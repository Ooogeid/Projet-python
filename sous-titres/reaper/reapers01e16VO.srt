HOW CAN YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT MONEY RIGHT NOW, SAM?

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,700
THIS VEHICLE IS
A LUXURIOUS TRIP BACK TO A SIMPLER TIME

22
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,600
WHEN AMERICA WAS NUMBER ONE

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,800
REVEL IN IT.

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,900
WHAT IS
THE SCARIEST SOUL
YOU'VE EVER CAPTURED?

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,100
BUG LADY
WAS PRETTY CREEPY.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
HMM?
YEAH.
REALLY? UM,

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,000
COME ON.
WORSE THAN THE CANNIBAL?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,300
DO WE REALLY
HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
WELL, I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S OLD NEWS TO YOU,

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,700
BUT THIS IS EXCITING
FOR ME.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
SO WHAT KIND OF VESSEL
DID YOU USE FOR THE BUG LADY?

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,400
UM, DEFECTIVE TOASTER.

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,300

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,200
MMM. HOLD ON.

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,900
WH--HEAR WHAT?

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,100
I SWEAR I HEARD SOMETHING.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
HELLO!

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
SAM, GET THE LIGHTS.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,400
HOLY CRAP. OK, SAM,
DO YOU HAVE A VESSEL?

42
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,600
I DO NOT.

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,100
OK, WELL, START THE CAR.
START THE CAR!

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
SAM, HURRY!
OK, OK.

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,000
SAM, OH, MY GOD,
PLEASE START THE CAR.

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,500
PLEASE START THE CAR.
HE'S COMING AROUND.
OK, ANDI--

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,100

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
WATCH OUT!

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
GO!

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
GO!

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,500
I'M SO SORRY, SOCK.

53
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,200
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN
MY OWN CAR.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,000
YOU'D BE DEAD
IF YOU WERE IN
THAT TREE HUGGER, OK?

55
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,900
GOOD OLD AMERICA.

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
SO A CHAIN SAW, HUH?

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,700
WAS IT BOLTED
TO HIS WRIST LIKE ASH
FROM <i>EVIL DEAD?</i>

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
NO. HE WAS JUST
HOLDING IT.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
WAS HIS FACE MADE UP
OF HUMAN SKIN

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,600
LIKE IN <i>THE TEXAS</i>
 <i>CHAINSAW?</i>

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,900
BEN, EVERYBODY'S FACE
IS MADE OF HUMAN SKIN.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,700
Sock: THAT IS TRUE.

66
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,800
HELLO, DARLING.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
HEY.
HI, GUYS.

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,900
UM, I DON'T
WANT TO BE A NOODGE
ABOUT THIS,

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,700
BUT, UM, YOU LEFT THE HOUSE 
WITHOUT MAKING THE BED THIS MORNING,

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,700
SO AGAIN--

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
BUT I DON'T EVEN
SLEEP IN THE BED.

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,700
I SLEEP ON A YOGA MAT
IN THE KITCHEN.

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,700
AND I VERY NEARLY
TRIPPED OVER THAT.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
SO IF YOU COULD
BE A LITTLE DOVE

75
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,600
AND JUST CLEAR UP
AFTER YOURSELF A BIT MORE,
IT'D BE GREAT.

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
HMM. LOVE YOU.

77
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,900
BYE, GUYS.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,600
BYE.
BYE.
BYE.

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,100
ALL RIGHT.

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,800
YOU WANT THIS?

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,000
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET,
THE NEWLY MARRIED,

82
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,500
SO FRESH AND EXCITING,
SO NEW--

83
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,200
OK. OK, OK.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
SAM, ARE YOU SURE THE DEVIL
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
ABOUT AN ESCAPED SOUL
WITH A CHAIN SAW?

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,300
I HAVEN'T EVEN
TALKED TO HIM.

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I, FOR ONE,AM NOT GOING TO STAND BY

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,600
AND WITNESS THIS DESECRATION
OF THE SOCKMOBILE GO UNPUNISHED.

89
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,300
SOMEONE WILL PAY.

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,300
WHAT'S THIS?

91
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,000
THAT IS A REPAIR
ESTIMATE FOR MY CAR.

92
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
4 GRAND. I KNOW
IT SEEMS PRICEY,

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,400
BUT SHE'S A CADDY.
I ONLY TRUST
THE DEALERSHIP.

94
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,400
A SOUL CAME AFTER ME
LAST NIGHT, AND I KINDA
NEVER GOT THE VESSEL.

95
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,300
PROBABLY JUST A MIX-UP.

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,200
WE DON'T HAVE MIX-UPS.

97
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,900
HMM.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

98
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,200
I DON'T HAVE
INSURANCE, SO...

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,700
ANY OF THESE
LOOK FAMILIAR?

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,100
NO WAY.
HELL'S MOST WANTED?

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,800
WELL, WE HAVE A FEW
OUTSTANDING CASES.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,300
YOUR SUSPECT
IN THERE OR NOT?

103
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,800
NO. I MEAN,
I DON'T THINK SO.
HE HAD A MASK ON.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

105
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
CHALK IT UP TO
A RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE

106
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
COMMITTED BY A REGULAR,
RUN-OF-THE-MILL LIVING HUMAN.

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
IT HAPPENS.

108
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,000
YOU LIVE
IN A SICK WORLD.

109
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,600
HAVE A NICE DAY.

110
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,600
NEXT!
YEAH--

111
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,400
I--THIS ISN'T
OVER, GLADYS.

112
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,400
THIS IS NOT OVER.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
WHEN DID WE SELL THESE?

114
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,000
IS THAT GREG?

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
WHAT, GREG?
ANDI'S EX-BOYFRIEND GREG?

116
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,900
YEAH.

117
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,100
OH, YEAH.

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,500
HE'S BETTER-LOOKIN'
THAN I REMEMBER. GOOD HAIR.

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,100
THAT'S PROBABLY
NOTHIN'.

120
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
THEY BROKE UP
A WHILE AGO.

121
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,400
I'M SURE HE'S
JUST SHOPPING.

122
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,900
OH, YEAH.
GUYS!

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,300
I GOT YOUR BOY!
HEY.

124
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,800
OH.
THAT'S THE GUY.

125
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,300
WH-WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?
WHO IS HE?

126
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
DUDE IS BAD NEWS.
HE'S KILLED OVER
30 PEOPLE.

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
HE'S CHOPPED THEM UP
INTO LITTLE PIECES.

128
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,200
JEEZ.

129
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,100
OH, WOWZER.

130
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,900
IN <i>KILLSAW I, II,</i> AND <i>III,</i>

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,100
AND IN STRAIGHT-TO-VIDEO
 <i>IV, V,</i> AND <i>VI.</i>

132
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
OH, YEAH.

133
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,500
W-WAIT.
HE'S FROM A MOVIE?

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
YEP.

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
MAYBE GLADYS
WAS RIGHT.

136
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,100
LOOKS LIKE IT.

137
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,300
HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
HE JUST SHOWED UP.

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,200
NO, IT'S OK.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

139
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,500
UH, SOME FAMILY CRISIS,
YOU KNOW.

140
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
HE'S JUST REALLY UPSET.

141
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
GREG'S FOLKS
ARE KIND OF NUTS.
YEAH.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,700
BUT HE JUST
WANTS TO GET TOGETHER
FOR COFFEE TONIGHT,

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,500
YOU KNOW,
JUST TO TALK.

144
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,500
but i totally understand if you don't want me to go.

145
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
NO, NO, THAT'S OK.
GO AHEAD. I--I TRUST YOU.

146
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
I FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY MYSELF.

147
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,600
I KNOW WHAT HE'S MISSING.

148
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
OK.

149
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,100
WHOA.

150
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
ARE YOU
GETTING SICK?

151
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,400
UM, ARE YOU WEARING
PERFUME TODAY?

152
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,500
OH, GOD. IT'S PROBABLY
GREG'S COLOGNE.

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
GUY DROWNS HIMSELF
IN IT.

154
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,900
THAT'S ATTRACTIVE.

155
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,200
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

156
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,200
OK. WELL, I'LL JUST
GIVE YOU A CALL TONIGHT THEN.

157
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,300
AROUND 9:00?

158
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
9:00.

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
YEAH. OK. BYE.

160
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,200
IT'S SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU, CASSIDY.

161
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,900
YEAH. CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
YEAH. YOU CAN
ASK ME ANYTHING.

163
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,400
THIS IS THE FIFTH DATE
IN A ROW THAT WE'VE HAD AT THE HOSPITAL
CAFETERIA.

164
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,100
HOW COME WE DON'T GO
ANYWHERE IN PUBLIC?

165
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,700
YOU KNOW, SOMEPLACE
WITH, LIKE, MENUS.

166
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
THIS--THIS IS FUN.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
ISN'T THIS FUN?

168
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,600
look, pudding cups

169
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,300
I-IT'S LIKE
WE'RE HAVING A PICNIC.

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
UH-HUH. I'M JUST
WONDERING IF YOU WERE
HIDING SOMETHING

171
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,200
AND IF IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT WEDDING
RING YOU'RE WEARING.

172
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,800
I FORGOT
I HAD THAT ON.

173
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,800
OK, CASSIDY, I--

174
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,000
GO ON.

175
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
I AM ALL EARS.

176
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
OK, IT'S A GREEN CARD
MARRIAGE.

177
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,000
HER NAME'S SARA.

178
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,900
WE WORK TOGETHER,
AND IF SHE DIDN'T
GET MARRIED,

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,700
SHE WAS GONNA GET SENT
BACK TO MANCHESTER.

180
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,900
I-IT'S IN ENGLAND.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,700
YEAH, I KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

182
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,600
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
I'LL UNDERSTAND IF YOU
NEVER WANNA SEE ME AGAIN,

184
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
BUT YOU GOTTA KNOW
THIS IS A FAKE MARRIAGE,

185
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
AND I WOULD HAVE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS

186
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,400
IF I'D KNOWN I'D MEET
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
SO YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO BE YOUR MISTRESS.

188
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,400
YES. YES, IF WE--IF WE
HAVE TO LABEL IT, YES.

189
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,100
AND IF I AGREE TO THIS,

190
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,800
THEN WE HAVE TO GO
SOMEPLACE NEW...

191
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,900
WITH, LIKE, A WAITER
AND A LIQUOR LICENSE.

192
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,000
ANYWHERE. YES.

193
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,400
ANDI, HI. UH, IT'S ME...

194
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,000
CALLIN' TO JUST, UH, SAY HI.

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,900
YOU'RE OUT WITH GREG,
I KNOW.

196
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,000
IT'S, UH--IT'S ALL GOOD.

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,400
UM, SO I GUESS I'LL JUST--I'LL--
I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN A WHILE.

198
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
CALL AT 9:00. IT'S 7 MINUTES AFTER, BUT, UH...

199
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

200
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,500
8 MINUTES AFTER NOW, SO--HEH.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
OK. BYE.

202
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
EVENIN'.

203
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
BEAUTIFUL NIGHT, HUH?

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,300
FOR YOU.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,300
IS THIS THE VESSEL?

206
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,700
IT'S A PRESENT.

207
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
WHY?

208
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,200
I JUST THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT NEED IT SOMETIME.

209
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,800
WAIT, WAIT.
SO THE CHAIN SAW GUY
WHO ATTACKED ME,

210
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,200
IS HE A SOUL OR NOT?

211
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,000
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT ANY CHAIN SAW GUY.

212
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,100
I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST ONE
OF THOSE CRAZIES OUT THERE.

213
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,400
YOU KNOW, MENTAL ILLNESS IS
A GROWING PROBLEM, SAMMY.

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
OH HO. YOU GOTTA
LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

215
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
DON'T EVEN LOCK THEIR DOORS.

216
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS?

217
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,800
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT LATELY, SAM?

218
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,500
TRUST, HONESTY, INTEGRITY--

219
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,800
I DON'T LIKE THOSE WORDS,
NOT ONE LITTLE BIT.

220
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,800
WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?

221
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,300
YOU KNOW WHY I HATE THEM?
THEY'RE FRAUDULENT.

222
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,000
PEOPLE SAY THEM WILLY-NILLY.
THEY DON'T MEAN THEM.

223
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,000
YOU FEEL ME?

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,500
NO. I DON'T.

225
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,200
I SHOW YOU THIS
BECAUSE I CARE.

226
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
AND ALSO
I KIND OF ENJOY IT.

227
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,000
SAM.

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Greg: OH, WHAT THE HELL?
WHOA, TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY.

230
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,700
- ANDI, WHAT ARE YOU--
- PLEASE PUT DOWN
THE KNIFE.

231
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
PLEASE.

232
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

233
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,600
SAM, WAIT.

234
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
PLEASE, SAM--

235
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,500
ANDI, WHAT WERE YOU--
YOU WERE KISSING HIM.

236
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, OK?

237
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,700
I MEAN, ONE SECOND,
WE'RE TALKING,
AND THE NEXT, I--

238
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
HOW COULD YOU DO--
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,200
SAM, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, OK?

240
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,300
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW I GOT HERE.

241
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,900
please YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
IT'S LIKE...

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,500
TEMPORARY INSANITY
OR SOMETHING.

243
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
LET'S JUST
GET OUTTA HERE.

244
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,900
I'M TELLIN' YOU
IT'S THE DEVIL.

245
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,700
IT'S GOTTA BE.
HE'S SCREWIN' WITH ME AGAIN.

246
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Sock: YEAH,
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,700
he was making out wiht ???

248
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,900
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT WASN'T
A NATURAL OCCURRENCE.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
WHAT'D YOU DO?

250
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
WHAT?

251
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,800
WHAT'D YOU DO WRONG?

252
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,500
CLEARLY YOU DID
SOMETHING

253
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,700
TO DRIVE ANDI
INTO GREG'S ARMS,

254
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,300
THOSE BIG, HANDSOME,
MUSCULAR ARMS.

255
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,300
I DID NOT.

256
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
THINK ABOUT IT,
SAM.

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
WOMEN DON'T
ALWAYS TELL YOU
WHEN YOU SCREW UP.

258
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,800
THEY LIKE TO GIVE
NONVERBAL CUES.

259
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,500
I.E., MAKING OUT
WITH ANOTHER DUDE.

260
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
THERE WAS NO NONVERBAL
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

261
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,000
I'M A--
I'M A GOOD BOYFRIEND.

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,700
I'M--I'M CARING.
I'M SENSITIVE.

263
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
AH. NOW, THAT'S YOUR
PROBLEM RIGHT THERE.

264
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,400
SENSITIVE, SAM?
REALLY?

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
NO. NO.
OH, SO NAIVE.

266
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,600
CHICKS DO NOT WANT
SENSITIVE, OK?

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,100
THEY WANT A BAD BOY.

268
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,700
THEY WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA BREAK
ALL THE RULES,

269
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,000
SOMEONE WHO WILL
BANG THEM ON THE
BACK OF A MOTORCYCLE

270
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
AND THEN
NOT DO THE DISHES.

271
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,200
A BAD BOY?

272
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,900
LIKE GREG.

273
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,800
YEAH.

274
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,900
DEVIL MAY HAVE HAD
SOMETHIN' TO DO WITH THIS ONE.

275
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,200
MORNING, PEOPLE.

276
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,900
I WOULD LIKE TO START
THE STAFF MEETING
ON A HAPPY NOTE.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF EXCITING NEWS.

278
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
YOU FINALLY MOVED OUT
OF YOUR MOM'S HOUSE.

279
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,700
VERY WITTY, BERT, BUT NO.

280
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,500
THIS NEWS ACTUALLY
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME FOR ONCE.

281
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
SARA HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

282
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON
DOWN TO THE--

283
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,100
thank you.

284
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
HELLO. UM...

285
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,500
AS YOU KNOW, BEN AND I
RECENTLY GOT MARRIED.

286
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
AND, UM, I'M VERY
HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
I'M PREGNANT.

287
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,400
MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE HAVING A BABY.

288
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,700
YOU HIT THAT?

289
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,100
NO. I DID NOT.

290
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
THANK YOU.

291
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
ARE YOU CRAZY?
OOH.

292
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,500
HELLO, MY DARLING.

293
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,300
WHY ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE
WE'RE PREGNANT?

294
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,600
BECAUSE WE ARE
PREGNANT, SILLY.

295
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,900
BUT WE DIDN'T DO--

296
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

297
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,700
EWW.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

298
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,100
ESTEBAN IS THE FATHER.

299
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,300
WHO THE HELL IS ESTEBAN?

300
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
MY BOYFRIEND.

301
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,900
YOU NEED TO KEEP UP,
MY SWEETIE.

302
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW?

303
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,100
YEAH, FOR 4 YEARS.

304
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
EH, HE TRAVELS
A GREAT DEAL.

305
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,700
PART OF THE CIRQUE
DU SOLEIL OBVIOUSLY.

306
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,300
WHY DIDN'T YOU
HAVE HIM MARRY YOU?

307
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,700
BECAUSE HE HAS
COMMITMENT ISSUES.

308
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,100
PLUS HE'S...

309
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
TECHNICALLY MARRIED.
NOW, LOOK,

310
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO
BE ANGRY AT ME, BEN.

311
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,300
ANGRY? NO. NO.

312
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,600
I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M HAPPY, ACTUALLY.

313
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
THIS IS GREAT. I'M ACTUALLY
SEEING SOMEONE, TOO--

314
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,900
CASSIDY, THE GIRL
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

315
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,200
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

316
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,800
WHAT?

317
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,300
WE CANNOT RISK EXPOSURE
WITH IMMIGRATION.

318
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
BUT YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
IT'S THE SAME THING.

319
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,400
ESTEBAN IS
FAR MORE DISCREET
AND RESPONSIBLE.

320
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,100
HE'S THE CATCHER
ON THE TRAPEZE.

321
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,900
YOU'RE CRAZY.

322
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
THAT'S IT. YEAH. MM-HMM.

323
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
BEN.

324
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
SORRY.

325
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
IT SEEMS UNFAIR,

326
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,900
BUT YOU MADE
A COMMITMENT TO ME,

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,900
AND THAT ALSO MEANS
A COMMITMENT TO
WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME.

328
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,500
YOU HOLD MY LIFE
AND LITTLE ESTEBAN'S
LIFE IN YOUR HANDS.

329
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,500
WE NEED YOU, BEN.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
HEY, YOU.
HEY.

331
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,900
GREG, YOU KNOW, I--
I CAN'T REALLY TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW,

332
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
ESPECIALLY
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

333
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,600
YEAH, I ACTUALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

334
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,200
HOW 'BOUT YOU AND ME
GO GET SOME COFFEE?

335
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,000
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
COFFEE SOUNDS GREAT.

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,200
UM, JUST LET ME
FINISH MY COUNT HERE,

337
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
AND THEN
WE'LL BE OUT, OK?

338
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,100
I WISH YOU HADN'T LEFT
SO FAST LAST NIGHT.

339
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,000
I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE
MAKING A CONNECTION.

340
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
yeah, ME, TOO.

341
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,300
I'M GLAD.

342
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,500
OHH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

343
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,900
I'M A LITTLE
RELIEVED THAT SARA'S BUN
DIDN'T COME OUT

344
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,000
IF YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

345
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,000
HOW COULD IT
POSSIBLY BE YOURS?

346
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
WELL, BEN,
LET'S JUST SAY I HAD
A VERY VIVID DREAM,

347
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,200
AND WE'LL LEAVE IT
AT THAT, OK?

348
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,300
oh, no.

349
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,000
DRIVE!

350
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
NO PRESSURE!

351
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,300
HE WAS WAITING
FOR US, FOR ME.

352
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
THAT THING'S
DEFINITELY A SOUL.

353
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
IT HAS DEFINITELY
GOT IT OUT FOR YOU.

354
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,200
OR MY CAR.

355
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
OPEN TABLE!

356
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,600
RUN! OPEN TABLE!

357
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
WHOA HO HO HO!
EASY THERE, CHAMP.

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,900
YOU DON'T WANNA LOOK
LIKE A JUMPER.

359
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,700
<i>NA ZDROWIE.</i>

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,400
THE CHAIN SAW GUY
ISN'T A PERSON.

361
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,800
HE'S A SOUL, AND HE'S
TRYING TO KILL ME.

362
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,700
SERIOUSLY? WEIRD.
yeah.

363
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,800
HEY, CHECK OUT
THE VIEW, HUH?

364
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
WH-WHAT THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

365
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
WHEN DO I GET
A VESSEL?

366
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,900
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.
I PROMISE.

367
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,900
HEY, SAMMY,
YOU WANNA SEE SOMETHING
REALLY WEIRD?

368
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,600
CHECK IT OUT.

369
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
SON OF A BITCH.

370
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,300
I KNOW. WHAT A DICK, HUH?

371
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,900
I GOT AN IDEA.

372
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,300
KILL HIM. THE SHOT'S
ALREADY LINED UP.

373
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,400
WHAT? NO,
I'M NOT GONNA SH--

374
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,100
YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THIS.

375
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,400
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

376
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,900
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW SHE'D NEVER GO BACK OUT
WITH THAT DOUCHE BAG.

377
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO HER?

378
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,400
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO ANDI.

379
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I MAY HAVE DONE
SOMETHING TO GREG. FOR GREG, ACTUALLY.

380
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,600
I BOUGHT HIS SOUL.

381
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

382
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,100
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT HIM, SAMMY.

383
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,800
WHAT A DOPE THAT GUY IS.
TERRIBLE NEGOTIATOR.

384
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
WHY?

385
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,300
THE POOR KID WAS BROKENHEARTED OVER
YOUR GIRL DOWN THERE.

386
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,200
HE WANTED TO ACQUIRE
THE POWER TO CONVINCE
HER TO DATE HIM,

387
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,100
KIND OF
A JEDI MIND TRICK.

388
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,800
OK, EASY ENOUGH.
WISH GRANTED,

389
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
AND IN EXCHANGE,
I GET HIS SOUL.

390
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
I CAN'T BELIEVE TH--I--

391
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THIS.

392
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,500
COME OFF IT.
WHAT'S SO AWFUL?

393
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
YOU KNOW THERE'S
ALWAYS A CATCH
IN A DEAL WITH ME.

394
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
WH-WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

395
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,700
IT MEANS THAT
THINGS AREN'T WHAT
THEY APPEAR TO BE.

396
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,000
FIGURE IT OUT.

397
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,800
YOU MAY STILL
GET ANDI BACK.

398
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,100
CANCEL IT. UNDO IT.
JUST UNDO IT RIGHT NOW.

399
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,400
SADLY,
ALL SALES ARE FINAL.

400
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,400
OH, YOU DO HAVE
ONE OTHER OPTION.

401
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,900
KILL HIM.

402
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,500
NO.
- WHY NOT?

403
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,200
GREG'S FATE IS
ALREADY SEALED.

404
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
HE DIES.
THE SPELL IS BROKEN.

405
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,900
YOU GET THE GIRL.
I GET THE SOUL.

406
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,800
WIN, WIN, WIN.

407
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,100
NO. NO, I'M NOT GONNA
SHOOT ANYBODY.

408
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,400
WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA LEARN?

409
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,300
THE ONLY PERSON PLAYING
BY THE RULES IS YOU.

410
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
PERFECT.

411
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,600
HEY, BUDDY.
HOW'S IT HANGIN'?

412
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,000
I'M NOT YOUR--
AH-CHOO!

413
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,400
AW, BABY GOT A COLD?

414
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,400
IT'S YOUR
STUPID COLOGNE.

415
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,700
NOW WILL YOU GO AWAY so i can talk to my girlfriend.

416
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
ACTUALLY ANDI HAS SOMETHING
SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

417
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,800
GO AHEAD, ANDI.
I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

418
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
SAM...

419
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
I HAVE TO
BREAK UP WITH YOU.

420
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,500
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

421
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
JUST I CARE
ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

422
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,700
IT'S NOT YOU, SAM.
I-IT'S ME.

423
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,800
NO, IT'S NOT, ANDI.
IT'S GREG.

424
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,900
HE SOLD HIS SOUL
TO THE DEVIL.

425
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
WHAT? NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S CRAZY.

426
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
I KNOW, GREG.
I TALKED TO HIM, OK?

427
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
ONLY A JERK
LIKE YOU WOULD MAKE
A DEAL WITH HIM.

428
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
HE'S GOT SOME WEIRD
MIND-CONTROL THING
OVER YOU.

429
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
HE'S MAKING YOU
LIKE HIM.

430
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,500
IS THIS TRUE?

431
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,600
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANDI.

432
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,700
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS ME.

433
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
SAM,

434
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 I HAVE TO
BREAK UP WITH YOU.

435
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,000
HEY, MAN.

436
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,900
YEAH! KILL IT! KILL IT! ALL RIGHT, MAN!

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
GREG SOLD HIS SOUL
TO THE DEVIL.

438
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
THAT'S HOW HE'S MAKING
ANDI GO OUT WITH HIM.

439
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,000
WOW. WHO KNEW?
GREG'S GOT BALLS.

440
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,700
SOCK!
WHAT?! I'M SORRY.
I'M IMPRESSED WITH HIM.

441
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,600
THE DUDE'S IN IT
TO WIN IT.

442
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
EVERYTHING'S SCREWED UP.

443
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,300
EVERYTHING'S COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

444
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
AH, DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC.
COME ON.

445
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,999
CLOCK OUT.
WE'RE LEAVING.

446
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
UH, KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE, SAMMY.

447
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,000
i need???

448
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
WE'RE GOIN' TO GLADYS'.
LET'S GO.

449
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,800
GLAD BAGS? ALL RIGHT.

450
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,100
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE BACK.

451
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,300
IT'S NOT A CRAZY PERSON,
GLADYS. IT'S A SOUL.

452
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,400
I HAVE NO RECORD.

453
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,700
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
STUPID CLIPBOARD SAYS, OK?

454
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
A SOUL WITH A CHAIN SAW
IS TRYING TO KILL ME.

455
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,100
NOW, YOU BETTER FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

456
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,500
OR I'M GONNA BUST IN HERE
MYSELF WITH MY OWN CHAIN SAW

457
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,600
AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT.

458
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,900
I NEED A VESSEL!

459
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,200
OK. ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE OK.

460
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,800
BULLYING ME
WILL NEVER WORK.

461
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,500
I DO, HOWEVER,
RESPOND TO BRIBES.

462
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,400
OK. OK.
OK, NOW WE'RE MAKIN'
SOME PROGRESS HERE.

463
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,500
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY.

464
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,700
I'M GOIN' TO ACAPULCO
NEXT WEEK.

465
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,300
I NEED SOMEONE
TO WATCH OVER MY CAT.

466
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
OK, NOW, BY "CAT,"
DO YOU MEAN CAT,

467
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,900
OR DO YOU MEAN
SOME KIND OF DRAGON?

468
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,100
SHE'S A PERSIAN.
HER NAME IS FANCY.

469
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
FANCY.

470
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
SURE. YEAH. THEN YOU'LL
GIVE US A VESSEL?

471
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,800
I CAN'T.

472
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,600
BUT I KNOW
A GUY WHO MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP.

473
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
YOU KEEP VESSELS
IN MINI STORAGE?

474
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,700
THIS IS A PORTAL TO HELL.

475
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
REALLY? IT DOESN'T???

476
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,800
THERE ARE 13 BODIES HIDDEN
IN THESE UNITS ALONE.

477
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,000
OK.

478
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
MANAGER'S NAME IS DENNIS.

479
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I GOTTA WARN YOU,
HE'S A LITTLE SQUIRRELLY.

480
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,800
A FEW TOO MANY YEARS SPENT
DOWN IN THE NINTH CIRCLE,

481
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

482
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,300
LET ME DO THE TALKING.

483
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,000
GLADYS. WHAT'S UP,
BABY BOO?

484
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
NICE TO SEE YOU.

485
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
DENNIS, THESE TWO
NEED A VESSEL.

486
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,200
COOL. ANY FRIEND
OF GLADYS.

487
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,500
AH, THEY'RE
NOT FRIENDS.

488
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,500
SAM HERE IS
A BOUNTY HUNTER,WORKS DIRECTLY
FOR LUCIFER.

489
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,499
OH, HEY, MAN, I, LIKE--
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T REALLY

490
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
GET INVOLVED
WITH ALL THAT, YOU DIG?

491
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,400
NO, NO. I DON'T NEED YOU
TO GET INVOLVED.

492
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,400
I JUST NEED
A VESSEL TO CAPTURE A SOUL
THAT'S TRYING TO KILL ME.

493
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,300
RIGHT, RIGHT. IT'S JUST I,
LIKE, KIND OF HAVE A SWEET
DEAL UP HERE, YOU KNOW?

494
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,300
CUT THE KID
SOME SLACK, HUH?

495
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,900
HIS PARENTS
SOLD HIS SOUL OUT
FROM UNDER HIM.

496
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
NO WAY.

497
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,700
AW, THAT'S A BUMMER.

498
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,800
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT SOMETHIN' FOR YOU.

499
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,000
TOOK A LOT OF BARTERING
TO GET MY HANDS
ON THIS PUPPY.

500
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

501
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,000
DENNIS PRIDES HIMSELF
ON WORKIN' THE SYSTEM.

502
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,500
IF THERE'S A LOOPHOLE,
HE'LL FIND IT.

503
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,400
YOU GOT ANY WAY
TO MAKE SAM'S GIRLFRIEND
STOP DATING HER EX?

504
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,900
I DON'T FOLLOW.

505
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,500
FORGET IT. IT'S JUST
THE DEVIL BOUGHT
THIS GUY'S SOUL,

506
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
AND NOW HE'S MAKING
MY GIRLFRIEND LOVE HIM.

507
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,600
AW, IT CAN'T HAPPEN, MAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

508
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,200
YEAH. YEAH, IT CAN.

509
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,600
IT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW.

510
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,500
AH, THE BOSS CAN DO
LOTS OF WHACKED-OUT CRAP.

511
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,000
HE CAN TRICK ALMOST ANYBODY
INTO ANYTHING,

512
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,400
BUT HE'S GOT NO DOMINION
OVER THE HUMAN HEART, BRO.

513
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,800
DEVIL CAN'T UNDO TRUE LOVE.

514
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
HERE WE GO.

515
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,000
WHOA. SHE'S A BEAUTY.

516
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,500
OK...

517
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,500
WHOA! WHOA! WATCH
WHERE YOU AIM THAT, TEX.

518
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,800
THIS VESSEL WILL SEND
ANYTHING TO HELL--

519
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,100
SOUL, LIVE BODY,
FREAKIN' SPACE NEEDLE,
MAN, GUARANTEED.

520
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,900
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

521
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,400
LOOK, MAN,
ALL MY CUSTOMERS
ARE SATISFIED, OK?

522
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,600
OK. ALL RIGHT. JESUS.

523
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,000
HEADS UP.

524
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?

525
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
HEY.

526
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,500
-hey.
- HEY, SECRET BOYFRIEND.

527
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
IT'S KIND OF SICK.

528
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,500
I'M TOTALLY GETTING INTO
THIS WHOLE AFFAIR THING.

529
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,500
ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF
BEING THE OTHER WOMAN,

530
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,500
none of guilt.

531
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,300
MY WIFE'S PREGNANT.

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
IT'S NOT MINE.

533
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
SHE'S GOT THIS
OTHER BOYFRIEND,

534
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,800
A CIRCUS GUY.

535
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,500
IT'S HIS KID, 

536
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
AND SHE'S GOIN' AROUND TELLING EVERYONE
IT'S MINE.

537
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
WOW.

538
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,300
THIS IS SERIOUSLY
MESSED UP.

539
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,300
I KNOW. NEXT TIME
I MARRY FOR CASH,
I'M CHARGIN' TRIPLE.

540
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,700
LOOK, UM, I GUESS THIS
IS OUR LAST NONDATE.

541
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
WAIT. WHY CAN'T WE
SEE EACH OTHER?

542
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
I MADE A COMMITMENT.

543
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,000
I MADE A COMMITMENT
TO A CRAZY WOMAN.

544
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,600
I'M VERY AFRAID, AND..

545
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,700
I HAVE TO LIVE UP TO IT.

546
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
I'M SORRY.

547
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
BEN.

548
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,300
ALL RIGHT.

549
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,400
LITTLE BIT OF SPACKLE
AND A FEW COATS OF THE , UH, 

550
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,400
BENCH'S
FINEST ULTRA-GLOSS, AND, UH--

551
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,900
IT STILL LOOKS
LIKE CRAP.

552
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, SAM?

553
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,700
I DON'T NEED
THAT NEGATIVITY RIGHT NOW.

554
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,300
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO MY CAR.

555
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,500
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

556
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,000
I KNOW HOW
TO GET ANDI BACK.

557
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,900
I'M INTRIGUED.
BRIEF ME.

558
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,500
ALL RIGHT, SO THE DEVIL
HAS NO POWER OVER
TRUE LOVE, RIGHT?

559
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,400
ok.

560
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,100
and THERE'S ALWAYS
A CATCH WHEN YOU
MAKE A DEAL WITH HIM.

561
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
OBVIOUSLY.

562
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
that's the catch.

563
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,600
NO MATTER WHAT GREG
DOES TO ANDI,

564
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,100
HE CAN'T STOP
HER LOVING ME.

565
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,000
I JUST HAVE TO
REMIND HER OF THAT.
I CAN'T LOSE.

566
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,900
BACK UP.
UH, ANDI LOVES YOU?

567
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
WELL, OF COURSE
SHE DOES.

568
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,200
SHE SAID THAT?

569
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,700
I, UH, THAT'S--

570
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,000
NOT IN WORDS.

571
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
OK, 'CAUSE, UH,
NO OFFENSE OR ANYTHING,

572
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,100
BUT I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR, WHAT, 14 YEARS,

573
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,500
AND, UH, I ONLY
SORTA LIKE YOU.

574
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
YOU CAN BE
PRETTY IRRITATING.

575
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
I'M SORRY, BUT...

576
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,200
SEE, 'CAUSE I LOVE
THESE SHOES.

577
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,800
LOVE IS A COMPLICATED
EMOTION, SAM,

578
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,000
FULL OF TINGLY FEELINGS

579
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
AND FRUSTRATION
AND ANGER.

580
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
THERE YOU ARE.

581
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
HEY.
HEY. UH...

582
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

583
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,800
UH, I-IT WILL BE, HOPEFULLY.

584
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
OK. WHAT'S UP?

585
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,000
OK, UM...

586
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,100
SO I NEED TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION, ANDI,

587
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,200
AND IT MIGHT SOUND KIND OF
WEIRD JUST ASKING OUTRIGHT,

588
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,700
BUT I GOTTA DO IT.

589
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
SURE.

590
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,300
THIS IS THE KIND
OF THING THAT YOU--

591
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,700
YOU PROBABLY NEED
TO COME TO ON YOUR OWN,

592
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,200
AND I DON'T WANNA FORCE
THE ISSUE, BUT I--

593
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,600
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW,
LIKE--LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

594
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,600
DO YOU LOVE ME?

595
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,500
YEAH. I THINK
I LOVE YOU.

596
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,300
YEAH.
THAT--THAT'S GREAT.THIS IS--

597
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THIS IS SO GOOD.
YEAH.

598
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,300
OK, UM, BECAUSE THE DEVIL,

599
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,000
HE'S KIND OF GIVEN GREG THIS WHOLE JEDI
MIND TRICK POWER.

600
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,700
OK, WHAT--
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE PLAN.HERE'S THE PLAN.

601
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,200
YOU GOTTA GET GREG
OUT OF YOUR HEAD, OK?

602
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM.
YOU CAN'T SEE HIM.

603
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,400
YOU GOTTA FIGHT HIM OFF.

604
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,900
BUT HE KNOWS
WHERE I WORK.

605
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,800
W-WE-WE'LL GET NEW JOBS.

606
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,300
BUT HE KNOWS
WHERE I LIVE.

607
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,700
THEN WE'LL RUN AWAY TOGETHER.
YOU LIKE BUFFALO?

608
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,800
NO WAY WILL HE FIND US
IN BUFFALO.

609
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,800
I HEAR THE WINTERS ARE MURDER.

610
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
NO, NO, NO, HANG UP.
HELLO.

611
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,300
IT'S GREG.

612
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
NO, I DO--
HI.

613
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
HANG UP.
YEAH. NO, I CAN'T
TALK RIGHT NOW.

614
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
I--I KNOW
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE LUNCH, BUT--

615
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,900
WHAT?
OH, THAT WAS SAM.

616
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,500
NO! WHAT ARE YOU--YOU--

617
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,800
YEAH, WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT

618
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
HOW WE WERE GONNA
RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

619
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
TO BUFFALO. HEH.

620
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
UNBELIEVABLE.

621
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,400
WHOA. NO, I'M NOT
TRYIN' TO UPSET YOU.

622
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,300
GREG, HOLD O--
DON'T GET SO MAD.

623
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,400
SORRY. OK, I JUST--
DON'T--

624
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
WHAT?

625
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
SAM...

626
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
SAM!

627
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,900
DOWN HERE, SAM. quick.

628
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,500
NO, NO, NO.
SAM, NOT NOW.

629
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,000
COLOGNE.

630
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,800
COLOGNE?

631
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
GRE-GREG'S COLOGNE.

632
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
OH, GOD.

633
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
GO! 

634
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
HERE, ANDI,
THE THING!

635
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,000
OK.
LET'S GO.

636
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,000
here, GO, GO, GO!

637
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,800
COME WITH ME
IF YOU WANNA LIVE.

638
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,700
SERIOUSLY,
YOU'RE SCREWED HERE.

639
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,400
YOU ASS, THAT ISN'T
A SOUL. THAT IS GREG.

640
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,600
YEAH. ISN'T IT GREAT? HUH?

641
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,100
BARKEEP, A ROUND OF DRINKS
FOR EVERYONE.

642
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,300
WHOO!
YEAH!
YEAH!

643
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,700
WHAT A--WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU?

644
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,800
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

645
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,800
OH, I JUST DIDN'T
WANNA SPOIL IT.

646
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,200
IT WAS TOO GOOD.

647
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,100
OH, BY THE WAY,
TECHNICALLY IT ISN'T GREG.

648
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,100
IT'S MORE LIKE HIS ID,

649
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,100
YOU KNOW,
ALL THE PENT-UP RAGE,

650
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
AND I HAD IT MANIFEST ITSELF
AS THE KILLER 

651
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,200
IN HIS
FAVORITE SLASHER FILM.

652
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
YOU MADE THAT HAPPEN?

653
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,700
YEAH. I THOUGHT
IT WAS A NICE TOUCH.

654
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,800
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE
OLD GREG EVEN KNOWS
IT'S HIM. 

655
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
BOY, OH, BOY.

656
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,909
I'M USUALLY NOT ONE
TO PAT MYSELF ON THE BACK,

657
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,810
but sometimes you've just nailed it, you know?

658
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,100
PURE POETRY.

659
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

660
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
WELL, JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

661
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,500
EVEN IF YOU AND ANDI
VOW NEVER TO SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN,

662
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,200
ANDI WILL STILL LOVE YOU,
GREG WILL STILL GET ANGRY,

663
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,400
AND SOONER OR LATER,
ANDI'LL GET HACKED UP
BY A CHAIN SAW. KKKT.

664
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,700
NO. NO, WA-WA--

665
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,400
UNLESS YOU PUT A STOP TO IT.

666
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,300
BECAUSE NOW YOU TRULY,
REALLY HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION.

667
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,700
ALL ROADS LEAD
TO KILLING GREG.

668
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE YOURSELF,

669
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,800
SAVE YOUR GIRL.

670
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,600
KIND OF A NO-BRAINER,
ISN'T IT?

671
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,300
IT'S GREG.

672
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,600
WHY IS GREG
CALLING YOU?

673
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
HE'S NOT. I TOOK ANDI'S PHONE
AND SENT HER HOME.

674
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I CAN'T LET THAT GUY
INTO HER HEAD AGAIN.

675
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,800
ARE WE GONNA
DO THIS, OR WHAT?
IT'S GO TIME.

676
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,800
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS.

677
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,400
A SHOTGUN?

678
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,100
IT'S ALL MY DAD HAD.
LIKES TO HUNT.

679
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,200
IT'S GONNA
BLOW HIS HEAD OFF.

680
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,100
THAT'S WHA
THE PLASTIC IS FOR.
LET'S GO.

681
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
Soft like a ninja.

682
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,100
GIVE ME THE AMMO.

683
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
OK.
OK.

684
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
I THINK MAYBE
YOU DID THAT WRONG.NG.

685
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
YEAH.
AMMO.

686
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
AGAIN.

687
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,400
BEN, WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF AMMO
DID YOU BUY?

688
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
I DIDN'T ASK!

689
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,900
SHUT--
SHUT UP.

690
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,700
THE GUY IN THE GUN SHOP
KEPT STARIN' AT ME,

691
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,900
FREAKIN' ME OUT.

692
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,200
I'M NOT CUT OUT
TO BE A HIT MAN.

693
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,500
I SAW MY GRANDMOTHER
ONE TIME SNAP THE NECK
OF A CHICKEN.

694
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,100
I CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP
FOR A WHOLE MONTH.

695
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,700
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

696
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,300
BEN'S RIGHT, MAN.
YEAH.

697
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,200
WE'RE NOT KILLERS.THE DEVIL WANTS ME
TO DO THIS.

698
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,200
HE'S TRYING
TO CORRUPT ME, MAKE ME
MORE LIKE HIM.

699
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,500
HEY.

700
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOIN' HERE?

701
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,300
NOTHIN'.
JUST BROUGHT YOU THIS, UH,

702
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,100
GIANT ROLL OF PLASTIC,
YOU KNOW, FOR SPILLS.

703
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,500
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK,
SAM. DON'T YOU?

704
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
I COULD--
I COULD CHAT.

705
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
SO, YOU GONNA
OFFER US ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

706
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
NO.

707
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
FINE.

708
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,000
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE, SAM.
WALK AWAY.

709
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
WIN ANDI BACK.

710
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I'VE GOT THE DEVIL
ON MY SIDE.

711
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,100
SEE, THAT'S THE THING, GREG.

712
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,500
THE DEVIL ISN'T
ON ANYONE'S SIDE.

713
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,900
THE DEVIL'S ON
THE DEVIL'S SIDE, PERIOD.

714
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,500
IT'S TRUE.
THERE'S ALWAYS A CATCH.

715
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,200
THE DEVIL MADE ANDI
LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

716
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,800
DID YOU THINK TO ASK HIM
TO MAKE HER STOP LOVING ME?

717
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
SHE STILL LOVES YOU?

718
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
CRAP.

719
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
SO IF ANDI
STILL LOVES YOU,

720
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,800
THAT MEANS WE'LL
NEVER BE HAPPY
TOGETHER AND...

721
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,800
I GAVE AWAY MY SOUL
FOR NOTHING?

722
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,700
BINGO. SEE?
HE'S NOT THAT DUMB.

723
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,600
AW, I SCREWED UP
EVERYTHING.

724
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,100
I'M--I'M STUPID,
STUPID, STUPID!

725
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
WHOA. DON'T HIT YOURSELF.
NO CALL FOR THAT.

726
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,000
I ALWAYS DO THIS KIND
OF STUFF! DAMN IT!
DAMN IT! DAMN IT!

727
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,300
OK, JUST CHILL, MAN.

728
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,200
DAD WAS RIGHT. I MAKE
ONE BONEHEADED MOVE
AFTER ANOTHER.

729
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,800
I FAILED MY DRIVING TEST
17 TIMES.

730
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,500
HEY, EVERYBODY
MAKES MISTAKES.

731
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,400
I SENT MONEY TO
6 NIGERIAN PRINCESSES,

732
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,200
AND I'VE NEVER
MET ONE OF THEM!

733
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE TRUSTING.
YES.

734
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,200
I MADE A PASS
AT MY STEPMOTHER!

735
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,800
M-M-MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.

736
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,200
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YEAH.

737
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,500
Sock: CHAIN SAW!

738
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,100
GO! GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

739
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
let's go.

740
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,600
HERE. COME ON.
WHERE'D HE GO?

741
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,900
WHAT IS THAT THING?!

742
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
IT'S YOU!

743
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,000
NO, IT'S NOT.

744
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
YES, IT--

745
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,800
GET THE DRESSER!

746
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,999
I'M SUCH A CHUMP!

747
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

748
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
GETTING MAD ONLY MAKES
THAT THING STRONGER.

749
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

750
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,600
LOOK, JUST LET IT COME.
I'M PATHETIC.

751
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,200
NO, YOU'RE NOT. L-L-LOOK.
Y-YOU HAVE A TROPHY.

752
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,700
YEAH, IT'S FOR
ATTENDANCE.

753
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,800
GREG, EVERYBODY
MAKES MISTAKES, OK?!

754
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,600
LOOK AT ME! I ONCE GOT PAID
FOR A GREEN CARD MARRIAGE,

755
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
AND NOW I CAN'T BE WITH
THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS.

756
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,200
AND SO HELP ME, IF I GET
THE CHANCE TO MAKE IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE,

757
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,100
I'M GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT,

758
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,000
BUT YOU GOTTA
CALM YOUR ASS DOWN!

759
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I CAN'T CALM DOWN!

760
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,200
come???

761
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,100
come to me

762
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,700
I SAID CALM DOWN!
AAH!

763
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,100
Ben: IT'S GONE.
IT'S GONE.

764
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,800
he does not  look good

765
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,900
HEY.
hey

766
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,100
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

767
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,700
AH, MY HEAD IS
KILLIN' ME.

768
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,000
A-AND THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANGRY?

769
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,200
NO. THAT'S GONE NOW.

770
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
PROBABLY
THE MORPHINE.

771
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
GOOD.

772
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,600
HEY, THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT.

773
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,100
SO I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY WAY

774
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,800
TO GET OUT OF A DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL.

775
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,000
NOT THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT.

776
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,000
GREG. OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT YOU.

777
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,900
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

778
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,300
HE'S--HE'S OK. he is fine.

779
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
SAM...

780
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,000
WH-WHAT HAPPENED?
A-ARE YOU OK?

781
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
YEAH. I'M FINE.

782
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
OK.

783
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
ANDI.

784
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
YEAH.

785
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
YOU LEAVE US ALONE
FOR A SECOND.

786
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
OK.

787
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,700
JUST BE OUTSIDE.

788
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,500
YOU KNOW, I CAN
FEEL THAT THING...

789
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,000
RIGHT NOW
GETTING ANGRY AGAIN.
GREG--

790
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,700
JUST A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE IT
STARTS ALL OVER.

791
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,300
I'M SO STUPID.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STUPID.

792
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,000
GREG, GREG, GREG, GREG,
IT'S OK. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

793
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,700
I GAVE UP MY SOUL

794
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,200
FOR ONE NIGHT OF
OVER-THE-CLOTHES
HEAVY PETTING.

795
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,200
IT'S A LOT TO SACRIFICE,

796
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
ETERNITY.

797
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,600
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
YOU'RE NOT AS STUPID
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.

798
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,900
Ben: EVERYTHING
HAPPENS FOR A REASON,
SO I KNOW THAT FOR--

799
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,100
THAT'S INTERESTING.
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

800
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,700
IT'S OK.

801
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,000
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

802
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
HI.

803
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,000
OH, IS SHE, NOW?

804
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,700
WELL, WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED.

805
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,100
PERHAPS I HAVEN'T
BEEN CLEAR.

806
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,200
WELL, NOW I'M
GONNA BE CLEAR.

807
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,900
IF YOU'RE FREE TO DATE
IN THIS MARRIAGE,

808
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,500
I AM, TOO.

809
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,000
IF YOU'RE FREE
TO GET PREGNANT...

810
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
GOOD FOR YOU.

811
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,000
MY, MY, MY.

812
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,900
WHEN DID WE
ACQUIRE TESTES?

813
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,600
YESTERDAY.
YESTERDAY.

814
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,600
NOW I'M GONNA
SAY IT AGAIN.

815
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,800
THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND.

816
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,800
UM, UH,
TRY TO BE DISCREET.

817
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
EXCUSE ME.

818
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,900
THIS IS AWKWARD.

819
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,200
SARA, I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

820
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,000
CLEARLY YOUR "HUSBAND"
HAS NO RESPECT FOR THE
INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE.

821
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,300
TED, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

822
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
THEN WHAT IS IT, BEN?

823
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,700
YOU MARRIED HER,
DID YOU NOT?

824
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,600
YOU FILED PAPERWORK
WITH THE HOME OFFICE.

825
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,000
OR SOMETHING
TO THAT EFFECT.

826
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,900
ACTUALLY, TED, UM...

827
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,700
BEN AND I HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING.

828
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
SO...

829
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,600
I SEE.

830
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU...

831
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
ENJOYED
THE LIFESTYLE.

832
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,600
IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
TURNING THAT TRIANGLE
INTO A SQUARE--

833
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
JUST LET ME KNOW.

834
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,600
A CHASER FOR MY MAN, SAM.

835
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,700
THANKS, BUT I'M GOOD.

836
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,000
REALLY?
YEAH.

837
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
FROM WHERE I SIT,

838
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,500
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LIFE'S
STILL IN THE CRAPPER.

839
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,400
AH, THAT SO?

840
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,100
GREG IS ONE SELF-LOATHING
HISSY FIT AWAY

841
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
FROM ANOTHER
CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.

842
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,300
YOUR GAL'S IN DANGER.

843
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,700
YOU YOUSELF ARE IN DANGER.

844
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,300
IT'S WHAT
WE CALL IN THE BUSINESS
A CLASSIC CLUSTER "F."

845
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,900
PRETTY PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

846
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,500
PRIDE IS
MY FAVORITE CARDINAL SIN.

847
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,999
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

848
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,700
KILL GREG.

849
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,600
YEAH. OOH,
SAY THAT AGAIN.

850
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
ONLY, THIS TIME,
USE A RUSSIAN ACCENT.

851
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,600
I DON'T THINK SO.

852
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
PLEASE.

853
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,300
WELL, I'VE BEEN WONDERING
WHEN I'D SEE THAT AGAIN.

854
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,900
WELL, IT'S NICE TO PUT
A GIFT TO GOOD USE.

855
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,800
IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S FOR GREG.

856
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,600
COME AGAIN.

857
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,300
I'M CANCELING
YOUR DEAL WITH GREG.

858
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,900
HE WON'T GO TO HELL,
HE WON'T HAVE POWER
OVER ANDI,

859
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,500
AND THE CHAIN SAW MANIAC
GOES AWAY.

860
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,800
EVERYTHING
GOES BACK TO NORMAL.

861
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,600
TELL ME I'M WRONG.

862
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,700
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANNA USE THIS CARD
FOR YOURSELF, SAM,

863
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,800
GET BACK TO
YOUR REGULAR LIFE?

864
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,000
IT'S A LOT TO GIVE UP.

865
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,300
NO, IT'S NOT.

866
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,000
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T
WORK FOR ME.

867
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,000
THERE'S ALWAYS
A CATCH, RIGHT?

868
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,400
YOU'D FIND
SOME OTHER WAY
TO SCREW ME OVER.

869
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,300
YOU'RE WISIN' UP, PAL.

870
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,900
MY LITTLE BOY'S
BECOMING A MAN.

871
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,800
SO I'M GIVING IT
TO GREG,

872
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,400
AND I'M BETTING
EVEN YOU CAN'T
GET OUT OF THIS ONE.

873
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
OH?

874
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,900
CONGRATS, BUDDY.

875
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,100
YOU JUST GAVE UP ETERNITY
FOR A WORKPLACE CRUSH.

876
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,300
WHAT A SUCKER.

877
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,900
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

878
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,100
THERE'S STILL
PLENTY OF TIME.

879
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,100
MAYBE.

880
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,300
MAYBE NOT.

881
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,900
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

882
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,500
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

883
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
GREG.

884
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,800
I MEAN, NO,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

885
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,500
HE'S A TOOL, AND
HE ALWAYS WILL BE,
BUT STILL.

886
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,200
BUT WHAT?

887
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,000
I MEAN, HE TRADED
HIS SOUL FOR ME.

888
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,500
IT'S FLATTERING,
BUT CRAZY.

889
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,500
KIND OF ROMANTIC
IN A WAY.

890
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,100
NO, JUST CRAZY.

891
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,100
LOOK, SHOOTING STAR.

892
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,310
