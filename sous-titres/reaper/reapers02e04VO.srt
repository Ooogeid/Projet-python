00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:01,720
I'm back with the groceries.

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,088
Finally. I'm starving.

3
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,322
- Get everything on the list, Ben?
- Of course.

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,618
Got your special potatoes.

5
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:12,770
- Got your special soy pizza pouches.
- What up?!

6
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,827
- That's for me.
- What's in there?

7
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:18,503
That's pri... It's my private food.

8
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,061
No secrets, Ben.

9
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,139
Cherry tomatoes,
sourdough rolls, and peanuts.

10
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,173
Why is that so private?

11
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:31,109
'cause I don't want people to
know what I eat all the time, OK?

12
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:35,438
- Got, scratchers.
- Nice, Ben. Give it.

13
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:36,452
Let's see.

14
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:40,664
OK, come on.
Pa needs a new jet pack.

15
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:44,377
Zip.

16
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:48,147
God, I never win anything!

17
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,373
I think I won $1,000.

18
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:53,344
What?

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,963
- I won $1,000!
- We won. We won!

20
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:03,033
That's so weird. I paid for that ticket
with my own money.

21
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,306
This is so great.
I wanted to take Andi away this weekend.

22
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,298
- I'm gonna go cash it out right now.
- What?

23
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,630
- I hate that guy.
- That's my money.

24
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,785
Let me check this out?

25
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,150
My lucky day.
This ought to be just enough.

26
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:35,478
Give that back.

27
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:37,873
You shouldn't be traveling around
with this much cash.

28
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:39,763
It's financially imprudent.
Live and learn.

29
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:40,977
That is my money.

30
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,348
And we're going to use
it to bail Morgan out.

31
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,216
- Now, police station. Hop to it.
- Who the hell is Morgan?

32
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:47,821
That's right.

33
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:50,705
- The two of you have never met.
- Wait till you meet him.

34
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,251
You're gonna love him.

35
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,078
All I'm sayin' is you're
Kinda bein' a Pill.

36
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:01,354
You know what they say about
money and evil and everything.

37
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:04,523
- Shut up. Just shut up.
- I think I hear our boy.

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,221
Look, i'm tellin' you, if your
wife doesn't like how late you work,

39
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:10,414
you just tell her
your girlfriend doesn't mind at all.

40
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,144
- Morgan, you are a piece of work.
- I'm terrible.

41
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:17,768
Hey! You came.
Sorry about all this.

42
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,463
Look at you.
How are you holdin' up, kiddo?

43
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:26,306
Great. They let me sleep in the back
office. Couch was comfy.

44
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,775
What did you do?

45
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,356
I just accidentally stole a limo.

46
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,977
You believe this guy?

47
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:36,954
Hilarious.

48
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,831
So can I go now?

49
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:41,930
You must be Sam.
It's good to meet you.

50
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,919
- You know me?
- Hey, I'm being rude.

51
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,644
Let me do it properly.
This is Sam Oliver,

00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,618

53
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:52,202
This is Morgan, my son.

54
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:54,716
It's nice to meet you.

55
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:57,515
Dad's told me terrific things about you.

56
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:01,660
You're his son?

57
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,384
One of the good ones,
like you yourself, Sammy.

58
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,962
Hey, I guess that makes
you two half brothers?

59
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:12,307
Hey, we're havin' a good old-fashioned
family reunion here, aren't we?

60
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,514
Look at that.

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,930
I put you on deliveries all week.
Perks of dating the boss.

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,137
Thank you. Wanna come?
I got a laser tag gift card.

67
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:49,537
I can't. I got all this work to do.

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,038
I hate that this new job's already
interfering with our lives.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,983
Andi, how often has my job with
the devil messed up our plans?

70
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:58,144
I was gonna take you away this
weekend with the thousand bucks I won.

71
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,782
You won $1,000?

72
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,017
Yeah, and then the devil took
it to bail out his stupid son.

73
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:05,964
The devil has a son?

74
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:09,936
Oh, my god.
That is... That is so scary.

75
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,430
I is it?

76
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,135
It's not that scary.

77
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,436
There are little devils running around,
and that doesn't give you chills?

78
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,054
You know, it's not chilling.
He's pretty normal, pretty normal guy.

79
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,319
Considering.

80
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:26,564
So, yeah.
I'm gonna go do deliveries.

81
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:34,234
- Thank you verry mutch.
- What is Ted doin' here?

82
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,074
I don't know. It's like he's still
working. He was fired,

83
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,850
- but he just can't stop.
- It's so sad.

84
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:41,941
Tragic.

85
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,046
Excuse me. Ma'am.
Hi. I'm sorry.

86
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:48,180
We've had reports of a pervert harassing
women in the parking lot today.

87
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:50,054
Real psycho, so be careful.

88
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
All right.

89
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,381
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,550
Plus I almost let it slip to Andi
that I'm the son of the devil.

91
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:57,715
Not smart.

92
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:00,046
Wasn't thinkin'.
God, just hate lying to her.

93
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,584
You're old-fashioned that way.

94
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,040
Here we go. Here we go.

95
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:07,694
Excuse me. I was wondering if...

96
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,723
Get away. Leave me alone.

97
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:16,813
- Happy?
- Always.

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,251
How are you?

99
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,040
Do many people find
those women attractive?

100
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:29,530
Yes. I think they are beautiful.

101
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,255
So for you,

102
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,367
beauty entails injecting
silicone into your chest cavity.

103
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:40,351
OK, ladies, enough fashion talk.
Poblano quesadilla.

104
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:44,176
- No, thank you. I have a class.
- Cool. If you're done with that,

105
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,670
- can I read that? Thank you.
- Sure.

106
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,571
Hot.

107
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:57,514
This is delicious.
I am starting to like human food.

108
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,351
How's demon food different?

109
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:02,226
Usually it's still squirming.
Or screaming.

110
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:06,018
Check it out.
A sex and intimacy quiz.

111
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,950
We should take it.
We'll score through the roof. All right,

112
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,429
"do you feel emotionally closer
to your partner after sex

113
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:15,300
or emotionally farther apart?"
Well, closer, obviously.

114
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,875
- Thank you.
- Well, what's your answer?

115
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,726
I don't know. It's hard to say.

116
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,741
Come on. Don't be shy it's just for fun.

117
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:25,546
It's fine, then.
We'll go to another one.

118
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:29,175
"How would you rate your overall
satisfaction with your lover in bed?"

119
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:32,143
Again, I have to give you a 10.

120
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,145
- What your answer? Come on. Be honest.
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

121
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,990
Are you, unhappy with me?

122
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:49,282
But in that way, the sex way,
are you unsatisfied?

123
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,822
It's not you, Ben, really.

124
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:57,374
You're amazing. I've just never.
I've never really been that into sex.

125
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,893
It's not that important to me,
so don't even think about it, OK?

126
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,866
Nina, we should talk about this.

127
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,963
Hey, do you think
Morgan would like these?

128
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:36,313
Why would I care what hat guy likes?

129
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:39,830
Am I detecting a little
sibling rivalry here?

130
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,737
Don't worry, Sammy.
There's no real competition.

131
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,380
I'm always gonna like him
a little better than I like you.

132
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,847
- That really hurts my feelings.
- Still, you know, I...

133
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:54,762
Just can't help feeling a little
disappointed about the kid, you know?

134
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,425
See, Morgan is that perfect mix

135
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,668
of relative morality and selfishness.

136
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,030
But there's something missing, you know,
something that makes me think that...

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,957
He maybe just doesn't want to help
me rule the netherworld by my side.

138
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:10,574
Don't care.

139
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,823
You, on the other hand, are a conundrum.

140
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:17,850
For all your whining and complaing
and lack of fashion sense,

141
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,698
you always get the job done.

142
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,454
You want to do the right thing.
I hate that about you.

143
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:27,489
But I guess that's the quality
that makes you so effective.

144
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,694
- Are you giving me a compliment?
- No. Mostly I just hate that about you.

145
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,971
You know, it's so damn perplexing.

146
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:37,167
If I could just take the best parts
of you and the best parts of Morgan

147
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,530
and just squish 'em all together,
i'd have the perfect son.

148
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:48,304
Is he dead?

149
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:51,326
Yeah. Killed by your latest soul,
edmund FitzGerald,

150
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,976
big-time shipping magnate
from back in the day.

151
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,739
Real weirdo, if you ask me.

152
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:59,231
Lot of wild rumors about
the man and how he died.

153
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:01,206
What rumors?

154
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,804
They say on his deathbed, he ate

155
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,207
his gold so that no one
else could have it.

156
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,829
There was a ring in this
shop that belonged to him.

157
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,856
Now he's back to collect what's his.

158
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,627
He will kill anybody

159
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:21,018
who gets in his way.

160
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:36,037
I think that Morgan is
gonna like these a lot.

161
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,101
I'm parked at the far end over there.

162
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:05,809
You can probably carry
this the rest of the way, right?

163
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,544
What? I'm just saying
you look pretty sturdy. Thick ankles.

164
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,557
I gotta catch my breath.
Hang on. Oh, my god.

165
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,099
Over here. Right here.

166
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:25,579
- What do you want, Wysocki?
- How much money you make today, Ted?

167
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:31,207
Phew. 4 hours, about $6.50.
But I think things'll pick up, though.

168
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,577
- Yeah. I have a proposition for you.
- What?

169
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,017
This lovely sturdy lady would like
some help carrying this box to her car.

170
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,338
If you carry it and she gives
you the customary tip of $5.00.

171
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:43,694
Although classy people leave 10.
I will gladly split it with you.

172
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,520
Shouldn't he get the entire
tip if he's doing all the work?

173
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:52,829
That is a business decision that you
shouldn't have any part of, ma'am, OK?

174
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:56,033
But to answer your question,
I am subcontracting the job.

175
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:58,142
Therefore we should split it.

176
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:01,073
And it's heavy, so 15,
probably the least you should pay.

177
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,708
I'll do it.
Bert, I thank you.

178
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:06,662
All right, watch your back.
Knees. It's heavy.

179
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,449
He's got it. All right.

180
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:18,844
Hey, I need extra shifts.

181
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,183
- What?
- I need extra shifts. I'll do anything.

182
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,062
Clean the toilets. Garbage duty, late
night, early morning, double shifts...

183
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,966
Whatever you got, load me up.
Let's party.

184
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:28,316
Who are you?

185
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,501
All right, look, look, I've recently
come into some financial issues

186
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,158
that may or may not be
online-poker-related, OK?

187
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,854
But more importantly,
I know that you're short-handed.

188
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:41,036
The socket wrench is here to fix
all your problems, boss lady.

189
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,801
- I'm afraid.
- Me, too.

190
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,444
Because I'm gonna go sickhouse
on this job, all right?

191
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:49,616
The work will be done.
It'll be better than done.

192
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,992
The work will be good.

193
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:58,545
You seem quiet tonight.

194
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,669
I've just had some stuff on my mind,
just been thinkin'

195
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:05,514
Well, stop it.

196
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,563
OK. Sure.

197
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,084
What's wrong?

198
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,494
I don't wanna talk to a certain
person over there.

199
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:26,463
Who was that?

200
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:31,362
That was brad, a demon that I used
to date. We just had a short thing.

201
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,722
It was a totally
superficial relationship,

202
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,551
nothing like what you and I have,
entirely physical. That's all.

203
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,262
- Physical?
- Yeah. That's it.

204
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,454
As in sex?

205
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
No. Well...

206
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,564
What? I don't.

207
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:53,317
Sorta.

208
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,569
'cause I thought you
weren't that into sex,

209
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:59,894
- that it wasn't that important to you.
- It's not. I just mean that.

210
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,771
I just mean that brad
was really shallow.

211
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:11,801
Spit that out.
We are talking about this.

212
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,039
- Will you get out of here?
- Morgan got himself arrested again.

213
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,155
I don't know how I'm gonna
get through to that kid.

214
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:34,410
Yeah, I don't have any more money, so
you can forget about me bailing him out.

215
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,128
I don't need your money, Sam.

216
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,465
I just wish some of your good
qualities would rub off on Morgan.

217
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,162
OK, can I use the bathroom now?

218
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,717
Special delivery.

219
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,151
Now, the next item FitzGerald
wants to Reacquire

220
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,536
is an old portrait of himself.
It's in the Asher gallery downtown.

221
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:06,722
The address is on the back of this.

222
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,691
Now, I suggest that you
grab that portrait tonight.

223
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,296
If it stays there too long,

224
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,758
FitzGerald will show up and reclaim it,
and more people will die.

225
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:18,982
Since when did you care
if people get killed?

226
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:20,814
I don't. Good call.

227
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,932
In truth, I have a small favor to ask.

228
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:28,392
And by favor, I mean
you don't have a choice.

229
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,185
So, training the son of the devil.

230
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,512
That was never in the job description,
Samuel. Can't believe you agreed to it.

231
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:38,826
The devil didn't exactly
make it optional, man.

232
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,194
The son of the devil?
Does he look like you?

233
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:43,733
- Wait until you meet him.
- You'll hate him. Super tool.

234
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:45,859
He's pretty.

235
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,168
God, he looked dead
even when he was alive.

236
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,958
Evenin', Bitches.

237
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:59,838
Hey, Morgan. This is Sock, Ben.
Guys, Morgan, son of the devil.

238
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:01,757
Hey. It's good to meet you guys.

239
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,539
You help out your buddy even though
you don't have to. You're good friends.

240
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:08,007
Yeah. We are good friends, so...
Thank you.

241
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,191
Devil get you that car?

242
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:13,704
No. Would you believe an ex-girlfriend?

243
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,219
I'm not one to kiss and tell, but did
she have a title, and was it princess?

244
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,466
Well, some people
probably like that car. I...

245
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,133
Also do.

246
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:30,909
All right, um, we need to get our hands
on that painting before the soul does.

247
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:33,926
There's a burglar alarm sticker
on the window, so obviously there's...

248
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,712
- A burglar alarm.
- Good one, Sam.

249
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:37,603
OK, great.

250
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,373
Which one of you guys
is surveillance guy?

251
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,568
The tech guy?

252
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,324
Fighting guy?

253
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:56,454
So what you're saying is you have,
you have no plan, no real skills.

254
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,262
Yes. I would say yes to that.

255
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:01,840
- Good eye. Good eye.
- We still get the job done.

256
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,422
No, you do. You do. I can't argue
with results. Hold one sec.

257
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,486
Right? You see?

258
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,429
See what I'm talkin' about? He's a Dick.

259
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,261
Yeah. Think he'd let us drive that?

260
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,124
I bet if we asked him, he'd say yes.

261
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,885
- You guys are Jerks.
- You know, I bet you're right. Yeah.

262
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,331
You see the suit he's wearin'? It's...

263
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:22,286
- Looks great on him.
- You don't buy that thing off the rack.

264
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,367
What the hell are you doing?!

265
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,191
So, in my experience you guys got, like,
3 or 4 minutes before the cops get here.

266
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:31,397
You better grab your painting.

267
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:34,589
I'm gonna go to a party.
If it's ragin', i'll text you.

268
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,577
Sam, the painting! Come on!

269
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:38,619
Sam, come on!

270
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:52,544
So you're gonna unpack all these
sprinklers, all 500 of them?

271
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:55,300
Restock the paint
and ship out all the damages?

272
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,694
You know it.

273
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,605
Sock, I'm having a really hard time
believing you're gonna do any of this.

274
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,641
Well, that is because you've never
seen me in hustle mode, Andi.

275
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,455
It is insan-i-tay.

276
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,660
Thing about hustle mode, though,
is I need to be alone.

277
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,830
I get sweaty I take off my shirt.
I'm a little bit shy

278
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:12,822
so you go for now, come back later,
and be amazed, all right?

279
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
All right.

280
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,980
So to continue, ground rules. You do not
work for the bench anymore, OK?

281
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,748
You work for me.

282
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,297
- I'm the judge, jury. Boss man!
- Executioner.

283
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,957
All right? I get the shifts.
You do the actual work.

284
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,069
And if Andi comes along, what do you do?

285
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:31,913
- Run.
- Run. Attaboy.

286
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:32,996
Got it.

287
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:37,381
You smell that?

288
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,142
That is a work bench scent.

289
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:42,576
Industrial rubber.

290
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:44,012
Turpentine.

291
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,064
Lawn Fertilizer.

292
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,283
It is wonderful, and it's home.

293
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,041
Thank you for this. You don't know how
much this means to me.

294
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,313
I will do anything you say.

295
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:01,147
Just let me be here, in the bench.

296
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,628
- I like your attitude. A lot, OK?
- Thank you.

297
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,870
Just don't do anything to mess up and
make me have to can your ass?

298
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,408
All right, I'm gonna take a nap.
You wake me up in 4 hours.

299
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:12,742
4.

300
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:14,979
4 hours.

301
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,605
Don't tell me the other
2 clowns got killed.

302
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,632
No. No, they're fine.

303
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:29,858
I'm not here on official business today.

304
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:34,436
I have a matter of personal
nature to discuss with you.

305
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,632
I need your help.

306
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:39,006
Speak.

307
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:42,725
OK. So, I'm sort of in a relationship...

308
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,274
with a demon.

309
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,207
Are you, now?

310
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,959
Never would have pegged
you for a horn hag.

311
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:53,982
Well, that...
She's a great girl.

312
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,263
Everything's going awesome,
except for one thing.

313
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:01,056
Spit it out, kid.
I'm on break in 5.

314
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:04,076
Right. OK. My...
My question is...

315
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,791
Can humans satisfy demons,

316
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,825
or can only demons do that?

317
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:15,910
Yes, humans and demons can get it on,
all the time in fact.

318
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:20,714
I see.

319
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,961
Are you trying to tell me
you're having a little trouble

320
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:24,408
in the bedroom department?

321
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:28,465
No. No, actually. No.
I'm doing a little research...

322
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:32,552
look, if you wanna know how to please
a demon, I can help you.

323
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:33,926
Seriously?

324
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,639
- 'cause that would be great.
- Of course.

325
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:40,093
Drop by my place tonight.

326
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,683
I'll give you a little
one-on-one tutorial, as they say. And,

327
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:46,456
I like to make learning fun,
so bring along

328
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,567
plenty of plastic garbage bags.

329
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,238
I think. I think no.

330
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,528
Thank you, no, but.

331
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:02,097
That sounds like somethin'
i'm a little uncomfortable with,

332
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,383
but thank you very much
for the kind offer.

333
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,414
- Fine. Figure it out for yourself then.
- No, Gladys, please.

334
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:10,683
Is there any advice you can give
me that doesn't require actual...

335
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:11,793
Touching?

336
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,090
Well, I guess she finds
you physically repulsive.

337
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:16,871
Have a nice day.

338
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,846
This guy gives me the creeps.

339
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:28,065
How much longer do
we have to hang on to this?

340
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:30,887
We gotta figure out a way to lure
FitzGerald out into the open.

341
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:33,628
I say we advertise this painting
is for sale, he shows up to claim it,

342
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:35,223
and then we trap him.

343
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:38,705
- Maybe Morgan has some ideas.
- Morgan? Why would we ask Morgan?

344
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,931
I don't know. Dude seems to
know how to get things done.

345
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:44,020
All he did was almost get us arrested.
Why do you love him so much?

346
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:47,157
I don't know.
He's just got this aura, you know?

347
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,460
He's the kind of guy that walks into a
room, and people's eyes just go to him.

348
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,525
- He's got "it."
- He does not have "it."

349
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,183
Some people do.

350
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:58,115
It's like that undefinable presence,
like Clooney, Pitt.

351
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:02,478
- Rickles.
- Yeah. You know, I used to have "it,"

352
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,137
like 4, 5 years ago.

353
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:07,029
I remember that.
That was a really good summer for you.

354
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:09,436
I was really into kale at that time.

355
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:11,470
- Yeah.
- All right.

356
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,159
Just keep in mind he's the son
of the devil. You can't trust him.

357
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,606
- You're the son of the devil.
- Do you trust me?

358
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,661
- Not really.
- Wanna hand me that dish?

359
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,657
What the hell, Sock?!
I'm gonna kill you!

360
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,383
Look! Look! Look!

361
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:43,425
- The soul, he's here.
- What? Where?

362
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,999
Get it off!
Get it off!

363
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,920
- Don't let 'em in your ear!
- On my back!

364
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,342
The back! The back!
Get the back!

365
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,202
- Can't vessel'em!
- Bathroom! Run!

366
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:15,222
- It's on me. Is it on me?
- Shut up.

367
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,075
What are you all doing in the tub?

368
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,080
We were playin' a game of hide-and-seek.

369
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:42,275
You were it, and you found us. Good job.

370
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,659
Really?

371
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:52,677
The painting. It's gone.

372
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,307
He took it back.

373
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:06,445
So sick.
I had the creeps all last night.

374
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,245
It sounds awful.

375
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:11,792
No idee and the get soul.
And no that painting was our only lead.

376
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,400
- What's he doing with all his stuff?
- What do you mean?

377
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,574
He must have hundreds of things.
I mean, thousands maybe.

378
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,960
He's gotta have someplace
to put it, right?

379
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,359
Hey, that's a really good idea.

380
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,653
Someplace big, like a warehouse.

381
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,817
You said he was in shipping, right?

382
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,110
Who is that?

383
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:53,858
I can see you.

384
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:55,850
Que?

385
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,269
I know it's you, Ted.

386
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:03,107
OK, listen, you can't be here.
You got fired.

387
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,162
I know I did, Judas.

388
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:09,131
- OK, why am I Judas?
- I don't know. Why are you?

389
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:12,367
I didn't fire you, Ted.
You got yourself fired.

390
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,499
Well, look at you, Miss Fancy pants,

391
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:17,201
all drunk with power.

392
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:20,166
You have to leave.

393
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:22,763
Sorry. Talk to the boss.

394
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:25,787
- That's me.
- Nope. My boss.

395
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:33,978
No need to yell.

396
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:36,262
You cannot subcontract your job to Ted.

397
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:39,030
Lookit, I promised you
the work would be done,

398
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,458
and it is being done
in a top-notch fashion.

399
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,891
- What's the problem?
- The problem is the company fired him!

400
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,489
I know that.
That's why he agreed to work for 40%,

401
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,946
and I get 60 finder's fee.
Everybody's happy.

402
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:51,152
Do I look happy?

403
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,707
All right, listen to me.

404
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:57,077
I will cut you in, OK,
but it needs to come out of Ted's end.

405
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,906
- Get rid of him.
- Wait. Wait. No. No, Andi. Brother.

406
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:02,532
OK, listen,
are you honestly gonna fire Ted again?

407
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,072
He's already been fired, Sock.
It should have stuck the first time.

408
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,142
OK, do you know

409
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:08,967
that he comes here all the time?
Yeah, just to be in the bench presence.

410
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,031
He loves this stupid place. It's like
his whole life, his whole identity.

411
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:14,219
And to take that away,
that would just be cruel.

412
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,105
Well, I didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:19,224
Plus, he's got other things in his life.

414
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,520
No, Andi.
Think about it.

415
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:23,661
This is all he's ever known.

416
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,718
This is the only job he's ever had.
He eats here. He sleeps here.

417
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,618
He brings imaginary girlfriends here.

418
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:31,723
If you force him to leave again,
you will destroy him.

419
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:35,366
Hey, we think we found where
the soul's hiding his stuff.

420
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:38,390
There's an old shipyard FitzGerald used
to own. It's been condemned for years.

421
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:41,206
I'm on it. My shift's covered.

422
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,885
All right, so which one is FitzGerald's?

423
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,756
I guess we'll have
to search 'em one by one.

424
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,091
- What?
- Hey, did you call Morgan?

425
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,043
How did you find us?

426
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:00,200
Dad wanted me to meet you here,
said you could use my expertise.

427
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,329
I guess FitzGerald's keepin'
his loot in this old container.

428
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:05,765
I don't believe this.
He doesn't help me with anything.

429
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:07,738
You just gotta learn
to work the old man.

430
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,872
He's actually a little
bit of a pushover.

431
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,540
I can't believe he was able
to get his hands on all this.

432
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,629
Right.

433
00:26:29,942 --> 00:26:32,417
The guy's got impeccable taste.
I'll give him that.

434
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,344
A biedermeier.

435
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,907
- Limoges.
- Limoges. Good stuff.

436
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:41,918
Venetian crystal.

437
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,151
This stuff is worth a fortune.

438
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,296
Look at this.

439
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:01,285
FitzGerald made a list of
everything he ever owned.

440
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,290
Looks like he got it all.

441
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:06,650
Except for mary ann.

442
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,626
Who's mary ann?

443
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:11,610
Maybe this is her.

444
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,426
You think she's still alive?

445
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:17,994
We should find her
before FitzGerald does.

446
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,629
Let's go.

447
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,697
This is all Sock's fault.
I mean, he put me in this position.

448
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,138
Now if I fire Ted,
he'll probably die or something.

449
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:41,675
Yeah, but ask yourself
is that a bad thing?

450
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,353
- I don't know what to do.
- What the hell is Morgan doing here?

451
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:45,436
He's here?

452
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,750
That's not what
I thought he'd look like.

453
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:55,568
Hey, he's a Jerk.
Try not to kill him.

454
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:59,043
Hey, hey.
You ready to get crackin' on that soul?

455
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,671
Yeah, we're tryin' to track down
his wife, so until we do that,

456
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:04,219
- we're pretty much stuck.
- Yeah, mary ann. I got her address.

457
00:28:04,302 --> 00:28:05,542
Dad hooked me up.

458
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:08,811
- Hi. Morgan.
- Hi. I'm Andi.

459
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:11,813
You're Sam's girlfriend.
OK. It's good to meet you.

460
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,981
How are you?
Heard a lot of good things about you.

461
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,217
- Thanks.
- You're a lucky lady.

462
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,113
He's one in a million.

463
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,293
He's just brave, smart.

464
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:24,743
- He's just an all-around great guy.
- Thanks. Yeah, I agree.

465
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:26,620
OK. You ready to get goin'?

466
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,739
Got a good feelin' about this.

467
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:32,085
- Don't say it.
- I'm sorry.

468
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,458
He's not that bad.

469
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,291
I told you not to say it.

470
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,270
Babe, i'm right here.

471
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:47,449
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

472
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,143
I just heard humans can
please demons in bed.

473
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,521
Ben, I told you this wasn't a problem.

474
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:53,671
Yes, it is!

475
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,906
Sex is an essential component
in a strong relationship.

476
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,816
It is the cornerstone of...

477
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:04,157
Something. I don't know.
I read it in some female books.

478
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:07,869
- What exactly are female books?
- Look, I know what it is, all right?

479
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:10,690
You can't be yourself sexually.

480
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:14,122
You change into human form, and tr...

481
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,169
And pretend to be something you're not.

482
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,340
And I want you to be happy.

483
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:20,276
So I...

484
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,802
I'm gonna have sex with
you in your natural body.

485
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:27,014
Now, I would simply ask

486
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,741
that you be careful that
your wings don't poke me in the eye.

487
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:33,395
Also, please be aware my skin is
very sensitive. It chafes easily.

488
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:36,191
Also, please don't talk
while we're doing it.

489
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,166
I mean, your demon voice
is a little mannish, OK?

490
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,199
Now, I'm gonna have a cocktail first.

491
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,196
I hope you don't mind.
Do you have a glass?

492
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:49,494
So you want this?

493
00:29:58,189 --> 00:30:00,182
I can drink from the bottle.

494
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,313
I don't know what I can tell
you about my late husband.

495
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:18,993
But if you're looking to get your hands
on his estate,

496
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,400
you can forget about it.

497
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,668
He made sure there was nothing left.

498
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,417
Actually

499
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:28,942
we're here to warn you, and,

500
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:31,495
I know this is gonna sound crazy.
It's just that...

501
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:37,000
Edmund FitzGerald might be back from the
dead and might be trying to kidnap you.

502
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:41,508
I would have been
a little more delicate about it,

503
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,882
but yes. It's true.

504
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:47,167
He had this list of everything
he ever owned, everything he loved,

505
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,253
and you're the last thing on the list.

506
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:52,462
Well, now I know you're
a couple of crackpots.

507
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,043
Edmund loved only things,

508
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,729
possessions.
Nothing else mattered.

509
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:00,482
No, he did.
Mary ann was on his list.

510
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:04,361
That's not me.
That was his boat, themary ann.

511
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:08,153
She sank to the bottom of
the pacific 50 years ago.

512
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,131
But if edmund's ghost

513
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,785
is looking for that,
well, he'll never find it.

514
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:14,913
Serves him right, the son of a bitch.

515
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,917
Well, I feel compelled to point
out that you're attacking the dead.

516
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,879
And to say there's nothing really
wrong with having an appreciation

517
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,132
- of the finer things, which clearly
- Actually, we were just leaving.

518
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:30,958
You're wearing his ring.

519
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,632
What?!

520
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:39,726
You're gonna get us killed. FitzGerald
is gonna come looking for that.

521
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,449
He's not even gonna know it's missing.

522
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,316
We have to take it back right now.

523
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,289
No. I like it.

524
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:49,128
You are such a Dick.

525
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:52,201
Now I understand why the devil
is disappointed in you. You're a moron.

526
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:53,945
He said that?

527
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,059
He said he was disappointed?

528
00:31:56,142 --> 00:31:57,882
You don't care about
anybody but yourself.

529
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,725
You do whatever you want, and
it doesn't even matter who gets hurt.

530
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,519
Why would I care,
when the world's full of guys like you,

531
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:05,475
responsible and ethical?

532
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:06,958
I don't feel that.

533
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:08,054
Never felt it.

534
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,904
In fact,
I've never felt anything for anybody.

535
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,098
It's very liberating.

536
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:18,393
Do you really think i'm gonna kill
myself for the family business?

537
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:20,225
Not a chance.

538
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:25,162
But you, you spill your blood,

539
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:28,967
you work hard, and you do
a good job so that when the time comes,

540
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,989
I can stand on your shoulders

541
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,262
or dead body, if necessary,

542
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,286
in order to get to the top.

543
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,122
You're evil.

544
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:43,126
I'm the son of the devil.
I mean, what'd you expect?

545
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:46,713
I'm done with this. I'm done with you.
After today, no more training.

546
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:50,816
Well, I think dear old dad has some
serious quality time planned for us,

547
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:53,553
so I don't think you're gonna
be done with me anytime soon.

548
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:56,682
You hear that?

549
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:02,433
My lucky day.

550
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,819
Wait!

551
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,477
- What was that?
- They're inside the vents.

552
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,968
- Run.
- What?

553
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:15,051
Run!

554
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,031
Sam, back here!

555
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,352
Wait! I am not the one
you're looking for. I swear.

556
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,716
I'm not the one you're looking for!
I'm not the one you want!

557
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,470
I swear! I'm not the one you want!

558
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,055
Sam, back here!

559
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:44,104
Just give him the ring.
That's what he wants.

560
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,639
It's stuck!

561
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,441
The pool!
Jump in the pool!

562
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:59,285
- It worked.
- Yeah, I know.

563
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,033
- Got it.
- What are you doing?!

564
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:04,082
Why did you do that?

565
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,626
Wait. Wait.

566
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,388
I'll give it back to you.
It's yours.

567
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,643
You want me to put it in your mouth?

568
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,684
Please don't bite me.

569
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:31,583
Happy?

570
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:33,646
Good.

571
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:53,089
We get to keep those, right?

572
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,648
I can't keep running away from you.

573
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:14,311
Or shoveling food into my mouth,
for that matter,

574
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:16,613
so I think I'm ready to
tell you the truth now.

575
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:20,423
Truth would be nice.

576
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:34,938
So you know I used to be an Angel.

577
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,944
Yeah, I know demons were Angels.

578
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:41,350
But what I didn't tell you is...

579
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,779
that you're not my first human.

580
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:46,639
I see.

581
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:49,836
Before the fall, some Angels

582
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:52,273
came to earth and married humans.

583
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,849
There were even children born.
They were called nephilim.

584
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,789
I was one of those Angels.

585
00:35:57,872 --> 00:36:01,271
I didn't have a kid or anything,
but I did fall in love.

586
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:04,339
When god found out, he...

587
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:07,372
banished us from paradise
and smote those we loved.

588
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:11,167
So the guy you loved died.

589
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,700
So if you're feeling like
I'm holding back from you, you're right.

590
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:20,563
I have been holding back
in a lot of ways,

591
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,939
sexually and emotionally,

592
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:25,807
because if I ever lost you
the way I lost him, Ben.

593
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,428
I can't tell you what's gonna
happen in the future,

594
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,857
but I can tell you
that I'm crazy about you.

595
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,720
And I'm not going anywhere.

596
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:41,045
Is that enough for now?

597
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:44,764
I think it is.

598
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,679
And...

599
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:51,433
I think I'm ready to be with
you completely,

600
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,029
heart and body.

601
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,151
And when you say, "body,"

602
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:04,095
you mean, this one, right,
without the tail and horns?

603
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:08,224
I'm just checking.
Just checking.

604
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:11,257
I made my decision.

605
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:14,105
Ted, only official employees
can work here at the bench,

606
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,925
so I cannot allow you
to continue taking Sock's shifts.

607
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,652
Didn't think you had it in you.

608
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,654
So cold.

609
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,333
That's why I called home office,

610
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:26,659
and they're letting me hire you
back on a 6-month trial basis.

611
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:32,248
- You are a benevolent, gifted leader.
- On one condition.

612
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:35,958
- You'll be hired back as a trainee.
- Trainee?

613
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,131
I was working in this stor
when you were still experimenting

614
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:41,090
with alternative
lifestyles at summer camp.

615
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,787
Take it or leave it, Ted.

616
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,181
Fine.

617
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:48,954
One more thing.

618
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:51,434
Our new trainee is gonna need a trainer.

619
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:56,940
I don't think so. No.

620
00:37:57,357 --> 00:38:00,985
I do. And if you wanna continue
working here, you'll agree.

621
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,773
Besides,
I think you'll make a fantastic trainer.

622
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,065
Conscientious, dedicated.

623
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,454
You guys are gonna be a team,
joined at the hip for 6 months.

624
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Touche, Andi.

625
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,459
Touche.

626
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:21,757
Who's the pretty boy?

627
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:24,142
Hi. Morgan.
It's nice to meet you.

628
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:26,970
He's sort of the son of your boss.

629
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:28,375
So's Genghis Khan.

630
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,932
You expect me to be
impressed by a gap ad?

631
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:33,821
These also came, a bunch of gold coins.

632
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:37,606
- I'm not sure what to do with them.
- Not a vessel, not my problem.

633
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,489
I can't believe you.
And you say I'm selfish.

634
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:50,959
I did all the work, and I saved your
life. We're not splitting this 50/50.

635
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:53,436
We never found if I wouldn't
have lured him to us with the ring.

636
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,499
So that was on purpose?
That was all a trap?

637
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:58,087
- That wasn't you being an idiot?
- You're a Jackass. You know that?

638
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,812
Listen to this.

639
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:01,420
Fighting like 2 brothers.

640
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:03,176
I'm gettin' all misty.

641
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,117
Look at you?

642
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,997
The hero.
You captured your first soul.

643
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,055
I don't know.
I'm just tryin' to make you proud.

644
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,766
You can learn a thing
or two from this guy, I think.

645
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,852
Unbelievable.

646
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,359
Hey, let me see those gold coins, Sammy.

647
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,608
Now, Morgan,

648
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,485
Sam has made quite the investment in you

649
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:25,611
by bailing you out of jail.

650
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,658
But at your well-deserved R&R
at my villa in the Caymans,

651
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,578
I want you to start thinking
about how you're gonna repay him.

652
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,788
What?! Why does he get the gold?

653
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,167
Well, you don't want that. That's
blood money. People died for that.

654
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,211
You don't mind a little blood
on your hands, do you, Morgan?

655
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:45,058
No, I prefere blood on my hands, dad.

656
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:46,753
Then it's settled.

657
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,303
Hey, that's not a very happy Sammy face.

658
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:55,008
No, you know, he did nothing to capture
that soul. I saved his life.

659
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:57,802
Don't worry about it. I'm just tryin'
to give the kid a little confidence.

660
00:39:57,885 --> 00:40:00,813
That's all. Don't wanna demoralize
him his first time out.

661
00:40:00,937 --> 00:40:03,285
- You demoralize me all the time.
- Well, you can take it.

662
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,975
- Whatever.
- No, Sammy, look.

663
00:40:05,058 --> 00:40:08,288
I don't have to reward you
with trinkets and paltry pieces

664
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,184
of gold that some soul has vomited up.

665
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,786
You're much bigger than that.
You are.

666
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,603
In fact, I'm beginning
to reassess this whole situation.

667
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,652
You know, maybe Morgan isn't
the one I should be priming.

668
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:22,945
Maybe the perfect son is you.

669
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:25,460
No. No, I'm not. Seriously.
Put it out of your head.

670
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:28,586
I don't know.
It's becoming clearer and clearer to me

671
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,223
that you are the one
who will be sitting at my right hand.

672
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,061
Morgan can have that job.
I don't want it.

673
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:36,230
But don't you see?
That's what makes you so perfect.

674
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:42,246
I am so conflicted now.
I don't know who to root for.

675
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:46,052
You could root for Morgan.

676
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:55,326
Do you mind making one last delivery?
It's a big freezer.

677
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:56,495
Sure.

678
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,413
OK, good,
because it's goin' to your mom's place.

679
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:02,291
What does she need a giant freezer for?

680
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:45,175
I don't want you to be afraid.

681
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:58,689
Dad!
