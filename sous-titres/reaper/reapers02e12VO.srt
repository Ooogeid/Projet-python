1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,856
Where the hell are you guys?

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,544
We were uh...
unavoidably detained.

3
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,316
"Dós taquitos" .
One beef, one pork.

4
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:47,380
All right, just...

5
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:51,871
- One beef, one pork!
- Yeah-- I got it Sock!

6
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:53,607
Hang on a sec...

7
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,106
What?

8
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:57,784
<i>Hey, where did you say
you were, again?</i>

9
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,263
It's the old asylum out--

10
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,223
Uh... Sammy?

11
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:28,796
How are you doing here, buddy?

12
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:30,139
You almost done?

13
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,142
'Cause I have something
I really wanna show you.

14
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,303
- Listen, you gotta get me outta here.
- Why?

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,155
- This is so exciting!
- No, please, the guy is gonna kill me!

16
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:39,324
Always so much drama...

17
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:40,415
Fine.

18
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:45,157
Wha-- that's it?

19
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:31,092
See?

20
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,675
- Now, that wasn't so hard.
- What?

21
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,188
Tell me, Sammy...

22
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,685
What do you know about
the world of business?

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,093
Where are we?

24
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,771
Did you know, beginning
in the late 19 century,

25
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:48,094
corporations were granted
all the rights of the individual.

26
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,062
But none of the annoying
responsibilities.

27
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:56,192
They lacked, almost by design, any kind
of moral compass, conscience or compassion.

28
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:59,031
Basically, corporations are a way

29
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:01,537
to *** sociopathic behavior
on a grand scale.

30
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:04,717
In short, they're what makes
this country so damn great.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,657
So what, you work here?

32
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:13,361
Well... actually...
I... was really rather hoping...

33
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:18,470
that you would.

34
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:24,076
What better place to instruct
you in the ways of evil...

35
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:26,774
than here.

36
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:28,762
Corporate America!

37
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,806
So... the Devil's making
you work here.

38
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:43,848
- Yep.
- It sucks...

39
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:45,664
I don't know what
the Devil's angle is,

40
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:47,433
but if he's trying to torture me,
it could be worse.

41
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:50,182
A lot worse, man...
This place is ***!

42
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,587
Benjamin!

43
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:53,221
Drink is ready!

44
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:56,411
Dude... there's a telephone
in that bathroom.

45
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,212
Just got a lot of stuff done
in a really short amount of time.

46
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,619
Bet you did...

47
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:02,129
So you're actually
gonna take this job?

48
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:04,411
Ele disse que se eu trabalhasse aqui
He did say that if I worked here
I wouldn't have to catch souls.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,664
Really?

50
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,539
Hey, getting paid to sit
around and do nothing

51
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:10,869
sounds a whole lot better than almost
getting killed by axe *** psychopaths.

52
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,551
And I'm really good at doing nothing.

53
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,564
That's true.

54
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:17,294
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

55
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:19,272
I'm Avery,
your personal secretary...

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,897
You should put this on,
Mr. Randall is waiting for you.

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,416
- Who?
- Mr. Randall, the C.E.O.

58
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:28,285
He's asked for you and he
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

59
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,699
Right, absolutely.

60
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:33,854
Thank you, Avery!

61
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,795
After over two years of planning

62
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,268
and thousands of man-hours of research

63
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,168
and development,
we present to you...

64
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:41,412
The "Orchard".

65
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,229
Combining high-end luxury apartments

66
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,522
with the best at shopping,
and dinning.

67
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,040
Thank you, Phil.
I get the general idea.

68
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:50,896
Now I'd like to hear
what the new guy has.

69
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,948
Comes highly recommended
by Jerry, upstairs.

70
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:55,272
- Me?
- What you got?

71
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,022
Uh. Oh, I didn't realize I needed
to prepare for something.

72
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:01,988
I-- have nothing.

73
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:03,324
Nothing?

74
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,613
You have nothing?

75
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,334
Maybe that's exactly
what this project needs.

76
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,116
- It is?
- A fresh start.

77
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,387
A new direction, and a leader who
isn't afraid of throwing everything out.

78
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,160
Start over from ground zero.

79
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:20,488
Sam...

80
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:23,465
Why don't you take your time with this.
Let this ***.

81
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,584
Couple days, we'll see
what you come back with.

82
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,622
Phil's set the bar pretty low.

83
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,590
I don't think this should
be too hard.

84
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:42,874
Yo, Benji!

85
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:44,938
Got us some burgers, buddy!

86
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:47,488
- Benji, burgers...
- Hey, Sock!

87
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:50,522
Wha--
What uh...

88
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,187
What is this?

89
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:54,907
Just giving Ben a trim.

90
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,435
You like it?

91
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,965
Doesn't look like a trim.

92
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,512
Looks like way, way more
than a little trim.

93
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:05,041
- Something wrong?
- Sock and I...

94
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,638
usually give each other haircuts--
- Usually?

95
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:09,449
Did you say usually?
Ben? Usually?

96
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:11,926
Let's not forget that
we've been cutting

97
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,028
each other's hair,
for 6 years, Ben.

98
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,796
Six long, wonderful,
funky-fresh years of...

99
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:20,198
of bowl-cuts, and cornrows,
and thaves, and high-***

100
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:23,376
and many, many many more.
You name it.

101
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,594
And then I come home to...
to this.

102
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:27,823
So, yeah, yeah.
Something's wrong.

103
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,701
Man, you need a girlfriend.

104
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,105
- What?!
- Sock...

105
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:33,824
I don't know why I didn't
think of this before,

106
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,511
- I have the perfect girl for you.
- Ooh... fix up...

107
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:37,845
Her name is Maggie,
she's a demon

108
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,714
and she is awesome.

109
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,408
You're gonna love her.

110
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,065
Come on, Sock...

111
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:45,826
We could double date.
Think how much fun that would be.

112
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,293
And I promise we'll ***
each other beforehand.

113
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,277
And maybe, uh...

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,478
You can give me a little trim,
****?

115
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,610
Absolutely, buddy.

116
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:56,639
Alright, I'm in.

117
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:01,574
- For you, Benji. Burger.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,000
- Thanks for the ***, buddy.
- Thank you.

119
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,024
How was your first day?

120
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,180
Good.
Fun.

121
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,826
Well, it's great to have
people onboard.

122
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,479
To be honest,

123
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:20,741
we got some people
here on *** control.

124
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,068
What a dead ***.

125
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:31,889
I'm sorry. You know...
I'm happy to work together on this

126
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,951
I don't even want to **,
so maybe if we--

127
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:37,744
One second.

128
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:50,679
Oh, my god!

129
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,405
- Hey.
- Hey!

130
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,967
- I just got a text from my dad.
- What did he say?

131
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,938
"Have what you need
to get out of your deal."

132
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,717
"Trapped in the third circle of Hell."

133
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,494
"Need a way out.
Send help".

134
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:10,827
See that? Sam?

135
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,386
*** those little circles
*** back

136
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:16,121
it's like you're uh...
*****

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,868
That's-- that's very impressive.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
Listen...
Tony.

139
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:21,904
I need to get into Hell.

140
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:25,029
What? That's impossible, Sam.
The living can't go down to Hell

141
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:26,404
they'll be incinerated.

142
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,676
You ever smell a man's flesh
boil of his own body? Right?

143
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:32,938
Have you? No. I haven't.
Big girl.

144
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:34,815
Tony, Tony, Tony.
Focus.

145
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,639
My dad is stuck down there. Okay?
Is there any chance maybe you could go?

146
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:42,548
I'd love to, Sam. But I--
I got a baby now,

147
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,411
I can't just run off
little ****

148
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:45,991
on a little ** to Hell.

149
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,286
Please! Plea--
I'm desperate!

150
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,764
Hey, Sam. Even if I
could find a babysitter,

151
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,732
I'd have to find an active
portal to travel to Hell,

152
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:55,355
I wouldn't even know where to begin
to search for something like that.

153
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:57,076
Wha-- what about the DMV?

154
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,389
No, that's for vessels only.

155
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:03,501
Oh! You know what? I think your best bet
would be to find uh, and active volcano, yeah.

156
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:06,107
Yeah, they're like pinpalls
on the other world's ass.

157
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:09,514
Oh. Hey, speaking of volcanoes.

158
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,633
I think *** Stevie
had a little eruption.

159
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,162
I have to go.
Bye.

160
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,741
Thank you, Tony.
163
Oh, you know what, Benji?

161
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:22,899
I'll admit it. I'm a little excited
about this blind date.

162
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,027
I can tell.

163
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,797
You're wearing the musk I
gave you for Valentine's Day.

164
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:27,715
I am.

165
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,400
*** that great natural order.

166
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:31,569
It's really floral.
Like *** or--

167
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,562
Ben, Sock...
This is my friend, Maggie.

168
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:35,971
Hey!

169
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:40,599
No, it is it?
This is Maggie?

170
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,472
This is your friend?
That I would love?

171
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:47,732
It's her! Nina, you have really...
outdone yourself.

172
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,452
I'm so happy with you right now.

173
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,887
This is gonna be--

174
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,256
You should've seen this one
during the ***.

175
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,879
** party girl!

176
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,409
What was that guy's name?
T-Burry?

177
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,007
Oh!
T-Bone!

178
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:04,951
T-Bone...
We called him T-Bone.

179
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,773
He could not keep
his hands off of you.

180
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,791
Wait...

181
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:10,312
I believe I set you up
with him as well.

182
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,317
Oh, you are such a good friend.

183
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:13,404
That she is.

184
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:16,214
Well, I'm gonna make a...
quick stop at the pee-pee ***.

185
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,591
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

186
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,892
Hurry back,
I miss you already.

187
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,371
- Sock! What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing...

188
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,150
- Crap me a cover story.
- A cover story for what, Sock?

189
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,905
For me bailing out on that ***.
Thank you very much for the effort.

190
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:32,930
What we're gonna tell her...
there was a bar fight that went on.

191
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,335
I got in the middle of it to kick
everyone's ass. That's pretty usual.

192
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:37,396
And had to take a trip downtown
to a patty wagon.

193
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,518
No, not good. Not good, Sock.
That is my friend Maggie.

194
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,674
I don't want you bailing
on her, that's so rude!

195
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,551
Nina, I waited until she
went to the bathroom.

196
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:45,989
Like a gentlemen.

197
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,728
- Hey!
- Wh-- Hey!

198
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,819
- Forgot my purse.
- Oh, it's right there.

199
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,504
Yes, it is.
What's going on here?

200
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,044
That-- nothing.
I got paged...

201
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:56,791
so I gotta go...

202
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,835
to the hospital.
Where I work...

203
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,191
as a surgeon.

204
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:04,153
- You're a surgeon?
- Big time. Big time.

205
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,816
I-- I gotta ask. What kind of surgery
are you gonna perform?

206
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,041
I...

207
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,891
am going to perform
what is commonly known

208
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,185
in the medical community as...

209
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:16,684
a face...
off.

210
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,741
A face off?

211
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,227
Like the movie?

212
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,840
Yeah! Exactly like the movie.

213
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,382
We just found...
the perfect face match.

214
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,962
So, I'm gonna buggy out of here.

215
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,601
Pleasure to make--
***

216
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:31,508
Thank you again, Nina.

217
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,096
Yeah...
Okay.

218
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,182
- Hey. Can I help you?
- I don't know. Can you?

219
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,448
Here.

220
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:48,593
- Uh.... what should I do with this?
- I don't know... Crush it?

221
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:51,639
Light it on fire... Just like you've
done to my career.

222
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:53,353
Here, let me get this started for you.

223
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,844
No, stop! Stop!
It's not that big of a deal!

224
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,094
You know what?
You're right.

225
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,234
It's nothing.

226
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:04,226
80 hours a week...
poured down the drain.

227
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:05,586
Nothing.

228
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,902
My dreams being disintegrated
before my eyes...

229
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,293
Nothing.

230
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:11,009
My wife!

231
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,383
Leaving me...

232
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,423
For my dad!

233
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:16,592
Because he pays attention to her?
It's nothing.

234
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:21,064
- Will you excuse me, for just a second?
- Whoa, what are you--

235
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:24,900
This nothing is gonna
jump off this window.

236
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,200
No-- no!

237
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:29,791
I hope all the 176 pounds
of nothing shoots out of my ass!

238
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:30,838
No, Bill! No!

239
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,804
You're not--
You're not nothing, ok?

240
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:34,100
You're--
You're great!

241
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,664
How can you say that?
You don't even know me!

242
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,065
Because I know a brilliant idea
when I see it, okay?

243
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:39,551
And-- and the "Orchard"...

244
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:43,119
The "Orchard"...
is a brilliant idea!

245
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,508
I don't deserve to be
in charge of the project,

246
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:49,287
I-- I suck at this job,
I shouldn't even be here.

247
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:52,406
You know what,
you're right.

248
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,526
Can you help me out, Sam?

249
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:58,626
How?

250
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,014
I need you...

251
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:01,496
To go out of this window.

252
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,306
** gonna be so great.

253
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:05,209
****

254
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,317
- Phil, stop!
- Don't fight it! It's a law of nature!

255
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,888
Kill or be killed.

256
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,395
It's a good thing you wear cheap ties.

257
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,470
What's that material?
Paper maché?

258
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,830
- Is he dead?
- Well, that poor bastard just dropped 59 floors...

259
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,615
Nah, he's probably fine.

260
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,516
Hey, victory Martini, Sammy?

261
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,091
I think I'm gonna be sick.

262
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,447
Oh, come on, man!

263
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,619
Don't feel so bad.

264
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:42,952
Most of this is all my fault anyway.

265
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,454
I've been trying to drive old Philly nuts

266
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,867
ever since we recruited him from
Harvard business school.

267
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,072
Why?

268
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,538
Well, that's the whole point of this place.

269
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:55,590
Some companies produce microwaves,
here, we produce sin.

270
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,400
Oh, there's only so much
I can explain to you.

271
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:03,249
Maybe I should just show you.

272
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,531
75, please.

273
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,785
Oh! I almost forgot.

274
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:23,841
I believe you need one of...
these.

275
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,867
Only a select few ever
make it up to 75, Sammy.

276
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:30,269
But everybody in this building would sell
his grandma's virtue for that privilege.

277
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:31,719
Allow me.

278
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:50,132
My tailor died.

279
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:54,323
Oh. Well...
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,739
Yeah. 81 years,
I was with Lou.

281
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:02,000
He knew how to make a suit
** a man.

282
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:04,776
Sweet Loui...

283
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,398
I'm gonna need ***.

284
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,514
Don't you always wear
the same suit?

285
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,039
I change three times a day, kiddo.

286
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,540
This is my afternoon suit.

287
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:43,870
We're seeing great results
from that nymphomaniac ***

288
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:45,919
that we put on Jamison's desk last week.

289
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,909
They're committing adultery on 9
as we speak.

290
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,577
How are things looking
in the mail room?

291
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:53,296
*** cut their over time?

292
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,632
Yeah, just got word.

293
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,570
****'s plotting of murdering
his supervisor

294
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:59,314
and his supervisor's supervisor.

295
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,228
Welcome to the top, Sammy.

296
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,007
They're all demons.

297
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,485
Demons, or souls that I own.

298
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:11,341
And they just... mess up everything
for people down bellow?

299
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,621
Yeah.
Pretty genius, right?

300
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:15,600
Thousands of employees
in this building

301
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:18,114
all clawing, and scratching,
and *** their way to the top...

302
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:19,284
Like Phil.

303
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,918
Then, once they're up here,
they belong to me.

304
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:25,380
The entire purpose of this corporation
is *** souls into Hell.

305
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,487
Michael, *** accounts ***
took the bait!

306
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,889
- He's *** on 18!
- ***!

307
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,231
Can you hear me now?

308
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:40,593
Okay. Yeah, I'm back in town.
I'll-- I'll go ** the meeting with you tonight.

309
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:41,954
What the hell was that?

310
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:44,867
That is a...
portal.

311
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,272
To the home office.

312
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,330
That's a portal to Hell?

313
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,269
No, it's a portal to ***.

314
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:58,861
I know what you're thinking.

315
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,013
You do?

316
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,859
You're thinking this place
doesn't look like much.

317
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,543
You're right, it doesn't.

318
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,318
But you will never know more power

319
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:09,312
than the rush one feels

320
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:12,806
when they make something
happen here, in the 75th floor.

321
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:29,110
This portal is *** made for humans.

322
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:31,095
Well, demons...
To go through.

323
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:34,227
So, do you think you can--
Can you stop that?

324
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,191
We're almost finished.

325
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:40,674
- Okay!
- Nina, could you rescue my dad

326
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,478
if I get you to that portal?

327
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:45,670
- No...
- No.

328
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,164
No, sorry. I don't think so.

329
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:49,952
But, Tony said that...
demons should be fine in Hell.

330
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,464
Well, physically, yeah.
But I don't wanna go.

331
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:53,820
I think it's too risky.

332
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:56,769
- Sam really needs your help.
- The woman said "no".

333
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:59,757
I know, I know. It's just that I--
I don't understand why.

334
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:00,871
Okay, look...

335
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:04,230
I was really wild when
I lived there. Okay?

336
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:08,971
And I don't wanna slip back into some old,
negative habits, that I left behind.

337
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:11,792
Like maiming, and torturing,
and ***.

338
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:14,226
Oh, my god. You guys,
it's like spring break!

339
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,565
If you're a demon...

340
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,453
- But you're different now, right?
- Absolutely. In theory...

341
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:25,381
The thing is... I've done a lot
of personal development

342
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:27,349
and de-toxing.

343
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,964
In order to stop craving
the sounds of people in agony.

344
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:33,085
She's more of a Stevie Wonder fan, now.

345
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:37,016
We are asking you for your help.
As-- as friends.

346
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,230
If you agree to do this, that's
pretty solid proof that you changed.

347
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:47,204
- Come on... I think you're gonna be just fine.
- I wouldn't ask if there was any other way.

348
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,010
Come on, Nina.
Please...

349
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:55,909
I think I can hold it together for one day.

350
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,252
Just for one day!

351
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

352
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:00,495
Thank you so much.

353
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:02,476
Alright, baby.
I'm gonna come back to you.

354
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:05,071
Oh, just be careful.
It is Hell.

355
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:07,662
Okay, how are you gonna
get her to the portal?

356
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,824
Oh, you need a keycard
to get to the 75th floor.

357
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:11,478
But they only give those to executives.

358
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,726
But I figured,
if I can impress the C.E.O.

359
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:18,030
with this presentation I'm supposed to give,
he might promote me.

360
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,131
Have you ever been promoted?

361
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,096
No.

362
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,769
Hi.
Hey.

363
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,626
Hi,
Sock.

364
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:38,556
- Uh... Just... looking for Nina.
- Oh, no. I haven't seen her today. So...

365
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,825
Sorry.

366
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:43,005
It was really... great
to meet you yesterday.

367
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:46,107
- You walked out on me.
- That was great too.

368
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:50,588
Can we just uh...
be honest for a second here?

369
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:51,590
All right.

370
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,250
You don't find me attractive.

371
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,564
No.
Not really.

372
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:57,855
Yeah, but if it's any consolation,

373
00:19:57,944 --> 00:20:00,222
I think it has more to do
with your choice of shirts.

374
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,591
- All right, fair enough.
- Yeah, a little frumpy.

375
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,004
Okay.

376
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:12,083
Did Nina happen to mention that
I can look like... whatever I want?

377
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:14,049
- What?!
- I'm a demon, man.

378
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:17,278
This whole appearance...
it's just a construct in my **.

379
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,729
I thought you knew that.

380
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,809
I could look like
Angelina Jolie, if I wanted...

381
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,066
And you chose
to look like that?

382
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:25,281
Yeah, low maintenance,
no fuss,

383
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:26,622
don't have to floss.

384
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:28,885
Right... anyway,
see you later.

385
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,383
Ah, Maggie,
hold on...

386
00:20:31,152 --> 00:20:32,988
So, what-- what--
How does this work?

387
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:34,518
*** give you a picture...

388
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:35,811
** like my dream girl,

389
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:39,665
and you snap your fingers, turn into her?
- Whoa, it's more complicated than that.

390
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,130
- But yes.
- Wow...

391
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:44,001
That is big news for me.

392
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:45,342
This is major.
All right, let--

393
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,640
Why don't we...
give us another shot.

394
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:50,178
With a-- with a....
different... looking you.

395
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,641
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah.

396
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,814
Wha-- what do you
want me to look like?

397
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,713
What do I want you to look like--
That is a....

398
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,880
That's a really big question.
Hang on. Let me take a look at you.

399
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,240
This is not something one wants to make a
snap decision about, you know what I mean?

400
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:09,608
It's uh-- it requires some research,
planning, a little meditation...

401
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:12,590
- I'm gonna need like 3 months.
- I'll give a day.

402
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:13,882
- Let's do this.
- All right.

403
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:14,995
Good job!

404
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:16,020
Yeah!

405
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,522
You may recall my self-sucking
straw invention,

406
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:22,850
the "straw-tomatic".
Well, my genius ideas

407
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:24,879
don't stop at beverage implements.

408
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:29,415
I *** architectural design.
And I'm gonna get you promoted, Sammy.

409
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:31,661
All right, what d'you got?

410
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:36,028
All right, now... My first idea combines
a hotel and a retail mall...

411
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:37,713
All underwater.

412
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:40,844
I give you...
"Bentopia".

413
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:46,179
Why is it underwater?

414
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:49,736
360º ocean views, man.

415
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:52,843
Right, okay.

416
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,024
Do you have anything
that isn't underwater?

417
00:21:57,427 --> 00:21:59,444
Sorry, I-- I think they all are.

418
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:03,700
So, I have nothing, man.
This *** is in 10 minutes!

419
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:05,523
Wha-- if the underwater
thing's bumping you, Sam,

420
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:08,241
let me remind you that we're
all underneath water already!

421
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,593
Clouds, Sam!
They're made of water!

422
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:14,478
I'm screwed, man! I'm never
gonna get to the 75th floor.

423
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:16,865
My dad's gonna be stuck
in Hell for all the eternity!

424
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,810
Or...

425
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,473
There's that.

426
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:30,499
Residents will live it up in...
5-star hotel-style accommodations,

427
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,399
and they'll totally be pampered by...
like uh... uh...

428
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:36,810
A service office...
that they can--

429
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:38,143
- A *** service.
- Sure, yeah.

430
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,531
You could call it that...

431
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:41,699
Tha-- the end.

432
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:44,232
What do you think?

433
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:46,961
I think that's Phil's model.

434
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:51,580
No... yes, but...
I made changes to it.

435
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,316
Uh... very substantial changes.
Like how I... crushed this part a little--

436
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,595
You stole Phil's model.
That much is clear.

437
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:00,796
Okay, listen...
I can explain--

438
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:02,763
This makes me suspect
that you murdered him as well.

439
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:05,506
You saw his project,
you wanted it for yourself.

440
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,379
So, you lured the man into your office and
you tossed him out a 59 story window.

441
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:10,953
- Mr. Randall, no.
- I'm impressed.

442
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:11,917
I would ne--

443
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:13,383
Wait... what?!

444
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,209
I have seen some ruthless
stunts in my day.

445
00:23:15,355 --> 00:23:16,926
Not many capital offensers, though.

446
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:18,411
Even the best business schools

447
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:20,076
don't bring that kind of bloodlust.

448
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,027
- Thank you.
- Sam Oliver,

449
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,633
you are the total package.

450
00:23:24,274 --> 00:23:26,067
Guts... determination...

451
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:27,849
sociopathic tendencies.

452
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,363
Welcome to the executive ranks, my friend.

453
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,604
See you on the 75th floor...

454
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,594
Can you tell me where
the fans are?

455
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:44,733
The fans?
Yeah.

456
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:47,854
They are right over there.
On the bottom shelf.

457
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,131
Just right there...

458
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,148
Uh... I don't see--

459
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:57,651
Did you just take a picture of my butt?

460
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,853
No. No, no, no, no.
Just ** little back.

461
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,408
Don't flatter yourself.

462
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:28,880
Oh, Benji.
I'm almost done.

463
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:31,304
Soon I will have created
the perfect woman.

464
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:32,781
She looks like Frankenstein.

465
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:35,079
Dude, don't... do me like that.
Come on...

466
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,807
I'm just saying it's unnatural.

467
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:37,746
It is not!

468
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:40,943
There are regular women, right here
in this bar, who are beautiful!

469
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:41,845
- Really?
- Yeah.

470
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:43,140
Okay, show me one.

471
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:45,869
Oh. Oh, my god.

472
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,864
- She's not bad.
- Not at all.

473
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:55,400
Get to it, buddy.

474
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:58,879
Hey.

475
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:00,673
I'm sorry if I was starring,
I just uh...

476
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,999
Got distracted by your hair.

477
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,290
- It's got a really gorgeous shimmer to it.
- Thank you.

478
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:09,628
And those cheekbones are just...
perfection.

479
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,903
Wow. I don't usually succumb
to flattery but, uh...

480
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,517
- You're pretty cute.
- Oh, my god!

481
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,537
I am struck by your beauty.
Look at you...

482
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,000
Can I ask you a favor?

483
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,059
- Anything.
- Can I touch your face?

484
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:25,794
Okay.

485
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:27,147
Team player, I like it.

486
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,162
7 and a half...
that's pretty normal.

487
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:31,504
Good.
Now...

488
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:34,010
Oh, have your eyes always
been this far apart?

489
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,677
- You need to stop now.
- I just need--

490
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:37,756
I'll go.

491
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:05,170
Okay, ** is clear.

492
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:07,972
Urgh... smells like Hell in here.

493
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:09,906
- You gonna be alright?
- Yeah...

494
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,917
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm gonna be fine.

495
00:26:13,135 --> 00:26:16,536
Just... please make sure that
you guys are at this door

496
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:19,267
tomorrow night, at 11pm,
because I don't wanna

497
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,419
be down there any longer
than I have to.

498
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:22,859
We'll be here.

499
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:26,834
- All right. Are you ready?
- Uh, can you give us a second?

500
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,731
Hurry home, baby.
I'm gonna miss you.

501
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:33,150
I'm gonna miss you so much!

502
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,288
As soon as you get back,
I'm gonna draw you a nice bath

503
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:37,191
and I'll give you a long
** foot massage.

504
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:39,485
You will?
That sounds amazing.

505
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:41,527
Maybe you could get
in the bath with me!

506
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,431
Oh, honey, I would.
But it's a 1-person tub

507
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,007
and I don't wanna cramp you in there.

508
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:46,224
I wouldn't mind.

509
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,817
I know, but then there's
the issue of dirty bath water.

510
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,465
And if we're both in there,
then we're only semi-clean

511
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,820
and nobody wants that, okay?
- Yeah, you're right.

512
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:55,350
Oh, maybe we could
take a shower together,

513
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:57,550
that eliminates
the dirty water scenario.

514
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,888
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Shower...

515
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,229
Well, there's just one
*** at it, baby. I--

516
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:04,412
I don't like to stand
when I'm naked.

517
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:07,752
- You sit in the shower, baby?
- What? I serve squad. Yeah.

518
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:11,605
Okay. Then, when I get back
we'll squad in the shower together.

519
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:13,309
Okay.

520
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:17,767
What? You never said good-bye
to a girlfriend before?

521
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:21,746
- Love you.
- I love you more.

522
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:26,284
Okay.

523
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,132
Time to go to Hell.

524
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:37,085
- All right. Thank you so much, Nina.
- You're welcome.

525
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,708
Friends help friends, right?

526
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,239
Nina, wait!

527
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:47,625
If you took a shower beforehand,

528
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,403
then maybe I could get in
the tub with you...

529
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:13,667
There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

530
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:16,054
Okay. Now...
What I'm about to show you...

531
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:19,610
is a combination of a lot
of hard work on my part--

532
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:21,650
- I'm really excited--
- Please. Don-- Don't.

533
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:22,663
Please.

534
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:27,191
Have a knock on me... * kinda of always been the type of guy that never finishes anything.

535
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,293
Like, when I was 5 years old,

536
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,636
I decided to build a bird house.

537
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,665
Never finished.

538
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:33,661
When I was 12,
I decided to learn Spanish...

539
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:36,594
6 months later, I *** "adiu"
to that dream.

540
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,402
- I think you mean "adios"--
- Shh! Do not... interrupt.

541
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:43,318
Okay... now, today...
not only did I finish something...

542
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:46,859
I nailed something.

543
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,666
I present to you...
my lady.

544
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:54,347
My dream woman.

545
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:55,752
Careful with her.

546
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:58,033
See, I drew on
a variety of sources...

547
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:03,364
The... petit small nose, so characteristic
of the women of southern Polynesia.

548
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,832
The toned arm musculature
of a Jennifer Gardner.

549
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:08,107
Or an Anniston,
if you will.

550
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:11,913
And the... monster boobs of the ladies
of "Monster Boobs - The Movie".

551
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:13,992
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah. I know.

552
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,470
So, you think you can...
*** into that for me?

553
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:17,736
I can do it.
I'd be honored.

554
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:19,328
- ***!
- I can do it.

555
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,023
What do you say?
Tonight?

556
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,396
11-thirty?

557
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,681
Thank you.

558
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:26,562
Thank you so much.

559
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,574
Don't screw this up.

560
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:39,853
Look at you...

561
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,599
*** all up.

562
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,736
- What?
- You got to the 75th floor, kiddo!

563
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,278
Faster than anybody
I've ever seen.

564
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:48,822
You're really proving yourself, Sammy.

565
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,075
I couldn't be more proud.

566
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:53,489
- Thank you. What are you wearing?
- Yeah, what do you think?

567
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:57,543
My new tailor says that
I've got some ***.

568
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:58,964
Yeah... no.

569
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,001
It's a lot of look.
Isn't it?

570
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:05,639
Not me.

571
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:07,324
Damn.

572
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:13,343
I need to get my old tailor back.

573
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:14,919
I thought he was dead.

574
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,719
Semantics.
Don't worry about it.

575
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,149
<i>Mr. Oliver?</i>

576
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:20,442
<i>Mr. Randall would like to you
in the conference room.</i>

577
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,193
<i>He sounds pretty angry.</i>

578
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:24,186
Don't ask me.

579
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:25,731
What the heck did you do?

580
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:39,611
Mr. Oliver. Are you aware that we have surveillance cameras throughout this building?

581
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:41,531
Mr. Randall, I can explain.
She was a friend of mine,

582
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,322
and she just wanted
to go home for a visit.

583
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:54,041
Do you see the problem here, Mr. Oliver?

584
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:56,382
- The problem?
- You didn't kill Phil.

585
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:00,418
I'm sorry?

586
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:01,791
You...

587
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:06,783
- What kind of ** are you playing, mister?
- I'm-- I'm not ***, I just--

588
00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:11,182
Wait... you're mad because
I didn't kill Phil?

589
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:13,086
- Really?
- No, Sam.

590
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:15,254
I'm mad because you let me think

591
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:16,393
that you killed somebody.

592
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,625
You weren't man enough
to pull the trigger.

593
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:20,423
On Phil, or on the project.

594
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,590
No, I could pull the trigger.
I can, I swear!

595
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:23,818
In my experience,
you either got it...

596
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:25,066
or you don't.

597
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,413
And you... don't.

598
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,033
You're fired.
Effective immediately.

599
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,745
No. Please, Mr. Randall.
I can do better.

600
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:33,589
** your desk and leave.
Right now.

601
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:39,258
Hand over your keycard.

602
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:02,940
Okay. Mr. Randall's
secretary told me

603
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:04,657
he would be here any minute.
Let's uh...

604
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:06,890
Let's get the keycard out of
his lock while he's in the gym.

605
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:08,650
Yeah. You know, but you two
got ** covered

606
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:10,833
I think I'm gonna ***
a little Boxing ** over here.

607
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,220
We have to meet Nina
at the portal in two hours.

608
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:15,549
And you're seriously thinking about
taking a Boxing *** class?

609
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,337
- Yeah, *** these days.
- Oh, wait, wait. There's Mr. Randall.

610
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:23,262
- He's going in.
- Okay. Come on.

611
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:49,748
Sock. Follow him in there.

612
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,890
Keep him busy.
Ben and I are gonna

613
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,527
break ** the lock
and grab his keycard.

614
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:54,183
Okay, one question.
Why does he have his shirt off

615
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:55,411
if I'm going to the steam room?

616
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:56,695
We're undercover.

617
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:58,172
I'm trying to be inconspicuous.

618
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,185
- Okay, fair enough.
- Go, go.

619
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,510
Hello. Good afternoon, **.

620
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,643
How's the market doing?

621
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,375
Down, 200 points.

622
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,736
Ohh. That's rough.
***. Tell you about it...

623
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:13,632
You know, I have and uncle...

624
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:15,441
- Works on uh... Wall Street.
- Yeah?

625
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,407
He used to have a...
corner on the market,

626
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,404
now he's got a market on the corner.

627
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:25,410
Okay, uh...
Allow me, Samuel.

628
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:32,866
All right, we use my system.
We're gonna get this thing

629
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,753
crack open in no time.
- You have a system?

630
00:33:36,408 --> 00:33:37,923
There's a lot you don't know
about me, Sammy.

631
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:41,594
Please *** 0-0-0.

632
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,491
Locked.

633
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:48,961
0-0-1.

634
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:54,485
0-0-2.

635
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:57,214
- 0-0-3.
- Wait!

636
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,817
Are you just...
wanting me to stand here

637
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:01,203
and try every number
until we find it?

638
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:02,467
Trust the system, Sam.

639
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,825
Trust it.

640
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:04,751
0-0-4.

641
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:07,351
*** be one.

642
00:34:08,353 --> 00:34:10,283
Well... think I'd better hit the shower.

643
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,220
- And get back to the office.
- No. No, no, no.

644
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,461
No, you don't wanna do that.
That would be... a huge mistake.

645
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,162
Really?
Why?

646
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:25,077
Well, because... you... would be walking out
on the business venture of a lifetime.

647
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,399
- Some other time.
- No! No, listen to me,

648
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:29,970
there may not be another opportunity.

649
00:34:30,314 --> 00:34:32,903
For... thousands of miles
of *** property for pennies.

650
00:34:34,653 --> 00:34:37,648
Okay...
I'm listening.

651
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,003
- 0-0-9.
- Ben, this is idiotic.

652
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,558
We cannot stand here and
try every single number.

653
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:47,475
What are you guys doing?

654
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,814
- Uh... we were just. Uh--
- We-- the--

655
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,184
Our combination...
isn't working.

656
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,294
You think you could
give us a hand?

657
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:58,551
Yeah, no problem.

658
00:34:59,508 --> 00:35:00,656
I got the master key right here.

659
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:02,455
- Oh, master key!
- Thank you!

660
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:08,134
- Thank you, very much!
- All right, guys.

661
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:09,678
- Take it easy...
- Ben.

662
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,920
And then the...
explosive charges go off...

663
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,615
completely flooding the Grand Canyon.
Filling it up with water,

664
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:20,280
and bam... all that worthless
property turned into

665
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:21,704
prime time real estate.

666
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,462
You wanna flood Grand Canyon...

667
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:25,885
- Absolutely.
- It's a national park.

668
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,519
So now it's a national pool.

669
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:28,927
- Sir?
- Yeah.

670
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,811
- All ready.
- Benjamin, yes.

671
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:32,048
Thank you.
Okay.

672
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:33,124
That's my secretary.

673
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:36,644
Good, we'll get those papers all...
signed up and set over...

674
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:39,422
your way. All right, buddy?
Enjoy your sweat.

675
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,113
All right. Ben and I are gonna
go up to the 75th floor

676
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:46,943
and grab Nina.

677
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:48,146
You guys stay here...

678
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,664
** lookout, all right?

679
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,371
Oh, my god!
Andi!

680
00:35:51,578 --> 00:35:54,012
Has anyone ever told you,
you have exclusive fingernails?

681
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,983
Okay, Sam.
Please, be careful, okay?

682
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,436
We'll give you a call
if we hear anything.

683
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,774
Wait a minute. Seriously.
What is your secret?

684
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,086
- Come here!
- Oh, my lord!

685
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,134
What?
Reflexology?

686
00:36:05,224 --> 00:36:06,278
- Yeah.
- ***.

687
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:07,943
Would you stop it? What is
the problem with you? Always--

688
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:09,739
-Randall!
- Go, go, go!

689
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:22,852
<i>This is Sam.
Leave a message.</i>

690
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:25,848
Sam! Mr. Randall's here, okay?
He's in the building!

691
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:27,503
- Get out!
- Wait, wait, wait!

692
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,872
Wait, Sam, Sam, Sam.
I think you're good.

693
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:32,607
He can't get in without his keycard.

694
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:33,323
You are golden.

695
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:34,448
I repeat: you're golden.

696
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:48,707
Call him back.

697
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:52,946
Speed dial.
Speed dial!

698
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:06,490
- Nina?
- Baby?

699
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:10,776
Dad?

700
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,733
- Nina!
- Baby!

701
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,412
I was so afraid you guys weren't coming!

702
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,704
Where is my dad?

703
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,155
He had to stay behind.

704
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,149
He had something important to do but...
he told me to give this to you.

705
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:40,404
It's blank.
What is it?

706
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:41,528
What?!

707
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:45,881
** makes sense. This--
This had writing on it when he gave it to me.

708
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:49,764
Who's that?

709
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:53,557
Hello?

710
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:54,963
What?!

711
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:56,958
Damn it!

712
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:59,268
That's Mr. Randall in the elevator shaft.

713
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,311
We gotta get out of here.

714
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,149
- We're all gonna die!
- Listen, you flew with Ben before.

715
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,522
You think you can
carry the both of us?

716
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:07,099
- I don't know. I could try.
- You're gonna have to--

717
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:08,563
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go!

718
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,372
Wow!

719
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:33,368
This is the 75th floor!

720
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:38,829
Oh, hey.

721
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,182
I'm just gonna go back.

722
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,369
You ready to meet your dream girl?

723
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:54,822
Absolutely.

724
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:56,893
What!

725
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,778
Wh-- What is this?

726
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,556
You didn't change. You didn't
turn into my dream woman.

727
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:06,066
- Yeah, I never was gonna do that.
- What?! You-- you said that--

728
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,991
I lied.

729
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:08,328
Yeah, ***.

730
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:09,950
But, uh... I wanted to teach
you a lesson and uh...

731
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,742
Judging by the look on your face
right now... message received.

732
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,020
Wow, we!

733
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:19,810
I-- honestly I had no idea
that you were this cruel.

734
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:21,156
Cruel?

735
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:22,680
You're kidding me?
You're a pig!

736
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,850
*** a pig!

737
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,114
You're being sadistic!

738
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:26,864
Yeah! I tried to be
honest with you, right?

739
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:29,111
I tried to tell you, that I simply
wasn't attracted to you.

740
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:30,870
But that wasn't good enough
for you, right?

741
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,304
And now... you have the *** plan,

742
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:34,775
to come here and punish me!

743
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:38,188
All right, all right?
I'm sorry.

744
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:42,075
I don't know, maybe I was projecting
my insecurities on to you.

745
00:39:44,692 --> 00:39:45,737
Yeah, I get that.

746
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,512
You know, it may not look like it
from where you're standing, but...

747
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,225
I definitely *** with
my share of insecurities.

748
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:57,718
You're not the only one who
gets judged for the way they look.

749
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:00,152
- I didn't realize that.
- Well...

750
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:06,001
Hey... I have an idea.

751
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,599
To help us get out of this situation.

752
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:09,827
- I'm listening.
- Okay, now... what if...

753
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:11,232
And this is just top--
top of my head.

754
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:15,253
What if... you go ahead
and turn into my dream woman...

755
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:17,939
And then I... will feel
better about myself

756
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:19,294
for having dated her...

757
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,354
And you won't have
any insecurities left

758
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,255
because I would be all over her.

759
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:26,780
A.k.a... the better looking
version of you.

760
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,195
You...

761
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:33,099
You are an idiot.

762
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:33,800
Oh, that...

763
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:35,952
Listen... can I have my collage back?

764
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,491
You know... I tried everything.
I got it wet...

765
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:43,552
I put lemon juice on it...

766
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,547
If there's anything written
on this paper, I can't find it.

767
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:48,758
Did Sam's dad say anything else?

768
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,716
All he said was that this
is the way to get the Devil

769
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,331
in the competition with Sam.

770
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:54,272
I'm so happy your home...

771
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,265
Even though you smell like ***.

772
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,866
Yo, Nina.
Childhood memories... right?

773
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:02,629
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so stupid!

774
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:04,528
- Here, give me that.
- No!

775
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:06,000
Wait. Wait.
Just watch it.

776
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,099
- See?
- Oh, my god. Look at that!

777
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:10,565
What does it mean?

778
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:15,199
I don't know.
It's an ancient demon text.

779
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,325
It's way before my time.

780
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:19,853
We get this translated...

781
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,985
Sam gets out of his
deal with the Devil.

782
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,282
- All right!
- All right! Yeah!

783
