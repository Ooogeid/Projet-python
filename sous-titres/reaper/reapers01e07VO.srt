1
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:03,227
Damn.

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,172
We look good.

3
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:08,535
- I'm thinkin' about touchin' myself.
- Not in my car, please.

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,644
That's weird.
Change the channel.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,789
Este sale a Maria de Jose,
Radar Love.

6
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,750
Man... What?

7
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:23,814
I the devil's trying
to talk to you,

8
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,237
tellin' you it's
time to go to work.

9
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,060
Nah. Uh-uh. No, not tonight.

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,540
Tonight is special.
We are gettin' Sam laid tonight.

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,776
- Sock, I don't--
- Sam,

12
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,565
I don't wanna hear a word from you,
all right?

13
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:34,167
One word about Andi,
and you are catchin'

14
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:35,703
the headbuttin' of your life.

15
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,461
You and Andi are
tryin' to be friends,

16
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,741
so that means you are
officially back in business

17
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,822
with all other ladies
starting right now.

18
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:44,751
We are planting your flag at
Iwo Jima tonight, my friend.

19
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:18,381
It's so hard to meet women.

20
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:21,092
Well,

21
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:24,160
you 2 crybaby bitches may have
decided to bail on tonight,

22
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,111
but I am not giving up,
all right?

23
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:29,000
Here we go.

24
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:32,323
Just gotta jump-start the action
a little, know what I mean?

25
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:34,370
Watch and learn, boys.

26
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:43,620
Oh, no.

27
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:48,892
Oh, god.

28
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:54,420
Oh. Hello.

29
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,970
At least he has one--

30
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:04,213
Look at this.

31
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,213
Yeah, good thing
I sat down, right?

32
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,231
You guys are multiplying.

33
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:12,361
Bert Wysocki.

34
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:14,882
Booties on the floor.
Booties on the floor.

35
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:17,771
Oh, I hurt my knee,
but that's ok.

36
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,742
Smells like beer. You ever notice
how beer smells like beer?

37
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:23,633
Best bachelorette party ever!

38
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,023
Having such a blast,
hey, Nicole?

39
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:31,103
We are sending
you out in style!

40
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:34,170
I think we'll be sending
Nicole out in a body bag.

41
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:42,651
They are laughing at anything.
We are so in.

42
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:05,701
I've had, like,
7 long island iced teas.

43
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,133
I was gonna say it
tasted like a cosmo.

44
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:09,360
I'm Taylor.

45
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,323
Sam.

46
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,280
- Come on.
- Shots. Shots.

47
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:15,891
More drinks for you.

48
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,550
- This is my number.
- Ok.

49
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:24,491
- Better call me.
- Yeah. Yeah, ok. Yeah.

50
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,523
You want me to-- right. Ok.

51
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:29,470
- Give me yours, too.
- There you go.

52
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,621
- Aw, don't worry, ma'am.
- Yes.

53
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,892
Guys, it is not a bachelorette
party without a stripper.

54
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:40,343
Oh, my god.

55
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,050
Sock, mm-hmm,
you wanna be our stripper?

56
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,381
- Uh, no. No. No.
- Come on!

57
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:49,981
Come on.
You're the funny dancing guy.

58
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:51,892
- Dance!
- You know,

59
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:54,530
I am not your monkey!
I'm not your monkey, ok?

60
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,281
Jeez.

61
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:02,851
- Ben, Benny, wanna be our stripper?
- Not for free.

62
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,753
I could lose my union card.

63
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,421
But, uh,
my buddy Sam here's a hell of a dancer.

64
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:10,282
No. No! I--I can't--

65
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:11,261
- Yeah.
- Yes.

66
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:18,480
Sam! Sam! Sam!

67
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,920
I can't. I--I, uh--

68
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,332
I have a trick knee.

69
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,022
Really. It doesn't...

70
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:38,173
It's just so hard
to meet women.

71
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:50,583
Season 1, Episode 7
Love, Bullets and Blacktop

72
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:00,412
Well, let's see what
the Prince of Darkness

73
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,583
has for us this time.

74
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:05,893
8-track?

75
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:07,611
So, uh,

76
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,441
what are you gonna do about that
Taylor chick, Sammy? She was hot.

77
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,920
Ah, she's not really my type.

78
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:14,002
- What's with the vessel?
- Your type?

79
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,870
Is she a girl? Ding.

80
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,901
What else do you need to know?
Come on.

81
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,511
We just--we don't have
anything in common.

82
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:21,603
Who cares?

83
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:22,850
You're not gonna
marry the girl, Sam.

84
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,341
You gotta get all this
relationship garbage

85
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,873
out of your head,
I'm telling you.

86
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:27,623
All right.
Sock, shut up. Vessel?

87
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:30,171
Soundtrack to a movie called Love,
Bullets & Blacktop.

88
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,883
Never heard of it.

89
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,420
Let me guess.
One of the songs is Radar Love.

90
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:35,932
Track number one.

91
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,091
All right,
so I keep hearing that song,

92
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:40,991
and the vessel is
an obsolete tape.

93
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:42,533
This gives me nothing.

94
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,640
Well, maybe the
answer's in the tunes.

95
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,431
You think that still plays?

96
00:05:57,536 --> 00:05:58,582
What's that?

97
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:00,891
Ah, cool. An 8-track.

98
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,872
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it.

99
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,973
Yeah, my dad had a
million of these.

100
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,413
Any good songs on here?

101
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,721
Ah, just old seventies stuff.

102
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,680
Right. And you thought
that you could actually

103
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,612
play it in one of
the systems we sell?

104
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,603
Right. Yeah, I realized...

105
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,392
Actually, you know what?
I think my mom

106
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,872
might have my dad's old player.

107
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:20,483
Why don't you just
come over and use it?

108
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:22,103
Yeah. That--
that would be great.

109
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,161
- Ok.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:24,820
Hold--Hello. Sam?

111
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,372
- Yes. Hey.
- Know who this is?

112
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,932
I d--I do, yeah.

113
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:31,732
-It's--it's Taylor.
- Taylor?

114
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,553
- Had fun last night.
- It was nice.

115
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:35,221
- Who's Taylor?
- So call me.

116
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,861
Ok. Yeah, I--
I'll give you a call.

117
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,412
- Still have my number?
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,291
Great.

119
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,702
By the way,
are your lips still lonely?

120
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,902
Uh, my lips are
currently not lonely, ok?

121
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,911
I--I gotta go. All right. Bye.

122
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,182
That was my dentist.

123
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,100
Oh, Dr. Taylor?

124
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:52,923
Sam, come on.

125
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:54,502
I mean, I heard her voice.

126
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,511
Did you meet a girl?

127
00:06:58,088 --> 00:06:59,782
We were talking
about something else.

128
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:02,213
You want--you wanted a coffee, right?
You want--

129
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,833
Let me get you a coffee. Ok.

130
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:05,693
Ok. 2 sugars.

131
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,310
Dr. Taylor? Seriously?

132
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,131
You're such an idiot.

133
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,420
I mean, come on.

134
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,123
What the hell is goin' on?

135
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,041
Train wreck.

136
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:57,293
- So, Taylor. Spill.
- Oh, my god.

137
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,163
Yeah, it's awful, isn't it?

138
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,000
This is what happens
when you play chicken

139
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,181
with a train.
The train's never gonna flinch.

140
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,202
- I don't understand.
- Well, come on over here.

141
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,523
See this?

142
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,692
That used to be a
mint-condition '73 GTO.

143
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,350
Stolen earlier tonight.

144
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:13,146
What a waste.

145
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,135
What about the driver?

146
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,117
Oh, driver and the passenger,

147
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,482
they just walked
away... unscathed.

148
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,652
That's been happening
a lot recently.

149
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:24,111
- They're both souls?
- That's right.

150
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:25,972
Kit and Holly.

151
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,412
2 for the price of one.

152
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,870
I really think you have your
work cut out for you this time,

153
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:33,411
but I have every confidence
that you'll seal the deal.

154
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:36,671
Which reminds me... Taylor.

155
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,742
I'm not talking
about that with you.

156
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:41,041
I was able to obtain
some information

157
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:44,742
on one of her many, many,
many erogenous zones.

158
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:49,350
Just stroke her earlobe,
and she'll do anything.

159
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:50,940
Anything.

160
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:54,882
There is something
really wrong with you.

161
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:56,320
What?

162
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:57,873
Encouraging a young man

163
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,652
to succumb to his primal and
perfectly tural instincts?

164
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:04,041
Sharing the fact that Taylor's
in her experimental phase?

165
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:05,973
- Is that bad?
- Ok, ok, stop. Stop.

166
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,472
All right, stop.

167
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:09,781
Just don't make
her wait too long.

168
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,713
She'll be out of your life...

169
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,910
Like a forgotten song.

170
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,512
<i>Radar Love.</i>

171
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,090
What is the deal
with this song?

172
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:39,961
Right behind you, sir.

173
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:41,400
You got it?

174
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,432
Any luck on finding
a copy of the movie

175
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,453
- that goes with that soundtrack?
- Wasn't easy.

176
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:46,111
That thing--

177
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,320
That thing's been out
of print for years,

178
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,393
but I--I found a used one online,
so it'll be here tomorrow.

179
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:53,843
Good. Good.
Hope it gives us some sort of clue.

180
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:57,110
Yeah. Love, Bullets & Blacktop.
It's a fine title.

181
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,523
Boobs, Bullets & Blacktop
would be better.

182
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,582
You know, the whole repeatin'
the Bs thing, that's classy.

183
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:05,541
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where's the guy?

184
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,291
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

185
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,982
Put it down. Put it down.

186
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,012
Ok, I'm sorry.

187
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:19,491
He'll find it.

188
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,733
Here! Here! Here!

189
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,433
<i>I'm here at the scene
of a gruesome crash</i>

190
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,792
<i>which is the result of what
many witnesses are calling</i>

191
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,572
<i>a terrifying
chain of events.</i>

192
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,722
<i>It all started as a
routine traffic stop</i>

193
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,753
<i>when the car behind me
refused to pull over,</i>

194
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,512
<i>leading police on
a 10-mile chase</i>

195
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:39,363
<i>at speeds of 90
miles per hour.</i>

196
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:41,011
<i>The stolen vehicle
finally crashed here,</i>

197
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,510
<i>killing 2 pedestrians.</i>

198
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,350
<i>The driver and passenger
of the wrecked vehicle</i>

199
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:46,051
<i>remain at large.</i>

200
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:50,133
<i>Authorities are not yet releasing
the names of the victims.</i>

201
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:52,342
<i>I'm told that one of the
victims was pronounced dead</i>

202
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,050
<i>at the scene and
the other...</i>

203
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,091
- Check this out.
- What?

204
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:57,521
Remind you of anything?

205
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,881
<i>If you have any information
related to the crash...</i>

206
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,711
- Both blue muscle cars.
- What does that mean?

207
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:05,640
Don't know.
Do we know any experts on old cars?

208
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:07,513
Well, there's always Russ.

209
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,252
Welcome to the Work Bench.

210
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:12,701
Welcome to the Work Bench.

211
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,272
Welcome to the Work Bench.

212
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,800
Aw, do we have to talk to Russ?

213
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:25,061
- Guy gives me the skeevs.
- Yes. Yes, we do.

214
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,372
But remember,
we're all business.

215
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:27,973
You show any signs of
friendship to Russ,

216
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:29,422
and it's like
feeding a raccoon.

217
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,171
- We'll never get rid of him.
- Ah, you hear that, Ben?

218
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,651
- Oh, wh--
- No, listen to me.

219
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:33,980
None of this, you name's Ben.

220
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,953
I like everybody.
Let's be blood brothers, ok?

221
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,543
I do not want to hang
out with this guy.

222
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,082
He's extra-strength douche.

223
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,760
Hey, Russell, nice to see ya.

224
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:45,272
There is some fine-ass
tail in the Bench today.

225
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,550
Yeah. Yeah. There--
Yeah, there is.

226
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,711
Um, Russ,
we have a question for you.

227
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,183
Shoot.

228
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,122
- Do you know what kind of car that is?
- '71 malibu.

229
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:55,792
Solid muscle car.

230
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:58,163
- Ladies.
- Russ. Russ!

231
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,180
Do you--do you know anything
else about this type of car?

232
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:03,673
I know everything else
about that type of ride.

233
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:07,012
You know,
I've been keeping my eye on you three,

234
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,003
can tell you like to party...

235
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:11,812
Have fun.

236
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,943
Yeah, fun's ok.

237
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:18,210
- Wanna see somethin' cool?
- Sure.

238
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:29,860
This here is my girl Mandy.

239
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:32,632
See, she's kinda like the
one on your 8-track there,

240
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,423
only a little more excellent.

241
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,381
Um, so, let's say you were in
the market for a car like this.

242
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:43,530
Is there a special dealership
you might go to or...

243
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,441
Oh, you thinkin'
of buyin', Sam?

244
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:49,340
You'd look pretty hot behind
the wheel of a '69 Daytona.

245
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,253
Ok, ok, Russ.

246
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:55,723
I know this little,
uh, car club.

247
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,023
Bunch of collectors get together
down at a lot in Chinatown,

248
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,632
show off their rides.

249
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:02,720
Maybe you could find
a seller there.

250
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,670
You know--heh. Heh.

251
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,573
What we could do,

252
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,672
we could score some vodka,

253
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:11,301
you know, go down there,
the four of us,

254
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:13,070
make an afternoon of it.

255
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:15,301
Yeah. Yeah,
that sounds like something

256
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,423
someone might do. Heh.

257
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,550
But I am pulling a double
shift this afternoon.

258
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,212
Well, what can I say?

259
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:25,312
The ladies don't
pay for themselves,

260
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,273
you know what I'm sayin'?

261
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:31,473
Well, let me give you
the address anyway.

262
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:33,583
It's down on Keifer.

263
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,613
And listen...

264
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,570
The four of us, we gotta hang.

265
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:43,463
Tomorrow, my place.
We start with poker...

266
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,072
And let it rip.

267
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,310
And that's great,
'cause I love poker.

268
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,883
We can't make it.

269
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,043
Oh. Well...

270
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:54,670
Rain check then.

271
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:56,543
Well, work calls.

272
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:02,810
See you later, Russ.

273
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:05,040
All right,
we gotta go to this car club.

274
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,021
I'm sorry I punched
you in the balls, man.

275
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,633
Oh, my god.

276
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,873
- This is just sad.
- What?!

277
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:15,560
Look, I promise
you both right now,

278
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,680
no matter how old I get,
I'll never make you hang out

279
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:19,531
in a vacant lot and
drool over my car.

280
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,393
Yeah, well,
you need to owe one first.

281
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,470
You know what?
I don't even want one now.

282
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:28,533
So how do we find 'em?

283
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,623
Let's see if we can
get their attention.

284
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,263
Ok.

285
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,282
- Here we go.
- Ok.

286
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:41,471
Radar Love, baby.

287
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:47,722
How you doin'?

288
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:50,963
Sam.

289
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:59,451
Sam, how are you doin' this?

290
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,243
Song has power, I guess.

291
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,330
Hey, man, I hate that song.

292
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,732
You got free bird?

293
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:13,801
Oh. S-Sam, they're leavin'.
They're leaving!

294
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:15,380
Uh, Ben, get the car! Get the--

295
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,380
They're headed for
the parking garage.

296
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,261
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Come on!

297
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,303
We can trap 'em on the roof!

298
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,503
Oh, god. Ok.

299
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:39,130
There! There!

300
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:46,600
Oh, holy--

301
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:49,333
Come on. Come on.
Where are you guys?

302
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,283
Have a nice day.

303
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,781
- Hi.
- Hi.

304
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,670
Does Sam Oliver work here?

305
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,922
Uh, yeah, he does,

306
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,040
but he has not come
in for his shift yet.

307
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,723
Oh. Ok. Uh...

308
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,781
Do me a favor.
Tell him Taylor stopped by.

309
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,120
- You're Taylor?
- Yep.

310
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:01,043
Why? Did he mention me?

311
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:02,862
Um. Yeah, actually. He did.

312
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:06,922
- So, Sam, what's he like?
- Um, he's great.

313
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:09,822
I mean, we've just--
we've been friends for a very long time.

314
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:13,031
- He is single, right?
- Huh? Oh, uh, yeah.

315
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,132
'Cause you don't know.
Guys you meet in bars,

316
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:17,493
they'll say anything
to get in your pants.

317
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,861
Yeah. Well,
actually Sam's not like that at all.

318
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,031
Hmm. Too bad.

319
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:28,020
Anyways, tell him
to call me, ok?

320
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:29,972
Thanks, "Andi."

321
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:36,173
Where are you goin'?

322
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,560
I got a plan. Don't worry.

323
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,621
All right,
check this out. Look.

324
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,123
- You're selling Russ' car?
- Exactly.

325
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:08,471
See, the souls are always
crashing cars just like this one.

326
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,173
Since we scared 'em
away from the car club,

327
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,253
- guess who needs a new one.
- Precisely.

328
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:13,881
So we set the trap.

329
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,371
We post the car on all
the muscle car sites.

330
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,890
Hopefully the souls see it,
and they come knockin'.

331
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:21,100
And then we send their little
asses right back to Hades.

332
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,331
All right, I like it.
I like it.

333
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,771
The only thing is the other
cars they wrecked were blue.

334
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,363
Sure they're gonna go
after an orange car?

335
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,622
Oh, my god.

336
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,551
You know,
we didn't think about that.

337
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:33,483
- Bam.
- Nice.

338
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:35,770
Hope this works.

339
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,813
So your dentist stopped by.

340
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:40,971
Dr. Taylor.

341
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,210
Dr. Tay--oh, Taylor was here?

342
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,273
What, at the Bench?
Was she shopping?

343
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:46,821
Oh, she was in the
market for somethin'.

344
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,111
Come on. Really?

345
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:50,590
I only said, like,
3 sentences to her at the bar.

346
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,383
Well, yeah,
apparently you made them count.

347
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,402
W-wait. Did she say
what she wanted?

348
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,460
Yeah. She said you
should call her.

349
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:58,761
Really?

350
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:00,672
Yeah. You gonna call her?

351
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:02,282
I--I don't know. Maybe.

352
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:04,901
I--she's a little... different.

353
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,862
What do you think?

354
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:09,003
I--I think she's
really attractive.

355
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:10,300
You should call her.

356
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,560
I'll think about it.

357
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,832
Maybe I should call her.

358
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:31,680
A church?

359
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,832
Isn't this a little
too close for comfort?

360
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:39,152
Nah. Me and the big guy
have an understanding.

361
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,321
I stay out of his house.

362
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,570
He lets me play with his toys.

363
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,942
All right, well, if you're here
to harass me about the souls,

364
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,071
I'm all over it.
I'll send a trap and have 'em both.

365
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,661
No, no harassing.
I have faith in you.

366
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:52,193
I have to admit, though,
I admire Kit and Holly.

367
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,832
The world's a whole lot
more fun with them in it.

368
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,422
It's the purity of their spirit

369
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:00,071
that I admire and respect.
They live in the moment.

370
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,422
The thrill of being
caught or killed,

371
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,870
that's their aphrodisiac.

372
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,722
- 2 psychos in love.
- Love?

373
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:12,463
There's no such thing.

374
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:15,271
I'm talking about
real passion, lust.

375
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,723
You don't think love is real?

376
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:19,721
The french invented love

377
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:23,130
so they could put a civilized
face on a primal urge.

378
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:25,723
Dress it up with
candy and hearts

379
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,783
and cubic zirconia,
and in the end

380
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:31,382
it all comes down to
endorphins and genitalia.

381
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:43,081
So if you don't believe in love,
why are you showing me a wedding?

382
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,230
The breathless bridegroom there

383
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,941
banged the maid of
honor last night.

384
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:51,261
- I give the marriage 6 months.
- Why are you telling me this?

385
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,263
Because I care.
I want you to be happy.

386
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:56,520
Give in to your urges
once in a while.

387
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:58,050
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

388
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,052
A night of pleasure?

389
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:02,792
I'd take that over
unrequited longing anytime.

390
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,301
Ah, whatever.

391
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,952
Don't forget. Earlobe.

392
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,703
- Heh heh. Sam?
- Taylor!

393
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:24,223
Wow. Uh...

394
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,413
You look amazing.

395
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,362
What are you doing here?

396
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:31,891
Oh. Uh, right.

397
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,172
I was--I was in
the neighborhood.

398
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:36,293
You work, like, 2 miles away.

399
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:39,262
Right. I--yeah,
I was--I had a delivery.

400
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,881
Look, you know,
you didn't call,

401
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,772
so I just figured
you weren't into me,

402
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:44,502
and that's fine.

403
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,532
But if you're here
to jerk me around,

404
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,251
I'm not really interested.

405
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,401
No, no, I--I promise that's--

406
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:55,131
- that's not why I'm here.
- Then why are you?

407
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,780
I don't really know.

408
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:02,492
Ok.

409
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:04,831
You're strange.

410
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:07,142
Yes. Yes, I am.

411
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:10,670
Uh, well,
I should catch up with--

412
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,172
Right. Yes.

413
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,453
Taylor...

414
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:22,092
You wanna maybe get a drink?

415
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,073
Tomorrow night, same place.

416
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:27,160
Yeah. Cool.

417
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:33,322
All right.

418
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:41,013
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Kit and Holly called.

419
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:42,833
- They're on their way.
- Come on.

420
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:47,880
All right,
the code word is "jambalaya."

421
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:50,641
I don't like that word.

422
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,333
I don't care if
you like it, Ben.

423
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:54,032
Decision has been made, ok?

424
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:56,413
You stall 'em.
I say "jambalaya."

425
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:58,172
Sam hops out from
behind the van

426
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:00,880
and sucks them into the 8-track,
and that's it.

427
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,230
This plan is starting
to feel stupid.

428
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:03,932
Learn to love it. They're here.

429
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:08,383
All right, let's do it.

430
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:17,460
What's happening?

431
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:20,640
They're just starin' at us.
Super creepy.

432
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,111
Hang tight, baby.

433
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,953
Only the dude is getting out.

434
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:35,651
- Well, you gotta get 'em both over here.
- I know.

435
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:37,331
What's up, man? How you doin'?

436
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,743
- Howdy.
- Like I advertised,

437
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,830
1970 mustang mach 1, mint.

438
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,213
What I neglected to
add on the website--

439
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:47,691
Yeah. In the picture,
it was blue.

440
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,512
Yeah, we had it repainted.

441
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:52,630
Yeah, well,
we don't want it orange.

442
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,470
Well, it's a good thing
we're at the Work Bench,

443
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:56,352
'cause we got all
types of paint,

444
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,972
whatever you want.
Uh, cyan, azure--

445
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,653
You name it, we got it.

446
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:02,503
That--that's a beautiful
color for this car.

447
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:05,333
- This car, yeah.
- Let me see the inside.

448
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:06,881
The inside. Yes.

449
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,092
You are a man of
discriminating taste.

450
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,710
I can tell by your 4 buttons
undone on your shirt.

451
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:15,122
So it's got, uh,
carpet both sides, which is good.

452
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:20,210
A steering wheel, dials,
speedometer and o-odometer.

453
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:23,612
- Uh, neoprene seats, I believe.
- Give me the keys.

454
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,513
Hey, why don't you
go get your lady?

455
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:29,143
Get her to come take a closer look.
See if she likes it, all right?

456
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,221
That's a good I--Let
me go get her, and--

457
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,390
Why don't you give me the keys?

458
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,420
I want to get inside
the car. Now.

459
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:42,493
I--I don't have--Ben,
do you have the keys?

460
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:45,320
- Uh, wh-what about price first?
- Price, yes.

461
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:48,603
You know what? Get your gal.
We will talk dollars and cents.

462
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:51,180
- Why are you so interested in my woman?
- J-jambalaya?

463
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:52,581
- Jambalaya!
- J-jambalaya!

464
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,152
- It's a trap!
- Jambalaya!

465
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,962
- Come on!
- Sam, go!

466
00:24:56,796 --> 00:25:01,341
Get him! Go! It's a trap!

467
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,992
Go! Get him, Sam!
Get him! Get him!

468
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,200
- Kit!
- See you at midnight!

469
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,622
Go get her! Get her! Come on!

470
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,852
Get her! Get her!
She's gettin' away.

471
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:19,843
Sam, Sam, Sam, get her!
Get her!

472
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:25,711
Oh, that was close.

473
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,580
Oh, weird. It feels hot.

474
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:33,652
Can souls break out of vessels,
do you think?

475
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:35,630
I don't know.
Never happened before.

476
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,263
Kit said he was gonna try
to meet Holly at midnight.

477
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:40,723
You don't think she's gonna
come after us, do you?

478
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,443
God, I hope not.
She scares the hell out of me.

479
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:44,870
Well, all women scare
the hell out of you.

480
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:47,573
Hence your lack of action
with that Taylor chick, hmm?

481
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,003
Hey, I made a date with Taylor,
thank you very much.

482
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:51,693
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:54,013
You know,
the devil can see her fantasies.

484
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,291
Makes her sound like
some kind of sex maniac.

485
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:58,563
Insider trading tips
from the Dark Lord.

486
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:02,493
- I so want your life.
- Hey, movie arrived.

487
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,860
Love, Bullets & Blacktop.

488
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,260
Great. Question is will
this help us find Holly?

489
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,263
The other question is does this
movie have any nudity in it.

490
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:12,800
Is that beta?

491
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:18,022
Where the hell are we
gonna find betamax?

492
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:23,003
Welcome to the wall of sound.

493
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:24,592
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

494
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,573
Oh, wow.

495
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,423
This stuff, uh,

496
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,320
takes up a lot of space
in your living room, huh?

497
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,863
It certainly does!

498
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:42,931
Pro logic quad amp,

499
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:45,280
sweet ribbon tweeter,

500
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:49,773
and a dual-18 subwoofer
that'll blow a chick's panties

501
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,431
- clean off.
- Whuhh.

502
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:55,130
You ever seen anything like it?

503
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:56,881
Definitely a first.

504
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,102
Hey, Russ,
you have a machine that might play beta?

505
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:04,320
Beta? Absolutely.

506
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:07,240
Here you go.

507
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:11,443
You know,
I am so pumped that you guy--

508
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,112
Sit down. Sit down.

509
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:17,612
You guys decided to come
and party with the Russ man.

510
00:27:18,457 --> 00:27:25,363
We are gonna get a little
crazy up here tonight.

511
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,840
- Look out.
- Space, space.

512
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,452
- Aw, thanks. Yeah.
- Oh! That's my shoulder.

513
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:33,981
All right.

514
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,992
- Wait a minute.
- That's real impressive.

515
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:49,080
What kind of a host
do I think I am?

516
00:27:49,387 --> 00:27:50,883
We can't just watch the movie.

517
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,122
We need to get high first!

518
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:55,421
Who wants to rip some peyote?

519
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:59,850
Uh. Russ, you know,
tonight's not a good peyote night.

520
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,320
Oh, no, no, no. No.

521
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:05,282
Peyote, man,
it makes a great platform, and then

522
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:11,643
we customize with a well-chosen
assortment of party enhancers.

523
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:13,732
We've got angel tears,

524
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:16,693
horse tranks, jelly babies,

525
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,180
muskies, happy flakes.

526
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,560
- Happy flakes?
- Poppers?

527
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:24,040
You know, Russ,
I was gonna pass.

528
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:26,503
Yeah, you know,
I took a--I took horse trank

529
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,773
on the way over here,
so I'm, uh, good.

530
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:31,692
Guys, you said that you
came over to party, right?

531
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,663
- Of course.
- Well, ok, then. Come on.

532
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:37,470
I mean, I don't wanna--
I don't wanna be watching this movie

533
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:41,100
until we're, like,
rolling 4 deep, ok?

534
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:45,542
Did Holly follow us?

535
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,180
You...

536
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,601
Where's Kit?

537
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:04,721
I--I don't--
I don't know where he is. I--

538
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:07,581
Where is the 8-track?!
Give it to me now!

539
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:14,781
It's right here.

540
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:38,821
That bitch is crazy.

541
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:40,893
Oh. Russ.

542
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:42,690
Russ.

543
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:44,491
Russ, are you all right?

544
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:49,423
- Are you--are...
- Flush the drugs.

545
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:56,133
- So what's the word on Russ?
- Oh, he's fine.

546
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,943
He's all zonked out on
heavy meds in the hospital,

547
00:29:57,975 --> 00:29:59,370
gettin' sponge baths.

548
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:00,932
It's kind of his dream scenario,
you know?

549
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,071
Good. He won't miss this.

550
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:03,940
Cover me on the floor so
I can hook this thing up

551
00:30:03,978 --> 00:30:05,390
and we can watch the movie.

552
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:08,970
This way.

553
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:16,253
Oh, this is the soundtrack you
were listening to the other day.

554
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,891
What's with your obsession?

555
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:19,171
I--

556
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,882
Well, you shouldn't have
to watch this out here

557
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,720
with all these
miserable customers.

558
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,672
Uh, you know, not you, sir.

559
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:27,412
Follow me.

560
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:36,391
- Just hold this.
- Where are you taking me?

561
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:44,373
Oh, wow. You made all this?

562
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:46,491
Yep. My Ted-free zone.

563
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:49,540
Well, until he finds it and
I have to build a new one.

564
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:52,242
- This is great.
- I know. Here.

565
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,212
Oh. Thanks.

566
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,713
- Beverage?
- Movie's started.

567
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:02,232
Yeah, hit me.

568
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:09,553
- I got it covered.
- I guess so.

569
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:18,993
<i>Open the register.</i>

570
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:22,321
<i>Don't make me do something
we'll both regret.</i>

571
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:25,551
<i>My life is full
of regrets.</i>

572
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:27,721
<i>Your mama know what
you're up to?</i>

573
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,752
<i>Your mama know what
you're up to?</i>

574
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:33,021
- Yeah, this is genius.
- Yeah.

575
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:35,191
<i>Will you give me
what I want?</i>

576
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:36,892
<i>I just might.</i>

577
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:50,262
Did you see that?

578
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:51,740
That--that's not
even the same car.

579
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,461
I know.
I was just gonna say the same thing.

580
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,901
Ok, you'd think they'd get
the color of the car right.

581
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:57,230
<i>I'm gonna lose 'em.</i>

582
00:31:57,378 --> 00:31:59,022
<i>- You watch me.
- Hang on.</i>

583
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,803
- Catch.
- No.

584
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,903
- Upp. You missed. Catch.
- Stop it right now.

585
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:04,162
Serious. Get serious.

586
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:05,821
- What?
- Whoops.

587
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:12,623
<i>Help.</i>

588
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:15,782
<i>I'm scared, Kit.</i>

589
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:17,953
<i>Every cop in the
county's after us.</i>

590
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:19,583
<i>What if we
get separated?</i>

591
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:21,243
<i>We meet back here, baby.</i>

592
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,230
<i>This'll always
be our place.</i>

593
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:25,563
<i>Ok.</i>

594
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:34,841
Midnight.

595
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:47,612
Kit said it right
before we captured him.

596
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:49,902
Yep. "Meet me at midnight."

597
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:52,330
There's her car.

598
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:58,193
- You scared?
- Does it show?

599
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:00,062
You're kinda hurtin' my arm.

600
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,772
- Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
- Got some nails on you, man.

601
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,843
Sock, shut up. Shh.

602
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,463
- What?
- Got that--

603
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:26,401
Sam, do you see her?
You see anything?

604
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,160
No, I don't see anything.

605
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:42,062
How do I set Kit free?!
Tell me!

606
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,100
Hey, goldilocks!

607
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,243
Suck on that, sugar lips!

608
00:33:57,665 --> 00:33:59,322
Sam, where's the vessel?

609
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,522
- Sam, vessel.
- Oh, damn. I lost it. I--I--

610
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:06,852
Sock.

611
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,023
What do you think
she's gonna do

612
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:18,263
when she finds that she's
got the wrong 8-track?

613
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:19,562
Kill us.

614
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,732
Yeah, that sounds about right.

615
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:26,320
How does this work?!

616
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:28,441
How do I get him out of here?

617
00:34:29,747 --> 00:34:31,791
You're gonna tell me
how to get Kit back.

618
00:34:32,226 --> 00:34:33,861
Ah! O-ok. O--

619
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,013
Easy, easy, easy.

620
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:01,252
I think you see
where this is going.

621
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:05,690
You're gonna tell me
how to free my baby or--

622
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,980
Ok, look, if you kill us,
you'll never get him out.

623
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,042
Tell me how to set Kit free,

624
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:12,212
or I will torch
this whole place,

625
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,412
and there will only one be of
us getting out of here alive.

626
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,920
Which one of us?

627
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:18,891
Which--What? I didn't---

628
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:24,581
I like you. You're cool.

629
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:26,262
I like your shoes.

630
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:30,643
Listen, Holly,
y-you don't have to do this, ok?

631
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:32,483
L-let's talk, all right?

632
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,990
We can't let Kit out,
but I--I swear,

633
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:37,022
you let us free,
and we'll let you go.

634
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,343
We'll let you go.

635
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,971
You're gonna let me go?

636
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,141
Kit has to go back to hell,
but you,

637
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:49,960
you can start over.

638
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:51,952
All right,
you can find a new guy.

639
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,760
Oh, is that right?
Find a new guy?

640
00:35:54,795 --> 00:35:57,183
You think there's someone
like Kit out there,

641
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:00,950
all fire and
passion and danger?

642
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:03,591
Like you?

643
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,282
Are you a tough guy?

644
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:09,301
Do you like to get crazy?

645
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,771
Do you like to
play with danger?

646
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:17,433
- I dabble.
- Good.

647
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:19,791
Let's see how tough you are.

648
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,661
Look, no. L-let's not.

649
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,242
Let's--let's not
see how tough I--

650
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:24,561
I--I don't wanna see.

651
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:28,730
I--I been drivin' all night

652
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,800
my hand's wet on the wheel

653
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,031
Th-there's a voi--

654
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:39,110
voice in my head
that drives my heel

655
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:45,110
Said it's my baby callin',
and she needs me here

656
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:50,213
And it's a-half past 4:00,
and I'm shiftin' gears

657
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:57,172
We got a thing that
we call Radar Love

658
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,971
We got a light

659
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:00,611
That we shine

660
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:07,592
Sam! Sam!

661
00:37:13,526 --> 00:37:15,312
- Ohh! Sam.
- Sam!

662
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:42,982
We got a thing that
we call Radar Love

663
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:47,801
We got a light that
shines Radar Love

664
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:56,812
Um, there's Taylor.

665
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:00,272
You guys can disappear.

666
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,230
Cool. All right.

667
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:06,652
Go, mighty warlord.
Collect your spoils.

668
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,480
Let's not call her
spoils to her face.

669
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:09,802
Good luck, Sam.

670
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:19,473
So, is that your thing,
kissing random guys in bars?

671
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,712
- Screw you.
- Well...

672
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:28,372
No. I, uh...
thought you were cute.

673
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:32,482
Didn't look like the kind of
guy to make the first move.

674
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,332
Excuse me? I... make moves.

675
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,822
Come on, Sam Oliver.

676
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:39,912
You have to think
about everything.

677
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:42,540
Don't you ever want to just do
something totally spontaneous?

678
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:44,223
Something you knew
you shouldn't?

679
00:38:57,488 --> 00:38:59,092
What if somebody
opens the door?

680
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,822
Who cares, right?

681
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:03,250
You like it dangerous? Cool.

682
00:39:06,115 --> 00:39:09,191
Oh, Sam.
That totally drives me crazy.

683
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:10,830
How did you know?

684
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,871
Uh, look, uh...
This--this, uh--

685
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:20,681
This doesn't feel right.

686
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:23,181
Wait. What?

687
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:26,402
Sam, you pulled me
into the closet.

688
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:29,741
Yeah. No, I know.
I did. I j--uh...

689
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,942
This just--this isn't me.

690
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:33,650
Can we--

691
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:36,340
Can we just--can we
slow it down a little?

692
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,071
Sure.

693
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,751
You really are strange.

694
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,783
Yeah, yeah, I--

695
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,612
I couldn't agree more.

696
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:55,333
I'm sorry, Sammy.

697
00:39:56,216 --> 00:40:00,070
I never should have pushed that
whole Taylor thing on you.

698
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:03,550
I had no idea you
were a homosexual.

699
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:07,351
"We should just slow
it down a little"?

700
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:10,792
You hear that?

701
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,221
That's the sound of every man
in the world laughing at you.

702
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,313
So you came all the way
here just to bust on me?

703
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:19,091
Oh, quite the contrary.
I feel bad.

704
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,021
I really do.

705
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:23,793
I just wanted you
to get the girl

706
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:25,983
for once in your
miserable life.

707
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,083
Yeah, I really
appreciate your concern,

708
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:30,662
but maybe I'm just not sure
that that's the girl I want.

709
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:32,002
Right, right, right.

710
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,022
You're holding
out for true love.

711
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,743
I told you, Sam,
there is no such thing.

712
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:41,270
I couldn't figure out why you
kept throwing Taylor in my path.

713
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:43,772
It's not because you
really care about me.

714
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:47,550
- Hey! Untrue.
- It's because you're tempting me again.

715
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:49,973
You just want me to be more like you,
but I'm not.

716
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:51,711
I don't believe there's
no such thing as love.

717
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:54,392
And you know what?
I don't believe that you believe that.

718
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:57,231
Wow. You know,
celibacy really makes you insightful.

719
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:59,170
Come on.

720
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:01,233
You've been around
since the dawn of time.

721
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:03,302
Are you telling me you've
never been in love?

722
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,212
Well, personally,
I've always found lust

723
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:09,540
to be quite satisfying.

724
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:12,202
Yeah. You would.

725
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:45,260
