1
00:00:00,964 --> 00:00:02,114
Previously on Reaper...

2
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:06,239
Before you were born, your mom
and I sold your soul to the devil.

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,255
You signed a contract
with the devil, Sam.

4
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,502
- Forget about the contract.
- No, I want to see it.

5
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:13,333
What is it about you, Sammy?
You just can't say no.

6
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,260
Almost ready?

7
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,166
I just have to lock up but
I'll meet you guys there.

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:23,079
You're not going to chicken out,
are you?

9
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,293
- What?
- Karaoke performance anxiety.

10
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:28,600
No way. 4 beers deep,
I'll be rocking some Bohemian Rhapsody.

11
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,505
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,709
Ok, don't take forever, all right?
I'm not singing that by myself.

13
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:36,549
Ok, I won't. 10 minutes.

14
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:03,550
Hello?

15
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:22,862
Is anybody here?

16
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:46,373
Oh. Please, stay away from me.

17
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:54,040
Are you... Sam Oliver?

18
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:57,160
- Yeah.
- I got a contract for you.

19
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,200
What?

20
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:02,420
Contract for your soul.

21
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,541
Heh, that's...

22
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,700
Sign there. There.

23
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,503
Initial there.

24
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,353
This is gonna take hours.
Can it wait?

25
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:18,460
Of course not.
I just, uh, I had plans with a girl.

26
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:22,603
We're meeting for karaoke like,
right now. So...

27
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:26,731
Here's an idea-- come with.
The girls are gonna get really wasted,

28
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,521
they'd be all over
a guy in uniform.

29
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,402
I can help you out,
be your wing man.

30
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,730
Not--not to suggest
that you need any help.

31
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:35,173
You're a very attractive demon.

32
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:37,801
I'm--I'm not hitting on you.

33
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:40,512
I just...
I'm gonna shut up, I'm gonna sign.

34
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:43,362
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna sign right now.

35
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:46,953
Initial.

36
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,771
Initial.

37
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,510
Half-off jello shots.
Just sayin', just sayin'.

38
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:55,580
Date.

39
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,921
Oh!

40
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:19,881
What happened to
you last night?

41
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,612
Oh...

42
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:24,810
I had to sign documents
for like 3 hours.

43
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,412
Really?

44
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:28,452
A demon delivered a
copy of my contract.

45
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:30,321
Hey! That's good, right?

46
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,031
Got the copy of your contract,
now you can, uh...

47
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:35,933
I don't know.
What can you do with that?

48
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,333
I was hopin' I could find a way
out of workin' for the devil,

49
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,061
but I couldn't make heads or
tails of it. It was huge.

50
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:42,791
All legal and latin.

51
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:46,672
Oh! Oh, that had to hurt, huh?

52
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,912
I've never seen anybody hit
the floor that hard in my life.

53
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:54,323
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, is it slippery?

54
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,301
Might have been sucking on
your feet in your sleep.

55
00:03:58,335 --> 00:03:59,731
My little brother does that.

56
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:18,382
Whoa! Are you sure you didn't
tie one on last night, man?

57
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:21,041
- You're a wreck!
- Yeah, it's my stupid demon-sense.

58
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:23,790
Even with my shoes on,
it's like I'm walking on ice.

59
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,441
Can I get some
help here, please?

60
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:30,531
Yeah.

61
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,973
Yes, and fine day to you,
good sir.

62
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,643
So, uh,
what'd I miss last night?

63
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:49,321
Oh, dude, the bar was awesome,
we had a great time.

64
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,221
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:51,773
What happened?

66
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,853
Uh, nothing happened.
It was super boring. Sucked.

67
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,651
You just said it was awesome.

68
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,212
Yeah, I chose my words poorly, Sam.
Forget it.

69
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:02,203
- What happened at the bar?
- I can't tell you.

70
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,672
Look, Sock,
I'm gonna find out anyway,

71
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:08,482
so just tell me what the hell happened!
Just, um...

72
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:13,072
Oh, oh. Ok, do you really want to
know what you missed last night?

73
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,253
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

74
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:18,130
That. Greg.

75
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,710
We were all waiting there for you
at the bar for hours, by the way,

76
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:26,540
and then in walks Greg with his super
fancy hair and his pointy shoes,

77
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,581
and he starts buying
everybody drinks.

78
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,103
You let him buy you a drink?

79
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,390
I don't want you to think
about that right now, ok?

80
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,063
I want you to think
about Greg and Andi.

81
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:36,940
- Greg and Andi what?
- They were hanging out together...

82
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:42,202
on the couch, talking. And they
were there until after I went home.

83
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,252
Yeah. I know.
They outlasted even me.

84
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:48,460
All right, you don't need to
see that anymore. Don't look.

85
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:53,740
Look, you can't let that get you down,
all right?

86
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,841
You have devil business
to take care of.

87
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,633
I know, it's just Andi thinks I
blew her off. I look like a jerk.

88
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,512
A jerk with tape on his shoes.

89
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:04,000
All right, listen to me.
I'm not advocating violence here,

90
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:10,001
but if you need to, uh,
take care of Greg, I know some people.

91
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:13,733
Yeah, I know the devil.
I think my people trump your people.

92
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:15,862
Yeah, uh-huh.

93
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:18,452
That's good.

94
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:43,933
- What is Ted doing?
- I put a note on his windshield.

95
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,902
It says, "sorry,
I hit your car."

96
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,422
- You hit Ted's car?
- Nope.

97
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,190
- Who did?
- No one.

98
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,183
He's been looking for the
damage over 10 minutes now.

99
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,491
That's genius.

100
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,841
Yeah, I think Ted would
use a different word.

101
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:02,010
Hey, Ted.
What happened to your car?

102
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,883
- Do you see something?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,640
It's a little
crooked right there.

104
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,920
Yeah, I see it, too.
It's definitely crooked.

105
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,680
Damn it!
I'm calling this number.

106
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,902
- Who's number did you put?
- Regional manager's.

107
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,432
Nice.

108
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:17,653
So...

109
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,012
another no-show last night.
It's becomg a habit, Sam.

110
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:24,122
Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:27,391
Please, just tell me
what's going on with you.

112
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:31,482
- I just-- I had some stuff.
- Some stuff. What stuff?

113
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:38,111
Jogging, actually.
Uh, uh, late night jogging.

114
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,521
I'm getting in shape
for a triathlon.

115
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,241
Oh. Ok, Sam.
You know what, you don't have

116
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:47,453
to tell me anything about your
personal life. Just don't insult me.

117
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,612
- No, I'm not! I--
- You know what, my break's over.

118
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,793
I'll talk to you later.

119
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:55,790
Oh, you're the idiot that hit my car!
I want your name!

120
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,820
Yes, sir.

121
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:02,203
No, sir, I--
I am absolutely not drunk.

122
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,293
Thank you for your concern
about my mental health, sir.

123
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:11,283
Sam...

124
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:22,552
Sam...

125
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,290
Boo!

126
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,090
Always a good effect.

127
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,941
Low-tech, but awesome results.

128
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,181
I really...

129
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:45,260
don't care for you.

130
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,740
Oh, come on, Sammy.
Don't be like that.

131
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,472
Hey, how's that gal of yours, huh?
Everything ok there?

132
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,152
You know andi's not my "gal." I had
to bail on her again last night.

133
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,153
I'm sick of it.
She knows I'm lying to her.

134
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,803
Oh, I see.
And now she's seeking comfort elsewhere.

135
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:01,782
What's his name? Greg?

136
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,882
Well, we can deal with Greg when
the time comes. No problem.

137
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:09,452
No, let's not deal with Greg.
Let's... let's just do this.

138
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:11,562
Oh, sure.
You want to be all business?

139
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,041
- Yeah.
- We can be that way.

140
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,062
We'll be all business,
here you go.

141
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:24,062
Now this sweet-faced mother of two,
local activist. Some smile, huh?

142
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:27,283
- Let me guess-- she's dead?
- Yep. Slipped and fell.

143
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,380
Cracked her pretty
head open on a toilet.

144
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,695
In my opinion,
a very undignified way to go.

145
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:39,429
This bright-eyed, intrepid local
reporter took a header down a stairwell.

146
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:43,089
Snapped his spine clean
right at the neck.

147
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,251
Another accidental death,
according to the authorities.

148
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:50,601
A soul killed all these people.
Made it look like accidents.

149
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,960
- And more will die.
- Well, who are they?

150
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,782
And why are we down
here in the sewer?

151
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,822
Oh, come on. Fire up that
sleeping bean of yours, Sammy.

152
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:03,073
- I can't do all the work.
- I'm not asking for all the work.

153
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:05,450
I just--
I want a clue that's remotely helpful.

154
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:08,970
Fine. You want it easy?
I'll make it easy.

155
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,381
I'll point the way.

156
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:17,091
That's funny, hilarious!
You're a jokester!

157
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,041
Dick.

158
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,592
Whoa! Whoa, look out!

159
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:59,772
The guy controlled
the slime and crashed.

160
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:02,261
It was awful.
Guy didn't even have a chance.

161
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,021
And you said he was
a lawyer, right?

162
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,801
Yeah, Ed Fazio.
I've tried calling his office,

163
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:07,332
but I guess they shut
down after the news.

164
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:08,911
All right,
let's talk consistency here.

165
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:10,811
We're talking about a
dude made from slime.

166
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:13,601
What is it, snot-like?
Spit? Household slime, what?

167
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:15,443
Uh, household slime?

168
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:18,371
Come on, Ben, everybody knows what
household slime is. Give me a break.

169
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,571
Well, whatever it is,

170
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,671
there better be something bad-ass
in this box to help us catch it.

171
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:22,821
Uh-huh.

172
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,940
Oh, wow.

173
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:35,662
Did the devil give you that,
or my grandmother?

174
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:39,151
Yeah, maybe you wear that,
and the soul laughs itself back to hell.

175
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,392
Look, we have to back and
find this thing, all right?

176
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,031
Last time I saw it,
it was heading down into a sewer grate.

177
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,971
No. Not going down into the sewer.
I just bought these pants.

178
00:12:48,196 --> 00:12:51,541
Look, the sewer's all we got,
so suck it up, you guys, we're going.

179
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:53,971
Dad.

180
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,780
Mr. O,
you're looking very pimp today.

181
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,920
Uh, thank you, Sock.

182
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,982
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Mr. Oliver.

183
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,571
- Sam, I'll catch you outside.
- All right, cool.

184
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:06,033
- Everything ok?
- Yeah, yeah.

185
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:11,320
I found this lying on the floor at home.
Thought you might need it.

186
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:14,281
Oh, yeah, thank you.
I, uh, fell down a few times.

187
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:16,390
It must have popped
out of my pocket.

188
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:20,440
Uh... Sam, what is that?

189
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:25,091
That...

190
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,350
is the contract.

191
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,861
The contract, huh?
You mean the contract?

192
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:38,033
- Wow.
- Yeah, yeah, well...

193
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:42,431
Should take me about a
year to get through it.

194
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:44,741
Well, you want me to take
a look at it for you?

195
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:46,732
- No, dad, I can handle it.
- Uh, are you sure?

196
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,583
Maybe there's a
way I can help out.

197
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:51,540
I-- I gotta get going.
Guys are waiting.

198
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:53,171
Yeah.

199
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:56,171
Damn it.

200
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,402
Dad, what-- what's wrong?

201
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,810
Ah, just seeing that contract just
brought back a flood of memories

202
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,020
and feelings of guilt
for what I did to you.

203
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:08,413
- No, it's-- it's ok.
- Well, look at me, sam.

204
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,322
I'm standing idle while you
carry the burden for this.

205
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:12,963
What kind of father does that?

206
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:17,093
I want you to arrange a
meeting with me and the devil.

207
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,973
- What? Why?
- To talk to him.

208
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:22,880
To convince him to release your soul,
to make a trade.

209
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:25,560
Trade? Dad, I don't think
you have anything to trade.

210
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,271
I have skills, Sam.

211
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,210
All the years in advertising,
I can use those skills.

212
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:33,651
I don't-- I just don't think you
have anything the devil needs.

213
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:37,923
I've created cartoon mascots to sell
cigarettes to kids, Sam. To kids.

214
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,781
Tell the devil that.

215
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:42,753
- That's a good point.
-  Yeah. Get me that meeting.

216
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:47,402
- Ok, I'll... I'll ask.
- Ok, good, good.

217
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:58,410
- Hey. Nice flowers.
- Hey. Yeah.

218
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:00,383
It's kind of a nice surprise.

219
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,991
- Oh, you got a... card.
- Oh.

220
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,470
Flowers, Sam?

221
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,102
Very inappropriate.

222
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:11,732
Make your co-worker uncomfortable,
you amp up the tension.

223
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,643
And we have harassment
sexual harrasment rules

224
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,602
that clearly forbid these
types of unwanted overtures.

225
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,441
- I'm not harassing, Ted.
- Sam?

226
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,200
- Yeah.
- Just trying to protect you.

227
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,313
- Flowers aren't from me, Ted.
- No, they're from Greg.

228
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:27,113
Greg. I met him. We had a
conversation about ceiling fans.

229
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:30,091
I heartily approve.

230
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,171
That's funny,
him giving me flowers.

231
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:35,992
They're-- they're really nice.

232
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,613
Wow. Not as nice as
that sweater, though.

233
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,751
What happened?
Did you lose a bet?

234
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,090
Oh... uh, yeah.

235
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:49,001
- You goin' somewhere?
- I got a family thing that I got...

236
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,412
Whatever.

237
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,362
Andi, wait, listen.

238
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,100
Ok, I haven't been
100% honest with you.

239
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,070
What's going on, Sam?

240
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:05,773
I have some stuff that
I need to tell you.

241
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,723
Obviously, so just tell me.

242
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,630
- Ok--
- Ahem!

243
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,252
Yeah. Ok. I can't right now.
But I will.

244
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:15,212
- Tonight, I promise. Uh, 7:00?
- All right.

245
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,891
Ok, I'll pick you up,
and I will--

246
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,152
I'll tell you everything,
ok? Everything.

247
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:24,573
I'm-- I'm good.

248
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:26,162
I'm ok.

249
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,163
So that's where I saw Fazio crash,
right over there.

250
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,600
The slime guy went down
the sewage right here.

251
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,350
All right.

252
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:51,231
Careful, guys.

253
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,301
Whoa, whoa!

254
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:56,380
Holy...

255
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,511
Sorry, guys,
this is the only way.

256
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,453
All right, here. Ugh.

257
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,841
It smells like strawberry.

258
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:07,263
Oh, yeah.

259
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,382
- That's good.
- Yeah.

260
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:10,831
- All right.
- All right.

261
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,252
All right, I'll go.

262
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,543
Sorry.

263
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,453
So I'm gonna tell Andi.

264
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,572
Tell Andi what?

265
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:29,911
Everything.

266
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,670
- Whoa, what everything?
- Everything, everything.

267
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,843
About this,
about working for the devil.

268
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:38,052
- Are you crazy? Why?
- Because I have to.

269
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:40,511
She's already mad at me
because she thinks I'm a liar,

270
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:43,093
which I am,
and I can't keep coming up with excuses

271
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:45,123
every time I have to run
errands for the devil.

272
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,853
If I'm ever gonna have a chance
with Andi, I gotta come clean.

273
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,742
Oh, she's gonna freak out, man.
She's gonna think you're off your nut.

274
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:52,783
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty sure she already thinks that.

275
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,061
Hey.

276
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:56,430
Hey, look at that.

277
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:00,321
Wait, that's him,
that's the soul, that's gotta be.

278
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:01,933
Look, look, footprints.

279
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,862
I think he's down here.

280
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,651
Oh, boy.

281
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,031
What is this?

282
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,133
Looks like a
political fundraiser.

283
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,912
Soul could be trying to
attack somebody here.

284
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,571
Hell, or it lives here.

285
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,542
- Oh, my god, look.
- What?

286
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:36,990
I see an open bar.

287
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,983
Hi, how you doin'? Good drinks?

288
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,761
Oh, 25-year-old scotch.
I'm goin' in.

289
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:45,062
No, no, no, no.
One of these people might be the soul.

290
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:46,993
Clearly, you didn't hear me.
25-year-old scotch, goin' in.

291
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:48,921
Gentlemen.

292
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:49,902
- Hey.
- Hi.

293
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:53,583
Hi, can I help you?
This a by donation only event.

294
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:57,350
Ah. What a coincidence, actually,
because I have been looking

295
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,061
to donate a bunch of money
to a worthy candidate.

296
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,880
Sam. Now, listen,
I have a couple pressing concerns.

297
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:07,252
Um, what is your standpoint
on legalizing prostitution?

298
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:10,052
- I'll handle this, Mr. Hartford.
- Thank you.

299
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,161
- Are you the prostitution guy?
- We're friends with Ed.

300
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,842
Ed Fazio.

301
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,583
Ah. Well, in that case.

302
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,573
Get the hell off my property
before I call the police.

303
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,602
Ok.

304
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,952
Jerry, will you take
care of this, please?

305
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,600
Ed Fazio is dead.

306
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,450
He died?

307
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:34,681
A few hours ago.

308
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,250
Well, that is a shame.

309
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,040
That is a crying shame.

310
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:43,331
Well, not for me.

311
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,570
But I'm sure if you
look far enough,

312
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,701
you'll find a sap out
there who did like the guy.

313
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,490
Heh heh, ok? All right.

314
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:51,210
Jerry.

315
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,212
Come on. You need to leave.

316
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:03,340
He didn't even care
about the dead guy.

317
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,573
Absolutely not.

318
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,423
It's like he wanted Fazio dead,
you know what I mean?

319
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,152
You know what,
I bet Hartford is the soul.

320
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,382
I don't know.
I didn't even see the slime bag's face.

321
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,962
Well, only one way to find out.

322
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:16,673
- Wait, Sock! Sock!
- Stop, Sock! Sock! No!

323
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,510
Whoa!

324
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,500
Ok.

325
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:29,202
It's cool.

326
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:33,072
Hey, do you think I can
get my sweater back?

327
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,001
It's an heirloom.
My dead grandmother made it for me, ok?!

328
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,330
My mom's gonna kill me.

329
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,181
She could handle us
being lost in the sewers.

330
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,071
She could handle that.

331
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:07,281
What are you doin'?

332
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:10,953
We gotta kick somebody's ass,
establish dominance, otherwise, uh...

333
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,712
deliverance brides,
you know what I mean?

334
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,112
I can take this guy.
Check it out.

335
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,031
Yo, homeboy.

336
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:26,383
What are you in for?

337
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:28,442
Triple homicide.

338
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,970
Trifecta. Nice work.

339
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:34,233
That's good.

340
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:40,242
I think we're in big trouble.

341
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:42,153
Look, we have more important things,
all right?

342
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:43,930
We lost the vessel, and we're not
going to get another one back.

343
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,430
And that trumps prison rape?

344
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:50,393
There. That's
them. Unbelievable.

345
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,981
I knew you wouldn't quit me, baby.
I knew it.

346
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:57,922
My boss convinced Bobby Hartford not
to press charges against you guys.

347
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,963
But you have to promise to
never go near him again.

348
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:02,710
You mean, he just let us go?

349
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,383
Hartford's about to announce
his candidacy for city council,

350
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,392
which means he doesn't want
to deal with you goofballs.

351
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,383
Has Hartford been having
any problems lately,

352
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,342
- like with lawyers or something?
- He's about to get his ass sued.

353
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,961
- Really? Why?
- Dumping toxic waste.

354
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:17,022
His family owns a
chemical company.

355
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,940
It's been rumored that they've
been dumping for years,

356
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:20,573
back when his dad
was in charge.

357
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:23,902
Finally got enough evidence against
him to file a class action this year.

358
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:25,810
- His dad?
- Yep.

359
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,412
Bobby Senior.
Too bad he's dead.

360
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:32,732
I would love to see that slimeball pay,
just like his son.

361
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:39,292
- It's the dad, it's gotta be.
- Well, why come back now?

362
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:42,080
Bobby junior's running for office
and this lawsuit could ruin him.

363
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:44,342
Dad's trying to get rid of his enemies.
We gotta get that sweater back.

364
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,213
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

365
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:49,141
- Is that what time it is?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,563
Damn it,
I'm 3 hours late to meet Andi!

367
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,321
Well, go.
We'll find the vessel.

368
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:54,823
How? You can't break
into Hartford's!

369
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,502
10 to one,
nobody kept that ugly sweater,

370
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:58,170
it's in the trash at Hartford's house,
all right?

371
00:22:58,215 --> 00:23:00,392
- Ok, I'll meet you guys there.
- You ever dumpster dive?

372
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:02,863
Of course. Remember that shirt
I got you for your birthday?

373
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:04,461
- That's a fine grab.
- Yeah.

374
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:12,272
Sam.

375
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,532
Hi, Mrs. Prendergast.
Is Andi home?

376
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:19,283
No, she went out.
She got a call from someone. A friend.

377
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,933
Greg. Uh, she went out with greg?
Right, Greg?

378
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,532
- I think it was Greg.
- Ok. Um...

379
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:29,032
do you have any idea where
they might have-- no?

380
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,893
Oh. Um, ok.

381
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:35,443
She'll probably be back soon.
Would you like to come in and wait?

382
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:39,213
No, no, no, thank you.
Um, that's ok.

383
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,811
- Well, good-night, Sam.
- Good-night.

384
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,572
Oh, god!

385
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:56,332
Say hi to your
parents for me, Sam.

386
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,922
Yeah. Ok. I'll do that.

387
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,073
- Ok.
- Ok.

388
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,892
- See ya.
- Bye.

389
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:11,781
So, Greg...

390
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,962
What are you doing here?

391
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:16,652
Well, I have a solution
to your problem.

392
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:21,601
I know you've been distracted
by all this Greg business, so

393
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:24,520
I took the liberty to
dig up some dirt on him.

394
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:26,490
I'm not interested.

395
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:29,072
Oh, I think you're going
to want to see this.

396
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:31,212
See, he's been
dating other women.

397
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:32,843
Plural.

398
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:35,022
Twins, to be exact.

399
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,781
What?

400
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:40,060
Ha. Dirty girls.

401
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:41,743
Slutty.

402
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,500
Oh, this player even
makes me jealous.

403
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:48,672
I'll just bet you that Andi will be
very interested in hearing about this.

404
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:50,732
No.

405
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:54,073
No, no, no. I know what you're doing,
you're trying to tempt me,

406
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:56,500
and I'm not going to fall for that.
I'm not gonna stoop that low.

407
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,050
Ok.

408
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:00,312
What's your plan, then?

409
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:02,353
I don't know. I'll just...

410
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:06,253
- I'll outcharm him.
- Right.

411
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,750
Well, good luck with that.

412
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:13,300
Wait.

413
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:16,961
I think we know who the soul is.
Hartford's dad, right?

414
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:20,012
He dumped a bunch of toxic waste,
and now he's back to help his son?

415
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:23,692
Yeah, me old story. The sins of
the father are visited on the son.

416
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:26,731
- Circle of life.
- Oh, my dad, right, um...

417
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,753
He wants to arrange
a meeting with you.

418
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:31,493
Not a chance.

419
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,451
He just wants to meet with you.
He only wants to talk.

420
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:36,580
I already have everything
I need from your father.

421
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,423
He has nothing
else that I want.

422
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,793
Feel free to pass
along that message.

423
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,801
Hey, check this out.

424
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:02,680
Ed Fazio was the lawyer on the
case against the Hartford family.

425
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:05,063
He's pictured here
with the reporter

426
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:07,750
and an activist who helped
break open the case.

427
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:10,871
Where'd you get this?

428
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:14,143
Oh, we stopped at a computer
at a Kinkos on the way over.

429
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:17,182
Actually, I got a receipt
so satan can reimburse me.

430
00:26:17,477 --> 00:26:20,731
These are the pictures the devil
showed me. They're all dead.

431
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,590
Yeah, and if they're all dead,
what about the lawsuit?

432
00:26:23,628 --> 00:26:26,960
- Does it die with them?
- I don't know, maybe.

433
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:36,152
This is worse than sewers.
How many cats do these people own?

434
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:39,611
Well, judging by the amount of
cat litter, I'd say about 1,200.

435
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:43,013
Damn it! Stupid... garbage!

436
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:46,771
So, uh...

437
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,342
How'd it go with Andi?

438
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,672
Not good.

439
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,360
Sorry, dude.

440
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,330
All right, come here.

441
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:03,230
Come here, come here.
Come here.

442
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,501
In the eleventh grade,

443
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:11,331
I was in love with this
girl named Susan Pulitzer.

444
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:14,852
I was convinced that
she was the one.

445
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:19,380
And then she came back from
summer vacation, and she was...

446
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:21,432
pregnant.

447
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:24,041
I thought, good.

448
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:26,840
Now I know that she goes
all the way for sure.

449
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:31,770
Then her parents sent her off
to a convent school, and, uh...

450
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:35,103
I never saw her or
heard from her again.

451
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:37,251
I was absolutely devastated.

452
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:39,271
Completely.

453
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,392
Well, look,
I'm just trying to commiserate here, ok?

454
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:46,493
Make you feel a little
better about Andi.

455
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:49,970
- Some things can't be helped.
- No, I refuse to accept that.

456
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:52,071
I'm not gonna let
Andi just slip away.

457
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,162
All right, good, well,
what are you gonna do, then?

458
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:55,391
I don't know. I don't...

459
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:56,673
Something.

460
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:00,980
Oh, look, look! I found it!
It's right here!

461
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:03,412
- You found it?
- It's stuck.

462
00:28:03,997 --> 00:28:05,401
Move the stuff on top.

463
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:08,162
Hurry up so we can get
the hell out of here.

464
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:10,941
Ok, how about a hand, please, Ben?
Ben, we need a hand.

465
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:18,910
I need a hand.

466
00:28:19,256 --> 00:28:20,653
- Sam, Sam--
- Hold on!

467
00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:23,131
It's got Ben, it's got Ben!
He can't breathe!

468
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,482
- Hurry up, hurry up!
- Hold on, let me get the vessel!

469
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,751
- Is he all right?
- Ben, breathe.

470
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,513
Breathe, buddy, take a breath.

471
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,402
Is that used kitty litter?

472
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:03,971
Uh-huh.

473
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,720
You should have just
let that thing kill me.

474
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:09,523
Yeah, right.

475
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,010
Oh, god.

476
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:27,270
Oh, uh, sorry, Sam.

477
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,412
You're, uh, in kinda late.

478
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,851
Yeah, yeah,
it's been one of those nights.

479
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,151
What's up?

480
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:38,913
Well, I was just wondering if you
had a chance to ask the devil about,

481
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:41,353
you know, what we talked about,
getting a meeting with him.

482
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:44,001
It's not gonna happen.
He was pretty firm.

483
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:49,680
- He won't meet me for 5 minutes?
- No.

484
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,002
That's not right.

485
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:57,073
I mean, that isn't fair.

486
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:01,730
He can't do this!
The devil can't do that!

487
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,742
He-- I deserve the chance,
just once chance--

488
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,161
Dad...

489
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:10,163
I'm sorry, sam.
I just want to help you, that's all.

490
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,410
I didn't know it was
that important to you.

491
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:15,030
Of course it is.

492
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:16,903
You're my son.

493
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:21,531
I'm pretty sure you can't
meet with him. Um...

494
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:24,310
But you can look at the contract,
if you want.

495
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,421
Yeah. Of course I want to, Sam.

496
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,051
- Yeah.
- Sure.

497
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:30,563
You know, I went to catholic school,
I know a little bit of latin.

498
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:31,972
I, uh, let me do this.

499
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,951
I will dedicate myself to
finding a way out of this.

500
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:37,402
I promise.
I mean, maybe there's a loophole.

501
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:43,872
Thank you.
I will not let you down.

502
00:30:57,496 --> 00:30:59,103
Nice sweater, weirdo.

503
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:03,040
Where are the other
mental midgets?

504
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:05,241
- They need to sign these, too.
- I don't know.

505
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:08,752
You are some bunch. The one time
I want Sock here, he's not here.

506
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:12,202
Hello?

507
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:13,842
Hey, what's up?

508
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,171
Yeah, I'm free.

509
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,272
No, I have not seen
the movie yet.

510
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:21,110
You gonna bring Greg?

511
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:23,382
That sounds like fun.

512
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:26,482
Yeah, I think I can
scrounge up a date.

513
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,383
Ok.

514
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:30,203
I'll see you tonight. Later.

515
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,602
- That was Andi?
- Yep.

516
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:37,252
You two are going
on a double date.

517
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:41,073
You and her, her and Greg,
goin' out with Greg.

518
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:43,763
Yeah.

519
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:48,310
I think he's good for her.

520
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,873
- Yeah. He's good.
- Nice, stable influence.

521
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,381
I think they make
a cute couple.

522
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:57,310
Yeah, well, you know,
Greg's dating twins, ok?

523
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,043
2 slutty twins,
if you wanna know!

524
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,681
- What?!
- Yeah.

525
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:04,830
Never mind. I don't know.
Just forget it. Forget it, I'm sorry.

526
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,332
- Don't tell Andi.
- Don't tell Andi?!

527
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,473
- Yeah, don't tell Andi.
- Is it true?

528
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:11,710
I don't-- maybe.
I--I saw pictures.

529
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:15,133
How am I supposed to not tell Andi?
What if they get serious?

530
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,560
Damn.

531
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:20,651
Oh, ok.

532
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,863
Wow, that's...

533
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:30,560
absorbent.

534
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:33,782
Knock, knock.

535
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:35,990
It's about time.
Where have you been?

536
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:40,271
Uh, just reading. Engrossed in,
uh, reading the old newspaper.

537
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,753
So interesting.

538
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:44,583
You finally bought a newspaper
for once in your life. So?

539
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:48,952
Yeah, today-- today's paper, actually.
The papier du jour.

540
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:51,051
Big steaming pile of news.

541
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:54,063
Someone's continuing the
lawsuit against Bobby Hartford?

542
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,550
Yeah. A new lawyer signed on.

543
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,781
Gwynne Gilford.
She's a real pit bull, too.

544
00:32:57,818 --> 00:33:00,402
Hartford's political career will
end before it's even started.

545
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,743
Too bad.

546
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,970
That's it, this is the address.

547
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,063
Yeah.

548
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:13,253
Oh. That must be
the new lawyer.

549
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,490
Oh, my god.

550
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,282
I kinda want to break the law

551
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:21,080
so she can get all legal on me,
know what I mean?

552
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:23,273
All right, so what do we do?
We warn her?

553
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,573
Huh?

554
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:27,523
We tell her what, some slime guy
is killing everybody on the case?

555
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:29,350
- We're gonna look insane.
- Yeah.

556
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:31,703
Ok, look, there she goes. Look.

557
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:34,480
I imagine a nice long
shower will be in order.

558
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:40,213
Wash that very dirty little body.
You are dirty, Gwynne.

559
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,673
It's Hartford, he's in the water system.
He's already in there, come on!

560
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:43,643
What? Huh?

561
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:54,153
This is so wrong.

562
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,851
Wrong in all the right ways,
my friend.

563
00:33:57,156 --> 00:33:58,640
She's gonna freak out.

564
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:03,060
Who in the hell is out there?
Who's in my house?

565
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:05,041
We're from the water company,

566
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,582
and there might be a
problem with your water.

567
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:10,853
You have no right to be in here.
What problem with water?

568
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:13,022
Uh, tainted. Tainted water.

569
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:15,272
Step out of the shower, please.

570
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:18,193
I am not coming
out of the shower.

571
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:20,580
I want your names,
I'm calling the police.

572
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:24,300
What-- what the...
hell is this stuff?

573
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:41,143
It went down the drain.
Back to the sewers!

574
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,261
Ok!

575
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:44,781
You can sue me anytime.

576
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,260
Anytime!

577
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:52,000
How the hell are
we gonna find it?

578
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:53,721
Well, it's gotta
be in the pipes!

579
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:55,990
I hear it!
It's in here, it's in here!

580
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,712
- Here, take this.
- Stand back!

581
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:08,701
I need the vessel!
I need the sweater!

582
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:11,591
Be careful!

583
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:22,503
- Do you think Sam is ok?
- He's probably good, right?

584
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,513
Sam! Sam!

585
00:35:32,946 --> 00:35:35,942
Christmas come early
this year, Bobby!

586
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:49,903
We get him?

587
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:50,982
We get him?

588
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,041
We got him?

589
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,592
- Yeah!
- Yes!

590
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:55,091
You saved my life!

591
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,961
I almost lost it,
I couldn't breathe!

592
00:35:56,998 --> 00:35:58,941
I know.
I jumped in there and nailed that dude!

593
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:01,182
- We got him!
- We did it! Yes!

594
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:09,163
- I can't move my arms.
- What?

595
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:13,603
It's like the slime crusted up in
the sleeves, it's like concrete!

596
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:15,171
I can't let go.

597
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:19,443
Well, what the hell
are we going to do?

598
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:25,380
Uh, excuse me,
excuse me, I'm so sorry.

599
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:27,921
Thank you. We're just going
to come through right here.

600
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:30,250
Excuse me. I'm so sorry about that.
Excuse me.

601
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:33,973
Yeah, I'm here for my friend, all right?
He's needy.

602
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:36,193
Take a picture. God.

603
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,950
- Hi, Gladys.
- Um...

604
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:43,063
Vessel drop-off?

605
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:45,662
Place the vessel on the mat.

606
00:36:46,068 --> 00:36:48,040
Um, we can't get it off.

607
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,263
You need an extraction?

608
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:54,751
Don't worry.

609
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:57,823
I hardly ever hurt anyone.

610
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:02,251
Enter there, please.

611
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,080
Hey, Sam.

612
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,330
- Hey, how are you?
- Slutty twins?

613
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:17,732
You told Josie that Greg
was dating slutty twins.

614
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:21,373
- Oh. Josie told you, huh?
- Yeah.

615
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,701
What, these ones?

616
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:28,161
- Yeah, yeah, those are the ones.
- They're his sisters.

617
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,663
God, what would possess you
to say something like that?

618
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:33,910
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...

619
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:37,410
Someone gave me the
wrong information.

620
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,070
Who? Who would say that?

621
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:40,643
I...

622
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:45,180
I can't-- I can't remember.

623
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:47,371
Another one of your
big secrets, huh?

624
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,702
You know what? You want me to stay
out of your private life? Fine.

625
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,250
Stay out of mine, got it?

626
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,560
Whoa, Andi, hold on!
It was a mistake!

627
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:09,060
Hey, Sammy. Feel like a game?

628
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:16,913
- You set me up.
- I did.

629
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,850
- But I feel awful about it.
- No, you don't.

630
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:21,803
You did it on
purpose to screw me,

631
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,660
to make me look like a
scumbag in front of Andi.

632
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:26,733
Come on.
I thought you were mister high road.

633
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:30,630
"Oh, I'm not going to be tempted by
pictures of greg with slutty twins."

634
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:33,752
And then when the chips were down,
you spilled your guts.

635
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:36,300
- Well, I was being stupid.
- Man to man?

636
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:39,960
You always get a little
stupid around that girl, Sam.

637
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:44,240
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

638
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:49,250
I know what you were planning.

639
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:53,243
You were going to tell Andi all
about our little arrangement.

640
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:54,972
Well, that just can't happen.

641
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:57,950
That would be bad for you.

642
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:00,382
And very bad for Andi.

643
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:07,192
Usually it doesn't end well for those
mortals that come onto my radar.

644
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:11,102
Your folks, you, Sock and Ben.

645
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,641
- Sock and Ben are fine.
- For now.

646
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:18,512
But your secret dies with you,
your family and your friends.

647
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:20,723
It dies.

648
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:23,030
Understand?

649
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:26,341
I'm just saying, you know,

650
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:29,003
you ought to think
long and hard

651
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,391
before you invite Andi
into our little circle.

652
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:36,403
Is that a threat?

653
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:39,803
No. No, Sam. Just the truth.

654
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:43,741
So I'm never going to be with Andi,
that's what you're saying?

655
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:45,633
What? No.

656
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:48,402
Hey, why would I deny you
the love of your life?

657
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:51,090
I'm just saying,
you're going to want to keep her safe,

658
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,711
and if that means...

659
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,953
telling a little lie or two,
so be it.

660
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm just looking after
you two lovebirds.

661
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:06,651
Oh. Don't feel so bad
about keeping a secret.

662
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:10,671
That's what people do, all the time.
Throughout human history.

663
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:15,681
It's nobel to protect
the ones you love, Sam.

664
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,860
If you really care
about someone...

665
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:26,053
Sometimes it's safer to
keep them in the dark.

666
00:40:26,196 --> 00:40:30,533
