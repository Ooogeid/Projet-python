1
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,709
Hey, so what does this soul look like?

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,016
He's a Mongolian warrior
from the 13th century.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,090
Whatever they look like,
that's who we're after.

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:12,598
Traditional Mongolian
dress is called the deel.

5
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:16,180
It's worn by both men and women.
It's widely worn by Mongolians today.

6
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:18,808
- Is that so, professor?
- Hey, don't mock me, OK?

7
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,716
History channel docs are a great way
to break the ice with the ladies.

8
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:22,954
What ladies?

9
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:25,173
All right,
he just got out of hell yesterday.

10
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:27,208
Devil said he'll come
here to steal a horse.

11
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,330
He's skilled with swords,
spears, and knives.

12
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:32,139
He could probably snap
your spine with his bare hands.

13
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,016
Yeah, maybe you guys should
cover the other exit.

14
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,036
Cover the exit with what, our spines?

15
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,163
Yeah. You have that.
We're stickin'with you.

16
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,863
He's probably hiding.
Keep your eyes open.

17
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:53,499
- Look.
- What, what, what?

18
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:55,526
Bunny.

19
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:59,169
He's gonna get crushed by the horse.
Cover me, OK?

20
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:01,245
- But, Benjamin.
- What are you doing?

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,020
Idiot.

22
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,322
- Isn't he cute?
- No, no, no, Ben. No.

23
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,324
Can't we keep it?
I've always wanted a rabbit.

24
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,371
No. My house, my rules. No pets.

25
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,621
- It's our house now.
- OK, can we discuss this later?

26
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,469
- We need to find the stupid soul.
- Look out!

27
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:49,418
Sock, the phone, it's freakin'him out.
I'm gonna call you.

28
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:59,130
Who's the big, tough, stupid,
stinky Mongolian now?

29
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:03,851
"I'm just a primitive man. I don't
understand your modern technology."

30
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:09,753
Ben, get the vessel!

31
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:12,685
Ben, drop the rabbit.

32
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,925
Ben, drop the stupid rabbit!
Get the vessel! Get the vessel!

33
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,640
I got it.

34
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,648
I got it, guys.
I got it.

35
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:35,696

That's the soul who figured out how
to get out of his deal with the Devil?

40
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,830
Gonna hang these up all over town.

41
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:55,067
- I don't know how else to find the guy.
- "Large reward."

42
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,714
Exactly what do you mean by "large"?

43
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,251
Got a gift certificate to outback.

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,264
$30.

45
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:06,490
Nice. Hey, have you seen the bok choy?

46
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:09,993
King Charlie here just loves it.

47
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:13,095
Didn't Sock say you were supposed
to leave it out in the garage?

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,794
Yeah, but he doesn't like it in there.

49
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:18,947
Needs to be inside.
Besides, he won't be any trouble.

50
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:23,632
You know, Ben,

51
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,607
when was the last time
you went out on a date with a girl?

52
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:31,000
- Wh-why?
- I'm just sayin'...

53
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,378
Sometimes when you get lonely,
you sort of

54
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,631
you get really attached to animals.

55
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,800
That's not. This is not about that.

56
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,203
Don't listen to him, King Charlie.
He's just jealous.

57
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,111
Don't you dare listen to him.

58
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,161
Time to...

59
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:56,387
- Wake up, brother!
- Hey, man, not today!

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,612
Top of the mornin'to you.

61
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:03,658
I can't believe
I'm wrestling with my brother.

62
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:04,866
Come on.

63
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,488
So fun!

64
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,431
So fun.
So excruciatingly fun.

65
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,567
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

66
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,130
1, 2...

67
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,178
No, you don't. OK. All right.

68
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,773
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Why, Sam? Why is she torturing me?

69
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:26,129
Oh, my god. I can't handle it.
I'm cracking up.

70
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:28,984
- Brother.
- What the hell?

71
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:31,791
It's like she's waterboarding my boys,
Sammy. They're constantly blue.

72
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,688
You got the blue man
group in your pants.

73
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:34,996
Shut up, Ben.

74
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,867
- What the hell is that?
- Easy. You're scaring him.

75
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,716
I don't care.
Get that thing out of here.

76
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,177
Dude, what's your problem?
He's not hurting anybody.

77
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:47,002
OK, house meeting. House meeting.
First item up.

78
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:50,839
I propose a vote we put a ban on all
bunnies being in the house at any time

79
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:53,160
- for any given reason. How'bout that?
- Seconded.

80
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,233
All in favor?

81
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:55,329
- Aye.
- Aye.

82
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,378
- All those opposed?
- Can we talk about this?

83
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:02,198
Thank you. The ayes have it.
Take the varmint to the garage. Now.

84
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,929
Brother. Make sure you tell your little
buddy to bundle up out there.

85
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,811
It gets good and cold at night.

86
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,815
But in terms of your basic bench top,
I mean, this really can't be beat.

87
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,881
It's lightweight, mobile,
and a real great value.

88
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:17,179
How big is the blade?

89
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:18,566
- 10 inches.
- Motor?

90
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,565
A single-phase, 120-volt, 3450-R.
pm, and a 27-inch fence.

91
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,778
- Anything else?
- I think that's it.

92
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,616
You certainly know your merchandise.

93
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,795
Are you one of those secret shoppers?

94
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,427
You know, they send you from
corporate to see if we know our stuff?

95
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,543
- Was I that obvious?
- No. Actually, you were really good.

96
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,427
Well, you were amazing.

97
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,280
Can you do me a favor, will you?

98
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:46,739
I can only do my job if none of your
coworkers know i'm in the store. Could you...

99
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,904
Yeah.
My lips are sealed.

100
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,944
Secret shoppers?

101
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,649
They pretend to be customers,
but they really work for the bench.

102
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:57,332
They write up reports on employees.
You remember Andrew finke?

103
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:00,569
Yeah, he got fired last year because he
tried to sell the secret shopper weed.

104
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,379
They spy on us?
They can do that?

105
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,834
Of course they can do that.
They do whatever they want, man.

106
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,841
They're a big, giant, evil corporation,

107
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:09,002
represent everything that's
wrong with this country.

108
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,092
- Well, I don't know.
- Excuse me.

109
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,864
I got a message for you and your boys
up at corporate, my friend.

110
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,583
I'm watching you watching me,
watching you.

111
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,140
Believe it.

112
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:21,150
Narc!

113
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,173
I just wanted some rope.

114
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,634
- I'm sorry. We're...
- Sorry. Sorry.

115
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,265
Place the vessel on the mat.

116
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,614
- No. I don't have a vessel.
- Great. Next.

117
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:38,334
No, hold on. Please, I need a favor.
Can you hang this up in here?

118
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,952
No. Get out of here.

119
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:43,908
Hold on a second.
Did you see that?

120
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,893
You recognize him.

121
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:50,109
All you meatbags look alike.
This is a federal building.

122
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:52,702
- No private bills can be posted.
- No, you know him.

123
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,926
Gladys, come on.
I just need to track him down.

124
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,082
His name is Alan Townsend. He used
to be in hell. I just I need an address.

125
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,793
- Not a chance.
- I got you out of hell, rember?

126
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,013
Once.

127
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:06,549
You're never gonna let
me live this down, are you?

128
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,772
I can't talk here. Tonight, 8:00,
look out your back window.

129
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:16,135
I'll flash a light.
When you see that, go outside. Next.

130
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,848
That look on your face, priceless.

131
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,591
Yeah, you're hilarious.

132
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:01,109
Hey, you ever hear that noise again,
buddy, you just start runnin'.

133
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,148
On second thought, forget about it.
<<You'd probably already be dead.

134
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,866
- At least you'll know what killed you.
- What are you talkin'about?

135
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:10,979
Demons. 'cause that's the sound one
makes when it's hunting its prey.

136
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,874
What, you don't recall a certain
demon rebellion that's sort

137
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:18,106
of trying to assassinate you,
what with you bein'my son and all?

138
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,164
Right. Right.

139
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,424
I'll try to watch your back,
buddy, but you know,

140
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,459
you gotta remember I'm a busy guy.

141
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:24,835
It's an election year.

142
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,783
- OK, I know. I'll handle it.
- All right.

143
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:29,637
And one other thing.

144
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:33,611
Assuming that you're not torn apart
by demons in the next few hours,

145
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,848
you might wanna try and catch
your soul sooner rather than later.

146
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,104
Those Mongols conquered half the earth,

147
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,595
and I have a feeling
this guy's gonna adapt

148
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,457
to life in the 21st century
pretty quickly.

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,409
- Your copies are done.
- Right. Thank you. Thanks.

150
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:58,202
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Always here to help.

151
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,973
Rember to keep focused on your core.

152
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,241
She's torturing me, Sam.

153
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,307
She's like a

154
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,771
prison guard at gitmo,
got my bonbons all locked up.

155
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,184
She's not trying to torture you.
She's exercising.

156
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,808
Arms Strong.

157
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,103
This is so unfair.

158
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,486
I'm not her brother. I mean,
I'm not I don't even look like her.

159
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,076
You know, why does she insist
on labeling me as her brother?

160
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,825
I just want her to see me the way
the rest of the world does.

161
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,409
And how is that?

162
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,279
As a sexual magician.

163
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:46,104
I gotta open her eyes, change up the
game, explode the paradigm, you know?

164
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,534
She's really flexible.

165
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:51,042
I know. It's crazy.

166
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:55,067
I got it. I got it. I got it.
I'll take her dancing.

167
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:58,927
Chicks love to dance? All love to dance.
They love to get drunk when they dance.

168
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,665
More importantly,
I can straight up shake this ass.

169
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,590
I start poppin'and lockin',
she's gonna go bonkers, right?

170
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:05,883
Absolutely.

171
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,252
Sock, can you spot me on this move?

172
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:12,271
Can i?
Heh heh. Gangway.

173
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,877
Look at me... Spotting you.

174
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:28,334
You know, i'm sorry you gotta
stay out here, little man.

175
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,954
Yeah, but my roommates have very little
respect for anything but themselves.

176
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:35,030
Anyway, I got you a present,

177
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,490
a tiki torch.
That's nice, right?

178
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:41,625
Scented, with a little
citronella to keep the bugs away.

179
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:45,340
Now we're livin'large.

180
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:52,065
Got me in the headlock again.

181
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:02,837
Gladys, where are you?

182
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,646
Let him go!
Now!

183
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:44,165
Hi.

184
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,106
- You surprised to see me?
- Little bit, yes.

185
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,784
I almost got my throat
ripped out last night.

186
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,211
Drama queen.

187
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,206
You sent a demon to
my house to kill me, Gladys.

188
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:59,872
- Why would you do that?
- We're in a book club together.

189
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,800
What, so you agreed to
have me assassinated?

190
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:03,784
These book clubs are a lot of pressure.

191
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,746
I want you to look at that computer
and find alan townsend right now.

192
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,314
There. Happy?

193
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:21,760
Before I look at this address,
I want you to remember who my dad is,

194
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:23,991
because if this is another
setup to get me killed,

195
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:26,371
I think dad would be very
upset about that

196
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,561
and would wanna punish
all those involved. Am I clear?

197
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:43,972
Thanks.

198
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,611
- This place is awesome.
- I know.

199
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,151
It's so nice
that we could do stuff like this,

200
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,483
you know,
just me and my brother hanging out.

201
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,747
Yeah, just hangin'with your bro.
Or just a... just a dude.

202
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,792
Just a dude who technically
isn't related to you

203
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,102
so much in common with you,
it seems like you should be.

204
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,152
You know, not in a blood
relations kind of way.

205
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:14,014
- I love this song.
- Me, too. Let's do it. Come on.

206
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,666
Like that?

207
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,094
Come on, babe.

208
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,433
Would you like to dance?

209
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:14,217
So you think you can
actually get this guy to help you?

210
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:17,765
I gotta hope so. I mean,
we do have a common enemy in the Devil.

211
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:22,948
What?

212
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,236
How great would it be
if this actually worked,

213
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:27,388
if I actually got out of
my deal with the devil?

214
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:28,556
I know.

215
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,255
I mean, I don't wanna jinx it,
but if this actually happened.

216
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,815
- It would be amazing.
- Yeah. No more devil. No more souls.

217
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,039
I mean, we could actually be a norma
couple... You know, do normal things.

218
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,274
I yes.

219
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:42,736
- We would go on vacation.
- Yes, like a real vacation. Paris.

220
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:45,850
- We could go to malta.
- I don't even know where that is!

221
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:48,842
But...

222
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:52,154
- First he has to help you.
- I know. I know.

223
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,105
- Well, it's fun to think about.
- Yeah.

224
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,058
I'm starving.

225
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:01,154
I'm gonna go to the convenience
store on the corner. You want anything?

226
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,390
No. I'm good.

227
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:04,730
Be back in a jiff.

228
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,667
You two seem very much in love.

229
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:13,388
Why do you always have to do that?

230
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,371
I just think that love
is really wonderful.

231
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:17,809
Whatever.

232
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:19,505
So...

233
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,854
What are you doin'here?

234
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:27,526
I was, lookin'for the Mongol.

235
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,285
I had a hunch,
and Andi wanted to help, so...

236
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:33,324
that fish is a week old, Sammy.
I'm not buyin'it.

237
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,701
- I got...
- I know what you're really doing here.

238
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:37,703
Makin'time with your gal.

239
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:40,580
Lookin'to steam up the windows.

240
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:42,866
Meanwhile...

241
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:47,272
In local news, a man on horseback
rampaged through a downtown area today,

242
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,354
vandalizing property
and robbing several stores.

243
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:53,409
Police warn that the man is
extremely dangerous and not to.

244
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,688
You hear that?

245
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,336
- The police are after him.
- I know.

246
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,975
I don't want that soul in police jail.
I want him in my jail.

247
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,339
I'm concerned that you're allowing
yourself to become distracted.

248
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:08,193
A $10,000 reward is being offered for
any information leading to his arrest.

249
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:10,487
Chips?

250
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,728
- We gotta go.
- What?

251
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:39,114
So this dude with these little curly
slut bangs starts dancin'with her, right

252
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,476
and she completely lets him.
It's like I wasn't even there.

253
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,309
- That sucks.
- I was pullin'out this move, too.

254
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:46,975
I mean, how do you ignore that?

255
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,948
I don't know. I couldn't.
That's a great move.

256
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:51,569
Thank you very much. You know,
I just want a little acknowledgement.

257
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:53,351
This is where Ben said to meet him.

258
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,694
Chao anh, gentlemen.

259
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:07,809
- What's what's that?
- It's the vessel. Where's the soul?

260
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,951
- He'll be here.
- How do you know?

261
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,948
History. Observe, if you will.

262
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,633
All right.

263
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:21,712
So, as any scholar will tell you,
the Mongols first invaded China,

264
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:24,101
then Korea, all the way down to Vietnam.

265
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:28,498
Now similarly, our soul first
ransacked a Chinese restaurant,

266
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:30,441
then a Korean barbecue.

267
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,757
One guess as to what
he's gonna hit next.

268
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:36,921
- Tell me. It's a Vietnamese restaurant.
- It's gonna be a Vietnamese restaurant.

269
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,742
And this one just happens to be
the best one in little Saigon.

270
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,869
Ben, I don't think it works that way.

271
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,080
Ignore history, Sammy,
and see what happens.

272
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:46,131
So, what,
we're just supposed to wait here?

273
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,649
Do you happen to have the rest
of the pieces?

274
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,860
- Way ahead of you.
- Try the bahn pho.

275
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:52,525
- It's really good.
- I will.

276
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,766
I don't care who you are.
It's 15 minutes wait.

277
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,241
It's the Mongolian.

278
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:03,763
Where the hell did he get a suit?

279
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,298
The devil said he could adapt. Come on.

280
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,427
Come on, baby!

281
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,513
Keep people out of the kitchen!

282
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:01,573
Oh, god!

283
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,241
Wait! Stay back! Stay back!

284
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:11,660
Are you kidding me?

285
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:44,491
- So you'll have to admit I was right.
- No question.

286
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:47,911
- Best vietnamese food in Seattle.
- No, about the soul, nimrod.

287
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:52,060
Ben, you were absolutely 100% right.
I am sorry we doubted you.

288
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:55,560
Thank you. So with those facts on
the table, i'd like to reopen the vote.

289
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,533
King Charlie should be allowed
to live inside the house.

290
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,259
That smelly beast is not
setting foot inside this house.

291
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:05,551
OK? Plus you need someone to
second the motion to reopen a vote.

292
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,228
Out of luck, pal.

293
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:13,468
I found the soul.
I saved your life from the demon.

294
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:16,654
You have to second the motion.

295
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,754
- I second the motion.
- Yes. All right. Cool.

296
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,585
A new vote. All those in favor

297
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,196
of King Charlie living inside the house,
please raise your hand.

298
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:30,288
Opposed?

299
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:33,624
- What?!
- I'm sorry, Ben. It was a close vote.

300
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,700
This is crap.

301
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:36,461
It's parliamentary procedure, Ben.

302
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,103
- It's not crap.
- It's crap!

303
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,080
Parliament, Ben.

304
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,685
- What's up, brah?
- Topher. We met the other night.

305
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,474
I'm here to pick up Krist.

306
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,963
Come on in, brah.

307
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:03,536
So...

308
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:06,576
Toph...
Toph-fu...

309
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:10,035
- What do you do?
- Do?

310
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,204
Yeah, do.
For a living?

311
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:15,457
- My dad owns a car dealership.
- Look at you.

312
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:17,973
Self-made man.
All right.

313
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:21,127
Very proud of you. That's impressive.
Here's the thing.

314
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,406
Kristen is not like other girls.

315
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:28,042
She is smart, and she is kind,
and she is very, very special,

316
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:31,018
so if you think you're gonna waltz up in
here and put another notch in your belt,

317
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:33,281
my man, you are sorely mistaken,

318
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,735
because she is my sister,

319
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:39,050
and the only one allowed
to have sex with her is me.

320
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:41,572
Hey, Toph.

321
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:43,902
Sock, you remember Topher.

322
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,898
- He's taking me dancing.
- Funsies.

323
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:57,062
If she were my sister,
I'd probably wanna do her, too,

324
00:22:57,196 --> 00:23:01,104
'cause that ass is crazy doable.

325
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,543
Oh, my god.

326
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:19,146
Oh, my god. I did that.

327
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,908
Dude. I'm so sorry.
Man, that was way over the line.

328
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,769
Listen.
I'm not normally a violent person.

329
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:26,279
I'm very tender.
I'm very gentle and kind. I just...

330
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,807
Do you need a water bottle
or some ice for your neck?

331
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,355
Just leave us alone!

332
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:33,786
Are you OK?

333
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:44,046
Come on, man. It's not that bad.
At least he didn't call the cops.

334
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,956
It's terrible, Sam, all of it,
all right? I mean...

335
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:50,857
My sister hates me.

336
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,529
I just you know what? You know, I just,
I need. I need you to leave right now.

337
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,424
Please just respect my privacy and go.

338
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:04,887
Carol, on line 2.
Carol, line 2.

339
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,362
I see you.

340
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,310
Excuse me?

341
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:13,712
You have been coming in he you have
been coming in here every day this week,

342
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:17,301
walkin'these aisles,
stealing furtive glances,

343
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,749
hoping, waiting...
Fantasizing.

344
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:23,866
I'm sorry. I think you're confused.

345
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,303
No. There's no confusion here,
sexy lady.

346
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,887
Yeah. No, I know the drill.

347
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:32,573
Lonely hausfrau cruisin'the bench,

348
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:36,520
looking for a fleeting moment of
passion with anyone that will have them.

349
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:41,260
Sir, I really don't think that you wanna
continue this line of conversation.

350
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:43,188
Don't worry. You aren't the first,

351
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:46,693
and you won't be the last,
but you will be the seventh.

352
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:50,524
What did you say your name was?

353
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:52,631
Gallagher...

354
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,359
Manager.

355
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,272
- Sock?
- Leave me alone.

356
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,834
Listen. Ted hit on the secret shopper,
and he got fired. He's about to leave.

357
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:05,648
Where?

358
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:19,672
You're gonna hear a lot of terrible
things about why I was dismissed...

359
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,494
Words like "harassment,"
"sexual advances,"

360
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:25,500
"inadequately endowed."

361
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,358
- Sir, please.
- Detective.

362
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,252
Thank you.

363
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:35,188
But what kind of world is it where a man
can't simply say hello to his neighbor,

364
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,837
can't strike up a conversation
with a pretty lady,

365
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:41,831
can't flirt harmlessly,
tell her about his hobbies and passions?

366
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:44,804
Not the kind of world I wanna
live in. I'll tell you that right now.

367
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:49,120
And just to be clear, sex swings have
been around for thousands of years.

368
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:50,711
It's not like I invented them.

369
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,011
Wish I had.

370
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,137
Sir, you need to leave immediately.

371
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,387
I've been authorized to use force.

372
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,894
I can't really.

373
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:06,451
Don't analyze.

374
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:07,626
Just savor.

375
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:09,702
Savor.

376
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,890
Wait! Alan, hold on!

377
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,247
I'm not here to catch you.
I just wanna talk. I just wanna talk.

378
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:43,343
I'm not gonna talk to you.
You work for the devil.

379
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,218
I do not work for him.
He owns me. My parents sold him my soul.

380
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:48,911
I'm goin'to hell when I die, and I
didn't have anything to do with it.

381
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:50,461
That sucks, man, but...

382
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,830
- I can't do anything for you.
- Wait. Yes, you can.

383
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:54,358
You can tell me how you did it.

384
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:56,696
Just tell me how you got out
of your deal with the devil.

385
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,784
I'm sorry, but I'm done with this.

386
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,036
I got a second chance,
and I'm not gonna blow it.

387
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:05,111
I can't risk talking to you.
I can't risk helping you.

388
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,668
I gotta stay off the devil's radar and I
gotta avoid any temptation of any sort.

389
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:12,338
Yeah, but that's never gonna happen.
You're always gonna be on his radar.

390
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,581
He's always gonna find
a way to tempt you.

391
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,508
No matter what you do,
where you hide,

392
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,720
he's gonna find a way to get
you into hell

393
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,074
unless I help you.

394
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,253
OK, I know how he operates.
I know his tricks,

395
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,864
some of them, and he trusts me.

396
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:30,648
I might be the only person in
the world to keep him away from you.

397
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,416
You set me up!

398
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,099
No, I didn't! I swear!

399
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,980
Go! Back to your little hovel!

400
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,442
And warn your rebellious friends
this one is not to be touched!

401
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,546
Did you get a look at its face?

402
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:25,369
I thought it was
gonna start bawlin'.

403
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:29,849
I love killin'demons.

404
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:37,055
Drink up, buddy.

405
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,176
You just had a near-death experience.
You ought to be over the moon.

406
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,563
You're thinking about alan townsend,
aren't you?

407
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,636
You gotta let go of that, man.

408
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,451
You know, face reality.

409
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,486
He's never gonna talk to you,

410
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,441
not after what you did to him.

411
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,151
What I did to him?

412
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,887
Did sort of look like you were trying
to get him killed by demons just now.

413
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:05,061
You set this whole thing up.

414
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,995
You had the demons attack me on purpose.

415
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,145
Now, how would I do that?

416
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,702
Because you know if alan thinks
i'm involved with those demons,

417
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:15,086
he'd be too afraid to talk to me,
and he is.

418
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,003
You know...

419
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,291
It's funny how it all worked
out in my favor,

420
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:22,545
isn't it?

421
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:28,924
I got a feeling that soul's
not gonna be able to stay out

422
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:31,836
of hell too much longer,
so my advice to you.

423
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:33,542
Forget about him.

424
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:35,789
Give over to your fate.

425
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:40,233
Because you can make yourself
miserable fighting it, or

426
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:43,867
you can accept your lot in
life and make the most of it.

427
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,118
Adapt or die.

428
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:50,538
Like our little Mongolian friend.
He was from 13th-century China,

429
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,168
and in less than a week, he's become
a blackberry-toting jackass who's

430
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:56,239
terrorizing the city like
a professional.

431
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,420
We should all be so wise.

432
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:07,112
Well, fine.

433
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:09,888
You don't wanna drink to your happiness,

434
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:12,768
here's to your sorrow.

435
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:25,565
Wanna do a little stretching with me?
This one's called the eagle pose.

436
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:27,406
It's the... listen. Hey,

437
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:30,007
if you were waiting for me to apologize
for what happened to Gopher,

438
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:32,208
- you can forget about it.
- His name is Topher.

439
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,051
What do you see in that guy?
He's a hair product.

440
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:37,931
You know, what?
Seriously, tell me.

441
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:41,367
I'd like to know, because he,
to me, is so obviously a player.

442
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:44,251
I don't know what dudes
are like in japan,

443
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,719
but this douche bag just wants
to bang you and walk away.

444
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,138
Maybe that's what I want!

445
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,104
- Come on. I mean, how bad could it be?
- It's bad.

446
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:00,163
OK, so he saw a couple
demons attack you.

447
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:01,913
The guy was in hell.

448
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,653
I mean, it's probably not
even a big deal to him.

449
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,877
The devil screwed me. He made it look
like I was working with him.

450
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:10,908
There's no way that guy's gonna trust
me. It's over. It's hopeless.

451
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:14,076
You know, I refuse to accept that.
There's gotta be something you can do.

452
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,865
There's not.
The devil made sure of it.

453
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,903
What the devil didn't count on is me.

454
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:20,628
- Alan will talk to me.
- Why?

455
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,503
Because when I want something,
I can be pretty persistent.

456
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:26,160
And I really, really wanna go to malta.

457
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,468
Hello. Hello.

458
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:33,474
Who's got fresh kale?

459
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:35,724
So nibbly. So delicious.

460
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,312
We're in the wrong garage.

461
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,002
Yeah. Excuse us.

462
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,130
Sock, he has the rabbit.

463
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,509
What? No, you don't. No.

464
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,888
- Please open the door, Sock!
- No. Don't even think about it, Benjy!

465
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,320
- Please open the door, Sock!
- The rabbit stays outside!

466
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:16,971
Open the door now!
Come on!

467
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,471
Somebody there?

468
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,191
OK, so we're just gonna leave.

469
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:58,670
So thanks.

470
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,910
You seem a little angry and upset.

471
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,997
Whatever we did, let me just say

472
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:24,752
that I apologize on behalf
of myself and the rabbit.

473
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,399
I burned you a little bit there,
and that was wrong of me.

474
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,175
I was so wrong.

475
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,553
Maybe we could get you some ointment

476
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,014
or something, something
to help with the scarring.

477
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,101
Please, just.
Just be careful, please.

478
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,273
You don't want him.
I promise he didn't do anything.

479
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:55,657
All right, just the two of us. OK.

480
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:59,828
I'm just gonna do a little prayer.

481
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:07,558
My mind's sort of blank.
I'm goin'total blank.

482
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,437
You know a prayer?

483
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:16,845
What? What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?!

484
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:20,391
I want what everyone wants.

485
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:23,769
I've been watching you.

486
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:25,514
You're very brave.

487
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,690
You risked your life
to save your friend.

488
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,734
You have a kind heart.

489
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:31,902
You seem to really love that rabbit.

490
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,145
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

491
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,741
You have beautiful eyes.

492
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,577
Oh, my god. He's dead.

493
00:34:44,702 --> 00:34:47,045
There's nothing we can do.
What do we do?

494
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,878
Sock, that thing took him,
and he's not coming back.

495
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,004
Sam, listen.

496
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,051
Here's what we're gonna do.

497
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,381
We need to get story straight?
People are gonna come here.

498
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:58,609
They're ask questions.
We have to have answers ready.

499
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:00,556
What. Our friend is dead!

500
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:04,059
Ben would want us to have a coverup
story for the cops, and that is a fact,

501
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,978
so now, here,
this is what we're gonna do.

502
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,522
Tell people that he went
on a bike ride late by himself.

503
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,711
Maybe we invent a drug problem.
He was a drug mule...

504
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:14,528
- You know what?
- Narcotraficante.

505
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,375
None of this would have happened if
you wouldn't have just opened the door.

506
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,450
Ben knew the rules! No pets
inside the house! We voted on that!

507
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,796
- Why do you hate the rabbit so much?!
- Why do I hate the rabbit?!

508
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,248
Let me give you one reason.
Because this...

509
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,708
Is not a milk dud.

510
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:30,294
- This is not a milk dud!
- What's up, boys?

511
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:33,421
Oh, my god!
You're alive!

512
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,717
Oh, my god, man.

513
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:40,178
Yes, I'm alive. What'd you think, some
punk-ass demon was gonna take me out?

514
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,796
We thought you were dead.

515
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:44,600
We thought you were dead, Benny.
Benny. We were freakin'out, man.

516
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,106
What happened?

517
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:49,688
- So the thing grabbed me, right...
- yeah.

518
00:35:50,038 --> 00:35:52,740
And it took me up to a lair up
in the mountains,

519
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:54,485
set me down, and came straight for me.

520
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:58,388
I mean straight for me,
and I just went house on that thing.

521
00:35:58,627 --> 00:36:00,073
How crazy. How?

522
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:02,201
It was just like
a shot of adrenaline.

523
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,453
Then I just jackie channed its ass

524
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,914
and hauled out of there.
It was crazy.

525
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,083
I don't believe it. Look at you. You
don't have a scratch on you, nothin'?

526
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,011
Not a scratch. Nothing.

527
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,172
What?

528
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,048
What? Nothin'.
No, nothin'.

529
00:36:17,173 --> 00:36:20,363
I mean, it's just, you know, you fought
a demon, and you're totally fine.

530
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,284
It's just odd.
That's all.

531
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,164
- What, you don't believe me?
- Who knows?

532
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:27,289
Maybe you're not lying.

533
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:33,196
The rabbit. House rules.

534
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,045
New rules.
King Charlie stays.

535
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:43,030
It's my sister.

536
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:44,162
Hello.

537
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:50,916
I came as quick as I could.
Are you OK?

538
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:53,390
Here. Get in. Get in.

539
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:57,673
You were totally right about Topher.

540
00:36:58,788 --> 00:36:59,888
He's a jerk.

541
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,163
What happened?

542
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,867
I went to surprise him,

543
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:07,099
and he was having sex
with another girl.

544
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:11,645
That's.
That's terrible.

545
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,756
I had my hair done.

546
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:16,088
I bought fancy underwear.

547
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,102
I was gonna give him my virginity.

548
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:20,751
Are you.

549
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,740
Oh, my god. Are you not wearing
any clothes under that thing?

550
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,722
I feel so ashamed.

551
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:28,540
You were gonna give
that guy your virginity?

552
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,098
- Why?
- I just wanted to get it over with.

553
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:34,282
All my friends have already done it.

554
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:36,628
I feel like such a loser.

555
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,594
Part of me feels so ready, you know?

556
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,227
Just to have...

557
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:46,137
meaningless, crazy sex with anyone.

558
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:48,169
I just thought...

559
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:51,459
- Topher would be easy.
- Listen to me.

560
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,687
Your ladyhood...

561
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:56,732
is a very, very special thing.

562
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:58,228
It's like.

563
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:00,353
You know what it's like?

564
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,779
It's like... it's like
a superawesome hot tub.

565
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,395
But if you just let anybody hop
into that tub,

566
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,846
it kind of becomes meaningless.

567
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,871
It gets full of hair, and you
have to clean it out all the time.

568
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,705
I hate dirty hot tubs.

569
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,166
We all do.

570
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,707
Now, look,

571
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:20,314
sex can be a wonderful thing
between 2 people. Don't get me wrong.

572
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:24,222
But it can also be just
really gross and kinda weird.

573
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,618
You will find the right person,
the perfect person,

574
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,350
maybe even closer than you think.

575
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,267
You're so right, Sock.

576
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:34,811
I know.

577
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,106
I'm going to save
myself until marriage.

578
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,142
Did I... did I say that?

579
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:45,322
I'm gonna keep my virginity,
and I need your help.

580
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,204
Please, Sock. Will you help me

581
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:52,328
not have sex with anyone?

582
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,760
Of course I will, Kristen.

583
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,919
You're the best brother
anybody could ever have.

584
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,507
I love it. Oh, I love it so much.

585
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:45,172
Glad you made it.

586
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:47,648
- You look amazing.
- I know.

587
00:39:56,257 --> 00:39:57,394
Just to be clear,

588
00:39:57,904 --> 00:40:00,989
you're not just using me to get to
my friend so you can kill him, right?

589
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,065
Probably not.

590
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:04,895
Yeah, that's good enough.

591
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,204
That's, that's fine.

592
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:30,761
He's gone.

593
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,588
Holy cow.

594
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:36,210
Look at this place.

595
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,038
He'ld be anywhere in the world by now.
There's no way we're gonna find him.

596
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,855
- We'll find him.
- How?

597
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,245
Look at this.

598
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:54,326
"Don't over eat.
That's gluttony."

599
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:58,914
"Don't covet neighbor's
possessions and/or wife."

600
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,931
- What does it mean?
- This guy was obsessed.

601
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,544
I mean, he's trying to avoid
temptation at all cost.

602
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:06,587
Gamblers anonymous schedule.

603
00:41:06,785 --> 00:41:07,836
Exactly.

604
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:11,780
I mean, he's terrified that the devil
is gonna somehow tempt him back to hell.

605
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:15,597
This apartment was his fortress.

606
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:18,095
So?

607
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:21,460
So we just need to figure out

608
00:41:21,995 --> 00:41:24,052
where would alan go
to be safe from the devil.

609
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:34,277
It's hard work, sweaty,
and it doesn't pay that much.

610
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:37,255
Plus lots of people
are afraid of corpses.

611
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:39,663
Doesn't bother me.

612
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,539
You sure you want the job?

613
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:48,421
- This ground's been consecrated, right?
- By the bishop.

614
00:41:50,483 --> 00:41:51,591
I'll take it.

615
00:41:52,982 --> 00:41:56,986
