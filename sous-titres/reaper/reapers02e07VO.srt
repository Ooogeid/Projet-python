00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,962
Hey, want some flax for your yogurt?

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,893
It's rich in Omega-3 fatty acids
and it promotes regularity.

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:10,273
Who are you?

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:17,240
Hey, I'm sorry Andi broke up with you
because you're the son of the devil.

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,025
And even though your dad evil, I thought
you guys were a great couple together.

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,874
No. No, don't be sorry.

7
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,555
I'm not ready to give up yet.
If I keep pushing, working some angles,

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,993
using my charm,
I know I can get her back.

9
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:30,702
You think that's the right idea?

10
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,806
Maybe you should give
it a little space for a while.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,858
No, space is the enemy.
I'm not done until we get back together.

12
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:37,182
Good for you.

13
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:40,067
Sometimes you've got to look
reality in the face and say no.

14
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,187
Morning, buttheads.

15
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:48,905
- Hey, you guys seen Kristen around?
- Think she's in the shower.

16
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:50,947
Really?

17
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:00,332
Brought shower coffee.

18
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:01,998
Sock! What are you doing?

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,612
Come on,
I've seen your cash and prizes before.

20
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:06,677
Get out!
My father will catch us.

21
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,550
What? Relax. My mom and your dad
moved out. We're good.

22
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,625
They could visit anytime.
This is not acceptable.

23
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,645
What?
Come on.

24
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,517
What are you so worried about?

25
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:19,544
My father cannot know
I date my stepbrother.

26
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:22,201
All right, sure, look,
he'll be shocked at first, yeah,

27
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,171
but so is the father of every girl
I've ever dated, all right?

28
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,513
But eventually, I promise you, he will
settle into a nice, grudging acceptance.

29
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:33,216
No, you don't know my father.
He does not change his mind. Ever.

30
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,410
Go on.
Don't let me interrupt.

31
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,518
Come, come on.

32
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,345
Can you believe this?

33
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,840
She doesn't think
that I can charm her father. Me.

34
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:48,292
- Unbelievable.
- I know, it's nuts.

35
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,831
- Could you put some clothes on, please?
- I'm too upset for clothes, man.

36
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,203
Is that flax?

37
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:56,082
This stuff's really good for you.

Corporate's making me fill out all these
stupid responsibility matrix forms.

I swear to god, if I don't take a break,
i'm gonna kill someone.

44
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,349
You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Bloodier the better.

45
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:25,388
I choose Sam.

46
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:27,974
What?

47
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:30,267
You guys broke up,
I had to choose a side.

48
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,526
I chose Sam.

49
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,533
Wait, why do you have
to choose any side?

50
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,061
I know what you're
trying to do here, Andi.

51
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:42,113
This is an ugly and awkward situation.
I made a choice, it's Sam, live with it.

52
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:44,688
Nobody's saying that we don't want
to be friends in the future?

53
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,191
We just think that in the time
being maybe we should take a break.

54
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,545
A friendship break.
While Sam heals.

55
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,538
That's too bad,
'cause I had a pretty cool assignment

56
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,589
I was gonna throw to
a couple of friends.

57
00:02:58,649 --> 00:02:59,889
A cool assignment?

58
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:03,121
We just got in a new shipment
of hammocks, really nice ones,

59
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,386
and I need people to stretch test them.

60
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:06,768
Stretch test?

61
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:09,403
You know sleep in them for
a few hours, see how they hold up.

62
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,922
- I choose you! I'm on your side.
- Break's over.

63
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,276
When do we start?
Are they here?

64
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,069
Thought so.

65
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:25,323
Try not to chew on it, OK?

66
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,675
Remember what happened
to your squeaky toy?

67
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,298
None of my other girlfriends
ever played fetch with me.

68
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,797
I like to be special.

69
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,154
Baby.

70
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,474
guess what saturday is?
Our 2-month anniversary.

71
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,704
You're right.

72
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,512
2 months ago I kidnapped you
and forced you to be my boyfriend.

73
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,468
The details don't matter.

74
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,748
What matters is I want to do
something special for our occasion.

75
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,405
Anything you want to do, OK?

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,483
Unless it involves
sacrificing an animal.

77
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,645
But anything else, i'm in.

78
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,855
You know what,
there is something that I want to do.

79
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,251
It's something that's
really important to me,

80
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:18,423
and I think it'll take
our relationship to the next level.

81
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,008
Reverse cowgirl.

82
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:24,221
No, silly, I want to take you flying.

83
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:29,142
- Right, yeah, flying.
- It's such an amazing experience, Ben.

84
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:33,809
At night, I go up to the mountains,
and I swerve through the clouds,

85
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,858
and I buzz along the treetops.

86
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,620
It's so moving, baby.
And I really want to share it with you.

87
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,624
- It sounds awesome.
- Really?

88
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:47,205
- Well, let's go right now.
- No, let's not.

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,012
Why?

90
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,936
I think we should save
something so special

91
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,226
for our special day, that's all.

92
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:57,076
You're right.

93
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,945
You're right.
OK, we'll save it for saturday.

94
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,884
This is gonna be so great.

95
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,751
Great.

96
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,432
I just don't understand.

97
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,725
I mean, this is like
every relationship I've ever been in.

98
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:15,814
- There's always a fatal flaw.
- What's the fatal flaw this time?

99
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,469
Nina wants to take me flying,
but I can't.

100
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,444
I don't want to die.

101
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:22,583
Have you tried telling
her how you really feel?

102
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:24,900
OK. Tut-tut.

103
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:27,268
Talking about feelings, Sam?
Come on.

104
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:30,665
We're discussing Ben's fata not yours.
Benjamin, look at me.

105
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,120
Come here.
Look at me.

106
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,754
I want you to forget all about
this fatal flaw poppycock.

107
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:37,878
It is nonsense, all right?
You are going to fly.

108
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,197
- You think so?
- I know so, buddy.

109
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:42,591
- Bring it in.
- Go get her!

110
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,855
It's so sad.
She's totally dumping him.

111
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,464
Great. What the hell
is Morgan doing back?

112
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:55,944
He's here? I Miss that guy.
Little bit.

113
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:02,103
- Afternoon, fellas.
- What's shaking Morgan?

114
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,672
Let me tell you where I was
12 hours ago. The French Riviera,

115
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,370
surrounded by topless super models
and Champagne.

116
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:13,955
And now I'm here, at the work bench,
surrounded by toilet plungers.

117
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,606
You didn't have to come back.

118
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,489
Not true, Sammy boy.
Dad ordered me to.

119
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,361
Wanted me to do more of
that training stuff with you.

120
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:24,413
Just believe in yourself.
There, training complete.

121
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,742
You know and I know that
I'm really bad at this job, but you

122
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:34,561
were born for it. You're great at this.
And I'm above it. No offense.

123
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,642
So, I have a proposition for you.

124
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,820
You catch a soul for me,
and I'll give you

125
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:43,676
- $10,000.
- Morgan, no. I do not work for you.

126
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:46,262
Fair enough.

127
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,104
20,000.

128
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,818
Hold on. Hold on one sec.
We've got to catch the guy anyway.

129
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:56,397
Why not make a little extra
cheese in the meantime?

130
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,413
- We don't need his money.
- I need his money.

131
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:00,587
- I want his money.
- For what?

132
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,519
For a new hot water heater and jet skis.
It doesn't matter what for.

133
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,738
Listen, don't we deserve
a little something to show for

134
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:07,967
all the crap we put up with around here,
just once?

135
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,284
- All right.
- All right.

136
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:15,309
So, you catch me the soul,
i'll take credit,

137
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:17,954
dad's off of my back,
and I'm out of your hair.

138
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,688
And you're all the richer for it.

139
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:56,572
Can you smell it, Sammy?

140
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,929
- Sweat and cigarettes?
- Desperation.

141
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:02,950
Intoxicating.

142
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:09,252
My boy Morgan show his face yet?

143
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,670
Everything's fine.
He's going to help with the next soul.

144
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,497
That's what I wanted to hear.

145
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,620
I knew we just had to light
a fire to that kid's rear end.

146
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:21,735
Speaking of next soul.

147
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,284
Wait.

148
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:28,085
Wait. Uh, actually never mind.

149
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,688
I don't feel proud about this one, Sam.

150
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,474
I mean, one could say that I'm even
feeling a little guilty about it,

151
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,369
- you know.
- What does that mean?

152
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:39,375
Well, he was killed while coveting.

153
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:42,477
- So?
- So, it's the commandment.

154
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:45,246
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife.

155
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,782
This poor schmuck was mentally
undressing some broad,

156
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:51,484
then the next instant.
Hit by a truck.

157
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:54,346
He was just looking at her?
Didn't have sex with her?

158
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,659
- That is stupid.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

159
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,635
You know, in the old days I used
to get the souls that ate shrimp.

160
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,583
Can you imagine how
unsatisfying that was?

161
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,695
Wait, so you can go to hell
for just thinking of something?

162
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:10,546
Yeah. Don't blame me.
I didn't make the rules.

163
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:15,332
You know, you're right.

164
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:20,423
Why should I feel guilty about this?
This one's on the big guy.

165
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,837
Now, get me my soul back.

166
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,401
Guy's named Billy Boyland.

167
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,122
Died back in early nineties. This was
one of his favorite hangouts back then.

168
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,392
Excuse me.
Hi, can I get...

169
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:41,798
Still is. Look over there.

170
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,902
A little bit of whipped
cream and 2 cherries.

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,918
Do I know you guys?

172
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,496
- Is that a dodgeball?
- Good guess.

173
00:09:56,832 --> 00:10:00,028
Well, yeah, I've had a lot of
those thrown at me over the years.

174
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,502
It's also a vessel to
send you back to hell.

175
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,851
Come on, I don't want to
cause any trouble, but I mean,

176
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:11,102
you guys know why I went to hell,
don't you?

177
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,319
Coveting? Isn't that a little unfair?

178
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,901
Heard every excuse in the book,
billy boy. It doesn't matter.

179
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,623
- Do it now. Nobody's looking.
- No. Wait, wait. Please, just

180
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:20,287
let me eat my dessert first.

181
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,715
Eternity is such a long time for no pie.

182
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,451
- OK, fine, fine. Hurry up.
- Thank you.

183
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:30,923
It's delicious.

184
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,655
- You want some?
- Sure, I wouldn't mind.

185
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:37,687
Don't worry.
Sorry. I got it.

186
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,421
Here, have some.

187
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:45,728
- That's not bad.
- Vessel him now, the pie's ours.

188
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,582
- Where'd he go?
- What?

189
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:52,752
There he is!
There he is!

190
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,548
Son of a bun!

191
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,237
- Son of a bun!
- Billy, wait! Wait, Billy, wait!

192
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,477
He's got a weapon!

193
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:14,820
False alarm.

194
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:17,633
- Sam, give me that vessel.
- I'm doing this myself.

195
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:20,344
Please. Is there anyway
you will let me stay out?

196
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,284
There's literally nothing you can say

197
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:24,434
or do right now to sto
this from happening.

198
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:25,759
I'm a virgin.

199
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,416
- Say again?
- I died before I ever had sex.

200
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,665
Just let me stay out long enough

201
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:36,224
so that I could fulfill that dream.

202
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,900
- What?
- Sock, what are you doing?

203
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:45,890
- He said the magic words, Sam.
- What, the magic word is "virgin"?

204
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:48,599
- Ask anybody.
- It's true.

205
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:50,454
It's your dream to have sex?

206
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:54,536
You are looking at
your dreamweavers, my man.

207
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,507
We are going to get you laid.

208
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:04,766
We got to get this guy some action?

209
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,900
It's going to be tough,
but not impossible.

210
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,390
II got a plan. Follow me.

211
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:11,641
Listen up, man. If we're going to make
this thing happen for you,

212
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,904
you are going to have to pay for sex.
Are you cool with that, big guy?

213
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:16,452
What?

214
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:19,583
We're all going to chip in for
a really lovely and discreet lady.

215
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:22,073
High-class, I like it.
Now, before we get started,

216
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,268
is there anything
weird that you're into?

217
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,245
No. No, I'm not paying for sex.

218
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
If you're not going to cooperate,
then we got to send you back.

219
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,971
But I did have an idea. What if,

220
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:37,193
- what if we try the encounters bar?
- Why would you want to go there?

221
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:41,385
The clientele is a little more...
Mature.

222
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,312
Mature? All right,
I know what's going on here. Yeah.

223
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,534
Our boy Billy's into the older ladies.

224
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,618
The cougs.
I'm talking about? That's smart.

225
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,963
They get the job done fast,
righ dirty thirties, whorey forties.

226
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:54,099
The surprisingly tender fifties.

227
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,015
You, my friend, are a genius.

228
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,964
We're gonna hit happy hour,
pop your cherry.

229
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,765
Sock, is that what you're wearing?

230
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,327
Today's family portrait day.

231
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,264
You must look presentable.

232
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,666
- Change.
- Right, right, pics with the fam.

233
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,332
It's gonna be good. I'll finally
a little quality time with Morris.

234
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,407
No. No quality time.
Do not talk to my father.

235
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:19,046
Do not even look at him.
Do you understand?

236
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,800
He's gonna love me.

237
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:33,435
OK, why don't the gentlemen step aside
so I can get some shots of the ladies?

238
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,601
Absolutely. Beautiful ladies. I get it.

239
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:39,990
You guys look great.

240
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,540
Hey, man.

241
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,646
Thought you had some
pretty rad poses back there.

242
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,338
We should hang some time, me and you.
Know what I mean?

243
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,449
So what do you what do you like
to do for fun? You like to...

244
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:56,497
Like to golf? I like to golf.
Get out the old 9 iron.

245
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:57,927
Got a good short game.

246
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,948
- It's, what about ping pong?
- He likes fly-fishing.

247
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,332
He's-fly-fishing? That's aces.

248
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,136
I'm the biggest fly-fisher of all time.
I love it, I love it.

249
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:10,382
He's going fly-fishing tomorrow.
You should take him, Morris.

250
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:14,710
Uh, fly-fishing is
typicly a solitary pursuit. So...

251
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:16,300
Come on, honey.

252
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:21,777
Very well.

253
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,351
Tomorrow we fly-fish.

254
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:27,101
Perfect. OK, good.
Won't let you down.

255
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, I'm gonna kick some fish ass.

256
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,460
Encounters Bar happy hour 5pm
seafood sampler $4.99

257
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:36,913
Welcome to the jungle, boys.

258
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:39,636
Time for a little big game hunting,
cougar style.

259
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,440
They look like regular ladies to me.

260
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,140
Lock and load, bitches.
You tag 'em, you bag 'em.

261
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,926
Please stop talking like that.

262
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:51,471
That's her. That's the one
I want to talk to right there.

263
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,982
- Come on, I need a wingman.
- Not it.

264
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,050
Not cool. You guys
know I stink at not it.

265
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,041
Come on, Billy.

266
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,153
Good afternoon, ladies.

267
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:16,622
What has this fine day brought for you?

268
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,980
We just got back from a conference.

269
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:22,284
A conference. Wonderful.
What do you do?

270
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:25,101
I'm a pharmaceutical rep.

271
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,490
And I'm a psychotherapist.

272
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:31,536
Psychotherapist?
So you deal with emotional issues,

273
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,744
people looking to overcome
their fears and

274
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,040
forge meaningful
and lasting relationships?

275
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,594
Well, you could say that.

276
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,721
Fascinating.
Would you like to get a drink with me?

277
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,671
Sure.

278
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,827
Hi. You look lovely.

279
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:56,965
Thank you.

280
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:06,373
And it just seems like whenever things
start to go well in a relationship

281
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,154
something always comes up.
In this case,

282
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:11,126
you know, it's the flying, but...

283
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:15,354
Maybe I'm unlucky or maybe I just
haven't found the right girl yet.

284
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:16,653
I don't know, I just...

285
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:19,094
Well, my guess is the
problem lies with you.

286
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,676
You sabotage your relationships.

287
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,303
I do that?

288
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,192
Perhaps because you don't
lieve you're worthy of love.

289
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,691
Until you love yourself,

290
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:32,863
you're not going to be able
to love others or be loved.

291
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,816
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

292
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:40,330
Thank you, you're...
Very good.

293
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,512
- Is this still therapy?
- It is for me.

294
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,050
- We got to go. Billy's on the move.
- What, really?

295
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,211
You believe it? Our little
virgin's all grown up.

296
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,600
You don't mind, I just...

297
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:00,778
- I'm sorry. Just...
- It's OK.

298
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,813
- I guess we just wait out the night.
- When the sun comes up,

299
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,444
we nab him before he does
the walk of shame. Good stuff.

300
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:22,761
- What's going on?
- Oh, my god. We must have dozed off.

301
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,858
Do you think Billy escaped?

302
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,089
Did you look both ways?

303
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,840
Hey, guys, what's up?

304
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,313
Good god. We thought you might
have skipped out on us.

305
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,724
No way. I don't want to be
anywhere but right here.

306
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:46,640
Last night was amazing.

307
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,657
Well, I'm glad you got
to do this, Billy, but,

308
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,367
you know the deal.

309
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,729
I can't go back to hell now.
I can't.

310
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,611
You guys, Cindy and i, we connected.

311
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,422
On every level.

312
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,664
I think we're soulmates.

313
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:06,726
A lot of guys confuse sex
for love the first time.

314
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,412
You just met this woman at
a Random bar. Come on, Billy.

315
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,900
Actually, I knew she'd be there.

316
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,888
I was sort of following her.

317
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,176
She was the girl
I was coveting when I died.

318
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:25,251
When I got out of hell,
I found out she'd gotten divorced,

319
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,851
so I knew I had to take a shot.

320
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,761
And this time there is no covet.

321
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,256
Now there's only love-it.

322
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,609
That's good.

323
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,477
Hey, Tiger. Your pop-tarts are ready.

324
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,500
These guys friends of yours?

325
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:44,315
Pretty much.

326
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,580
I'm gonna be late for work, so help
yourself to anything in the kitchen.

327
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,402
I love you.

328
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,602
I love you, too.

329
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:01,330
You can't send me back, Sam.
It's just not right.

330
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:14,501
Hey. You free for lunch?

331
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:18,948
I think it's best if we kept
a professional relationship right now.

332
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,273
Right. Yeah, no, this is
completely professional.

333
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:24,622
It's a work problem. It's just...

334
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,437
It's for my other job.

335
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,503
Well, can't Sock or Ben do it?

336
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:33,028
Well, this problem really
needs somebody who's...

337
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:35,173
Smart.

338
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,249
I can see your Dilemma.

339
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:42,900
OK. Yeah, I could use a break.

340
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,036
Look how happy they are. I mean,
how am I supposed to vessel this guy?

341
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,122
- I don't know.
- String cheese?

342
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,583
- Yeah. Thanks.
- No problem.

343
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:05,869
It's just-it's so unfair that the devil
is always ruining true love, you know?

344
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:10,470
And I'm just trying to figure out a way
just one time the devil doesn't win,

345
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,294
because love is worth
fighting for, right?

346
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:17,016
Strawberry?

347
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,600
- What are you doing?
- Having snacks.

348
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,393
Oh, my god.

349
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,218
- What?
- This was all a set-up.

350
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:31,984
You just wanted to get me in the car
so that you could talk about love.

351
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,747
- That... that is crazy.
- Is it?

352
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,216
Then what is this for?

353
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:42,700
Later?

354
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,674
All right, fine. Yes, this
is somewhat of a set-up.

355
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:47,852
Fine. But you know, you've got
to give some credit.

356
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,731
- I'm trying to win you back here.
- Give you credit for what, Sam?

357
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:54,734
You trying to trick me, manipulate me.
Do you know who that sounds like?

358
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:57,588
And the devil.

359
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,789
Come on. I mean, you're being influenced
by them more and more every day.

360
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,712
No, but I'm trying to do something good.
I mean, isn't that...

361
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,240
Aren't you the least bit charmed?

362
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:12,490
That's not the point.

363
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,675
Andi, no. Wait.
Where are you going?

364
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,290
I don't know.
I don't know.

365
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:19,745
I'm walking home.

366
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,540
Hello. Baby?

367
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,645
- No. Wait, wait.
- What?

368
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,905
- Don't look. Don't look.
- What? OK. All right.

369
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,540
You ready?

370
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,419
Open your eyes!

371
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:41,695
I decorated with human furniture!

372
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:43,999
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

373
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,125
I just wanted you to feel at home.

374
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,366
Oh, baby.

375
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,543
What's that?

376
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,262
I got good news.

377
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:55,069
Now, remember how I said
I didn't want to fly

378
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,315
because I wanted to save it
for a special day?

379
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:01,340
- I was afraid.
- Of flying?

380
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,641
No, of loving myself
and letting myself by loved.

381
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,769
And that's good news?

382
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,993
That's great news
because I figured it out-

383
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,652
How to love myself.

384
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,200
I just have to remember
how wonderful I am.

385
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:16,333
And that's where this comes in.

386
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:19,300
My vision board.

387
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:22,562
It constantly reminds me
of my best qualities.

388
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,744
"Friendly." That's me.

389
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,140
I love that about myself.
I'm very friendly.

390
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:30,400
The Brooklyn Bridge.
I'm just like that Bridge.

391
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:33,537
I bring people together.
I do not collapse under pressure.

392
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,100
These guys, just like me with
Sock and Sam. Then gentlemen

393
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:42,237
boys, friendship, bromance.

394
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,320
Is any of this making sense?

395
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:46,800
I think so.

396
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,910
So, do you want to go
flying tomorrow or not?

397
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:53,298
I do.
I absolutely do.

398
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,389
Tomorrow night
for our special anniversary,

399
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:58,083
you and me, we're flying to the moon.

400
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:04,215
Baby, you would suffocate and
freeze before we got there.

401
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,252
But OK, tomorrow.

402
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:13,609
- Hey, what's that one?
- Nothing, I just like bunnies.

403
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:16,866
Oh, god.

404
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:20,257
Poppa weewee, that's cold.

405
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:27,462
- Where are your waders?
- Waders? I don't need them.

406
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,700
I like to feel the water. It helps me
locate the fish. Know what I mean?

407
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:32,900
Here we go.

408
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,500
All right.

409
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I got it.

410
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:44,090
You are a terrible fisherman.

411
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:48,229
Yeah. You know, I just thought maybe
it'd be a good idea for you and I to

412
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,712
come out here and bond a little.

413
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:51,546
You know, spend some
quality time together.

414
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:54,348
I mean, look at this. Look what
we're having. Good times. GTS.

415
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,040
Yes, good times.

416
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,706
Listen,

417
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:02,701
I feel like I could,
I could ask you anything, dad.

418
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,287
So here's one for you,

419
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,525
and, this is purely hypothetical,
by the way.

420
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,285
What if, you know,

421
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:12,108
I wanted to ask your daughter
out on a date?

422
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,740
That is outrageous to consider.

423
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,337
Yeah. Yeah, I know,
but I'm serious, though.

424
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,670
You know, I know the whole stepsister,
stepbrother thing is a little weird.

425
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,040
That's of no importance.

426
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,884
Look, Sock,

427
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:31,884
- you're certainly a nice boy.
- Thank you.

428
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:34,471
And, a funny kind of clown.

429
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:36,801
You could just say charming.

430
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,200
Kristen would not date you.

431
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,152
You aren't good enough for her.

432
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:43,801
Excuse me. Not good enough?

433
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,709
You have silly clown hair and

434
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,872
big honking clown nose.

435
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,500
Honk honk.

436
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,640
Is that funny?
Really funny. I'm a big laugh to you?

437
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,824
Check this out. Your daughter wasn't
laughing when she gave herself to me.

438
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,359
So...

439
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,099
You...
Soiled my daughter?

440
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,051
Soiled? No.

441
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:11,440
No, not soiled. No, no. I made
the sweetest love to your daughter.

442
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,561
You know, I cherished her virginity.
I cherished every moment of it.

443
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,443
What the hell was that for?

444
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,386
All right! What do you,
what do you want me.

445
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:38,665
Hey, Sam.
How are you?

446
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,161
I'm doing all right.
I just wanted to check on you.

447
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,875
It's all good in here.

448
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:47,085
You, still a grape guy?

449
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:49,525
No thanks.

450
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,664
Do you have a second to talk?

451
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:53,728
Yeah, sure.

452
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:58,216
And now I'm supposed to send
this guy Billy back to hell,

453
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,575
even though he's not evil and even
though he found the love of his life.

454
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:03,577
Sam, I actually envy the guy.

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,089
I'd rather be a soul
running free for one day

456
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,487
than to be stuck in this
decaying body forever.

457
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,218
He's out there getting
friendly with the ladies.

458
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,606
I can't even get close to your mom or...

459
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:16,477
Any other woman for that matter.

460
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:20,369
You're right,
because you're a decaying body.

461
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,100
- Thanks, Sam. Rub it in.
- No. No, I'm saying,

462
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,774
I think I have an idea for
how to keep Bill out of hell.

463
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:31,631
- I don't know about this.
- No, this is gonna work.

464
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:33,595
It has to, 'cause I don't
have any other ideas.

465
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,759
I don't know. I mean, digging
up a grave seems wrong.

466
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:38,248
I mean, disturbing the
dead is some bad Mojo.

467
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:41,207
In this case, the dead is across town
sleeping at his girlfriend's house.

468
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,834
We're just disturbing his old corpse.

469
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,140
So you think that dodgeball's
gonna work on his dead body?

470
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,293
Maybe hell will think it's a mix-up.
If not, we got to send billy back.

471
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:51,477
Either way we get to enjoy the night air
and desecrate a cemetery.

472
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,740
Found it.

473
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:56,810
"Billy Boyland.
Born 1971. Died 1993."

474
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,831
Dug up 2009.

475
00:27:03,711 --> 00:27:05,675
So how'd it go with
you and Kristen's dad?

476
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:09,525
Weel, he called me a clown, said
I wasn't good enough to date Kristen,

477
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,430
and attacked me with a fishing rod.

478
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,716
Had to escape by swimming
across the lake.

479
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,441
That's terrible, Sock.

480
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,559
Honestly, compared to some
other times when I've met the parents,

481
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:20,351
it didn't go that badly, Benji.

482
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,173
You know, he didn't pull a gun on me,
didn't try to rip off my genitals.

483
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,327
Sounds like he's got
a soft spot for you.

484
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,116
- Finished.
- Yeah?

485
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:34,755
- Is that Billy?
- I don't know what that is.

486
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,421
He was hit by a truck.

487
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,844
All right.

488
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,239
You always were good at dodgeball.

489
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,451
EPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

490
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:51,659
got my vessel?

491
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,241
Got my money?

492
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,727
Place the vessel on the mat.

493
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:04,900
It looks like it might be too big.

494
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:11,579
Right. Yeah.

495
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:18,099
- Have a nice day.
- Wait.

496
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,314
There's not i don't have
to sign anything?

497
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,266
I just want to make sure
I get the credit.

498
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,389
OK, great. Thank you. Perfect.

499
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,400
- What's that?
- Red notice.

500
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,633
What does that mean?

501
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,280
It means there was something
other than a soul inside.

502
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:36,235
What'd you put in there, potatoes?

503
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,617
What? No, no. I didn't even...
Sam's the one that got the soul.

504
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,840
Hey, douchebag. What did you do?

505
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,129
I didn't do anything.
It was probably just a glitch.

506
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:50,351
- Well, you got to fix it.
- I- what do you, I'm nofixing!

507
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:53,578
Stop it.

508
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:03,312
Don't you ever try to screw me again.

509
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,739
This was amazing.

510
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:16,424
Thank you.

511
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:17,978
My pleasure.

512
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:20,851
So...
You ready?

513
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,242
Completely ready.
Let's do this.

514
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,150
This is the perfect night for flying.

515
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,189
I say we fly out to the water,

516
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,522
cruise along the coast a little bit,
and then we'll fly inland.

517
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:44,828
I can't do this.

518
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:46,946
What?

519
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:49,510
Look, I know how important it is to you,
but I can't do it.

520
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,319
I just now realized that it's not
that I don't love myself enough

521
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:55,763
it's that I'm super afraid of flying.
And falling.

522
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:58,376
I'm sorry, Nina, i'm sorry,

523
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,907
but no, no, no.

524
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,083
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Of course.

525
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,503
A long time ago

526
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,555
I had hemophobia.

527
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,740
That ain't right. My cousin's gay.

528
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:19,078
No, hemophobia.
It's a fear of blood.

529
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,026
Well, you love blood.

530
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,997
I know. See, that's what's crazy.

531
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:26,549
I- I just had to confront my fear

532
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:30,200
and immerse myself in it.
And then once I did that,

533
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:33,705
it was great, I loved it. And now
I could bathe in it every single day.

534
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,155
That's...
Nice for you.

535
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:39,238
No, but I can help you, too.

536
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,964
The question is, will you let me?

537
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:48,591
Yes, Nina, please help me.

538
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:50,841
Perfect.

539
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,628
What are you doing? No. No!

540
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,926
You jammed up the system, Sammy.

541
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:36,399
The system is made of cogs,

542
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:38,406
and every cog must play its part.

543
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:43,505
- Please stop. Please. Please stop.
- This little cog here

544
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,148
had to muck up the machinery?

545
00:31:47,224 --> 00:31:49,188
And now look what you're making me do.

546
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm sorry.
I'll get Billy.

547
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,453
Please, I'll get him, I swear.

548
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:58,000
No, you won't. You can't.

549
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:02,335
And the sad thing is,
I won't be able to get him either.

550
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:04,500
The ender will.

551
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,776
What is "the ender"?

552
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,591
My failsafe.

553
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:13,979
I had it created for the rare occasion
when a soul gets lost

554
00:32:15,295 --> 00:32:18,168
or some idiot tries to brinG
a corpse back in its place.

555
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:21,711
The ender is released,
tracks the soul down

556
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,594
and destroys it.

557
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,853
Utterly destroys it.

558
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:29,202
And that means one less
soul for me in hell.

559
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:32,614
Well, just call the ender off.

560
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:34,092
Oh, god!

561
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,066
Call it off?

562
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:38,126
Can you call off the terminator?

563
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:39,790
You can't reason with it.

564
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:41,815
You can't stop it.

565
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,675
Well, isn't there anything we can do?

566
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,504
He dye's been cast, buddy.
Nice going.

567
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,287
Your pal Billy's gonna
wish he was back in hell

568
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:52,312
by the time the ender's
through with him.

569
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:04,273
Missed me!

570
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,319
- Hey. There's my hero.
- I came to warn you.

571
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:20,226
There's this thing called the ender.

572
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:22,394
The devil says it's coming
to destroy your soul.

573
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:26,581
Why can't anything ever go right for me?

574
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,856
I'm sorry Billy, but,

575
00:33:28,095 --> 00:33:31,005
you know, you lost your virginity,
and you fell in love.

576
00:33:31,394 --> 00:33:33,546
But I'm still a virgin.

577
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:34,679
What?

578
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,225
I wanted to connect
emotionally before we

579
00:33:37,603 --> 00:33:39,033
connected physically.

580
00:33:42,495 --> 00:33:44,286
You better start connecting
physically quick

581
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:46,587
because I have a feeling
you're running out of time.

582
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:48,300
I can't rush it, dude.

583
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:51,600
It's not just about me,
it's about Cindy's pleasure, too.

584
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:54,113
It says so right on the coom box.

585
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:59,499
Maybe I can buy you some time.
But we need to get you two out of here.

586
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,124
It was amazing.

587
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,411
I mean, one second I'm
about to eat the sidewalk,

588
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:09,000
the next I'm soaring through the city,
cradled in Nina's arms,

589
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,871
her demon breath keeping me warm.

590
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:13,643
Focus now, Benji. Come on, this
has to be the perfect love chamber.

591
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:16,225
Kid's gonna need all the help
he can get, know what I mean?

592
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:17,753
Just one second.

593
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:21,904
Nice.

594
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,513
Smile, smile.

595
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:29,429
Hello.
Welcome to storm command central.

596
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:31,796
We have everything for you to feel safe.

597
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,740
We have flashlights on the dresser,

598
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,184
and then we have daiquiris
and lotion on the nightstand.

599
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:39,242
Also, please feel free to peruse
my collection of adult erotica,

600
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,653
- both in print and Dvd.
- Why did we have to come here?

601
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,667
Well, it's safer to wait
out a storm with friends.

602
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:47,786
Exactly, so we're gonna leave
you two alone and check

603
00:34:47,846 --> 00:34:49,891
out the weather channel.
Billy you let me know when.

604
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:52,640
I'll let you know when the storm passes.
Good, great.

605
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Let's go.

606
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,100
Come on, guys.

607
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:05,125
You know, I can't believe
he's not done yet.

608
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,701
I'm impressed, man.
Billy's a stallion.

609
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,476
Smart. Girls talk to each other.

610
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,361
You're only as good as your last job,
you know what I mean.

611
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Look!

612
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:31,961
Holy crap, this is bad.

613
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,547
Come on. Go, go, go, go.

614
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,226
We have to get Billy.

615
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:58,266
Come on, Billy.

616
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:23,174
Is it gone?

617
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:26,341
What just happened?

618
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:29,916
Hey, guys.

619
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:34,070
Finally up? You dog.
Boppidy boppidy.

620
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:36,266
How does it feel to finally
lose your virginity?

621
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:38,560
How does it feel, boys?
Let me just show you.

622
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:43,884
I won't be needing this.

623
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,615
Intercourse cured your asthma?

624
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:50,254
Nobut Cindy's a pharmaceutical rep,
so she gets them for free.

625
00:36:52,057 --> 00:36:53,885
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Aces.

626
00:36:54,353 --> 00:36:57,130
Do we know what happened,
why the ender didn't come for me?

627
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,640
- Ben has a theory, actually.
- Yeah. So, during the act of love,

628
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:03,952
or at the exact moment of consummation,

629
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:06,357
2 souls became one. Yours and Cindy's.

630
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,862
Well, it's like the ender
lost your scent.

631
00:37:09,924 --> 00:37:12,001
They say the devil has no
dominion over true love.

632
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:13,519
So,

633
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:15,566
am I out?

634
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:19,143
Yeah, I mean, the devil thinks
you were destroyed by the ender,

635
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,297
and I don't even have
a vessel to capture you,

636
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,023
so yeah, that's it.

637
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,299
How could I ever repay
you guys for this?

638
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:28,549
I'm going to spend the rest
of my days making Cindy happy.

639
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,659
- Good luck, Billy.
- Good luck, Billy.

640
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:36,977
Something good happened
here today, boys.

641
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,142
The geek escaped from hell.
Geek banged a cougar.

642
00:37:40,712 --> 00:37:42,689
Ge walks away a little less of a geek.

643
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,623
And we helped.
Looks like we're his fairy bone-mothers.

644
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,440
That is a nice feeling.

645
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,509
Finally a happy ending to this crap job.

646
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:52,479
- No kidding.
- Isn't that Morgan?

647
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,662
Wait, wait, wait.

648
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,540
- No!
- Stop!

649
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,100
Wait, Morgan, stop!

650
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,951
- What are you doing?
- Hey, it's the fellas.

651
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,653
Dad told me you tend to
fall for those sob stories,

652
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:12,542
so he sent me to do the job
you couldn't do.

653
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:13,581
Give it to me.

654
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:14,953
Easy, man.

655
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:16,675
Your conscience is clear.

656
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,038
You didn't want to send him
to hell, now you don't have to.

657
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:21,439
I'll do it.
And everyone's happy, right?

658
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:31,057
Hey, you got a second?

659
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:32,952
That depends.

660
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:35,692
You're not going to pull out some
champagne on me again, are you?

661
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,479
No, no. This is strictly work-related.

662
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:40,530
I wanted to ask you
if I could leave early tonight

663
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:42,068
there's something I have to do.

664
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:44,999
I'm going to need a better
reason than that, Sam.

665
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,140
Morgan took him.
Morgan took Billy, he's back in hell.

666
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,418
- I'm sorry.
- You know, it's not fair. I...

667
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:57,425
I try to do something good, something
to make this whole thing tolerable,

668
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,400
and it's always taken away from me.

669
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:01,935
Well, if it makes any difference,

670
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:04,557
you have the rest of the night
off to do whatever you need to do.

671
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,059
Thank you.
I'll make it up to you.

672
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:09,950
You want company?

673
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,476
You know, as long as it's not a date.

674
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,239
No, it's definitely not.

675
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:22,802
Where you been hiding all day?

676
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,490
And,

677
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:27,263
where you going?

678
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:28,842
Back to Japan.

679
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:32,059
School's over, and I'm going home.

680
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:35,274
Going home? Why?
You were in school?

681
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:38,182
Yes, Sock.
Hotel management school.

682
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,545
Don't you remember me
studying all the time?

683
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:41,729
You were gonna leave

684
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:44,441
and you weren't gonna tell me, Kristen?
How could you do that?

685
00:39:45,137 --> 00:39:47,300
I was afraid it would be too painful.

686
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:49,240
OK, you don't have to leave.

687
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,753
I talked to your dad already,
and once he gets tired of beating me,

688
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:53,962
we can eventually be
happy together, you and me.

689
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,927
I'm so sorry, Sock.

690
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:58,090
In Japan

691
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:01,190
I was afraid of having
my life planned out for me,

692
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:04,736
so I decided to come to America
to discover who I was.

693
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:08,340
And then I found you.

694
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,416
And you...

695
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,812
Helped me discover so much about myself.

696
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:20,501
I came to America as a girl,

697
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:23,300
but because of you,

698
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,294
I leave it as a woman

699
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:29,253
who has discovered both her sexuality

700
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,245
and her ability to manage
an extended-stay hotel.

701
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:35,147
Right.

702
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:38,877
I owe all of that to you.

703
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,391
You're welcome.

704
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,552
Sorry, Billy.
Did everything we could.

705
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,138
You know, this ground
looks freshly dug up.

706
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,277
Yeah, we did that.

707
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,454
The OK.

708
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,750
Well, he was happy for a little while.
I mean, it has to mean something.

709
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:29,341
I hope so.

710
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,845
You're trespassing.

711
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,226
You can't be here.
I'm going to call the cops.

712
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,059
Alan, wait!

713
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:55,228
Dammit.

714
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,200
I know you're out there.

715
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:03,319
I'm gonna find you!

716
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,856
