1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:01,694
Previously on "Reaper"...

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:03,477
You're a carjacker.
Are you carjacking me?

3
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:04,898
I'm not a carjacker.
I'm the devil.

4
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:06,472
My parents sold my
soul to the devil

5
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:08,340
and I'm a bounty
hunter for hell.

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,708
- You didn't tell Andi?
- No! I'm not gonna tell Andi.

7
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:11,744
If she knows, she'll think I'm a freak.
She'll never go out with me.

8
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:13,076
Whatever man.

9
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:15,302
She was all up in your grill piece,
and you told her to take a hike.

10
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,480
- And how am I supposed to capture him?
- This will help--

11
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,916
A vessel,
handcrafted in the bowels of perdition

12
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,775
by the iniquitous and the vile.

13
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:24,627
You put a soul in hell.
How does that feel, huh?

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,871
That's pure,
unadulterated satisfaction.

15
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:29,862
All the money and tail in
the world can't compare.

16
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:10,460
Mom? Dad?

17
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,061
I need a ride!

18
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:18,223
Thanks.

19
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:21,842
That's 14 even.

20
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:24,022
Ok.

21
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:29,472
You being cute?

22
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:33,331
Uh, no, I--
I swear the money was just in my hand...

23
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,540
Along with my wallet. Um...

24
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:40,771
Ben!

25
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:42,292
Hey, would you--
hold on one second, ok?

26
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:44,093
Ben! Ben, hey.

27
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,743
Dude, I need some cash.
Can I borrow some, uh...

28
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:49,541
Some... Really?
What are you d--

29
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:51,250
I know you can hear me!

30
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:57,661
- What, just disappeared out of your hand?
- Yeah, money, wallet, keys.

31
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:59,940
- It was not a good morning.
- Oh, wait.

32
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,522
- Are these yours?
- Where'd you find those?

33
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:04,733
They were in my pocket
like 20 minutes ago.

34
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,361
I have no idea
how it got there.

35
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,363
I do.
It's my devil power kicking in.

36
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,162
Wait, to make stuff disappear?

37
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:13,612
Yeah, it's supposed to point me in
the direction of an escaped soul

38
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,800
from hell so I can hunt them
down and send them back.

39
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,143
Hey, hey. Guys. Little help?

40
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,901
It's the paint mixer rodeo.

41
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,421
That's one angry looking bull.

42
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,003
You sure you're ready for this?

43
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,823
This is not my first
time at the rodeo, son.

44
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,410
- Clock ready.
- Thank you, Ben.

45
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,252
Guys, ready?

46
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,522
Release the bull.

47
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,873
Gravity my foot!

48
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,473
Ow, not the crotch.
Not the crotch.

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,733
Sam...

50
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:13,402
- I found your wallet.
- That is awesome!

51
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:23,031
Season 1 Episode 4 - Magic
For www.forom.com

52
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:35,863
- Hi, can I help you?
- Yeah, how much is this?

53
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:37,130
Um, let me see.

54
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,663
I'll just ask someone else.

55
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:54,303
- Was that you?
- I just--

56
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,780
The devil's totally
messing with my head.

57
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,372
- You see that guy?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,263
I just had this really weird
vision that he stabbed me.

59
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:04,863
I just had this really weird cupcake,
so I guess we're even.

60
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:05,992
Uh, come on, let's go.

61
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:07,293
Where are we going?

62
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:09,731
New devil box arrived right in
the middle of the back room.

63
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,111
Scared the crap out of Ben.

64
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,990
What about me?
I just thought I got stabbed.

65
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,460
- You know how scary that is?
- Yeah, all right.

66
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:16,731
Come on, here.
Hop on. Let's go.

67
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:18,612
Come on, piggyback.
It'll cheer you up. Let's go.

68
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,102
Come on! Come on!

69
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:22,393
Eh...no. I'm good.

70
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,573
Yeah, you're a little big for that now,
aren't ya?

71
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:25,641
Just so you know,

72
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,232
I would have piggybacked
you right back there.

73
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:34,722
You know, we might as well just
open it and get it over with.

74
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,360
- Sam, your box was moving.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

75
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:42,870
It sounds like it's alive.

76
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:44,972
Like there's a little
tiny demon monster

77
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,802
trying to scratch its way out.
That would be awesome.

78
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:47,892
Can we open it?

79
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,981
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah, yeah, hi.

80
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:53,161
What are you doing?
You look guilty.

81
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,313
- No guiltier than usual.
- No, no.

82
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:57,142
- What's going on?
- I'm good.

83
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:58,511
Listen, I need to talk to you.

84
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,772
Yeah, yeah, let's--
Let's take a walk.

85
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,003
- You wanna--
- Ok. Yeah, yeah.

86
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,070
All right.

87
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:06,612
University of Idaho,
Flaming Lips concert, this weekend.

88
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:08,431
Sounds great. You going?

89
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,290
Yeah. My cousin's a student there,
so he said he can get us tickets.

90
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:12,473
What do you think?

91
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,511
- Us, as in me?
- Yeah!

92
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,901
Oh, good, yeah.

93
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,063
You know, all of us.
Ben, Sock, Josie.

94
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:20,473
I mean, it's a 7-hour drive,

95
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,362
but we can just take
turns at the wheel.

96
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,323
I guess, you know,
we need a place to spend the night.

97
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,001
Um, Sock.
Sock's uncle has a van.

98
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:27,741
- We could crash there.
- Perfect!

99
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:28,780
- Yeah.
- Ok, great.

100
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,771
We'll just have a van
slumber party then.

101
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:33,262
Oh, but you should know...
I snore.

102
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,463
Extremely loud,
like a 50-year-old man.

103
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:37,152
Heh. Nice.

104
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:38,901
It's really attractive.

105
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,881
Well, I myself am
a drooler, so...

106
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:42,691
- Oh! Fantastic then.
- Perfect.

107
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:46,193
I mean,
this is gonna be so much fun, right?

108
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,852
I mean, just the 5 of us
going away for the weekend.

109
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:50,200
We'll have bed head together.

110
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,971
- It's gonna be--
- My office now.

111
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,993
And bring the morons.

112
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:02,373
Ok. Can you tell me about
this can of wasted paint?

113
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,433
It's leaking onto your desk.

114
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:09,600
I found 6 others just
like it in the dumpster.

115
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:12,292
Seems the rodeo
is back in town.

116
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,493
What can I say, Ted?
You can't fence this cowboy in.

117
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,691
Well, congratulations.

118
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:18,001
You have just incurred
the wrath of Ted.

119
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:19,131
Hold on a second.

120
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:20,871
I wasn't even there.
Why am I being punished?

121
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,081
Because, Andi,
if you're not part of the solution,

122
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,012
then you're part
of the problem.

123
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:28,153
There will be no more talking
of a social nature at work.

124
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,001
Any of you.

125
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:33,062
- Hold on. Why?
- Why, Sam?

126
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:36,543
Because the Work
Bench is my world,

127
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,602
and I will not let your
chaos destroy my world.

128
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,042
So that means there will
be no more talking,

129
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:45,241
chit-chatting, and/or
yarn spinning.

130
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,121
I'm sorry, Ted. I'm not feelin'
this plan. What else you got?

131
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,512
Oh, I got weekend shifts,

132
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,181
night shifts, holiday hours.

133
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,810
I have the power to
destroy your social lives

134
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:58,882
until you beg me...

135
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:02,052
To fire you.

136
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:04,562
So good day, sir.

137
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,031
You know what, Sam?

138
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:10,931
I think that I am
outraged right now.

139
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,673
Good to know, yeah.
Can you help me, please?

140
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,350
I ca--I can't, Sam.

141
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:18,192
I'm too disgruntled, all right?

142
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:21,493
I mean, give me a break.
No talking at work?

143
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,490
I mean, what's next?
Take away the air that I breathe?

144
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,496
Take away the beer that I'm
about to drink on my break?

145
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,405
- Come on.
- What? You got beer?

146
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,507
Where'd you get beer?
I actually hit the

147
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,503
diet iced tea button
the vending machine,

148
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,033
and this just came out.
I think maybe it's a sign.

149
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,963
Want half? Yes, I want half.

150
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:39,531
Yeah? I love you right now.

151
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,871
Have a seat, bro.

152
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,791
You know what?
Don't worry about it, man.

153
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,702
It'll all blow over it's Ted.
It's a cycle.

154
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:46,352
- He always does this.
- I'm not like you, man.

155
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:48,140
I can't just sit back and
let Ted walk all over me.

156
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,523
I don't--what?
I don't let Ted walk all over me.

157
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,521
- What are you talking about?
- Sure, you do. And it's ok

158
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,252
because beta males
are in right now.

159
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,683
Ok? Chicks dig it.
Good to know. Good to know.

160
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,953
I refuse to accept
Ted's power over me.

161
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,833
We have rights, ok?

162
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,072
We are not machines.
We are not robots.

163
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,032
Be cooler if we were robots.

164
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,860
- You know who I'd be if I was a robot?
- Who?

165
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:12,753
The hot chick from
Terminator 3.

166
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:15,720
First I would tear this
building down brick by brick,

167
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,492
then I would go home,
lock myself in the bathroom,

168
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,640
and stare at my boobs
for as long as I wanted.

169
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,021
Which would be a long time.

170
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:23,120
And then Ted would have
no power over you.

171
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:24,401
Testify.

172
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,392
Oh, Sam.

173
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,620
Life's too short
to drink domestic.

174
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,662
- What's that?
- What?

175
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:46,132
I could go for one of
these apples. You?

176
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:49,323
What the hell happened here?

177
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,630
Oh--oh, my god. We--

178
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:58,992
We need to call an ambulance.

179
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,751
No, Sam. It's ok.

180
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,900
There's no point.
He's dead already.

181
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,123
You know,
one day you're coming home,

182
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:06,852
happy as a clam, and then boom,

183
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,760
you're gone.

184
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:10,961
That's the way life is Sam.

185
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:13,433
You've got to eat your
apples while you can.

186
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,660
So, let me guess,
an escaped soul from hell did this.

187
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:16,690
That's very good.

188
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,500
You're starting to
catch on to this.

189
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,393
But you know what
the funny thing is?

190
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,472
The coroner's gonna blame this
guy's death on the car crash.

191
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,060
The truth?

192
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,391
This fellow died while
the car was still moving.

193
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,112
How?

194
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,771
Who knows?

195
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:34,680
It's like... magic.

196
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,490
Ok, so where's the soul?

197
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,350
I'm not Google, Sam.

198
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,940
Well, don't you have
minions down in hell

199
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,740
keep track of these things,
like who's escaped recently?

200
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,532
I don't know how it works.
Come on.

201
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:46,390
Minions. You know who works
for me in my central office?

202
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,693
White-collar criminals.

203
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:49,690
They hate me.
They hate their jobs.

204
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,910
I'm lucky if I get
coffee in the morning.

205
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,793
Oh... ok.

206
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,780
I'll help you.

207
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:59,792
I remember the file.

208
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,973
In life,
the soul's name was Bellifiore.

209
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:05,502
That's it?

210
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,492
That--that's not gonna
help me find him now.

211
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:08,853
This could take forever.

212
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,642
Well, since when are you in such
a hurry to catch souls for me?

213
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,810
Because I--I care
about these people.

214
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,333
I mean, look at this guy.

215
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,033
Are you sure it's not because
you have some other plans?

216
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,400
Plans to...

217
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:21,862
lock lips with somebody?

218
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,440
Flaming Lips?

219
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,500
Look, look, I just--

220
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,592
The concert isn't
until this weekend, ok?

221
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,023
And I just--I figured if I
could take the soul down fast,

222
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:31,513
then I could still go,
you know?

223
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,440
A little vacation
for a job well done.

224
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:36,213
Well, here's the thing
about that, Sammy.

225
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,121
When your parents signed
the contract for your soul,

226
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:41,403
they didn't think to
ask about vacation days,

227
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:43,293
- so you don't get them.
- So that's it?

228
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,771
I work for you for
the rest of my life?

229
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:45,852
No vacation, nothing?

230
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:47,293
Yeah.

231
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,303
And I'm afraid I
won't budge on this.

232
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,950
- Sets a bad precedent.
- God, you sound like Ted.

233
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,423
Ohh, that was harsh.

234
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:56,322
Ted is a real douche bag.

235
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,143
Yeah, well, the truth hurts.

236
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:00,073
You push me around, you know.

237
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,230
You make up these
totally arbitrary rules

238
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:04,653
and expect me to just
be your little robot?

239
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,481
No! I'm sorry, ok?

240
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:08,702
I refuse to accept your power over me,
all right?

241
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:10,292
I'm not your machine.

242
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,582
I trust I've made my point.

243
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,101
Loud and clear.

244
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:46,843
What is in that thing?

245
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:49,051
Whatever it is,
it was forged in hell.

246
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:52,620
Sock, you really think that's
gonna help you slow it down?

247
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,393
- Ben, you want to trade?
- No.

248
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,032
Ok.

249
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:01,303
- I'm going in.
- All right, get it.

250
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,803
- I'm going in.
- Nice and easy.

251
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:06,322
- I'm gonna do it.
- Nice and easy.

252
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:23,590
He's cute!

253
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,570
Pretty bird.

254
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:30,513
All right,
so we have the vessel,

255
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:34,511
but all we know about the soul is
that his name was Bellifiore...

256
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:36,583
When he was alive. Ok.

257
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,280
812 hits?

258
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:41,523
All right,
we gotta narrow this down a little.

259
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:44,103
- How?
- Bellifiore, soul.

260
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,862
Nope. Ok. Bellifiore, evil.

261
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,093
- Plus
- Evil. Sock...

262
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,040
Now the mouse has disappeared!

263
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:56,942
I swear, the devil doesn't
even want me to solve this.

264
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,942
- Guys?
- Sam?

265
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:01,320
Do I hear
unauthorized chit-chat?

266
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:05,812
What, are you talking
to yourself again, Sam?

267
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:09,671
That is a sad,
sad state of affairs, my friend.

268
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:12,200
Because no one answers.

269
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:13,761
Ever.

270
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,453
As you were.

271
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,790
God, I thought you
guys disappeared, too.

272
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:27,272
This power's stupid, Sam.

273
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,331
If making things disappear
is supposed to be a clue,

274
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:31,803
I don't get it.

275
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,421
Wait, wait, that's good!

276
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:35,030
Disappear. Hold on.

277
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:40,303
- Bellifiore, disappear.
- Yes! All right. Good job.

278
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:42,912
Enrico Bellifiore was a
magician in the 1920s.

279
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,383
Never head of him.

280
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:47,710
He's featured on a documentary
DVD Dark Side of Magic.

281
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:50,783
Let's find that.
Maybe... Come on.

282
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:53,020
There's 2 copies in
store right now.

283
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,583
Mm. God bless you, Work Bench.
You have everything.

284
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:56,792
Awesome.

285
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,380
How much for the flat screen?

286
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,520
Uh, a million dollars.
Try best buy.

287
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,253
Dateline 1929.

288
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:11,663
Former stage magician
Enrico Bellifiore

289
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,960
walks the last mile for murder.

290
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,802
A young waiter with dreams of
becoming the next Houdini,

291
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:20,790
Bellifiore traded in his
breadsticks for magic tricks.

292
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:25,210
The unadoring masses felt Bellifiore
needed to sharpen his skills.

293
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,262
What? I saw wires.
Did you guys see wires?

294
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:28,573
And so did the theater,

295
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:31,361
so Bellifiore took
one last stab at fame,

296
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,483
and the crowds lined up to
see this malevolent magician

297
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:37,780
perform his final rope trick.

298
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:41,371
And this has been another
edition of movie-vue news.

299
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,760
- Ok. All right.
- That's news with a view!

300
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,543
Now we know who Bellifiore
was when he was alive.

301
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:47,192
We just need to figure
out where he is now.

302
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:49,240
Sam Oliver for carry out,
register 2.

303
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,021
- Sam Oliver, register 2.
- That's Andi.

304
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,722
You gonna tell her you
can't go to the concert?

305
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:56,702
Don't really have a choice.
The devil made it pretty clear.

306
00:14:56,977 --> 00:15:00,721
- I need to talk to you about the concert.
- Oh, yeah. I...

307
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,633
I could only get 2 tickets.

308
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,920
Oh, well, then just--
uh, maybe go with Josie.

309
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,250
Well, I mean, in all fairness,
I did ask you first.

310
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:12,083
You're--wait, yeah.

311
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:15,451
- But, what, so just you and me together?
- Yeah.

312
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:16,972
What's the big deal?

313
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:20,251
Well, where would--

314
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,562
- Where would we sleep?
- My car.

315
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,450
It'll be tight, but...

316
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:26,723
Well, I mean,
if you're not up for it,

317
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,201
then I completely understand.

318
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,240
No, no, no! I'm up for it!
I'm completely up for it.

319
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:32,130
Very, very up. I--

320
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,133
- Well, great.
- All right, yeah. That sounds great.

321
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,191
- Oh. You got it from here?
- Oh. Yes, yes.

322
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,141
- Sam!
- Sorry. I got it. I got it.

323
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,100
Nora, don't throw food.

324
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:53,780
It's ok. It--it happens.

325
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,471
Uh... excuse me, ma'am. Where--

326
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,573
Where did you find
all these apples?

327
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:01,821
I'm confused.

328
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,791
You and Andi are going to
the concert alone overnight.

329
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:06,143
That's right.

330
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,691
Well, what about the devil
saying no vacation time?

331
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:11,370
Ben, we're talking about me
and Andi alone overnight.

332
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:13,370
Come on, this is my shot.
I have to take it.

333
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,183
Ok, but what about the devil?

334
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:18,170
I'm choosing to not think
about that right now.

335
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:19,470
Oh, really.

336
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,762
Hey, look at that sword.

337
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,400
That's got to be our guy.

338
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,422
You know,
maybe if we catch him fast,

339
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:28,270
the devil might let me go
to the concert with Andi.

340
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:29,921
Yeah, 'cause he's a
real peach like that.

341
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,771
So then we point the birdcage
at the soul and open the door.

342
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,953
I guess.
Not like there's any moving parts.

343
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:37,490
- When does the bird come in?
- Maybe he's bait.

344
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:40,050
Wait, I'm sorry, bait?
Nobody's hurting Winston.

345
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,611
Who's Winston? The bird.

346
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:45,142
You named the vessel?

347
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:48,630
Dude, Winston is not
a bird's name, Ben.

348
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:51,132
Ok, well,
you tell me what a bird's name is.

349
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,950
I don't know.
Uh, how about Flappy or Paul.

350
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:56,052
Wha--no, no, he's a Winston.

351
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,911
- Right, Winston?
- What is wrong with you?

352
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,370
My dad's super allergic.

353
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,131
You know,
I couldn't have any pets,

354
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:04,001
so this little guy
fills that void.

355
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:05,842
You said I filled
that void, Ben.

356
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,781
Oh, my god.

357
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,232
Look at this toolbox.

358
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:15,720
Is that all I have to do is
slap on a little guyliner,

359
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,332
- I get to shower with Cameron Diaz?
- Uh, probably not.

360
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,881
- Well, it's her loss.
- She wouldn't think so.

361
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,181
Sorry, sorry.

362
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,351
How's he do that
with the sword?

363
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:36,461
He's an escaped soul.
It could be real magic.

364
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,441
You guys want to
see some real magic?

365
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:39,932
Check this out.

366
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:45,663
It's gone. Where'd it go?

367
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:50,540
What are we waiting for?

368
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,981
We can't just suck him in
with all these people around.

369
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:56,051
Let's just catch
him after the show.

370
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,240
So that's it?

371
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,612
What, no cheering?
No standing ovation?

372
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,392
It's not funny.

373
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,250
I perform magic no
one else can touch,

374
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,193
and all you do is
just sit there.

375
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:18,702
What do you people want?

376
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,680
Maybe you need proof--

377
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,481
Proof that I'm the greatest
magician in the world.

378
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,692
What's the matter, mate?
Don't you like my show?

379
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:29,060
I don't know.
I'm just headed to the restroom.

380
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,040
And that's better than my act?

381
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:34,033
You're a magician
at a food festival.

382
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:35,393
What do you want from me?

383
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:37,862
Come on, why don't you get
up on stage for a trick

384
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:40,492
guaranteed to impress you?
To impress all of you?

385
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:43,081
Come on, everybody, a round of
applause to encourage this guy.

386
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,330
Come on, come on.

387
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:47,872
Is this a real sword?

388
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,200
It's real.

389
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,552
You better believe it.

390
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:15,752
You gotta admit that
was a pretty good trick.

391
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,762
Let's catch him backstage.
Come on. Come on.

392
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,052
I want an autograph.

393
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:22,220
Hey, I waited out front till the
lobby was empty. No sign of him.

394
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,450
Yeah, and he didn't
pass me out back.

395
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,613
Damn it, we lost him.

396
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,572
All right, it sucks the soul got away,
but at least nobody died, right?

397
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,423
Yeah, and nothing
happened to Winston.

398
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,860
And nobody died, too.

399
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:38,741
What happened?

400
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,652
Excuse me.
What happened to him?

401
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,133
Oh, we found him keeled over,

402
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,810
massive internal injuries.

403
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:48,623
Must have been hit by
a car or something.

404
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,361
Another beer, please.

405
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,360
You know, I've never seen a
dead body up close before.

406
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,630
- It's messed up.
- I know, right?

407
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:12,260
I mean you'd think that seeing
scarface all those times,

408
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,242
I'd be better prepared
for that, but...

409
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,131
- Why'd the magician kill that guy?
- I don't know.

410
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:18,811
I feel like He
hates the audience.

411
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:21,631
Like he blames them for his
crappy career when he was alive.

412
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:24,153
Well, at least we know
where he's gonna be.

413
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,992
The next performance
is tomorrow at noon,

414
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,483
which means we need to
ask Ted for time off.

415
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,491
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

416
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,002
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

417
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:33,930
Let me...

418
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,283
You need help.

419
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm worried about Winston.

420
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:40,600
He's innocent in all this.

421
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,391
What about me, man?
I'm an innocent.

422
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,771
You're not feeding me pretzels
and nestling me to your breast.

423
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:45,981
Ok, that's just gross.

424
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:48,403
Because you signed a contract
with the devil, Sam.

425
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:50,630
- No, I did not.
- You didn't sign anything?

426
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,043
- No. No, my parents did.
- That's weird.

427
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,581
Says the guy with the
shirt full of bird.

428
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:58,191
Dude, you should really take
a look at that contract.

429
00:20:58,228 --> 00:21:00,723
That's not cool your parents
sold your soul to the devil

430
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,450
without your consent.
Isn't that right, little man?

431
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:06,031
Yeah, that's a good point.

432
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:09,583
See if my parents have a copy
of the contract somewhere.

433
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,981
Hey, good morning.
You're up early.

434
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:22,630
- Can I see my contract?
- Which contract is that?

435
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:27,580
Uh...it's... the contract.

436
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:30,481
You know, for my soul?

437
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,111
What do you want
to see that for?

438
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,263
Well, I just thought
I should see it.

439
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:39,801
You know what? You're right.

440
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,021
You deserve to see it.

441
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:46,580
Ok, uh, let me think.
Where did we put that?

442
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,893
Well, what's in there?

443
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:51,442
This is your memento box.

444
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:55,053
I haven't looked
in here in years.

445
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:02,372
You put the contract for my soul
with my third-grade report card

446
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,903
- and Mr. Huggles?
- Yeah, you're right.

447
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:07,552
It's not gonna be in here.

448
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:10,773
Ok, maybe your dad
knows where it is.

449
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:18,213
Oh. Well, uh...

450
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,023
Did you check the linen closet?

451
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,901
Yes. John, you know,

452
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:24,293
I don't understand why you can't
get a handle on the paperwork.

453
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,213
We have absolutely
no filing system.

454
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:29,070
I konw you keep your golf
cleats and tennis shoes...

455
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,802
- You're up, John.
- Can we talk about this later?

456
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,292
Fine. But that's your
answer to everything.

457
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:36,170
Just... uh...

458
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,530
- Check the office with the tax returns.
- Ok.

459
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:42,541
Come on, Sam.

460
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,611
Here it is.

461
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,343
- This is kind of a big deal.
- I know.

462
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:05,653
What's wrong?

463
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,011
It fell apart.

464
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:26,692
Don't disappear.

465
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:28,142
Don't disappear.

466
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,221
Don't disappear.

467
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,530
Son of a bitch!

468
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,780
Hey, you want a ride?

469
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,641
Oh, just leave me alone!

470
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,311
Aw, come on. Hop in.

471
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:08,420
I want you to feel
the V8 in this baby.

472
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:09,792
Yeah, what are you
gonna want in return?

473
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,290
Do I have to sign a contract?

474
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:12,721
You know, Sam...

475
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:15,800
Sarcasm is the lowest
form of social discourse.

476
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,631
Just go--go away!
What are you doing here?

477
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:20,281
What's eating you, champ?

478
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:22,901
How about you--
you own my soul?

479
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,493
You won't let me
take any vacations.

480
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:27,572
I mean, the contract you gave
my parents just turned to dust!

481
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:30,413
- Forget about the contract.
- No. No, I want to see it.

482
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:31,861
But why?

483
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,931
- Because I want to know my rights.
- Oh, that's easy.

484
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:36,591
You don't have any.

485
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:41,070
Go around!

486
00:24:43,597 --> 00:24:45,311
Go to hell, jerk!

487
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:49,060
I'll meet you there, Bruce!

488
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:52,870
You know that little
thing on his neck?

489
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,702
- Not a freckle.
- Ok...

490
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,151
So I'm--I'm a slave.

491
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:00,272
And I catch one soul after
another for the rest of my life.

492
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:02,363
No days off.
Nothing to look forward to forever.

493
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:04,361
Oh, so that's what
you want--incentive.

494
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:06,153
- Yes.
- Oh, I can do that.

495
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:08,752
I can motivate you 110%.

496
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,203
Wait, no! What--

497
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:13,303
What are you gonna do?!

498
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:26,600
- Can I help you?
- No.

499
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,183
- Hi! Can I help you?
- No.

500
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,272
Hi, I'm Andi. Can I help you?

501
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:43,093
You know... I bet you can.

502
00:25:53,477 --> 00:25:54,900
Here you are.

503
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,712
Magic show starts in 40 minutes.
We better deal with Ted.

504
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,903
I got the perfect plan.

505
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,663
Hey, hey. Uh, Ted.
Ted! Kaczynski!

506
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,331
We were wondering if we
could take an early lunch,

507
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:24,333
if that's ok.

508
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:26,211
Why do you need
to get off work?

509
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:27,542
I'm glad you asked, Ted.

510
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:31,800
Drywell is having a driveway
sealant seminar at lunch, Ted,

511
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,140
basic information on installation,
maintenance, what have you.

512
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,502
And I know that you've
been trying to beef up the

513
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:39,311
driveway sealant department
for quite some time,

514
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:40,540
as well as our knowledge

515
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:42,721
of driveway sealants,
so we thought we'd go over there

516
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:45,983
and bone up on driveway sealant.
That's that.

517
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:48,510
You know what, guys?
That sounds like a great idea.

518
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:50,551
It sound responsible.
Efficient, even.

519
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,320
I told you he'd be
cool with it, right?

520
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,052
Great, thanks.

521
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:57,350
Only if I was a complete
and utter idiot.

522
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:03,463
Guys, seriously.

523
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:05,211
Driveway sealant?

524
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:07,050
Think I'm just gonna
let you blow off work

525
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,983
to go to a magic
show with Andi?

526
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:11,810
- Heh! Magic show. Please!
- Wait, wait!

527
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:14,253
Ted, how do you know about
a magic show with Andi?

528
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:15,633
What are you talking about?

529
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,952
'Cause some guy was in here
giving away free tickets.

530
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:20,262
Was this guy in a suit,
really, really tan...

531
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:21,461
You know what, Sam?

532
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:24,101
I'm not really in the habit
of checking other men out.

533
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,750
Unlike some people I know.

534
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:28,340
Huh? Oh, sorry. Heh!

535
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:31,322
I was so busy checking out your ass,
I missed your funny joke.

536
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,753
- Ok, come on, come on. Let's go.
- Did you want to repeat it, or...

537
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:40,593
Whoa, wha-- Why are we running?

538
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:44,972
The devil's trying to set up Andi.
Let's go.

539
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:47,152
Wait, wait!
Let me catch my breath! Sam!

540
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,033
Relax. He'll be back.

541
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:51,402
- Where the hell's the bird?
- He got out.

542
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:55,163
- What? How?
- We were talking.

543
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,903
All right,
just catch the bird and

544
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:58,463
meet me at the magic show.

545
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:02,110
Come on, Winston. Come to daddy.
We have to go now.

546
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:05,172
- I'll bring him down.
- I will cut you where you stand.

547
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:12,301
So what is it now,
roof tar class?

548
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:15,413
Look, Ted...
I'll work the weekend shift.

549
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,790
I'll work the next
4 weekend shifts!

550
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,761
I'll work nights!
Hell, I'll even work Thanksgiving!

551
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,393
- Come on!
- Seriously, you'd...

552
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:24,183
- You'd give up all that?
- Yes. Now move!

553
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:26,103
Ok then.

554
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:32,623
Ted is good.

555
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,871
Hey, what took you so long?

556
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:56,183
- What do you mean?
- I got your voicemail to meet you here.

557
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:58,931
- Voicemail? In my voice?
- Um, yeah?

558
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:00,971
What, you don't
remember leaving it?

559
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,591
Uh...that message.
Yes, yes. I do.

560
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:06,183
Um, sorry,
I had a small stroke earlier.

561
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:07,852
- We gotta go. Let's--
- No, no!

562
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:10,451
- This is kind of fun.
- This--he sucks! Let's go.

563
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,111
He's right behind me, isn't he?

564
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,241
I suck.

565
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:21,240
Why don't you come up on stage and
let me show you some real magic?

566
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:25,063
I--I would do that,
but we were just leaving.

567
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,783
Ladies and gentlemen, come on,
give this guy some encouragement.

568
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:30,751
No, no! Seriously, no.
Andi, stop laughing.

569
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,922
- We gotta go.
- You're such a chicken.

570
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:35,861
- You know what? I'll do it.
- No! No, you can't.

571
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,802
Why not? It'll be fun.
I'll do it.

572
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,850
Because... he asked me first.

573
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:43,080
- Right?
- Ok.

574
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,441
Let's do this.

575
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:58,530
You looking for something?

576
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:01,512
This isn't enough to
hold your attention?

577
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:05,282
Uh, no. My friends are supposed
to meet me here, so I was...

578
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,052
- Touch it.
- What?

579
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:09,263
Touch the sword.
Tell them it's real.

580
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:13,233
I don't know. Seems...

581
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,960
- Could be fake.
- Hold it. It's real.

582
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,581
Yeah, that's, uh...

583
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:22,260
That's some pretty good
action right there. Yeah.

584
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:25,423
Ladies and gentlemen,

585
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:28,141
looks like our volunteer's
contracted a case of stage fright.

586
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:29,623
We'll be right back.

587
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:37,170
Give me back my sword.

588
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:40,782
You need it, don't you?

589
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:43,642
You have no power without it.

590
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,422
What are you, a demon?

591
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:48,080
No, I'm just the guy
sending you back to hell.

592
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,491
Just as soon as my
friends show up.

593
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:54,622
I'm not gonna let you
kill anymore people!

594
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,371
Those yokels out there
get what they deserve.

595
00:30:58,046 --> 00:30:59,761
I give them pure magic,

596
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,852
and they respond like a
bunch of slack-jawed cattle.

597
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:04,442
Yeah, well,
maybe they respond that way

598
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:06,433
because you're such
a total dickwad.

599
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:08,690
You have no idea what
I went through in hell,

600
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:12,002
what I feels like to be impaled
on a sword for decades on end.

601
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,960
Yeah, well, get used to it,
because you're going back.

602
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,133
Sam! You all right?

603
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:41,793
No, no! He's right behind me!

604
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:44,910
Give me the vessel.
Give me the vessel.

605
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,913
Wave it around! Wave it around!

606
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:50,693
You stupid bird, come on!

607
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:52,501
- Come on! Come on!
- Go, go!

608
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:54,653
- Come on, Winston!
- Go, Winston!

609
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,242
- Come on, come on. Come on, Winston.
- It's sad.

610
00:32:57,796 --> 00:33:01,410
So stupid, you can't even figure
out the simplest of tricks.

611
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,681
Huh? Tricks? Tricks.

612
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,783
That's it! That's it!

613
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:10,280
Sam, what are you doing, Sam?

614
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:15,132
Uh, ta da?

615
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:23,863
Winston?

616
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:45,952
That, my friend...

617
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:47,870
was some fine hell sucking.

618
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:49,182
Come on.

619
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:01,302
Aw, that was awesome.

620
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,072
Hi, Gladys.

621
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:10,351
You are looking... today!

622
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,421
Place the vessel on the mat.

623
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,962
It's gonna be kind of
difficult with all that

624
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,393
sexual tension pushing back.

625
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:20,651
You ready?

626
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:23,241
Yeah.

627
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:26,330
Oh, I--can I have a moment?

628
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:31,081
Winston...

629
00:34:33,347 --> 00:34:35,311
You're one freaky ass bird

630
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,652
who scared the crap out of me,
and now I can't be comfortable

631
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,992
around birds ever again.
I hope you know that.

632
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:46,533
Ok.

633
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:47,873
- All right.
- Cool.

634
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,151
It's cool.

635
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,003
Ok.

636
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,172
- Thank you, Gladys.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

637
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,901
These are his favorite.

638
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:57,882
Ok, now I'm done.

639
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,541
So what did happen to you?

640
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:13,760
Yeah, that was a hell
of a magic trick.

641
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:15,493
He made you both disappear.

642
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,762
Why did you run off the stage?

643
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:20,132
Yeah, I, um...

644
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,042
- I ate a bad hotdog, so--
- Ooh. Yeah, well...

645
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,340
You better man up for
this weekend because

646
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:28,850
we have a long trip and
limited bathroom stops.

647
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,261
Right, yes. Um, about that...

648
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:35,192
I...I can't go.

649
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:38,670
What? Are you that sick?

650
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,730
No, no, no. Um...I'm working.

651
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:44,521
I told Ted that I'd work
the next 4 weekend shifts.

652
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:45,650
What?

653
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:47,372
Why would you say that?

654
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,253
I mean, you knew we were
going away this weekend.

655
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:50,611
Don't be mad. I--

656
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:54,031
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just... I'm confused.

657
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:55,640
I mean,
if you didn't want to go with me,

658
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:57,073
why wouldn't you just say that,

659
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:59,300
and why saddle yourself
with weekend shifts?

660
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:03,663
- Th--that is an excellent question.
- Ok, then answer it.

661
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:05,793
That I can't-- I can't answer.

662
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,583
It's hard to explain,
all right?

663
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:09,893
I--I tried,
but Ted wouldn't let me.

664
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:11,552
It's not that I
didn't want to--

665
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:12,951
Ok, you know what?
I take it back.

666
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,002
I am mad.

667
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:16,233
- Wait, Andi, hold on!
- You know what?

668
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,612
We could've had a really
great weekend, Sam.

669
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,913
And then you had to get all caught
up in your head and make it weird.

670
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,132
No! I don't think it's weird.
It's the opposite.

671
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:26,161
- It's not weird.
- Yes, it feels weird.

672
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,672
Listen, you're like
my best friend, ok?

673
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,993
I really don't want
things to change.

674
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:33,841
And they won't!
We--we're--we are friends.

675
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:38,470
Just friends that can't spend
time alone together, huh?

676
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:42,320
Never mind. Never mind.

677
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,123
Listen, I'll bring you
back a program, ok?

678
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:59,203
Ah, drinking alone.

679
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:01,443
That's a slippery slope.

680
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:03,873
I don't have much else to do.

681
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,903
I'll have a cranberry and soda,
my good woman.

682
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,201
I never drink while I work.
Clouds the mind.

683
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:14,040
Maybe if you drank,
you'd be less of a dick.

684
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,740
Hmm, yeah.

685
00:37:17,637 --> 00:37:18,990
Oh, buddy.

686
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,673
You've worked hard, sacrificed.

687
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,781
I really appreciate that.

688
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,080
You know what?

689
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:29,831
You can take the weekend off.

690
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:31,543
Go to your little concert.

691
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,952
Drop some ecstasy,
whatever you want.

692
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:35,661
I work this weekend.

693
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:38,651
I work the next 4
weekends because of you.

694
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:41,100
- What did I do?
- You put Andi in danger.

695
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:46,010
Yeah, right. I did, didn't I?

696
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,471
Well, this really sucks.

697
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,622
Can't go on your trip.

698
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,552
You don't get the girl.

699
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,050
You expect me to believe
you feel bad for me?

700
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:01,891
- I do!
- No, you don't.

701
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:03,762
I do, I do. I feel terrible.

702
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,732
I feel crappy. I feel awful.

703
00:38:06,756 --> 00:38:09,500
You sure there's nothing I
can do to make it up to you?

704
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:15,350
I want the contract.

705
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,230
What do you have? A death wish?

706
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,953
Well, I realized if
anything's gonna kill me,

707
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:25,110
it's gonna be some psycho
escaped soul from hell, not you.

708
00:38:25,566 --> 00:38:28,962
Because... you need me.

709
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:32,031
And I--

710
00:38:32,317 --> 00:38:33,702
I need that contract.

711
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:43,252
See, what is it
about you, Sammy?

712
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,830
I just can't say no.

713
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:49,992
All right,
I'll talk to the guys downstairs and

714
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,532
see if they can dig up a draft,
all right?

715
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:54,230
Filing system in the abyss is

716
00:38:54,696 --> 00:38:58,550
shabby, as you might expect,
but I'll put in a request.

717
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:02,581
- Ok? Fair enough?
- Yes. Thank you.

718
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:04,191
Yeah, well...

719
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:08,243
What the heck.
I'll have what he's having.

720
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:12,260
You know the one bright
side of all this?

721
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:14,831
Now you know that
Andi's into you.

722
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,451
- No, she almost bit my head off.
- Exactly.

723
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,533
The lady don't protest too much,
me thinks.

724
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,501
Thanks.

725
00:39:23,038 --> 00:39:25,072
Do you--
do you really think so?

726
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:26,590
Trust me, buddy.

727
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,742
I do know a thing or two
about the human animal.

728
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:33,242
Thanks to Raceman
