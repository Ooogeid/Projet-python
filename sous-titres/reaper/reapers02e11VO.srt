1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,019
All right, come on. Square it up.
Square those massive shoulders.

2
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:06,170
- Sam, she's not squaring up.
- What are they doing?

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,470
They're arm-wrestling.
Sock has never beaten her.

4
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:10,255
This is what she does.
Watch her thumb.

5
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:13,428
- Normal.
- Sock... calm down.

6
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:17,224
A statement and a question.
You're gorgeous. Can I buy you a drink?

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,730
She has a drink.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,431
Well, when you change your mind,
i'll be at the bar.

9
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,024
- You believe that? Like who does that?
- Weird.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,272
You know what, Ben?
Take the tie off, Sam wrap it up.

11
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,570
- You are so dramatic.
- No room for air.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,267
- All right.
- Okay, less and tight, she's a cheater.

13
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,116
I'm Xavier. But you can call me X.

14
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:40,870
What's your name?

15
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:43,709
And this is my boyfriend Ben.

16
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:45,930
Nina. That's beautiful.

17
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,470
In the native American
language of Quechua,

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,435
Nina means "fire." Are you fiery?

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,421
- She is, and she's taken.
- Really? Does he own you?

20
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:55,970
I'm not interested. Thank you.

21
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,640
You'll come with me to my table,
we'll share a bottle of pinot,

22
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,670
then we'll go back to my loft.

23
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,856
We'll make love,
slow and gentle... hard.

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,344
What? What? Dude,
you need to leave, like right now.

25
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:09,109
You hear me?
Like right now, dude.

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,787
What the hell was that?

27
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,431
I don't know.
This place is full of creeps tonight.

28
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,758
It's like he even listening
like he's on drugs or something.

29
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,870
You know what? To be fair,
Nina is super-fo and you're... you.

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,121
So people have a hard time believing you
guys are dating. Let's do this thing!

31
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:29,806
- Finally!
- You get no power Boss.

32
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,382
Count three. Ready...

33
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:37,627
I'm gonna blow through you
like gas through a funnel.

34
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:41,224
It's fate, you know,
'cause I'm coming... Over the top.

35
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,655
No, no, no...
Not this time.

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,769
Ho ho! Finally.
You're just a weak little girl!

37
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:53,654
You okay?

38
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:56,748
Did you see that? You want to see
what defeat looks like, take a picture.

39
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:59,770
Yeah, here's something for you.
Got a little something for you.

40
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,939
- What is he doing?
- I choreographed this one.

41
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,453
You should sit down 'cause it's
gonna take about 10 minutes. Do it!

42
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:08,085
M-A-M-A, we know how you got that way,
your mama!

43
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,378
- Your mama!
- Stupid.

44
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,720
I'm gonna go get some more tunes.

45
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,852
As you can see, the clarity is stunning.

46
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,330
It's so pretty.

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,341
However, to be honest,
it's a bit pricey for what it is.

48
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:35,433
Diamonds are beautiful,
but you have to ask yourself,

49
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:38,123
who but an expert would really
know that it's a diamond?

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,958
That's true.

51
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:43,695
You don't want to get a diamond?

52
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,870
Jake, might want to check out
those cubic zirconias over there,

53
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,727
see if anything strikes your fancy.

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,040
I heard even J. Lo has one.

55
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,030
See, honey? J. lo.

56
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,672
You know, not that
it's any of my business, but,

57
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,742
a man who won't buy you a diamond

58
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,100
doesn't seem to be all
that committed, does he?

59
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:13,276
- Having a good time?
- Are you kiddin'me?

60
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,170
There's no better feeling in the world
than bustin'up nuptials.

61
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,763
- ... care about what J. Lo wears.
- Loves it.

62
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:20,577
All right, soul or what?

63
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,652
Anything you want to
tell me about this one?

64
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,530
I'm working here. OK?

65
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:30,176
I don't look at every piece of
paper that passes across my desk.

66
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:33,282
You know the drill. Bad guy escaped,
he needs to be captured.

67
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:37,904
Is this Mr. Sprong?

68
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,410
- What are you babbling about?
- I know this guy.

69
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,723
- Was my biology teacher in high school.
- Is that gonna be a problem for you?

70
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:47,530
No, not at all.
He was a complete ass.

71
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,964
It really makes sense he's an evil soul.
I'll be happy to send him back to hell.

72
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,987
We are done.

73
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:55,884

Bert Wysocki to the manager's office.

79
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:19,914
What are you doing here, Ted?

80
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,648
Cleansing, to get rid of the bad mojo.

81
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,758
- Right.
- Look at that.

82
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,530
Lovely bone structure.

83
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,102
- I'm back.
- Shut the door.

84
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,370
- Really?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,312
Store manager. Well, interim store
manager, but those are just words and...

86
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,039
Words cannot hurt me anymore.

87
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,072
- Congrats, Tedster!
- Thank you.

88
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,682
Couldn't find anyone else to do it?

89
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,749
I called you into my office today

90
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:51,457
because I learned something
over my brief but painful hiatus.

91
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,096
I learned to cherish those
who support me...

92
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,575
And Shun those who sabotage me, and you,

93
00:04:57,648 --> 00:05:00,166
Sock, well, you've been a supporter.

94
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,477
I know.
I have.

95
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,041
You were the only one that was there
for me during those dark days. And I

96
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,599
- want to reward you.
- Good. I'll take cash.

97
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,068
This is more than money, my friend. OK?

98
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:16,170
I am doing flier for the sunday paper,
and you, Mr. Bert Wysocki,

99
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,989
with your beautiful face
and your sticky-uppy hair,

100
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,769
you would be the one who brings
in the customers. I want you

101
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,664
to be the face...
Of the bench.

102
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,170
What do you think?

103
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,870
- I'll do it for 25 bucks.
- Sold!

104
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,493
Deal! Hallelujah! It's raining pencils.

105
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:35,875
I'm rich!

106
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:38,342
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

107
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,407
My next soul.

108
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,369
Wait.
Is this Mr. Sprong?

109
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:49,830
Oh, my god.
I hated this guy.

110
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,970
- Was he an escaped soul all along?
- I mean, he must have been.

111
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,973
No living person could be that evil.

112
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,056
Do you know that he told me that
I was biologically dumber than a guy?

113
00:05:58,116 --> 00:05:59,677
I mean, I believed that for years.

114
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:02,270
He told me it was possible
that I was partially brain damaged.

115
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,683
I Still believe that.

116
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:06,158
What's with the vessel?

117
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:07,951
We'll check it out.

118
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,119
Nice.

119
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,718
It's good weight.
When do we get him?

120
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:17,417
We? You mean you want to participate?

121
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:22,231
I'm sorry. I just thought my job was
too evil and terrible for you.

122
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,881
It's just too evil for me to date you.

123
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,982
I'll Still help you hunt souls.

124
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,670
All right. We'll go tomorrow
after school's closed.

125
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,902
Mr. Sprong always stayed late
to grade papers.

126
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:33,200
Great. It's a date.

127
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,965
I mean, it's just... It's...
something we'll do.

128
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:46,633
That was funny.

129
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,877
- Deer hunter isn't really a comedy.
- Are you sure?

130
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:56,991
- What the hell was that?
- You know, just the wind.

131
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,530
Wind? Wind?
That's not the wind.

132
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,241
I need to tell you something.

133
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,608
You know those guys that were
hitting on me at the bar?

134
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,294
Those were demons.

135
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,526
And they weren't hitting on me
because they think i'm super hot.

136
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,762
They were hitting on me because I'm
in heat and they can't help themselves.

137
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,101
- You're in heat?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,705
Female demons go through
a mating season once a year,

139
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,106
like... like cats or dogs or bears,

140
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,885
and when I'm in heat I give off these
pheromones that attract male demons.

141
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,545
You know what? Cut it out!

142
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:35,555
It's that cheesy X guy from the bar.

143
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:38,832
Persistent, isn't he?
He must have caught my scent bad.

144
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:40,807
You know what? That is not OK.

145
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,180
The only one that gets to mate
with you is me.

146
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,421
Hey! Where are you?

147
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:56,474
Get your ass down here.

148
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,430
I said get your ass down here!

149
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,734
Nina, what's up?

150
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,156
You're gonna have to
back off, all right?

151
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,022
How about we, go for a light dinner,

152
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,718
maybe fly over to tahoe?

153
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,730
Let's watch the rest of the movie.

154
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,987
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

155
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:54,670
If Nina hadn't demoned up, I would
have totally whipped that guy's ass.

156
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,770
Next time, man, next time i'm gonna
throw down ato pretect my woman.

157
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,820
- Good for you.
- Good morning, boys.

158
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,826
Where are you off to so early?

159
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,833
Nothing. Just got a little
work bench photo shoot, that's all.

160
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,560
Really? And you're going like that?

161
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:11,370
- I look amazing.
- You do, what? But these?

162
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,470
- What?
- They're not working, Sock.

163
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:18,370
Hey, the eyebrows are crucial.
They're the windows to your face.

164
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,333
- My eyebrows are fine, Ben.
- Yeah. They're a hot mess.

165
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,416
- Yeah, sweetheart?
- Can we talk?

166
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:30,330
Sure. Sure.
Be right back, OK?

167
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,572
- That was horrifying.
- You look wet.

168
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:39,970
Look, honey, I'm gonna be
in heat for another week.

169
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,828
OK? And these guys are
not going to leave me alone

170
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,791
with all of these crazy
pheromones floating off of me.

171
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:49,545
So, I've decided
that I'm going to lock myself away

172
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,820
in an undisclosed underground location
just until this all blows over.

173
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,176
- What? Where?
- It's safer if you don't know.

174
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,230
So I can't see you for a week?

175
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:01,082
No, Nina, we shouldn't have to
stop our life because of some Jerk.

176
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,292
I guess I'm gonna have to make him stop.

177
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,651
Ben, he's a demon. He eats guys like
you for breakfast and sometimes lunch.

178
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:11,682
Mostly for dinner.

179
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,792
Hey, I can take care of myself.

180
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,430
And you.

181
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,356
All right. All right.
I'll tell you what.

182
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:22,578
If you promise me that you won't
do anything to get yourself killed,

183
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,470
then I'll stay.

184
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:27,530
All right, I promise.

185
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:41,386
- They're not lying right.
- Ben, I'm telling you one last time,

186
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:45,310
you do not put spit on my eyebrows
or anywhere on my face. Okay?

187
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,230
- Whatever. Your funeral.
- There's my model.

188
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:50,295
- Looking very fly, bert.
- Thank you. I know.

189
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,932
Now...
For your costume.

190
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,028
What?

191
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,133
- What is that?
- It's wrenchy Bench.

192
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,510
I invented it myself.

193
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,895
Store mascot. Hey?

194
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,157
People will love him.
And because of that, they will love you.

195
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,615
This is degrading,
and this is not what we agreed on.

196
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,799
This will take Sock to the highest
heights of fame and fortune, so zip it.

197
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:17,830
You won't even be able to see him.

198
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,410
Don't. The fashion community will
never take you seriously after this.

199
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:25,230
Walk away with your dignity.

200
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,060
25 more bucks.

201
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:30,930
It's called negotiating, Ben.
Look it up.

202
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,379
Welcome to the work Bench,
home of wrenchy Bench!

203
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,570
Who's gonna join us?

204
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,031
Well, hello, little ones and big ones.

205
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,700
Bigs and littles, welcome alike.

206
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,745
Here we go.

207
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,805
Where are you, Sprongy?

208
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,370
According to you, I should be doing
softcore porn by now, ain't that right?

209
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,951
Well, guess what...
Face of the work Bench.

210
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:05,896
- What?
- Stop.

211
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,342
- I'm gonna hit the can. Be right back.
- Hurry up.

212
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,216
- It is so weird to be back here.
- That it is.

213
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,658
A lot of memories.

214
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,129
Oh, my god. We went
to that dance together, remember?

215
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:20,794
I do.

216
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:23,030
I secretly wanted you
to kiss me that night.

217
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,135
Spotlight dance 7.30 Pm friday
I don't know why I just told you that.

218
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,457
I... Really? 'cause I thought
you wanted to be friends?

219
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,530
I mean, if I would've known...
I had no clue.

220
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,952
Story of our lives, right?
Bad timing.

221
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,499
K. i. S. S. I...

222
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,148
- Shut up.
- Why?

223
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:51,721
That stings.

224
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,389
Excuse me. The school is closed.

225
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:06,563
Yeah, we know.
Here for a little "extra credit."

226
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,045
Thought of that in the John.

227
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:11,290
Is that... Bert Wysocki?

228
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,509
You know it, my man. In the flesh.
Surprised to see me?

229
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:16,813
Surprised you're not incarcerated.

230
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:23,519
Good one. I'm surprised you're not,
livin' in a box on the...

231
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,230
Doing the... Sam,
a little help. You gotta...

232
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,306
I don't believe it.

233
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,465
- What are you doing back here?
- We found out about you, Mr. Sprong...

234
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:35,773
What you really are.

235
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:38,118
Son, I have a lot of work
to do and very little time

236
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,111
to take a trip down memory lane with
a couple of technical college rejects.

237
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:44,070
- Didn't even apply.
- I hear you talking, but all I...

238
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,346
See is this.

239
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,232
Miss Prendergast,

240
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:51,028
I must say I'm disappointed
to see you here with these two.

241
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:53,101
Despite all your faults,
and there were many,

242
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,131
you had at least a glimmer of potential.

243
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:59,712
But I see you're Still Rolling
in the mud with the other swine.

244
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,841
She is not fat.
Take a look.

245
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,510
You're evil,
and you're going back to hell.

246
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,107
What are you gonna do to me?

247
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,830
That's what! Suck it!

248
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,729
He... He didn't vessel.

249
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,725
Are souls supposed to bleed?

250
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,823
- What happened?
- I don't know.

251
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,472
- OK, well, why is he bleeding?
- This has never happened before.

252
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,336
- - Hit him again.
- I don't know, maybe I did it wrong.

253
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,660
Maybe the vessel doesn't work.
I don't know. Maybe...

254
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,307
- Maybe...
- Maybe... he's not a soul.

255
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,830
- What?
- He's not the soul, Sam.

256
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,706
- He's the target of the soul.
- What?

257
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:48,935
OK, look. The real soul
is a guy named Jordy Boone,

258
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,806
who's a former student of Mr. Sprong's
and just wants to kill him.

259
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,334
You didn't even look at the file,
did you? What's wrong with you?

260
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:57,715
Sam, what's wrong with you?

261
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,673
Shut... I was... I looked at the picture
and I made a snap judgment.

262
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,816
I'm a picture guy.

263
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:04,485
OK, perfect. Well, now
you're an armed assault guy.

264
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,821
- Do you know how much trouble we're in?
- A lot.

265
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,283
- Sprong, are you OK?
- Hey, you're not dead.

266
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,654
Mr. Sprong, do you know where you are?
Do you remember what happened?

267
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,749
You mean when you attacked me.

268
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,010
Yes, I remember that very well,
and I can describe it

269
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:24,380
in great detail to the authorities.

270
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,987
You don't want to do that.
You got a massive head wound.

271
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,505
- You could really mess yourself up.
- Get your hands off of me.

272
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:34,528
I'm really, really sorry that
I hit you with a mallet, OK? It was a

273
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:37,441
huge misunderstanding. But you're in
danger. Someone is trying to kill you.

274
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,356
Yes. Do you remember Jordy Boone?

275
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:41,728
Jordy? He's dead. That's...

276
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,603
I know it sounds crazy, but we just
need to get you someplace safe

277
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,170
and then we'll explain everything.

278
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,226
You will get your hands
off me this instant.

279
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,281
I am not going anywhere
with you lunatics.

280
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:52,602
No, no, Mr. Sprong, please.
Okay, just...

281
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:54,330
What was that?

282
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,719
Jordy, wait, wait, wait.

283
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,627
What happened?

284
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:03,671
There! Back there!

285
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,130
- You're dead, sprong.
- Get him out of here!

286
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,556
No, no, no, no! Come on, Sam!

287
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,207
- No, no, no...
- OK, push him.

288
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,348
Come on.

289
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,867
Come out.
Where are you?

290
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:46,070
OK, do you believe us now? That guy
came back from the dead to kill you.

291
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,470
He's not gonna stop. So if you want
to live, you will come with us, OK?

292
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,129
I don't know how you pulled off
that mind freak business back there,

293
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,763
but you are all going to jail.

294
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,079
And I will take
every delight in making sure...

295
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:04,507
OK, let's go. Grab him.

296
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:09,492
Grab him! Grab him!
Come on Andi, this way. Go. Over here.

297
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,730
OK. Yeah, that looks pretty good, right?

298
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:20,630
Yeah, this is pretty awesome. Sam.
I mean, we make really great kidnappers.

299
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,249
Well, this isn't my fault.

300
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,029
Isn't your fault? Yeah, I think it is,
actually. You didn't read the file.

301
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:26,850
You're the one
who wanted to come with us.

302
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,010
Yeah, but I didn't want
to become a felon, Sam.

303
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:31,556
What? Give me a break.

304
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,426
You gonna be OK with this?

305
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,877
Yeah. I mean, he doesn't
look as bad as I remember.

306
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:40,224
- I'm older now, so I can handle it.
- You totally can.

307
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:43,077
You know, all we gotta do is keep him
tied up until we vessel the soul, then

308
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,153
talk him out of going to the police, OK?

309
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,782
I have to go to the bathroom.

310
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:56,970
There.

311
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:02,726
Ben Gonzalez. I'd recognize
that Skinny frame anywhere.

312
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,870
You realize your lifelong dream
of becoming a woman yet?

313
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,870
Hello, Mr. Sprong.
It's a pleasure to... see you.

314
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,337
Nice, Ben. Ironman.

315
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,905
You know what I always
remember about you?

316
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,136
The time we dissected that cat.

317
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,592
Snap. Walk away, Ben.

318
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:21,284
You started crying
like a little 5-year-old girl.

319
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:24,270
Now, that was hilarious.

320
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,687
- What a cute, cute little Kitty.
- Shut up!

321
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:30,193
I told you that was against
my principles.

322
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:33,970
She was all frozen and stiff
and fuzzy and...

323
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:37,782
So, so helpless
but I made you cut that Kitty.

324
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,623
You cut it up good, didn't you?

325
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:43,902
All right, shut it, sprong!

326
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:47,730
Are you OK? You all right?
Come on, pull through.

327
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,868
You are a bad man.
Ben, come here. Come on.

328
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:02,622
- Poor Ben.
- I know. It really messed him up.

329
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,570
I don't think he's gonna be down for
sprong duty later. It'll destroy him.

330
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,430
I know. Andi's watching him now.
Maybe we can get Nina to pitch in.

331
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:10,981
Mom, that's him!

332
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,631
- Do you know that kid?
- What? No.

333
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,730
Can I have your autograph, Wrenchy?

334
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,591
- Wrenchy?
- The flier came out.

335
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,697
I look...

336
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:25,334
Amazing.

337
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:29,208
Yes, you may have my autograph.

338
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,357
Don't have to look when I do it.

339
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:32,771
That good.

340
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,913
- Hi, Wrenchy there.
- Are you looking at this? Are you?

341
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:39,470
- I'm looking. Yeah.
- It's good.

342
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,927
I am bringing joy into the lives
of all these little orphans.

343
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,870
I think probably they're not orphans.

344
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,231
Why you gotta rain all over my orphan
parade, Sam? Why? Listen...

345
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,730
I am a light in this dark world.

346
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:54,990
I am Sock no longer.
I am Wrenchy Bench forever.

347
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,707
When I say Wrenchy.
Y'all say Bench.

348
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,485
Wrenchy... Bench!

349
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,745
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- Why, certainly you may.

350
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,962
Here, let me give you
a special one right there.

351
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,545
Is that permanent marker?

352
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:11,644
Maybe. Yeah.

353
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,830
You'll thank me for it later. Trust me.

354
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,898
- Bert Wysocki?
- No longer my friend.

355
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:20,843
Wrenchy Bench is the new identity.

356
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,026
What's your name, bro?
I'll make it personal.

357
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,708
- You've been served, jerkoff?
- What? Jerkoff?

358
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:27,738
What's your problem, dude? Hey, guy!

359
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:29,670
- What was that about?
- What? I don't know.

360
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,381
Read that. What does it say?

361
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:35,906
- Cease and desist.
- What?

362
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,063
Yeah, it's a court order
from the bargain Bench.

363
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:40,838
It says Wrenchy infringes
on their copyrighted character

364
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,741
Bargain Brandon,
the price-smashing hammer.

365
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,770
You've been ordered to stop being
Wrenchy Bench effective immediately

366
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:50,254
and to destroy
the Wrenchy Bench costume.

367
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,990
Sorry, Sock.

368
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,088
This will not stand.

369
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:11,371
Here we go.

370
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,930
That should be a little more
comfy for you, right?

371
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,230
Or not...

372
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:17,870
You got a remote here.
A lot of channels.

373
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,544
You can watch whatever you want.

374
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:20,730
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,094
And, if you get thirsty...

376
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:28,197
We got diet soda on the left,
spring water on the right.

377
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,945
I would just be careful, you know,
how much water you drink during the day,

378
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,944
unless you want to give
the adult diaper a try.

379
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:39,379
I can only imagine your parents'
profound disappointment in you.

380
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,930
They're OK, actually, but thanks.

381
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:46,137
We got Nina here to watch you and she's
promised not to eat you. Right, Nina?

382
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:47,958
I'm not gonna eat you.

383
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:53,779
Mr. Sprong, you have to believe me.
We let you go as soon as we find Jordy.

384
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,229
A school dance is coming up next week.
We're thinking he might show up there.

385
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:00,761
So you're gonna tape me to a chair
for a week.

386
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:05,770
I knew you were stupid, Oliver,

387
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,159
I just didn't know
you were criminally stupid.

388
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,945
You wasted space in my classroom,
you're wasting space here and now,

389
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:15,117
and you will waste space
when they put you in jail.

390
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,482
Until another waste of space beats
your skull to a bloody pulp

391
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:21,673
and a broom handle.
And that will be a good day.

392
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,510
OK. So remember,
soda on the left, water on the right.

393
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,130
Welcome to bargain Bench,
where bargains abound.

394
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,670
Hi. Welcome to the bargain Bench.

395
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,369
- You the manager?
- That's right.

396
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,934
Explain.

397
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,130
The work Bench.

398
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,970
I think the court order
is self-explanatory.

399
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:56,342
You and your store
are a bunch of copycats.

400
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,752
Your stupid wrench
is a mockery of Bargain Brandon.

401
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:02,730
Wrenchy Bench...
Is not stupid.

402
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:05,978
Bargain Brandon is a beloved icon.

403
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:08,570
He's been hammering prices since 2002.

404
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,035
Who's... what...

405
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,396
what?
That?

406
00:23:14,137 --> 00:23:16,363
That's your mascot?
A hammer.

407
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:20,627
- That doesn't even make sense, dude.
- Yeah. Well, the judge thought it did.

408
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,230
Face it...

409
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:25,447
I just killed your wrench,
work Bench scum.

410
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,071
Not you,

411
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,622
not some stupid piece of paper

412
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,070
can stop me from being wrenchy bench,
all right?

413
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:42,504
You're gonna have to pry that costume
from my dead, cold,

414
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,289
slightly overweight body.

415
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:48,407
Screw you, Brandon.

416
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,187
Look, everyone! It's me Wrenchy Bench.
Better than Bargain Brandon.

417
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:58,468
Way better!
Way better than Bargain Brandon.

418
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:00,097
He was born to wear that costume.

419
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:02,741
Yeah, I think he's starting
to scare people, though.

420
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:05,796
Yeah, Bargain Brandon can suck it!

421
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,182
Hey, how's Nina's demon heat going?

422
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:12,830
Terrible. That demon tried to chew
through my bedroom wall last night.

423
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:15,867
I'm going to have to end
this once and for all.

424
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,119
I'm gonna fight Xavier. I'm gonna
send a message to all these demons

425
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,480
until they stop trying
to have sex with my girl.

426
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:23,782
- Be careful, buddy.
- You know...

427
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:26,397
Oh my god.

428
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:30,765
Let go of me, wrench!

429
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,207
- Your shoe, Brandon.
- Should we stop this?

430
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,184
It's terrible. We should.

431
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:50,028
I'm gonna make you eat
this whole hammer, Brandon.

432
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:54,532
Oh, my god!

433
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:58,169
I'm so sorry I hit... no!

434
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,962
It is on now, old lady.

435
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:11,633
This is not what Wrenchy Bench is about!

436
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:15,115
Wrenchy Bench is about good service,
competitive prices, not

437
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:17,465
about violence.
It's not about...

438
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:19,533
Punching old ladies.

439
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,644
You should be ashamed of yourself.

440
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:27,455
And you can go back to the candy-ass
outfit you came from before

441
00:25:27,515 --> 00:25:28,770
I call the police.

442
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:47,025
I thought might come in Handy for your
little house guest. Pulp Fiction style.

443
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:48,970
- What?
- How about a ball gag?

444
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,804
- Or fur-lined cuffs?
- No. It's not like that.

445
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:56,298
Now, Sammy, you have a grown man
duct-taped to a chair in your house.

446
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:59,800
So don't you tell me you don't have
something freaky going on up in there.

447
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,017
We're just protecting him,
OK? From Jordy.

448
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:05,746
No, you're protecting yourself,
from arrest and prosecution.

449
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,708
That's not entirely untrue.

450
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,120
Hey, I'm not mad at you, man.
I'm a mighty proud papa bear.

451
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:13,933
Kidnapping and assault.

452
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:16,236
You're way more twisted
than I had ever hoped.

453
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:17,990
I'm just a little bit stuck.

454
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:21,220
I don't have the first clue about how to
find Jordy. And then once we do find,

455
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:23,530
I don't know how to catch him.
He keeps disappearing.

456
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:25,805
Yeah. Jordy always
thought he was invisible.

457
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,125
Now he can actually become invisible.

458
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,535
You know, you could let sprong go.

459
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,297
Why would I do that?
Jordy will kill him.

460
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:34,675
- Well, who cares?
- I won't do that.

461
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,151
Sam, you have firsthand
information and knowledge

462
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:40,389
that this sprong has been
torturing kids for 25 years.

463
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:43,018
Although I admire that
and I like his style a lot

464
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,810
you'd be doing the world a favor.

465
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,549
I won't let him get killed. It's wrong.

466
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:48,670
Brother, what's with
the high road all the time?

467
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,970
Can you just give me a hint
about how to find Jordy?

468
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,004
I can't give you any hints, Sammy,
but I can tell you this...

469
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,430
You won't have to worry about
finding Jordy. He'll find you.

470
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:58,909
Soon.

471
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:09,936
Here we go.

472
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:20,934
Oh, my...

473
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:24,052
Hey, baby.
Lunch time. What are you doing?

474
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,183
Sweetie...

475
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,267
I'm getting ready for war.

476
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,647
- I'm gonna fight Xavier.
- I... i thought we talked about this.

477
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,754
You promised you
weren't going to do anything stupid.

478
00:27:33,814 --> 00:27:37,195
Stupid is letting demons
try to steal my girl.

479
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,428
No one is stealing me, Ben.

480
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:42,170
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you get yourself killed.

481
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,603
Why does everyone want to treat me like
i'm a weak little girl? I'm a man, Nina.

482
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:47,255
I do man things.

483
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,459
Fighting a demon doesn't make you a man.
It makes you dead!

484
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,118
Well, then I'd rather be dead
than be a coward.

485
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:56,441
- Don't say that, Benji.
- Why are you so against this?

486
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,734
Because...

487
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,302
You are breakable.

488
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,366
Ben, you're mortal,
and ou could really die,

489
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,343
and I don't think I could handle that.

490
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,351
I promise that I won't die. OK?

491
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,007
This is why I'm training.
I'm training to be an ultimate champion.

492
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,030
Look, stand back here and let me show
you what I've been working on.

493
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:23,506
That's right.
That's my girl.

494
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:32,657
You see that?
I'm totally gonna own this guy.

495
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:43,200
Fighting demons is more than punching
through a silly piece of plywood, Ben.

496
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,283
I'm aware of that.

497
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:48,407
- Now.
- Good.

498
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:00,596
Ghetto boxing gloves?

499
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:04,399
- Nice.
- I intend to reclaim manhood.

500
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,092
Xavier comes around
sniffing for Nina again,

501
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,326
he's gonna have to
go through these guys.

502
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,540
Lilo and stitch.

503
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,470
You, Ben Gonzalez, and some
demon hunk are gonna throw down?

504
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,956
Sure, it might get tough.

505
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:20,757
Benzine, save yourself the pain, my man.

506
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,354
It's no use, all right,

507
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:24,911
to try and fight the natural order
of things. Next thing you know,

508
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,109
you're getting punched in the face
by some old lady in a hammer suit.

509
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:31,130
I'm not gonna roll over on this, Sock.
I can't, OK?

510
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,479
I'm fully prepared
to take control and maintain...

511
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:36,632
Shut up. Shut up.

512
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,286
I just got an idea.
What if

513
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:42,511
this little demon duel of yours doesn't
have to end with you getting killed?

514
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,950
- By me wearing that? Sock...
- We shall rebuild it, Benjamin.

515
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,164
We have all the technology
right here at our fingertips.

516
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:54,206
We shall make it better
than it was before. Faster, stronger,

517
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,696
and demoner-proofer.

518
00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:59,727
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

519
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:02,114
but you seem so excited.
So I'm in, no matter how stupid.

520
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,853
- Very stupid.
- I'm more in.

521
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:39,032
I defy any horny demon to get past this.

522
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,646
Watch out, now.

523
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,135
How'd that feel?

524
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,721
Feels good.

525
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,945
Nina, we brought pizza!

526
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,221
Oh, my god.

527
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:57,158
What happened?

528
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:01,578
- Nina was supposed to watch sprong.
- Well, and here's a note.

529
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:05,921
"Ate the last of the meatloaf.
"Went out for a moose. X-O-X-O Nina."

530
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,548
All right. So where's sprong?

531
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,571
Oh, god.

532
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:19,125
Get back inside!
You're going to get yourself killed.

533
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Good!

534
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:25,333
- It's better than dying by your hand.
- We're trying help you.

535
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,426
You know what?
Screw this guy.

536
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,013
Let him go. I hope Jordy kicks his ass.

537
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:32,180
Works for me.

538
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,115
- Hurry! Lock the door!
- All right.

539
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:45,058
Where'd he go?

540
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:46,734
Get me out of this chair!

541
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:48,730
You ruined my life!

542
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,270
Sam, watch it!

543
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,799
I don't know what to do!
He's impossible to vessel!

544
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:57,668
Where is he?

545
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:04,526
You know what he did to me?

546
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,545
He made me feel like I was nothing.

547
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:08,465
He said that I was worthless.

548
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:11,303
Forget it, Jordy!
You're not going to get sprong.

549
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,108
- Jordy!
- Let her go.

550
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:23,267
You really want her to die for him?
You think it's worth it?

551
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,202
Where did they go?

552
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:31,389
Bring him out here and I'll let her go!

553
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,777
I'm not playing around anymore!

554
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:40,391
We got to do it.

555
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:43,930
What? So you're just going
to let him kill me?

556
00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:55,543
- All right. There you go.
- Kill away.

557
00:32:57,752 --> 00:32:58,884
I have to, Andi.

558
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:01,286
You're right. He's an awful man.

559
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,170
If he hadn't put you down,
maybe you'd Still be alive.

560
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,930
Maybe you would've turned out different.
Maybe we all would have.

561
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,153
So, there you go.
We won't stop you.

562
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,995
Sam, this is wrong.

563
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,456
You blame me for your problems?

564
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:21,830
You think I'm the cause
of your crappy life?

565
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:25,068
I just saw you for what you we, Jordy...

566
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,905
A lunatic.
A loser.

567
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:29,685
A nothing!

568
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:38,828
You're probably right, mr. Sprong.

569
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:45,588
- All right!
- Like a charm!

570
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:50,521
Well, well, well.
Look who just captured a soul.

571
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,122
Do you finally believe us, mr. Sprong?
We're not evil.

572
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:55,664
Who's an idiot now?

573
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,522
Mr. Sprong!

574
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:12,110
- I was up all night.
- Yeah. Me, too.

575
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,155
I had very vivid dreams.

576
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:19,549
Guys, I keep thinking it over and over,
and I can't see any way out of this.

577
00:34:19,866 --> 00:34:21,557
We're in trouble, you guys.

578
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:24,770
OK? We don't have a believable
defense for anything that happened.

579
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,992
We're all complicit in a kidnapping
and holding someone hostage.

580
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:29,830
I know. You're right.

581
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:31,969
As soon as sprong goes to the cops...

582
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:35,501
- We're going to be arrested.
- No, no, we're not.

583
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:37,370
- Or at least, you guys aren't.
- What?

584
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,770
I was thinking about it, too.
I decided to turn myself in.

585
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,913
I'll tell the cops it was my idea
and I forced you guys to do it.

586
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:48,104
- No, Sam, you can't.
- I think you are really going to enjoy

587
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:50,503
the structure of prison.
That is a great plan.

588
00:34:51,663 --> 00:34:54,766
- It's only way. I got you into this.
- He did.

589
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:58,322
OK, well, just... At least see if sprong
even goes to the cops, all right?

590
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,935
Maybe he'll change his mind.

591
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,316
I don't think he's
going to change his mind.

592
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,648
Fudge.

593
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,165
Hey, guys.
You are Sam Oliver,

594
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:17,187
Andi Prendergast, and Bert Wysocki?

595
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:19,366
Yes, sir.

596
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:22,666
We're here on a
complaint from Elliott sprong.

597
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,870
Yeah. But really,
it's me you want to talk to.

598
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,405
No, no, no.
We were all there.

599
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,292
We're basically just doing a welfare
check, making sure you're not injured.

600
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,130
Are you all OK?

601
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:36,633
Are we OK?

602
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,257
We believe mr. Sprong
has had a psychological break

603
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:41,912
he's been having violent delusions.

604
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,130
Told us he may have assaulted
one of you with the magic mallot.

605
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:48,544
Weird.

606
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,656
And we just wanted
to make sure you're not hurt.

607
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,607
- No. We're fine. Not hurt at all.
- I feel good.

608
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:57,306
Of course, if anyone wants
to press charges, just contact me.

609
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,605
No, you know what?
That is totally unnecessary.

610
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:16,799
Just...

611
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:20,866
It's a little tight
in the crotch area. But

612
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,264
I live with the pain because I care.

613
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,958
You're OK with me doing this, right?

614
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,508
I'm Still afraid.

615
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:32,429
But I can see now how
important this is to you, and

616
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:35,474
I'm going to support you
because i'm crazy about you.

617
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:38,123
You know, I've never dated a guy before

618
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:41,570
who dressed up like a weird,
semi-robot to protect me.

619
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,330
I'd do anything for you, baby.

620
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:46,178
What do you think of the gold color?
It's my idea...

621
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,540
figured silver was a little too
on the nose.

622
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:50,726
I like the gold.

623
00:36:50,988 --> 00:36:52,965
- Yeah?
- It's very manly.

624
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:54,592
Very sexy.

625
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,641
No stupid, muscular demon
could ever compare to you.

626
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,216
You're damn right.
Let's go put this Jerk Back

627
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:05,259
in his place.
You're sure you can lure him here?

628
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,470
Baby, of course
I can lure a male demon here.

629
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,935
I've been going through heat
for eon mating with hundreds...

630
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:14,444
No, god.
Thousands of guys along the way. So,

631
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:17,155
Yeah, yeah. Pretty sure
I can lure him here.

632
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:21,330
Perfect. Let's...
Let's do this.

633
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,399
- Honey. I think he's coming.
- OK. It's on.

634
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:46,151
Get inside, lock the doors.
I'm going to wreck shop.

635
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:51,245
Go get him, baby.

636
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:55,508
Boy.

637
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,078
All right, chief. Just you and me now.
Let's dance.

638
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,470
- Hey, what's up?
- Ben's defending my honor.

639
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,467
What, already?
Hot diggity dog.

640
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,809
That's a good-looking robot suit,
isn't it? Look at that.

641
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,903
I Still think he should have gone with
silver gloves. The gold a little tacky.

642
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:24,826
Look at this.
The robot suit's going Gangbusters.

643
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,305
Come on, Ben!

644
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:33,034
Go off me.

645
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:37,230
That... Doesn't look like
any fight I've ever seen. This is...

646
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:40,420
What's happening?

647
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:44,700
No. When I hugged Ben, I think I might
have rubbed pheromones off on him.

648
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:47,243
That demon is not trying to fight Ben.
He's trying to mate with him.

649
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:48,339
Oh, god.

650
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,402
Oh, my god.
We have to stop him.

651
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,416
We make it out there, you turn
on the hose, and I'll blast him.

652
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,605
Okay. On 3 ready. One... 2...

653
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,505
That was a terrible place
for a ventilation hole. 3! Go!

654
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,325
All right, Benji. Here you go.
You just need to relax.

655
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:10,101
I don't understand why you're so upset,
man. I got another demon

656
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,913
after me "that wants to make love to me.
Why am I so attractive?"

657
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:15,370
Sock, you don't know
what it was like, OK? It was terrible.

658
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,828
The robot suit protected you!

659
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,579
You know, that demon douche never
even touched your actual body.

660
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,161
But it was the grinding...

661
00:39:21,499 --> 00:39:22,568
The humping...

662
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,230
And the romantic words he was
whispering in my ear hole.

663
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,094
I can't get it out of my head.

664
00:39:28,956 --> 00:39:32,065
Your emotional trauma makes
you so much more attractive to me.

665
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,996
Cheers. Cheers to that. There we go.

666
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,620
Andi, you all right?

667
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,730
Yeah. I just hope
that sprong wasn't right about us.

668
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,091
- What do you mean?
- Well, that we're losers.

669
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,206
Think about it. We're Still doing
the same thing we did in high school.

670
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:53,765
Nobody's done anything with their lives.
That's a little messed up.

671
00:39:57,974 --> 00:40:01,296
No. Andi, you know what?
I reject that, and I reject you.

672
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,130
OK? Yeah! Don't you laugh.

673
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,759
None of us have done
anything with our lives? Excuse me?

674
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,670
Do you know who you're looking at?
I was, if only for a brief moment,

675
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,889
the face of the work bench,

676
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,379
young lady.
I was a loveable foam wrench character

677
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:16,442
that was adored by children
all over the country, OK?

678
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:19,570
I took a stand against tyranny
and alleged copyright infringement.

679
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,016
And not to mention, I kicked
an old lady's ass all over town.

680
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,811
I don't think I could fit more life into
myself without exploding on this bar.

681
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:30,030
All right? And Benjamin, right here,
I mean, come one, let's all face it...

682
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,929
He is banging a super smoking
hot demon named Nina, all right?

683
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:37,989
And tonight, he defended her honor,
and now, he's got a kickass robot suit.

684
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:40,939
- That is true.
- That is very true. I know.

685
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,516
And you... look at you,

686
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,517
little bellyacher, little sourpuss.

687
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:47,054
You were the manager

688
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,946
of a major national chain home
improvement store, were you not?

689
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,370
- I got demoted.
- So? Who cares if you got demoted.

690
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,539
You hated the job, didn't you? Right?
And you know what the best revenge is?

691
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,380
Happiness, Andi. Are you happy?

692
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,186
Right here, right now? Are you happy?

693
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,711
Yeah. Yeah. I guess I am.

694
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,126
- You guess you're what?
- I'm happy!

695
00:41:08,186 --> 00:41:10,170
You're happy. I know! Shout it with me!

696
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,466
Happy! Right?
And this guy right here...

697
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,804
Samuel, I mean, what more can I say?

698
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:21,134
Heir to the throne of the underworld.
What's up.

699
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:23,999
So, losers, Andi?

700
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,294
I think not.

701
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:27,930
Winners.

702
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,571
- Winners.
- Winners.

703
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:37,872
