1
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:01,387
Previously, on "Reaper"...

2
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,648
Before you were born...

3
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:06,171
your mom and I--
sold your soul to the devil.

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,544
- I'm the devil!
- Aah!!!

5
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:11,162
You're just going to bring
escaped souls back to hell.

6
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:12,505
You know, like a bounty hunter.

7
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:14,194
- You didn't tell Andi?
- No! I'm not gonna tell Andi.

8
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,104
If she knows, she'll think I'm a freak.
You can make her go out with you.

9
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:18,059
You can make her go
out with you, Damien.

10
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,380
Sam, I like you.
I love working with you guys.

11
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,196
And how am I supposed
to capture them?

12
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:23,555
This will help. A vessel.

13
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:25,697
Handcrafted in the
bowels of perdition

14
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,233
by the iniquitous and the vio.

15
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:28,801
How do you capture
a soul with it?

16
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:30,643
Maybe you drive it
into the guy, right?

17
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,520
You finally found the one
thing that you're good at,

18
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,252
and you kicked ass.
We kicked ass.

19
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,340
I did it.

20
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:43,373
You're dead.

21
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:47,831
You're dead.

22
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,842
You're dead!

23
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,533
Ah, I'm dead.

24
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:04,513
*Good morning,
new day's dawning*

25
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:06,201
*and I'm through yawning*

26
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,463
*now we get excited
every week babe*

27
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:13,290
*ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh*

28
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:18,212
*what's it seem when
everything's wrong?*

29
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:23,511
*Despair sinking in*

30
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,351
*spend days just sleeping in*

31
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,391
*good morning,
a new day's dawning*

32
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:33,591
*and I'm through yawning
now we get excited*

33
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:35,980
*every week*

34
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:44,951
Give me a bite of that.

35
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:48,143
No, no,
I need you to feed it to me.

36
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,501
- What?
- I'm starving, ok?

37
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:53,043
Everything I put in my mouth
ends up covered in bugs.

38
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:54,083
Oh, nice.

39
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,783
So bugs, huh?

40
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,492
You think that's the work of,
uh, el diablo?

41
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:01,052
It must be.

42
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:03,193
Time to collect a soul
that's escaped from hell.

43
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:05,970
I just wish the devil would do
it in a less disgusting way.

44
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,380
All right, come on.
Open up, baby bird.

45
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:09,981
Tilt it back.

46
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:11,982
- Get it, get it real--
- Morning.

47
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,570
No, please continue.

48
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:15,373
Very romantic, actually.

49
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,973
Ha, yeah, no, it's--
my hands are dirty.

50
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:21,630
Sam, what time are
you off work tonight?

51
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,742
Seven. Why?

52
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,220
There's a primate lecture
on campus tonight.

53
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:28,341
They're bringing in a
lowland gorilla expert.

54
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,622
I could use your company.

55
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:31,052
Really?

56
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:32,973
I just figured we could
get a cup of coffee

57
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:34,652
afterwards with some
people in class.

58
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,653
So what do you say?
You, me and the monkeys?

59
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,790
Um, yeah, well,
actually, uh--ahh.

60
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,403
Sock and I made plans
to hang out, so...

61
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,191
Yep. Yeah.

62
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:51,261
Yes. Uh,
we're gonna go donate bone marrow...

63
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,313
- to the needy at the convention.
- You guys are so weird.

64
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:58,383
Oh-ho. That's right.

65
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,591
- Bone marrow?
- Pardon me, idiot,

66
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,592
but I think Andi just
asked you out on a date.

67
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:04,202
No, it wasn't a date, ok?
It was a lecture,

68
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:05,651
and I don't want to spend
the evening feeling stupid

69
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,100
in front of her
college friends.

70
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,161
Whatever, man.

71
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,530
She was all up in your grill piece,
and you told her to take a hike.

72
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:12,051
- Good job.
- It's not a good time

73
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,871
to start something with Andi, all right?
It's just...

74
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:16,293
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you
had such a full calendar right now.

75
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:17,693
My life is complicated, ok?

76
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,091
If we actually went on a date,
it would be a total disaster.

77
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,363
You know what?
I'm sick of that old song and dance, ok?

78
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:24,641
"My name's Sam,
I gather shopping carts for a living,

79
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,043
I collect souls for the devil."

80
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,570
Boohoo. Zero pity.

81
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:29,823
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

82
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,332
Well?

83
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,300
See, now I think that's cool.

84
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:49,200
Reaper Season 1 Episode 3 - All Mine
For www.forom.com

85
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,201
You ever feel lost, Sam?

86
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:58,213
- What?
- Lost. Aimless, lacking purpose.

87
00:03:58,436 --> 00:03:59,980
Believe me, I can relate.

88
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,863
I wasn't always the manager.

89
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:03,720
I had to earn it.

90
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,693
But I had to shake off some
serious addiction issues

91
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,552
before I found
direction in my life.

92
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,853
- You were addicted to drugs?
- Gambling.

93
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:12,761
And shoes.

94
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:15,670
Lots of shoes.

95
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,960
Point is, Sam,
is that I turned my life around.

96
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,223
And there's still hope for you.

97
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:27,623
Hope in the form of toilets.

98
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,362
- Toilets?
- For 2,000 years,

99
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,070
people have been using these

100
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,843
porcelain "thrones,"

101
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:36,513
and they're gonna be using
them for another 2,000.

102
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:39,363
Um, yeah, I just have no interest
in selling toilets, so...

103
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:41,880
I see a spark of the old me in you,
you know?

104
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:43,532
Please don't tell me that, Ted.

105
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,113
And that's why I am prepared...

106
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:46,892
to promote you

107
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,830
to assistant manager

108
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:50,910
of the plumbing department.

109
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,523
What do you think
of them apples?

110
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,042
I think I want to stab myself.

111
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:56,782
- Sorry?
- What?

112
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,092
I'm throwing you a
lifeline here, Sam.

113
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:00,410
I suggest you take it.

114
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,922
Yeah, it's just...

115
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:03,452
my destiny does not include

116
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,661
spending the rest of my
life at the work bench.

117
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:08,171
You know, I have plans to
do something with my life.

118
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,760
Doing something with
your life, Sam,

119
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,613
requires skills.

120
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,970
And the only overt
skills I see from you

121
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:18,240
is tardiness and
general ineptitude.

122
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:22,333
Lifeline, Sam.

123
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,993
- Think about it, ok?
- Ok.

124
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,170
What are you doing?

125
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,851
This is really nice.

126
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:53,963
Much roomier than it looks.

127
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:55,722
Why, you could live in there.

128
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:58,382
Finally get out of your parents' house,
huh, Sam?

129
00:05:58,585 --> 00:05:59,682
Ugh. Give me the vessel.

130
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,120
No, no, no, no.

131
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:04,110
I do not like this tone at all.
What's the problem?

132
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,923
Ted wants to promote me
to assistant manager

133
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,342
of the plumbing department.

134
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,843
Promotion?
Well, congratulations!

135
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:12,893
Make sure you get the 401k.

136
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,663
No, no, don't congratulate me.

137
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:15,822
He's saying that
I'm going to spend

138
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:17,652
the rest of my life
here at the work bench.

139
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,123
You know,
I don't get you, Sammy.

140
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:20,960
You don't want to work
here at this place,

141
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:22,513
you don't want to work for me.

142
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,523
What exactly do you want?

143
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:26,810
Just something
that doesn't suck.

144
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:28,346
Well, one of these days,
maybe you'll come up

145
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,455
with a little better
plan than that, huh?

146
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:32,917
I brought this for you.

147
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,130
This is the vessel?

148
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:38,920
No. I just want to communicate
with you on your level, buddy.

149
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,391
Go ahead, give it a gander.

150
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,580
Oh, man,
what are you showing me?

151
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,283
That's Harriet Swenseen, 62.

152
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:49,050
Her death was attributed to
anaphylactic shock. Keep going.

153
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,620
Lois Johnson, 59.

154
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,382
She caught the west nile virus.

155
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:54,510
Fiona Beauchamp, 65.

156
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:57,142
She was done in by a nasty
infection from a bite.

157
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:03,421
Oh, sorry.
That's me at the Emmys.

158
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,391
All right, so let me guess.
They were all killed by bugs?

159
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,990
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

160
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,562
I can tell you this--

161
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,192
all the deaths occurred
in the last 2 months.

162
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,472
That's--that's it?
That's all you're gonna tell me?

163
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,582
Oh, come on!

164
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:16,730
Aren't you going to
at least thank me

165
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,201
for the visual presentation?

166
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,221
- I mean, how cool was that?
- It just doesn't help me.

167
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:26,070
- Wait, I need more help.
- Follow the bugs, buddy.

168
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,320
What does that mean?

169
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,822
You didn't give me the vessel!

170
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:40,430
Thanks.

171
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,482
Ass.

172
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,230
Ted offered me a job today.

173
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,531
Assistant manager of plumbing.

174
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,982
Oh. I see.

175
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:04,462
- I'm not taking it.
- No, no, you know what?

176
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:06,553
Go ahead,
take your little job, Mr. Man.

177
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,411
- When were you gonna tell us?
- I'm not gonna take it.

178
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,390
I'm not taking it.
I'm probably not taking it.

179
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,043
Probably? Probably
not going to take it?

180
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,432
Well, guess what?
I'm probably not going

181
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,083
to feed management
french fries.

182
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,931
Why are you so pissed
off about this, huh?

183
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,823
- Why?
- Yeah, why do you care?

184
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,121
Maybe if you didn't
have your lips

185
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:22,662
permanently sealed to Ted's
anus like an ass gasket,

186
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,912
you wouldn't be in this
situation in the first place, ok?

187
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:26,533
- Come on.
- God!

188
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,140
You're angry today, man.

189
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:30,940
A little bit.

190
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:32,472
I want a salad.

191
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:35,303
Uh, no. Sorry,
I'm not going to order you a salad.

192
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,243
- That's a chick order.
- I want a salad.

193
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:38,933
You're not getting a salad.
We always do this.

194
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,460
- Do what? Do what?
- Do this.

195
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:42,043
What, you always order a salad?

196
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:43,820
You're getting the
chicken midgets!

197
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:45,402
Fine.

198
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,981
And a side salad, ok?
You can have a side salad.

199
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,481
Thank you. Appreciate it.

200
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,261
Hey, guys, look.

201
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:56,101
- Devil said follow the bugs.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

202
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,331
Burger!

203
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,561
I saw him turn right up there.
Pull over.

204
00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:06,573
Horseshoe court.

205
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,040
What is this place?

206
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,021
Looks like an
apartment complex.

207
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,181
You think the exterminator's
the escaped soul?

208
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:19,663
I don't know.

209
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,453
- The soul kills people with bugs.
- Oh, head's up.

210
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,300
Dispatch, I got trouble.

211
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,070
This place is
swarming with bugs.

212
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,182
They're everywhere.

213
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,053
I'm calling public
works in on this one.

214
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,531
They're gonna have to
fumigate the whole complex.

215
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:35,852
What do we do?

216
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,593
I don't know.
I left the vessel at the bench.

217
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,550
What?

218
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,523
We were getting food.
I didn't think we'd need it.

219
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,321
That's not exactly management thinking,
is it, Sam?

220
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,411
All right.

221
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,400
Look, look!

222
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,950
It's locked.
It's locked, it's locked!

223
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,751
Uh, yeah, good thinking,
good thinking!

224
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:25,460
Guess he's not
the escaped soul.

225
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:32,992
Bug. Oh!

226
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,752
Relax, there's no bugs on you!

227
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:36,791
They got in my pants, Sam.
In my pants!

228
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,371
I know, I know,
they got everywhere.

229
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,691
So the soul is in the
apartment complex.

230
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:42,212
Makes sense.

231
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:44,062
The exterminator tried
to kill the bugs,

232
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,842
so the soul made
the bugs kill him.

233
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,233
Ok, but the problem is,
there's a dozen houses in there,

234
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,780
so where does the soul live?

235
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,093
Sock, bees are not
nesting in your crotch.

236
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,220
What are you doin'?

237
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:58,013
I thought these might help us
find out where the soul lives.

238
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:59,281
You stole mail?

239
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:01,600
- Yeah.
- Sock, that's a felony.

240
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,210
Well, come on now,
there's a fine line between a felony

241
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,973
and doing something
really super cool.

242
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:07,700
- That's true.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

243
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:09,930
Rooster in the
dog house, buddy.

244
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:13,160
Andi's cozying up to
a tie rack over there.

245
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:14,822
Who's that?

246
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,553
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

247
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,763
I know who that is.

248
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:21,063
Some college punk she
met at that monkey thing

249
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,250
that you wussed out on.

250
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,141
Now she's gettin' married,
and it's all your fault.

251
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:25,473
She's not getting married.

252
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,521
Just take the mail in the
back before you get arrested.

253
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll be right back.

254
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,743
If you showed up more often,
you'd know.

255
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,270
'Cause if you don't
party all the time.

256
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,732
That's what people
do in college.

257
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,191
- No!
- They party, yes.

258
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:37,291
Hey. Uh, this is Greg.

259
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:38,830
- Greg, this is Sam.
- Hey.

260
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,042
Good to meet you, Sam.

261
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,001
He was dropping off my jacket

262
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,740
'cause I left it at
the lecture last night.

263
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:46,202
Oh, you guys...you guys
go to school together.

264
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,920
We just met last night.

265
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,843
Though I'm hoping to
see her more often.

266
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:55,001
He's just trying to convince
me to go to school full-time,

267
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,730
which I think is
absolutely crazy.

268
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,052
I don't see why.

269
00:11:58,377 --> 00:11:59,861
Do you realize
how smart she is?

270
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:01,692
Yeah, oh, yeah,
she's totally smart.

271
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,270
Look, even then,
I'd have to work,

272
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,722
and there's just really
no time to study, so...

273
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:08,870
Well, you'd have
to quit this job.

274
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,500
Quit?

275
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:16,301
Well, what do you think about
me going back to college, Sam?

276
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,893
Well, you know, I don't know,

277
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,260
you go to school and
you get all in debt,

278
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,600
and then, you know,
you graduate and you have to

279
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,280
get a job to pay
off all your loans,

280
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,792
so you're right back at the
bench where you started.

281
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:25,901
So to speak.

282
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,672
Or you could get a career.

283
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,150
You know, a salary,
a job with a future.

284
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,731
There--there's a future here.

285
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,452
In, um...

286
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,710
toilets.

287
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:38,572
Toilets?

288
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,351
You know, everybody needs...

289
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:41,860
toilet.

290
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,840
You know,
I'm not knocking you, Sam.

291
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,841
I'm just saying,
Andi can be so much more.

292
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,492
Yeah. Yeah.

293
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,210
Uh, you know,
I need to head out.

294
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,652
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

295
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,573
Ok, well,
I have drill bits calling my name,

296
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:08,020
- so I will talk to you later.
- All right.

297
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,370
Hey, hey.

298
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,450
How'd it go with
captain laptop?

299
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,342
He's trying to convince
Andi to go back

300
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:23,291
to college full-time
and quit the Bench.

301
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,112
Who the hell does this
guy think he is?!

302
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,740
I don't think
she's gonna do it.

303
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:28,512
It's too much for her.
I'm sure...

304
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:29,932
I'm sure she'll stay here.

305
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,780
It's a passing thing,
it'll be fine.

306
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,703
Did you guys find anything?

307
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,201
Ah, well, for starters,

308
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:39,360
miss Marjorie Platt from apartment
2a is a Keanu Reeves freak.

309
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,862
- Another one?
- The lakehouse.

310
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,432
God!

311
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,170
Thank me later, Margie.

312
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,090
Well, everybody seems normal.

313
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,680
No weird bug fetishes,

314
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,722
no satanic
magazine subscriptions.

315
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:55,291
This guy's mail is forwarded
from an old address.

316
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:56,761
Harold Bunsen.

317
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,083
Harold--

318
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,642
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

319
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,272
Uh, yeah.

320
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,112
I have his gas bill right here,

321
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,493
and it says his service
started 2 months ago.

322
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,532
Right around the time
of the first murder.

323
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,463
Could be him.

324
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,752
I know how we could
find out for sure.

325
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,412
All right,
Josie's out to lunch.

326
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,600
We use her computer, we're on our
merry way, nobody knows nothing.

327
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,492
- You still have keys to her office?
- Ah, yeah.

328
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,143
Well, I mean, you know,
I kept a couple

329
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:28,751
after we broke up
for emergencies only.

330
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:31,632
And for, uh, naps at her
apartment while she's not there.

331
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,111
Great. We need a password.

332
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,930
Oh, uh, try, uh...

333
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,632
try grumpy.

334
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,573
- It's a little pet name we had for--
- I don't want to know.

335
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:47,051
A cat that we had,
you sicko. God.

336
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:50,300
No, I'm just kidding.
It was totally a name for my junk.

337
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:54,012
That actually worked.

338
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,321
Keep an eye out for Josie,

339
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,221
I want to see if Bunsen
committed any crimes.

340
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:58,502
Ok, will do.

341
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:02,043
Don't you, uh, don't you want to
know why we called it grumpy?

342
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,140
I do not. No. Thank you.

343
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,953
Fine, suit yourself.

344
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:11,521
How you doin'?

345
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,803
Having fun bein' hot? I am.

346
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:17,161
Just keep going.

347
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,490
Danger, danger,
wrap it up, wrap it up.

348
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:22,713
I just started!

349
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,151
Just... wrap it up!

350
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,473
Oh, my god, you are a stalker.

351
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,282
Wow, what are you doing here?

352
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:36,160
That's so--

353
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,381
that's so weird.

354
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:38,760
What are you doing?

355
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,191
- Uh... who's this guy?
- My boss.

356
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:42,823
He prosecutes criminals.

357
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,153
Daniel Scofield,
district attorney.

358
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:46,873
Burt Wysocki, king of beers.

359
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,743
We'll pick this
up later, Josie.

360
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,213
Awesome. See you later.

361
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:53,783
Bangin' the boss, huh?
Good choice, big shot.

362
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,073
I am not banging my boss.

363
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,262
Really? Maybe you should.

364
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:57,700
Might get a little
promotion out of it.

365
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:58,893
Get out of here, Sock.

366
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:00,320
Wait, wait, Josie, Josie.

367
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:02,283
Um, I--I--I--

368
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,691
wait, I do have something important
that I need to tell you, ok?

369
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:07,403
This is hard.

370
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,602
I... I have...

371
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,192
the cancer.

372
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,562
- What?
- Yeah.

373
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,452
I don't have cancer, I'm sorry.

374
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,003
I had a dream about
having cancer,

375
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:32,341
and you were the first person
that I thought of when I woke up.

376
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,832
I thought that had to mean something,
you know?

377
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,521
Right?

378
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,462
There is something
really wrong with you.

379
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:43,172
Yeah, I know. I know.

380
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,413
I'm gonna go take care
of that right now, ok?

381
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:46,681
I just wanted you to know,

382
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:48,762
it means a lot to me
that you still care.

383
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:50,741
Never come here again.

384
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:52,600
Ok!

385
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:57,973
Listen to this police report--

386
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,443
Back in the sixties,
Bunsen was the prime suspect

387
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,770
in the murder of his wife.

388
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:03,272
How'd he kill her?

389
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,192
No cause of death
could be determined.

390
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:06,922
They never had enough
evidence to charge him.

391
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,151
It says here that Bunsen
disappeared in '72.

392
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:11,473
Must have been when he
died and went to hell.

393
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,601
But why come back to
kill some old ladies?

394
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:18,510
- I know why it's bugs.
- Why?

395
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:20,232
They found Bunsen's wife

396
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,383
in a compost heap completely
devoured by bugs.

397
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:24,933
Oh, god.

398
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,342
Can't we just skip this one?

399
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,262
You know, just let it slide,

400
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:32,561
tell the devil we
couldn't find him?

401
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:33,992
Can we do that?

402
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:36,602
Let's get the vessel,
see how hard it's going to be.

403
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,030
Yeah.

404
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:51,710
Oh, right, yeah.

405
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,362
That makes perfect sense.

406
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,912
How am I supposed to
catch a soul with this?

407
00:17:58,168 --> 00:18:00,161
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it has to be plugged in.

408
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:02,453
We gotta catch it wherever
there's an electrical outlet?

409
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,781
Well, that's why the Work
Bench saves the day.

410
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,953
All right,
let's find us an outlet.

411
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,393
Oh, laundry room's that way,
I bet we can plug in there.

412
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:12,781
I'll do some recon. Here.

413
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:14,452
Ok.

414
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,132
Hey, here it is.

415
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:34,931
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Yeah.

416
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:44,932
Just put it in.

417
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,500
This is it.

418
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,292
I should test it out.

419
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,521
No, I don't think you should,
since I--

420
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,960
Oh! Oh! No!

421
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,103
Die! Toaster!
Die, toaster, die!

422
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,193
That was me.

423
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,542
That was my fault.

424
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,113
Really. Bad news.

425
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,441
Ben broke the vessel.

426
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:54,420
Go, go, go!

427
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,562
Ok, so we know
where the soul is.

428
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:22,181
As soon as Ben fixes the vessel,
we go back and we nail him.

429
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,412
Sam, I want you to
understand something, ok?

430
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:27,600
This guy controls... bugs.

431
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,640
I know.
That's why we have to stop him

432
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,040
so he doesn't do it again.

433
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:32,431
Bugs, Sam!

434
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,522
Bugs that kill people.
I'm sorry, I'm out.

435
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,472
Look, you guys don't
have to do this, ok?

436
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:40,052
This is my deal.
If it's too much, I--I understand.

437
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,742
Think I found the problem.

438
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,530
There's a short.

439
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,133
And this thing was never
gonna work right, anyway.

440
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,433
Why am I not surprised?

441
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,500
- Can you fix it?
- Of course.

442
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:53,251
Just have to order the parts,
which will take a day,

443
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:54,881
and you and me
can send this guy

444
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,393
- back to hell in a toaster.
- Actually...

445
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:00,321
let me take care of this
one on my own, Benji.

446
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,100
I don't want you
to get hurt again.

447
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,581
Sam Oliver, Andi Prendergast,

448
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:06,343
report to the manager's office.

449
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,942
Sam Oliver, Andi Prendergast,
manager's office.

450
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,421
You sure, Sam?

451
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,260
Positive. I can
totally handle this.

452
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,683
Kiss ass. Coward.

453
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:23,161
What does Ted want
to see us for?

454
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:24,931
I don't know,
maybe he's lonely.

455
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,452
Ok.

456
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,252
It's been exactly 24 hours
since I've offered you

457
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:35,622
a tremendous career advancement
opportunity here at the Bench.

458
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,253
And your answer is?

459
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,362
I don't want the assistant
manager job, Ted.

460
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,222
Thank you, but no.

461
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,163
That is a...

462
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:46,431
bad decision on your part.

463
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:50,123
But good for you,
Andi. Congratulations.

464
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:52,270
You are the new
assistant manager

465
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:53,870
of the plumbing department.

466
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,260
What?

467
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,053
Your training
begins immediately.

468
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,950
Wait, no,
I really don't want that job.

469
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:01,173
It's a big decision,
I don't need your answer right now.

470
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,101
No, you have my answer.
No, thank you.

471
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,273
You can tell me next week.

472
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,172
I'm not going to
be here next week.

473
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:08,421
What do you mean?

474
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,641
I'm taking classes,

475
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,960
prerequisites for
college next semester.

476
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,112
I was thinking of
a way to tell you.

477
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:21,690
Wait--wait, you're leaving?

478
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:23,883
I'm real--

479
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,193
I'm really sorry.

480
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,171
Awkward...

481
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:31,520
for...

482
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,303
both of you.

483
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:35,121
Almost for all--

484
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,072
all three of us, actually,
since--'cause I'm

485
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,092
right here when it happened.

486
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,690
- Hey, everybody.
- All right.

487
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:48,240
To Andi, thank god you finally
made it out of that dump.

488
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:52,592
Well, it still does
not compute for me.

489
00:22:52,877 --> 00:22:55,223
- What, growing up?
- Ha ha ha, hilarious.

490
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,120
No, I am grown up, Josie, ok?

491
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,193
I can drink, and I can vote.

492
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,022
When the hell have
you ever voted?

493
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:01,893
Unimportant.

494
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:03,373
Look, yay, yes,

495
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,123
we're all very happy for Andi,

496
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:06,591
but can someone
please explain to me

497
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:07,920
the attraction to college?

498
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,300
Yeah, 'cause I want a career one day,
not just a job.

499
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:12,061
- Exactly.
- You know what I mean?

500
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:13,620
Yes. No, I don't.

501
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,371
I'm sorry,
I don't understand that.

502
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,011
Ok, well,
I'm never going to buy a house off

503
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:19,020
- of work bench wages, ever.
- I have a house.

504
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:21,921
- It's your mom's house.
- No, but I--but

505
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,220
I live in it, ok?

506
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:25,890
And somebody pays the bills,
somebody cooks the food,

507
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:27,503
and somebody does the laundry.

508
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,510
So I put it to you guys,
the table.

509
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,570
The great life,
or the greatest life?

510
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,661
You are leaching off your mom,

511
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,652
and you are actually
defending it.

512
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,323
She's a mom, Josie,
she likes it.

513
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,012
It's awesome for her.

514
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,770
Andi, do not listen
to these morons.

515
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:44,782
I think that going
back to school is

516
00:23:44,818 --> 00:23:46,142
the best decision you made

517
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:47,512
since the last time
you decided to do it,

518
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:49,292
and this time it
is going to stick.

519
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,622
All right.

520
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,763
Andi, I'm happy for you.

521
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,452
I think you're gonna do great,

522
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:01,531
we're gonna miss you,

523
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:03,321
you're going to do
amazing in college.

524
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:04,463
Thank you, Ben.

525
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:06,133
I hate you so much right now.

526
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,283
I gotta--um,
I'll be right back.

527
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:26,242
So what are we doing, Sam?

528
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:27,973
I know, I know there were some

529
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:29,840
technical difficulties
with the vessel,

530
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:32,121
but I'm gonna snag the
escaped soul tomorrow.

531
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:34,251
No, I'm talking about you
being such a buzz kill.

532
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:35,570
What's the problem?

533
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:39,123
Andi's leaving again,
probably for good.

534
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:42,513
Oh, so you're just gonna
whine in your light beer.

535
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:44,980
- No wonder she's bailing.
- Ok, are we done?

536
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,382
Or do you need to
keep riding my ass?

537
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,121
You know, Sam,
sometimes I just don't understand you.

538
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:49,692
You know,
it'd be one thing for you blow off

539
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,132
your bounty hunter
duties to get the girl,

540
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,711
but you're not even doing that.

541
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:53,911
You're embarrassing me.

542
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:55,501
What do you want me to do?

543
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:56,900
Get the girl, get the soul.

544
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:59,443
I don't care which, man,
just pull that trigger.

545
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:00,781
Tired of coddling you.

546
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:03,423
You call what you put
me through "coddling?"

547
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,862
Oh-ho, Sam.

548
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:08,632
You have no idea.

549
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,910
It's not me.

550
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:56,023
I didn't kill anyone.

551
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,363
It's her, she's back.

552
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:01,241
- Who?
- Gloria.

553
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:05,000
She's so jealous,
so protective.

554
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:06,610
She killed my wife.

555
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:10,163
And that, uh, exterminator guy.

556
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,840
I told him to stay away.

557
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,152
And the three old ladies?

558
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,951
Fiona something, um,
Harriet and Lois?

559
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,862
- They're all dead?
- Yeah.

560
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:22,821
But I only talked to them.

561
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,463
Gloria's killing anyone she
thinks is getting between us.

562
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:29,113
You just stay away.
She'll kill you, too.

563
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:31,782
She's everywhere.

564
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:34,162
She sees everything.

565
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:15,661
Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.

566
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,533
Gonna kill me some bugs.

567
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,890
That bug spray sucks ass.

568
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:31,423
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

569
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:34,592
My old grandmother could kill
more bugs than that stuff.

570
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:36,293
Try the red one.

571
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:41,160
Yeah, that's a good one.
Go with that.

572
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:54,163
Get kind of heavy carrying all that
stuff around, don't you think?

573
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,080
Just a little?

574
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,930
Hey, careful,
careful with the bug bombs, all right?

575
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:00,512
Don't want to mess around
and blow the place up.

576
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,740
I do not.

577
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:05,672
You know why I can't
go with you, right?

578
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:06,652
Yeah.

579
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,530
I understand.

580
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,133
Good, good.

581
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:12,582
Good!

582
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,923
Good, good, good. All settled.

583
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:15,323
Good to know.

584
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:23,592
Sam, no, no, whoa, no, no, no!

585
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:26,290
God, it's like you don't
know anything sometimes!

586
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:27,523
A fog machine?

587
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:30,093
How are you going to see?
You're going to suffocate, stupid!

588
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,791
Unless you use a gas mask.
That'll work. Right here.

589
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:34,580
Good thing we sell these.

590
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,342
Take that one.

591
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:38,900
- Don't forget the old toaster.
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,462
Definitely need two of these.

593
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,580
Oh, yeah.
We'll strap this on your back.

594
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,292
Turn around. Turn around!

595
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:49,741
Honestly, it's like you're
a child sometimes, Sam.

596
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,131
Ok.

597
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:54,121
Sock, do you want to come
with me to capture the soul?

598
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:57,382
Ok.

599
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:01,973
So are we gonna
pay for this stuff?

600
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:04,403
- Define "pay."
- Like, pay money.

601
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:05,852
Oh, no, no.

602
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,932
What--what do you mean?

603
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,753
We're not gonna pay. Excuse me.

604
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:11,781
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

605
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:14,963
I'll--I'll be right back, ok?

606
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:16,433
Fine.

607
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:21,063
- Andi, hey.
- Hey.

608
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:22,640
What's wrong?

609
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:25,560
I think I'm screwed.

610
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:27,040
Why?

611
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,713
Listen to this.

612
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,333
"Statistical analysis.

613
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:31,682
Topics include--

614
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:34,293
probability, binomial
and normal distributions,

615
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:37,391
2 sample hypothesis tests
for means and proportions,

616
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,871
applied combinative...
something,

617
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:42,053
discrete and continuous
random variables,

618
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:43,683
and simple linear regression."

619
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:47,801
Yeah, I think my brain
just broke a little.

620
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,321
Yeah, I have to take this course,
and I can't even figure out

621
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,053
what the course
description means.

622
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:56,303
Am I making a huge mistake by
going to college full-time?

623
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,580
Honestly.

624
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:02,521
You know, that's not really
something I can answer.

625
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:06,150
Because I tried it before,
and I left.

626
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:08,511
Look, you can do this, Andi.

627
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:10,433
This is nothing.

628
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:12,532
- I don't know.
- I do.

629
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,533
Take the hard classes,
and then take some of the easy stuff,

630
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,120
like, uh, badminton.

631
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:19,903
- I suck at badminton.
- Yeah, me, too.

632
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:22,812
You're just freaking
yourself out.

633
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,371
It's a big change, and...

634
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,001
you know...

635
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,031
you've had your life
on hold ever since

636
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,670
your dad died.

637
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:41,520
Yeah. You're right.

638
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,950
Maybe it's time that I move on.

639
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:47,623
On the Work Bench.

640
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:50,430
Thank you.

641
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:54,790
Yeah, no problem.

642
00:30:55,295 --> 00:30:58,803
Ok. You know, I'm gonna go this
afternoon and sign up for classes.

643
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,380
I can't believe it.

644
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,651
We'll go plug in.

645
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:06,702
How are you getting
in Bunsen's place?

646
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:08,812
I don't know.
I guess we kick the door down?

647
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,190
- Yeah.
- Be careful.

648
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,212
- Don't break your ankle.
- Thanks.

649
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,622
You get the vessel to Sam,

650
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:23,510
- I'll feed you the cord, all right?
- Got it.

651
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,263
Go, go, go, go.

652
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:39,792
Sorry.

653
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,231
You scared me.

654
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,210
Who are you?

655
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:49,093
I'm, uh...

656
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:52,552
I'm Burt Wysocki,

657
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,982
but everyone just
calls me Sock.

658
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,762
I think it's because I fit like a glove,
you know?

659
00:32:06,445 --> 00:32:07,341
Bunsen!

660
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:09,372
Bunsen, you gotta
get out of here!

661
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:13,723
What are you plugging in?

662
00:32:14,677 --> 00:32:16,421
Oh, that's, uh,
that's technical.

663
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:18,150
I don't want to bore
you with the details.

664
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:19,830
What's, uh, what's your name?

665
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:24,192
Ok, ok, look, look, look.

666
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,680
All right, look.

667
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:28,092
I was just trying not to
scare you there before.

668
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:29,872
It's about to get pretty
darn real out there.

669
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,401
I think you should stay with me,
I'll protect you.

670
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,520
Is something bad
about to happen?

671
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,331
Well, I wouldn't say "bad"

672
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:39,633
so much as, uh, "bad-assed."

673
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:42,693
'Bout to squash a few bugs,
you know what I mean? Dead.

674
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:45,260
Yeah. I was thinking
maybe after that,

675
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,441
we could, uh,
go grab a drink together.

676
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:49,011
Share a couple laughs,
maybe, uh,

677
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,721
launder some soiled clothing.

678
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,113
You got a little
something on your...

679
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:55,370
forehead.

680
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,780
Never mind,
looks like you got it.

681
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,902
Bunsen, Bunsen!

682
00:33:07,865 --> 00:33:08,841
Oh, boy.

683
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:12,792
No bugs.

684
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:14,331
Where the hell's the soul?

685
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:15,543
Where the hell is Sock?

686
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,460
Uh, Sock... don't...move.

687
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:28,300
I'm not an idiot, Ben.

688
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,273
- Come on, let him go.
- Sam, Sam, Sam!

689
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,772
Keep it on the cool tip.

690
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,701
She knows I'm allergic to bees.

691
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:35,250
How does she know that?

692
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,132
It came up in conversation, ok?

693
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:38,980
Drop the toaster,

694
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:41,953
or your friend chokes to
death on his swollen tongue.

695
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,643
Actually, it's more of a hives thing--
Sam, Sam!

696
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:46,383
Just--just let him go.

697
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:48,900
No one comes between
Harold and me.

698
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,550
Not even the devil himself.

699
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:54,911
Let him go, Gloria.

700
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:57,791
That's enough already.

701
00:33:58,126 --> 00:33:59,531
You can't just go around
killing everybody

702
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:01,150
you think is coming between us.

703
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:03,370
Harold, they're trying
to send me back.

704
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:04,873
You don't want that.

705
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:08,302
Do you?

706
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:10,981
Yeah, I do.

707
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:15,333
I...

708
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:18,162
never actually
loved you, Gloria.

709
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:19,492
What?

710
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:21,523
I'm sorry,
I know I told you I did,

711
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:23,430
but I was...

712
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:26,541
really into it for the sex.

713
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,081
What we had was a fling,
nothing more.

714
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,411
What's going on?

715
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:38,482
I don't know.
It's working, but it's not working.

716
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,780
When I realized
you killed my wife,

717
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,451
I, uh...

718
00:34:42,716 --> 00:34:45,412
felt like I had
to stay with you,

719
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:48,422
but it was more fear than love.

720
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:50,652
It was all fear, actually.
I'm sorry.

721
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:55,243
I went to hell for you.

722
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,501
Oh, look. Look, Ben, look.

723
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,193
- What?
- It's a bug zapper.

724
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,681
I think we broke it
when we fixed it.

725
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:06,101
- I am sorry.
- Don't be.

726
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:10,133
Because I'm taking you
with me when I go back.

727
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:23,891
Oh, Sam, think of something!

728
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,620
Do something, Sam!

729
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:59,230
Hey, hey, bro-ham.

730
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:03,542
Never tell crazy that you
were in it for the sex!

731
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,480
No, all I'm saying is that
I feel bad for the guy.

732
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:11,961
I'd still do that chick.

733
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:13,133
Gloria?

734
00:36:13,408 --> 00:36:14,742
- She almost killed you.
- I know.

735
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:15,921
Makes me want her more.

736
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:17,560
The guy could have
ended this whole thing

737
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:19,792
if he would have just
told gloria the truth.

738
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:23,142
Instead, all those people died,
and he lived a miserable life.

739
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:25,570
Yeah, you're right.

740
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,732
About what?

741
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,500
I don't want to be
miserable my whole life.

742
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,981
- Here, turn this in for me.
- Where are you goin'?

743
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:39,681
Andi left for college once,
and I never said anything.

744
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:40,933
The devil's right.

745
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:43,400
I just stare at her like an idiot
and wait for something to happen.

746
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,833
I'm not gonna do that again.

747
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,912
- Keys.
- Hey, keys!

748
00:36:56,968 --> 00:37:00,232
*Each day's bettering me now*

749
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:02,003
Excuse me, excuse me.

750
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:04,413
Do you know where the
media studies building is?

751
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,473
Thank you.

752
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:08,112
*Each day is bettering me now*

753
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,463
*all the time,
spend it with me now*

754
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:12,991
Andi.

755
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:14,492
- Hey.
- Hey.

756
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,122
What are you doing here?

757
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:18,512
Um, I--I just
wanted to see you,

758
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:20,273
to, uh, tell you something.

759
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,390
Ok, well, here I am.

760
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,571
So what do you want to tell me?

761
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:31,150
Look, I--I was just thinking...

762
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:33,572
You know...

763
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:38,201
When I heard you were
going to quit the Bench...

764
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:41,081
Look, I--I just
really hate the idea

765
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,741
of not working
with you anymore.

766
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,612
You know? But I think it's cool
that you want to go to school.

767
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,313
I'm not going to
school anymore, Sam.

768
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:49,281
Classes were canceled
for the whole semester.

769
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:51,553
- But why?
- Asbestos.

770
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:53,770
Someone called into
the state and reported

771
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,411
the building is filled with it.

772
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,053
So they shut the
whole department down.

773
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,913
That's weird, huh?

774
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:02,213
Yeah, that's...

775
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:08,680
- Really, um, really weird.
- Yeah.

776
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,732
Andi, I'm--I'm sorry.

777
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,191
I know how important
this is to you.

778
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:17,602
You know how I feel about it?

779
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,753
- No.
- Relieved.

780
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:21,643
- Really?
- Yeah.

781
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:23,941
I mean,
I'm not ready for all this.

782
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,671
You know, college, classes.

783
00:38:25,986 --> 00:38:27,651
You know,
I came back to the Work Bench

784
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,841
because I wanted everything
to be normal again.

785
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:33,120
I just really wanted everything
to be the way that it used to be.

786
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:35,410
I realize that sounds crazy.

787
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:37,542
No, I totally get it.

788
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:39,862
I mean, I'll go back one day.

789
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:43,021
I'll be ready to change everything,
just not now.

790
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,133
Right now, I really need my
life to stay exactly the same.

791
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,131
You know?

792
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:50,632
Do you know what I mean?

793
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:51,970
Yeah.

794
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:54,181
I mean, you could go back, too.

795
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:56,552
You aren't going to hang
out in toilets forever.

796
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:58,962
Yes, I--I could go back.

797
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,073
But, uh, for now,

798
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:05,123
- nothing changes.
- Right.

799
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,332
For now.

800
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:15,041
*Each day's better
with you now*

801
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:17,123
Are you--are you
gonna eat that?

802
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:18,872
It's all yours.

803
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:22,421
*All my time,
spend it with you now*

804
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:26,383
- That's a good cookie.
- *All my time, spend it with you now*

805
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:30,173
