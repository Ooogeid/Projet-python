1
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,517
Is that better?

2
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:32,602
What's that?

3
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,514
I just went for some takeout.

4
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,830
I wasn't expecting company,
not that I mind a surprise visit.

5
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,669
So, what's up?

6
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:47,293
I was on my way to work, and I decided

7
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:50,097
I want to introduce you to my friends.

8
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:52,559
Really? That's great!

9
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,424
Yeah. It is great.

10
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,559
Well, here's the story
we're gonna tell them.

11
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:02,611
- There's a story?
- We met at a mall.

12
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:06,324
I was shopping for pants, and you and
I got into a fight for the last pair.

13
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,177
It was instant chemistry. Boom!

14
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:11,866
Boom. Ben, I don't think that's
gonna be a very good story.

15
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:13,981
It is. It happens all the time.

16
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,058
And after some time passes

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,073
and the guys get to know you
and see how awesome you are,

18
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,480
then we'll tell them you're
a demon from hell and all that.

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,741
You're ashamed of me.
You're ashamed of me, aren't you?

20
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:27,587
- You're ashamed that I'm a demon.
- What? No, that's crazy. No.

21
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,933
I just my friends might have
a problem with the fact that

22
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:34,456
you tried to kill Sam that one time,
but that's all.

23
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,360
It's not like I tried to murder
your friend for fun.

24
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,428
I was rebelling against Satan,
and Sam is his right hand.

25
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,608
I was basically being a hero.

26
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,279
Anyway, can we please move past this?

27
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,987
It would just be for a little while,

28
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,029
and I'll know that they'll be
crazy about you the way I am.

29
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,829
Will you do this for me, please?

30
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:03,404
OK, fine.

31
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:05,700
I'll do it, but the second

32
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,048
that they think they're crazy about me,
we tell them.

33
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:09,775
Absolutely.
Thank you so much.

34
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:17,837
- Tastes like pennies.
- That's just blood, silly.

35
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,527
I'm gonna go wash up.

36
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:28,022
Say, are you just washing
your hands or taking a full shower?

37
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,129
Because I could help.

38
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,583
Actually, I'm late for work.

It's difficult when a member of
your family is removed from your life,

43
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:58,343
forcibly or otherwise,

44
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,863
and we want to
make this time of transition

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,060
as smooth and painless as possible.

46
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,633
With that in mind, we looked over
the personnel from this store,

47
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:10,970
and we feel that we have
made an excellent decision...

48
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:11,857
Surprise.

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,280
- What?
- The floor is yours.

50
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,941
No way. You're our new manager?

51
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:19,407
No way, Sam.
You're banging our new manager. Shut up.

52
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,575
Hey, everybody... Listen, I just
want to say that I know first-hand

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,985
how hard everybody works here, and

54
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,498
don't worry, you know, i'm not gonna
get all crazy with power or anything.

55
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:32,507
Also, I'm not above
buying your affection,

56
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:35,088
so why don't we just kick
the day off with a prize?

57
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,262
A prize?

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,052
I've got one gift certificate to
the coffee shack for one lucky winner.

59
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:43,423
And that winner is...

60
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,930
Les
Nessman.

61
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,390
Yeah! Les, where are you?
Les, get up. He's not here. OK.

62
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:53,668
Hey, everybody,

63
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:56,591
Les Nessman couldn't be here today
'cause he's out on a lumber delivery, so

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,654
I am glad to accept this
gift certificate on his behalf.

65
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:01,775
- Thank you.
- Who is Les Nessman?

66
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:06,147
He and I have a squash game later on.
I will make sure that he gets this.

67
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:07,523
Don't you worry.

68
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,376
I got you a little something
to say congratulations.

69
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,011
Sorry, we were out of
number one boss mugs.

70
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,782
Thank you. That's very sweet.

71
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,469
I'm sorry that I sprung this on you.

72
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,761
Corporate made me promise not to say
anything until official announcement.

73
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:27,254
Are you mad? Really?
OK, so you're cool with this?

74
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,142
I mean,
me being your boss and everything.

75
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:32,228
Yeah, definitely. I mean, nothing's
gonna change between us, right?

76
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,521
Of course not.

77
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,219
OK. Actually...

78
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,071
Do you know this Les Nessman guy?
I mean, I've never even heard of him.

79
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:43,668
Les N... yeah.

80
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,030
He's great. Good. I got to get back
to work. Good talk, OK?

81
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,296
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Benji.

82
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,271
- You guys want to go get a drink?
- Hells yes.

83
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,255
No, not now. Tonight.

84
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,046
There's somebody i'd like you to meet.

85
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:01,687
- Ben, did you meet a girl?
- When did you meet a girl?

86
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,585
I need a little me time,
so I went to the mall alone...

87
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,400
- Sure.
- To buy a couple pair of pants.

88
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,251
You bought a couple pair of pants?

89
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,212
Since when do you need more than one
pair of pants? What are you, Jude Law?

90
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,911
Point is, I went to the mall
and met a girl,

91
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:16,898
nice, normal girl,
and I'd like her to meet you.

92
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,059
- Yeah, we would love to.
- That sounds lovely.

93
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,194
- Set it up, all right?
- Where are you going?

94
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,548
Benji got me all psyched for a drink.
I'm gonna go have a cocktail break.

95
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,121
- Come on.
- Why would I go?

96
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:29,963
Because you, my friend, make
a grasshopper like nobody else can, OK?

97
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,199
- Don't ask questions.
- Yeah, you guys go ahead.

98
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,351
I'll just stay here and work.
That's cool.

99
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:42,379
And I had to go around the house
collecting the hidden whiskey bottles,

100
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,499
one by one.

101
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,595
I guess that's all
I have to say tonight.

102
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:53,357
That's what it's all about,
people staying strong.

103
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,541
Each and every one of us is
here for the same reason.

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,440
We're weak.

105
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,417
But we must also rember
the strength of the individual.

106
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,144
With that in mind,
I'd like to step it up a little bit.

107
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:10,341
Barb, what is your favorite drink?

108
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:14,377
- I love a nice irish car bomb.
- An irish car bomb?

109
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:18,347
Tonight, I want you to go
to your old watering hole,

110
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:21,212
and I want you to order
an irish car bomb.

111
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:25,400
I know, but that's what
I want you all to do.

112
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:29,804
Tonight, you go to a bar, and I want
you to order your favorite poison.

113
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:32,872
And then I want you to walk away.

114
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,734
That's power, people,
power over your addiction.

115
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,057
So let's go do it?

116
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,569
Very good, Barbara. Thank you.

117
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,309
Don't let me down, Carl.
Counting on you, babe.

118
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,722
Be strong.

119
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,733
- You are a terrible person, seriously.
- That's my job, man.

120
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:02,522
You know, tempting the weak,
culling the herd.

121
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:03,894
You know the drill.

122
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,509
Now, I want you to make a fist.
Go ahead.

123
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:14,386
Nice. Solid, strong.
You're gonna be all right.

124
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:36,170
Boxing gloves?
I'm supposed to box a soul now?

125
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,963
He goes by the name of Michael
"red" Sabatino, a real chump.

126
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,587
He took a payoff in
the fifties and threw a fight.

127
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,268
They busted him,
and they drummed him out of the sport.

128
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:50,955
And now he's after the one thing
that eluded him his whole life.

129
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:53,048
The championship he never won.

130
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,806
You are aware that I know
nothing about boxing, right?

131
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:56,931
Relax.

132
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:01,723
Red's got a weak spot. All you have
to do is land one punch on the chin.

133
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,294
Lights out.
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

134
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,430
All right now. Clear out of here.

135
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,413
I've got a sexaholics
group coming in at 5:00.

136
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,030
Tends to be a little messy.

137
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,103
I have never ever had cooked cow before.

138
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:34,053
- This is so good.
- She likes her burgers rare.

139
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,555
So, Nina, where you from?

140
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:42,926
- I'm from the Kansas.
- The State of Kansas. Kansas the State.

141
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:46,383
OK. Yeah, Ben was telling us
that you guys met at the mall.

142
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,147
Boom. Hey, Nina, check this out.

143
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,486
What do you think is
your biggest character flaw?

144
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,384
Sock. You don't have to answer that.

145
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:56,516
Hold on. I just want to
find out what we're in for.

146
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,812
I don't want her to crush
him like cassidy did.

147
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,706
- Who's Cassidy?
- An old flame.

148
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,592
She stepped out on him
while he was in the Pokey.

149
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,217
- What's the Pokey?
- It's prison.

150
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,129
- Babe, why were you in prison?
- It's a long story. I...

151
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,947
My ex-wife double-crossed me.
She took my money and

152
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:17,822
left me holding the bag for
our sham green card marriage.

153
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,862
Plus she was a limey. Gross.

154
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:25,236
You are a horrible judge of
character when it comes to women.

155
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:29,345
So, Anita, what's your deal, then?
You some kind of murderer

156
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,435
- or something?
- She's not a murder!

157
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:34,921
OK, Ben. Sorry. I was just kidding.

158
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,827
I am stuffed.
Does anybody want half my burger?

159
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,678
- I do.
- Nina, no!

160
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:43,151
Jeez!

161
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:48,786
Why'd you do that?

162
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:52,949
I wanted to eat his meat
before those guys got it.

163
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,024
Yeah, Nina, nice.
I like a girl who eats like a trucker.

164
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,318
Thank you, Sock.

165
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,238
This is where the soul
is supposed to be.

166
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,275
Getting a little nervous
to throw down with him?

167
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,845
It's just one punch.
Besides, the devil said he was a chump.

168
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,735
All right, tough guy, let's do it.

169
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,456
Gym's closed.

170
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,893
We're... We're not here to work out!

171
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,421
The devil sent me!

172
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,989
Well, then, step into my office.

173
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:44,169
"Step into my office."

174
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,319
You're not gonna start crying on me,
are you?

175
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:56,789
I'm not gonna cry.

176
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,563
- Let's fight.
- Go on, knock him. Pop him, pop him.

177
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,035
You know who I am, sluggo?

178
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,861
I'm Red Sabatino,

179
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:09,654
the same Red Sabatino
who racked up a 33-1 record.

180
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:14,535
And 29 of those were knockouts.

181
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:22,341
And 11 of those went in the first round.

182
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,475
Walk it off, walk it off!

183
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,923
I was the best there was,
pound for pound, kid.

184
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,732
And they sic a Tomato can in after me?
I'm insulted.

185
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,929
That was me at about 10%.

186
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,591
You come back again, and I'll kill you.

187
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,332
Tell the devil I ain't going back.

188
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:51,554
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Well done.

189
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,574
At least you won the moral victory.

190
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,136
- Hey, boss. You wanted to see me?
- Hey. Yeah. Come in.

191
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,101
I've been trying to find
this les nessman guy.

192
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,059
Really? That SOB.
Win another latte or what?

193
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:15,416
No. What I thought was weird is that
I've never met him,

194
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,536
and we've both worked here for like,
6 years.

195
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:20,392
Two years, Andi. Actually,
Nessman's been here for two years.

196
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,069
Right. Yeah.
Well, you would know since you are him.

197
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,443
- You're high. You're so high.
- I went over old paperwork.

198
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:32,375
You and Les Nessman have worked
the same shift ever since his first day.

199
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,851
So what? We're shift mates.

200
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:35,901
You clock in and out
at the exact same times.

201
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:38,506
- Big whoopity-doo-da.
- I called the coffee shack.

202
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,868
- You did? Yeah.
- I wanted see if Les Nessman had

203
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,720
- redeemed his gift card.
- Did he?

204
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,315
So I asked for a description of Nessman,
and you want to know

205
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,504
- what they said?
- I don't know.

206
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,200
- Handsome and charming?
- Loud and Husky.

207
00:12:58,387 --> 00:12:59,652
Husky? Come on!

208
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:01,738
You are an evil genius.

209
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,046
Right. I've been collecting
an extra paycheck for two years, Andi.

210
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:08,452
- How did you pull it off for so long?
- I did have a little help from Ted.

211
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,079
Ted helped? How?

212
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,131
By being an absolute nimrod and having
no idea what goes on around here.

213
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,254
I'm gonna need les nessman's letter
of resignation on my desk tomorrow.

214
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,094
I don't think so.
He's responsible for half my pay.

215
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:24,428
Sock, OK. I can't in good conscience
have a fictional employee working here.

216
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:27,513
Who needs a good conscience?
I mean, it's overrated.

217
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,932
Either Les Nessman resigns,
or I fire him.

218
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:32,548
- You fi. You're gonna fire him.
- Come on. Help me out.

219
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,929
All right. OK. All right, all right.

220
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:42,544
You know what? I recognize your plight,
and I'll take care of it.

221
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,479
- You will?
- Who's got your back?

222
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:48,488
Thank you, sir.

223
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,719
Welcome to the bench, sir.

224
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,669
- Here. Check this bag.
- sure.

225
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,257
- It's for you. It's a geode.
- It's gorgeous.

226
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,013
It is super-rare.

227
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,196
I saw it, and it reminded
me of how I feel about you.

228
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,552
Sparkly and Warm.

229
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:13,309
It is warm literally.
It's hot in my hands.

230
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,715
- That's because it's from home.
- Home?

231
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,938
Home. Down there home.

232
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:19,566
Hell home.

233
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,707
Yeah. Might have a little
bit of hellfire left in it.

234
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,899
But don't worry. It's perfectly safe.

235
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:28,879
Just don't ever sleep next to it
because it will give you nightmares

236
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,567
and don't ever make wishes upon it
or get it next to a nuclear reactor

237
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,128
and then just use a regular
damp cloth to clean it.

238
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,498
I love it,
and I can't wait to show it to the guys.

239
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:44,298
So what did they think about me anyway?
Did they like me?

240
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:46,525
I think they did,

241
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:51,114
but I wanted to talk to you
about what happened.

242
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,293
Is this about
your disastrous taste in women?

243
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:57,019
Because don't worry about it.

244
00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:00,154
I was thinking more about you
coming at Sam with a knife.

245
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,603
But I didn't.
I came at his burger with the knife.

246
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,932
I just want to be crystal
clear on the issue.

247
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:08,906
You're not dating me to kill Sam, right?

248
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:13,077
No. Besides,
I don't need a knife to kill Sam.

249
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:14,536
What's that mean?

250
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,911
I just use these guys.
I like to get up in there

251
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,751
and feel the heart beating before
I squish it with my hands.

252
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,895
You see,
that doesn't make me feel better.

253
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,567
Let me say this to
you one more time, OK?

254
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,971
What happened between me and Sam in
the past is just that. It's in the past.

255
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:34,569
Besides, after hanging out with him,
I think he's a really good guy.

256
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:36,756
I don't even want to
destroy him anymore.

257
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,844
- That's all I needed to hear.
- Good.

258
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,595
So I figured out your problem
with catching this soul.

259
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,138
And what's my problem?

260
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:52,321
- You are not a boxer.
- You're a genius.

261
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,281
You're going about it all wrong, man.
All you need to do is land one punch.

262
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:58,560
In order to do that, you have to avoid
getting hit for as long as possible.

263
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,042
Now there's no way I can
turn you into a boxer.

264
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,169
Well, yeah.

265
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,339
But I can turn you into a dancer.

266
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:12,395
- A pitching machine?
- No, no. Not a pitching machine.

267
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,610
Your new best friend.
Using modern sports technology,

268
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:18,517
we're gonna increase your speed
and help you avoid getting hit.

269
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,364
- This is totally stupid.
- Good enough for me.

270
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,393
- Hey. I dodged it.
- Good job.

271
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:31,028
I'm doing it. I'm dancing.

272
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:32,748
I know. I see it.

273
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,949
What the hell, man?

274
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,673
- I'm the left hook.
- Well...

275
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:43,630
Eyes on the prize, Sammy.
Eyes on the prize.

276
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,371
How you feeling? You feeling pumped?
Should feel pumped. Winners feel pumped.

277
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:58,430
I am not pumped, and you wouldn't be
either you knew what was ahead of you.

278
00:16:58,555 --> 00:16:59,476
OK. All right.

279
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,497
What are you doing?

280
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,559
I want you to hit my hand
as hard as you can?

281
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:08,102
Hey. Don't be shy. Come on. Drop a load
of Sammy on me. I can handle it.

282
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,626
Would you quit screwing around and hit
my hand as hard as you can? Go.

283
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,776
- That was it.
- Are you serious?

284
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:16,833
- You are weak.
- Sock, not now.

285
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,774
You got the punching
power of a drunken baby.

286
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:21,060
I hope you throw the bone
better than you throw the fist.

287
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,798
- I feel bad for Andi.
- Shut up!

288
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:25,963
- Hey! Wait! Sock, stop it!
- See what I did there, see what I did?

289
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,198
I got inside your head. You lost your
concentration. I slipped shot in on you.

290
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:30,436
- So.
- So?

291
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,152
That's what u got to do to red, man.

292
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:36,142
You got to talk a little trash,
rattle his cage. Boxing requires focus.

293
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:38,837
You know what it's like?
It's like having sex.

294
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,453
Everything's going good, right? You're
getting your groove on, chugging along.

295
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:45,215
In comes the talking, the hints,
the tips, the criticizing.

296
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,356
Next thing you know,
you've lost that concentration,

297
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:49,858
you're locked in the bathroom
yelling at your own lap!

298
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,583
- That could work.
- It will work. Yeah.

299
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,053
Didn't think you had it in you, kid.

300
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,523
You proved your point.
You're not a pushover.

301
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,753
Another time, i'd buy you a beer,

302
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:13,076
but I'm a busy man,
and I'm not going back to hell.

303
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,922
I'm not here to drink beer.
I'm here to fight.

304
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,139
OK. Remember, Sam.
Float like a butterfly

305
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,772
and let your words sting like
a hateful, sarcastic bee.

306
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:30,457
And remember, dance, dance in there.
Dance it out, all right?

307
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,108
- Keep it loose.
- All right.

308
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:37,317
What are you doing?

309
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:40,089
Moving! I'm not gonna
make this easy on you.

310
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:41,852
Wheelhouse time. Get in his wheelhouse.

311
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:44,410
- Wheelhouse. Yeah.
- I got to say, kid. I'm impressed.

312
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:45,853
You got stones for days.

313
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:48,603
Yeah. Well,
you're just another bum, right?

314
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,673
- What did you call me?
- You heard me.

315
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,538
Why don't you ask the 29 guys
I put to bed how much of a bum I am?

316
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,376
I'd rather ask the guy who beat
you because you threw the fight?

317
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,265
Yeah. You weren't so tough on him?

318
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,502
- Nice, Sammy. Stick and move.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

319
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,608
- How much money we got?
- I don't know. Let me find out.

320
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,820
- $13, Sam.
- What do you say, Red?

321
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,504
$13 enough to buy you off these days?

322
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,454
You know what?
Maybe you could pay me to beat you.

323
00:19:46,757 --> 00:19:47,757
Run, Sam!

324
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:01,901
- Did he just knock himself out?
- Yes, I believe he did.

325
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:15,646
Maybe you,
might want to take the gloves off.

326
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:22,341
- Forget it. It's too hard.
- Hey, man. I got to tell you something.

327
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:24,300
- You were awesome back there.
- Sock listen.

328
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:27,415
It's awful that you pummeled my friend
into the ground and everything, but.

329
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,045
Oh, my god.
I've never seen a human being

330
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,564
deal out punishment like that
in my life. It was unreal.

331
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:35,983
Thanks. To be fair, your buddy could
take a punch with the best of them.

332
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:39,736
There you go. It's nice to be good
at something, right, Sammy? Right?

333
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,788
Sorry about what happened back there.

334
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:45,618
I mean, you pressed my buttons pretty
good, and I guess I blew a gasket.

335
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,288
That's why they called me red, you know?

336
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,978
I'd lose my temper,
and that's all I could see.

337
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,800
- Red.
- Red. But that's not what I'm about.

338
00:20:58,621 --> 00:20:59,690
Not anymore.

339
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,729
Beat half the guys on this wall.

340
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,771
- I should be up there.
- How come you're not?

341
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:15,460
Disgraced myself.
Disgraced the game.

342
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:18,876
Took a bribe, and that's all she wrote.

343
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:21,945
Well, if you were so good,
why'd you throw the fight?

344
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:24,040
A guy comes to me, he...

345
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,659
Offers me more money
than what the prize money was.

346
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,304
I got greedy.

347
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,561
Wound up being the biggest
mistake I ever made.

348
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,834
Fixing to change that, though.

349
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:40,213
So. You're supposed to
send me back to hell?

350
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,817
Don't really have a choice.
Devil owns my soul.

351
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,177
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to capture you.

352
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:47,732
Probably later.

353
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,413
Look. I'm not looking to hurt
anybody or kill anybody, eh?

354
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:57,478
I got one goal and one goal only.

355
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,193
Win that title.

356
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:05,209
Figure it will take me 7 fights.
First one is next week in Vegas,

357
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:09,688
so I think I could have the whole
thing wrapped up in two years tops.

358
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,990
- So...
- So. I got a proposition.

359
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,777
Let me do this.
Give me the two years.

360
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:21,463
I win the title,
then I'll go back to hell willingly.

361
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,662
- I'd be happy to.
- I don't believe you.

362
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:27,528
Look. Either you
go back with me in that ring

363
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,429
and I beat you to a pulp again,

364
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:34,136
or you can take my proposition to your
boss and see what he has to say about it.

365
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:40,113
- I guess I'll run it up the flagpole.
- Yeah. Good choice.

366
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,392
- This isn't for me.
- Just got off the phone with corporate.

367
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:52,648
- How is corporate?
- Not good, actually.

368
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:55,247
It seems that they got a call from
a Mr. Les Nessman.

369
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:59,571
He threatened to file a sexual
harassment suit against me.

370
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:02,546
Apparently, I keep asking him
to do me in the tool corral.

371
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,585
Now, somehow I am sensing that you
are a little bit upset about this.

372
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,981
- What the hell were you thinking?!
- Lower your voice, all right?

373
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:10,946
I solved our problem, Andi.

374
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:13,228
You can't fire Nessman now
or you look like a harasser.

375
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:16,052
This way, you're off the hook,
I keep getting paid.

376
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:18,405
Everyone wins.
Who's got your back? Sock does.

377
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,314
Do you understand what you've done?
I almost got fired.

378
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,474
I have to go to a 2-day
sexual harassment seminar.

379
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,393
So new to the ways
of the corporate world.

380
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:30,925
You cannot play by the rules
with the big boys, all right?

381
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,308
You got to play dirty.
Punch 'em in the nuts.

382
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:35,537
- Want a little soda?
- No. I'm good, thanks.

383
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,502
OK. Suit yourself.
Perfect. More for me.

384
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:40,734
What are you saying, I don't look good?

385
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,892
I just think you could look better.
You had this look for a long time now.

386
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:46,391
- I like this look.
- Maybe you should grow a soul patch.

387
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:49,508
- No. I'm not growing a douche tag.
- Hey, I like soul patches.

388
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:51,328
A Tiny beard isn't going to help me Ben.

389
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,249
- All right. Fine.
- How about sideburns?

390
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,466
See, now sideburns
might be a really good idea.

391
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:57,508
- Hey, there's Nina.
- Yeah, that's her.

392
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:00,942
She ain't slowing down. Ben.

393
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,103
God.

394
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:09,821
Oh, my gosh.

395
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,933
I'm sorry. I got confused
with the pedals...

396
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:15,425
- You OK?
- Yeah. I think so.

397
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,176
- You OK?
- Yeah. I think so.

398
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:20,110
- What were you doing?
- I haven't been driving that long...

399
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:22,010
You almost killed Sam. That is not OK.

400
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:23,461
Ben, I'm not hurt. It's OK.

401
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,821
We talked about this, remember?
We talked about this.

402
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:27,787
- Talked about what?
- It was an accident.

403
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:30,402
- I don't think I believe you.
- Then you're being a bad boyfriend.

404
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,399
I just got in a car accident, Ben.

405
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:34,574
Excuse me. Why would your girlfriend

406
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,928
almost hitting me with a car
not be an accident?

407
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:40,644
Because I'm a demon.

408
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:46,411
OK. So...
So there. I said it. And actually,

409
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:49,194
I feel better for having said it because
now we can all move forward.

410
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:50,363
You're a demon?

411
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:54,234
You met a demon at the mall?

412
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,220
She's the demon who kidnapped me.

413
00:24:56,355 --> 00:25:00,068
The demon who kidnapped you? But you.
You mean the demon who tried to kill me?

414
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:01,309
Also that. Yes.

415
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:06,783
Hey, Sock, lock the door.

416
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:13,423
What's going on?

417
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:15,486
- Nina is a demon.
- What?

418
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:18,424
Yeah. She's the demon that tried
to kill me, and Ben is dating her!

419
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,980
- I knew you weren't buying more pants.
- It's not what you think.

420
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,897
"I think"? I think you're going out with
the thing that was sent to murder me!

421
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,374
- And you've been lying to us.
- And you've been lying to us.

422
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,849
Which is the most hurtful
thing of it all to me.

423
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:32,350
I was gonna tell you the truth
eventually, when you got to know her.

424
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:34,483
There is something seriously
wrong with you man.

425
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:37,534
She said she didn't want to kill you
anymore. And I wanted to believe her.

426
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:40,781
You wanted to believe her.
He wanted to believe her. That's good.

427
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,695
I'm sorry. Let me talk to her, please.

428
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,164
Nothing to talk about.
She's a demon. As long as she's around,

429
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:47,627
I'm in danger. We're all in danger.
This can't happen.

430
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:48,784
If you would just.

431
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:51,590
If you ever thought of us as friends,
you have to break up with Nina.

432
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:01,129
Hey, did you know Sock was Les Nessman?

433
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:03,935
Think about your answer really hard.

434
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:06,358
I might have had an idea.

435
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,444
I might have helped craft
Les Nessman's resume.

436
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,374
- What? Why wouldn't you tell me that?
- Because before you were boss,

437
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:14,401
 it never really came up.
And then when it did,

438
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,073
I decided to leave it between you
and Sock to remain neutral.

439
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,157
OK, well, he almost got me fired, Sam!

440
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:20,967
Would you have remained neutral then?

441
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:23,176
Andi, no. Of course not. What?

442
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:28,609
I'm sorry, OK? It's just I have to be
the one that's in charge now.

443
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:31,055
I can't screw around
with you guys anymore.

444
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:33,940
Would you like me to
beat him up for you?

445
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,842
Because I'm getting
less awful at fighting.

446
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:37,716
No. I'll talk to him.

447
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:39,728
I have to be the adult.

448
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:41,965
That's no.
That's definitely a terrible idea.

449
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:42,737
Why?

450
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:45,916
Because you can't deal with Sock as an
adult. You have to sink to his level.

451
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,077
- You have to sink below his level.
- I'm not even sure that's possible.

452
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:52,445
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:55,244
And I hear you loud and clear.
And I want you to know that

454
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,406
I'm taking care of the situation,
all right?

455
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:00,688
- Yeah. Thank you.
- What are you taking care of?

456
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm going to break up with Nina,

457
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:06,417
and I'm kind of scared
that she might not take it too well.

458
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:09,355
I'm so sorry, Ben.
Is there anything I can do?

459
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:13,594
Yes, you can. May I please borrow the
company pepper spray and box cutters?

460
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:15,342
Thank you.

461
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:17,926
You did it.

462
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:21,492
And when the bartender made you your
favorite drink, you said, "no, sir."

463
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:23,679
What a man.

464
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,711
What a mighty good man.

465
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:27,697
I'm proud of you, Carl.

466
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:30,471
Of course you know what this means.

467
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,376
- What does it mean?
- It means...

468
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:35,623
You are cured.

469
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:38,012
I am?

470
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,907
You are no longer an alcoholic, man.

471
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:42,804
Now, get the heck out of here.

472
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:49,640
My man.

473
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,560
I love helping people.

474
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:57,037
Hey, Sammy, what's up?

475
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,773
- You get my soul yet?
- Working on it.

476
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,637
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you about him.

477
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,744
- Already hating this conversation.
- No, no. I'm gonna capture him.

478
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:09,394
I was just wondering if
you wouldn't mind a delay.

479
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,613
A slight delay.

480
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:12,978
I don't follow.

481
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,029
The guy just wants
to win the championship,

482
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,933
and then he'll go back to hell,
no problem.

483
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,393
I was thinking that maybe you
could wait, a couple years.

484
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:28,485
Punishing souls
is like raising children.

485
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:32,991
They need consistency.
And you can't reward bad behavior.

486
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:34,964
If they step out of line,

487
00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:38,706
you just have to give them a time-out
in the closet of abysmal agony.

488
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,878
Yeah, but you'll still get him in hell.
The end is the same.

489
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,701
Hey, souls don't get second chances

490
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,902
to achieve life goals.

491
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:49,899
That's not how we roll in h-town, baby.

492
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:52,645
He's not a bad guy. He made one
mistake that ruined his life.

493
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:56,187
Yeah, he threw a fight for 47,000
bucks and didn't think twice about it.

494
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,759
Red Sabatino's nothing
more than a greedy thug.

495
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,640
It was you.

496
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:07,098
You bribed red to throw that fight.
You destroyed his life.

497
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,926
Red destroyed his own life.

498
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:12,331
I simply provided him a choice, Sam...

499
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,249
To do the right thing or the easy thing.

500
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:19,114
And he chose to prove to the world

501
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:22,634
that he's just a bum who's willing to
trade his integrity for few easy bucks.

502
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:25,168
Yeah, but that's not fair.
It was a moment of weakness.

503
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:27,704
It if hadn't been for you,
he would have never thrown that fight.

504
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:30,183
Come on. Moment of weakness.
There's no such thing.

505
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,931
Human lives are defined by weakness.

506
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,679
Red would have been a bad
apple with our without my help.

507
00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:38,972
I just expedited the paperwork,
that's all.

508
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:40,319
Here.

509
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:45,350
You know,
on that fight next week in Vegas,

510
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:49,425
the one Red's been training for,
it can't happen, Sam.

511
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,258
Make sure of it.

512
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,253
I'm really glad you called.

513
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,661
I wanted to say again that I'm sorry

514
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:46,123
for almost hitting your friend
with my car.

515
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,302
And I also wanted to say i'm sorry

516
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:50,801
for blurting out all that demon stuff.

517
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:53,720
That's what I do.
I get angry, and I blurt.

518
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:58,283
There's something I have to say.

519
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:01,925
And before I say it, i'd like to remind
you that we're at a public place,

520
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,140
and there are tons of witnesses here.

521
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:07,393
Oh, no. You're breaking up with me.

522
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:09,654
I want you to know
that this isn't easy for me.

523
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,951
There's just no way around it.
I...

524
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:15,864
Are you growling at me?

525
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,544
You have the demon eyes, Nina.

526
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:24,714
Don't do anything crazy.

527
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,104
You're crying.

528
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:35,016
And your tears are made of acid.

529
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,888
Is everybody looking at me?

530
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,332
No, no. You're fine.

531
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,602
Nina, I'm sorry.

532
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:47,907
I want to believe you,
but my friends are everything to me.

533
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,670
And I just don't think they'll ever
be able to see you as

534
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,349
anything other than a monster.

535
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:54,494
How do you see me, Ben?

536
00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:03,083
Well...
That says it all for me.

537
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,237
I guess this is it.

538
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:19,057
I understand why you're afraid of me.
It just makes me sad.

539
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:22,876
I like you a lot.

540
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:26,498
Take care of yourself, Ben.

541
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,795
Did you see Benjamin come on last night.

542
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,459
Rough, man. Just sat on the couch all
night and watched "dan in real life."

543
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:44,424
Oh, god. He's hurting. I know.

544
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:48,240
I can't feel guilty about this. He's the
one who secretly wanted to date a demon.

545
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,349
- What's with the creeps?
- I don't know.

546
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:02,488
Hi. I'm Dave.

547
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:04,961
No. I won't pray with you.

548
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,638
Good morning, everybody.

549
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:12,551
I'm guessing you've all
noticed our visitors.

550
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:15,238
Did we open a weird sweater department?

551
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:19,633
Home office was very kind
to send some grief counselors after I

552
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:21,765
broke the news to them.

553
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:25,885
Last night, I received
a call from the police, and...

554
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:30,177
it seems that Les Nessman was
involved in an accident,

555
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,316
and he's gone. He's... dead.

556
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:39,349
I'm sorry.
I know how much you all loved him.

557
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,132
Oh. My god!
You son of a bitch! This is...

558
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:44,465
- This is crap, Andi.
- We've got a screamer.

559
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:48,715
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Sadness makes me angry.

560
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:52,320
I also have the sad duty of
telling you how les passed.

561
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:56,251
Probably doing something awesome, right?
Like... Les was always doing cool stuff.

562
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,527
Was he running into
a burning orphanage, Andi?

563
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,729
Did he save a little flaming orphan?
Was it Andi?

564
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,636
- He died on the toilet.
- Why?

565
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:08,890
Why?

566
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,466
- Devil said no?
- I tried.

567
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:34,445
Yeah. Well, it was a long shot,
anyway, right?

568
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:35,989
Run.

569
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:39,325
- Run?
- Run away. Just get out of here.

570
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,461
Forget about the title. If you disappear
someplace I can't find you you are free.

571
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:46,354
- Can't do that, chief.
- Why? Why not?

572
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,279
Come on, can't forget about the title.

573
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:51,532
Who cares about some boxing match?
You got out of hell.

574
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,170
Isn't that more important than a game?

575
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,707
I remember the end of my life.

576
00:35:01,744 --> 00:35:04,157
I know what it's like to
look back and realize...

577
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:07,163
you threw it all away.

578
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,981
I turned myself into a piece of garbage.

579
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,846
And that kind of regret...

580
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,449
I can't let that be all that I am.

581
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,350
It's not just a game.

582
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,633
I win this title fair and square,

583
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:25,071
it'll prove that i'm not all rotten
and wash away all my mistakes.

584
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,490
You don't have to do
this to be a good person.

585
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:31,273
Go join the peace corps, build houses
for poor people. Anything but this.

586
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,228
Fighting's the only
thing I'm good at, sam.

587
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:35,923
I hear a lot of talking...

588
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,497
but I don't see a lot of fighting.

589
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:40,713
I know him.

590
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:44,901
He's the guy who paid you off,
also known as the devil.

591
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:48,070
You know, boys, as far as I can tell,

592
00:35:48,828 --> 00:35:50,432
there are two ways this is gonna end.

593
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:53,117
One of you will find
his way back to hell...

594
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:55,860
or one of you will be dead.

595
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:59,322
It doesn't matter to
me which way it goes.

596
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:05,072
But I recommend somebody start throwing
some punches before I lose my patience.

597
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:08,961
No. Look. We're not gonna!

598
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,935
- That's what i'm talking about.
- Red! What are you doing?

599
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:16,714
What red! Red!
We don't have to do this?

600
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:30,864
- Make it look good.
- What?

601
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,041
I laid down once before
for the wrong reasons.

602
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,857
I'm gonna lay down for the right ones.

603
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,527
Stop clinching, ladies.
This is a fight, not a dance hall.

604
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,951
- Red, no.
- So make it look good.

605
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:58,869
All right!

606
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:01,705
That was intense.

607
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:03,594
I don't mind telling you,

608
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,805
I would have bet against
you if I was a betting man.

609
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:10,435
Take them.

610
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:14,407
Come on, Sammy, don't be like that.
Savor the victory.

611
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,315
Eye of the tiger, Sammy!

612
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:18,669
Eye of the tiger.

613
00:37:25,428 --> 00:37:26,656
what's going on?

614
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,444
Benji's been talking to these grief
counselors for, like, an hour.

615
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:31,490
He's pretty broken up about Nina.

616
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:33,541
Look out, man.

617
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:37,545
We're gonna need coffee
and pound cake in here, please.

618
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,742
I'm gonna take a shot at this.

619
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,380
Can I talk to you for a second?

620
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:47,246
Ben, I know this has been hard but

621
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:49,638
I need you to take all your
personal feelings,

622
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:52,038
just shove them aside
and answer me with clarity.

623
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:54,900
Do you think Nina was
trying to murder me?

624
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:57,288
She said it was an accident.

625
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,735
I thought about it, and I believe her.

626
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,016
I mean, I know I've had bad judgment
in the past,

627
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,882
but I know i'm right about Nina.

628
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:14,290
- Nina's made her mistakes.
- Scary, evil mistakes.

629
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,909
But I trust you, Ben.

630
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:19,366
And if you see something good in her,
I have to believe you,

631
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:22,680
because I've seen good in
some unlikely places recently.

632
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:25,710
- Thanks, Sam.
- No problem.

633
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,720
Hug it out. Let go.

634
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:29,221
Go get your demon.

635
00:38:30,703 --> 00:38:32,745
- That was sweet of you.
- Thank you.

636
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:35,005
- I hope he doesn't get eaten.
- Me, too.

637
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,160
Nina, I'm back.

638
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:40,669
Baby, we need to talk.

639
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:51,867
Great news, honey.
We can get back together.

640
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:53,769
Nina, I'm sorry.

641
00:38:54,204 --> 00:38:56,749
I listened to my friends
instead of listening to myself.

642
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,502
I believed in you.
I always believed in you.

643
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,172
I know you're not a monster.

644
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,070
You're my girl...

645
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,338
my sweet, beautiful...

646
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,052
crazy-ass girl.

647
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,541
Getting a little light-headed now.

648
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:14,872
Actually, I'm getting tunnel vision now.

649
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:29,573
I'm sorry, Nina.
Please give me another chance.

650
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,440
You're forgiven.

651
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:45,673
Danny boy the pipes,

652
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:49,000
the pipes are calling

653
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:53,041
from glen to glen...

654
00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:55,597
- unbelievable.
- Alms for lester.

655
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,626
Alms for Les. Yeah, thank you.

656
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:00,107
Thank you. Thank you.

657
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,730
- What is this?
- We're throwing a wake for Les Nessman.

658
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,716
Why are we throwing
a wake for Les Nessman?

659
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:07,236
Because he was murdered
by your girlfriend.

660
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:10,384
- You're such a moron.
- You guys kicking in?

661
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,342
For what?

662
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:14,524
Les' mom says they're having a really
rough time with the funeral expenses.

663
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:17,288
Tricky time to die.
Don't die, if you're thinking about it.

664
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,046
You're kidding.

665
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:22,333
I love to joke about
people who died penniless.

666
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:28,244
A 5? Really?

667
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,092
It's a 5, everybody.

668
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:32,996
Here.

669
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,667
I thank you.
And Les Nessman thanks you.

670
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:39,425
Now, if you'll excuse me, I just
have a couple things to attend to.

671
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,156
Why don't you grab us a table?
I'll grab us a couple drinks.

672
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,017
Two beers.

673
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:54,184
- Put those on my tab? Please?
- No, no, no, i'll pay for it.

674
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:57,828
Jeez, Sam.
I'm just trying to be friendly.

675
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,379
What, do you want something?

676
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,996
Well, you seemed down
after the sabatino fight.

677
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,860
- So I just came by to check on you.
- No, you didn't.

678
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:07,630
You came her to gloat over forcing me
to send Red back to hell.

679
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:11,109
Well, the two wants are
not mutually exclusive.

680
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:13,887
To victory.

681
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:18,064
- Thanks.
- You know, Sammy,

682
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,280
You can make it a lot easier on yourself
if you just remember the first rule:

683
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,678
i'm always going to win.

684
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:31,307
And I hate to see you tearing
yourself apart like this.

685
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,618
Red threw the fight.

686
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:37,996
- He let me win.
- Hey, don't kid a kidder, kiddo.

687
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,986
Why would he do that?

688
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:42,832
Because he wanted to go back to hell
knowing he did something good,

689
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:44,750
something worthwhile.

690
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:47,410
So he sacrificed himself to save me.

691
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,467
He got his wish.

692
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,462
So in a way, you did something good.

693
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,029
Weird?

694
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,898
