4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,366
Hello?

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,733
Andi, hey.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,366
Yeah, everything's
on schedule.

7
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,199
Dinner might be
a little bit late.

8
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,433
No, i want
to cook for you.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,100
Heh, no.

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,000
No, you won't get
food poisoning.

11
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,700
All right,
i'll see you in a bit.

12
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,833
"Debone chicken."

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,166
All right.

14
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,000
Aaah!

15
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,733
Why?

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,933
Why did you
betray us?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,199
Tony?

18
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:18,134
Tony!

19
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,700
I swear i was
tricked by the devil!

20
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,233
Look into my eyes.

21
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,900
I didn't betray you!

22
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,533
I...

23
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,166
I-I know.

24
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,733
I know, I know,
I know, Sam.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,000
Come here.
Did i hurt you?

26
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,667
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

27
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,100
Needs a little garlic.

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
What it says next?

29
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,433
Uh, debone chicken.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,400
Ok, easy enough.

31
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,700
Oh.

32
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,466
That's how you do that.

33
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,867
I'm, uh, leaving
my apartment,

34
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,000
Dropping out of
society altogether.

35
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,433
Except for my bon
appit magazines.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,867
They're what
keep me sane.

37
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,333
But it's just
not safe to be
around anymore.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,466
Where are you gonna go?

39
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:20,266
Oh, steve and I had
this little ramshackle
place in the country.

40
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,833
We...were gonna
retire there.

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,767
But now it's perfect
for what I need.

42
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,867
To fight against...

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,433
the devil.

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,180
To do what?

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,233
To defeat him.

46
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,867
I'm going
to rebuild the army.

47
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:40,965
Pass the paprika.

48
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,299
Tony, I think
the better way

49
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,767
To defeat the devil
is with Steve's plan.

50
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,800
Random acts of kindness,
pay it forward.

51
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,533
That's what's going
to stop the devil.

52
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,700
Hey.

53
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,933
Hey! You're early.
Yeah, sorry,

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,933
I just felt guilty
with you doing everything
on your own.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,266
No, it's fine.

56
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,933
Were--Were you talking
to someone?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,700
Just me.

58
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,767
Just, I was--I was
reading the...cookbook.

59
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,333
Oh. 'Cause I heard 2 voices.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,433
Yeah. I like to give
different voices
to the ingredients.

61
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,100
[Deep voice]
grr, zucchini.

62
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,299
Well, it smells great.

63
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,733
Yeah.

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,667
Um...

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,633
It's the paprika.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,134
So are we still
on for lunch?

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,334
Definitely.

68
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:42,134
Anything you want
from the meat truck,
my treat.

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
You, sir, are an
amazing boyfriend.

70
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,833
Heh. Bye.

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,367
Bye.

72
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,533
What's goin' on
here?

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,833
Take a look.

74
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,967
Hey.

75
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey.

76
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,000
So, you're back
together, huh?

77
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, decided
to give the poor thing
one more shot,

78
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,867
See how she handles
herself, you know?

79
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,034
I hope you guys both
know how lucky you are

80
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,401
To have strong, proud,
intelligent women.

81
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,267
It's hard to find love.
I should know.

82
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,067
Don't--Just don't, man.
Don't mope.

83
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:15,367
Don't go down that road.
You want to find a girl,

84
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:17,000
We will help you
find a girl!

85
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,767
You must have your eye
on somebody.

86
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,100
I got nothing.

87
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,533
Of course
you've got nothing.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,134
You choose to got nothing.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,300
All right, man, come on,
show me the list.

90
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,566
What list?

91
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,533
What list?!
What list?

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,034
You got this list.

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,234
The one--Benji!
The one you've had
in your back pocket

94
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,034
For 10 years,
all right?

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,666
So let's see,
what would you like?

96
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,967
You would like
a girl who's funny,
sure,

97
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:40,833
Smart, piercing
green eyes,

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,434
Delicate wrists,
independently weathy,

99
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,967
A trained masseuse.

100
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:48,200
Essential.

101
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,401
Uh-Huh. A fan
of mixed-Martial arts.

102
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,501
Tough.

103
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,167
Familiar with the works
of Ms. Sue grafton.

104
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,267
Intellectual.

105
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,833
Sue grafton, really?

106
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,967
Oh, alphabet novels
are sick,

107
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,533
And g is for gumshoe
is so off the hook.

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,566
Point is, Ben,

109
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:06,300
We all want
to date this girl,

110
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,267
But it isn't gonna happen,
you know why?

111
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,633
She doesn't exist.

112
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,800
Now listen to me, ben,

113
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,733
I am going to spit some
scientific fact at you.

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
The longer most men
are in a relationship,

115
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,666
The happier they get.

116
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,434
The opposite is true
for the lady folk, ok?

117
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:22,633
So we would just
like to see you happy

118
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,900
Making a woman miserable,
like we're both doing.

119
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,833
So, kill
the ridiculous list, ok?

120
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,100
Kill the list.

121
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,367
Head's up.

122
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:48,900
Ow!

123
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,434
Nice header there, becks.

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,067
Oh, look at you, man.

125
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:56,633
I kick a soccer ball
right at your head,

126
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,833
And you're grinning
like an idiot.

127
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm not grinning.

128
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,600
Maybe this
will put a smile
on your face.

129
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,434
You see number five
over there?

130
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,833
And the one over there
by the jungle gym?

131
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,700
And that one
over by the tree?

132
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,300
Don't tell me
they're all souls.

133
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,200
No.

134
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:14,900
They're all related.

135
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,334
They all have
different mothers,

136
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,767
But the same father.

137
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,967
Ok.

138
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:20,833
But they don't
know that, see?

139
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,067
As a matter of fact,
i don't think

140
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:23,434
Any of the mothers
know that, either.

141
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,467
That this man...

142
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,234
is the father.

143
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,467
He now goes by the name
Jack King.

144
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:33,467
Yep, ol' jack's
not only their father,

145
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:36,234
He's also the proud father
of a few hundred other children.

146
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,733
A few hundred?

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,700
Yeah.

148
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,334
He's a true narcissist.

149
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,100
A man after my own heart.

150
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,334
I mean, what is he,
a serial rapist?

151
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,167
Wow. You go
to the dark place fast.

152
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:49,501
No, nothing like that.

153
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,334
No, Jack's method
of conception

154
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,900
Is somewhat
less conventional.

155
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,900
I can assure you that
the sperm in our bank

156
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:02,600
Comes from the highest
caliber contributor.

157
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,633
Here is our donor book.

158
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,633
You can start
flipping through,

159
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,533
But i have to say,

160
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,967
I think i have
the perfect guy for you.

161
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:18,434
Yeah, i'd have to say,
he's pretty much
the total package.

162
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,100
So where
do we find him?

163
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,633
Devil says Jack
opened up shop again
at a new sperm bank.

164
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,733
Oh, fun.

165
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,933
Whoa.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,200
Vessel.
Huh? Oh.

167
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,767
What?

168
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,501
That doesn't look
all that--Whoa!

169
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,134
Oh, sweet lord in hell!

170
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,334
Oh, thank you, devil.

171
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,134
Thank you so, so much.

172
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,833
May I? Yeah.

173
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,401
Oh, yeah.

174
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:58,600
He's duncan mcleod,
the highlander.

175
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,600
The highlander
doesn't have a scythe.

176
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,067
He's duncan mcleod,
the highlander,
who now has a scythe.

177
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,566
All right, let's just
get on with it.

178
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,900
Ok, take it easy, easy.

179
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,067
Sweet, let's go.

180
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:13,034
Hi.

181
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,501
You ready for lunch?

182
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, um, actually,
I already ate.

183
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,633
Oh.

184
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,867
It's my fault.

185
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,767
I challenged Sam
to an eating contest.

186
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,867
I won, heh.

187
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,933
Yeah. Yeah, Sock brought in
a bunch of food.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,401
It was paella.

189
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,267
It's spanish for rice.

190
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,967
But i promise you I'll...
I'll make it up to you, ok?

191
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,967
Ok.

192
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,467
No problem.

193
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,134
Hey, so, uh,

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Did the devil happen
to mention to you

195
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,167
What this
semen demon's
special powers are?

196
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,501
I don't think so.

197
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,200
Ok. 'Cause my head
has gone

198
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,933
To some pretty
awful places
with this one.

199
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,767
Hi, uh, we'd like
to become donors.

200
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,767
Mm-Hmm.

201
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,300
Fill these out.
Just so you know,

202
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,467
We have an extremely...
rigorous

203
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,633
Selection process.

204
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,067
Oh, that's good.
So do i.

205
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,566
What college
did you attend?

206
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:17,800
Harvard.

207
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,833
I went to Oxford.

208
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
Yeah, but i also went
to yale medical school.

209
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,067
I research alternate
power sources.

210
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:32,200
I have a 4-Foot
vertical leap.

211
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Hey.

212
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,600
There he is.

213
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,367
Come in.

214
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,833
Hey, Jack.

215
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,200
Hello, heh.

216
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:51,267
You're not here
for a deposit, are you?

217
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,700
I don't know,
we may be making
one big deposit today--

218
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,501
You back to hell.

219
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,434
Hmm, no.

220
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:00,467
Come on, you don't think
i really belong in hell!

221
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,467
I was just trying
to make the world
a better place!

222
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,666
And I did!

223
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,100
No, no, please,
don't do this!

224
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,501
I--I have children
to think of!

225
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,167
Hundreds and hundreds
of children!

226
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,367
Did you mean
to cut his head off?!

227
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,033
Uh!

228
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,567
Whoa! Oh!

229
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,999
They're over here!
Aaah!

230
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,999
No, this way.

231
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,200
I don't know
what to do! I cut him!

232
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,433
Cut him again,
Cut him again!

233
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,400
You morons!

234
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,567
You're carving up
a masterpiece!

235
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:47,999
You're destroying--
Aah!

236
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,600
All right, now, now,

237
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,899
Hold on one second.

238
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:01,899
Before you send me back,
tell me...

239
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,066
how do I look?

240
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:07,533
Stupid question.
I know I look great.

241
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,066
Sso we good?

242
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,899
Yeah.
I feel kinda hungry.

243
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,400
What do you want to get?
I don't know.

244
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,166
I feel like ham
for some reason.

245
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,800
Let's do it.

246
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,333
Ben?
Hmm?

247
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,767
Want the rest
of my pretzel?
I can't finish it.

248
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:28,834
Are you kidding?

249
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,333
I know you love your pretzels,
are you sure?

250
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,033
It's my fifth one
of the day.

251
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,333
Oh, my god, come on,
that is not safe.

252
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,467
All right.

253
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,100
What's that?

254
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,200
Uh, nothing.

255
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,767
It's...it's nothing.

256
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,233
What? Let me see.

257
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,200
No, it's just
this stupid list

258
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,033
About everything
I want in a girlfriend,

259
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,266
And it's long, and I'm going
to cut it down, so I--

260
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,600
This is really great.

261
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,834
Really?
Mm-Hmm.

262
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,200
You know, because
the guys think
it's unrealistic,

263
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,233
And they think my standards
are too high.

264
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,166
Really? Oh, ben,
they are wrong.

265
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,800
This girl
is out there.

266
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,166
You just gotta go
and find her.

267
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,266
Yeah?
Mm-Hmm.

268
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,033
Soul mates exist.

269
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,066
I really
believe that.

270
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,866
Have you met yours?

271
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,133
Yeah.

272
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,433
When I was 12.

273
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,200
I was at the mall,

274
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,033
And I was sipping
an orange julius,

275
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,866
And I looked up
and there he was.

276
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,467
Phil collins.

277
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,433
You hang on to
your list, Benjamin.

278
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,667
Your Phil Collins
is out there, ok?

279
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,567
Oh, that's so funny.

280
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,300
What?

281
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,933
I have almost
none of these things.

282
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,433
Hmm.

283
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:44,600
For you, milady.

284
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,633
Oh!

285
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,667
Ow! What are you doing?!

286
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,433
I saw you!
What, what?!

287
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,633
I saw you, sam!

288
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,899
You killed that man!

289
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:53,467
Ow, ow. You saw that?

290
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,734
Yeah! How could you
do something like that?

291
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,767
Huh? How?

292
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,200
I promise you--
I promise you,

293
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,834
There's an explanation.

294
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,567
Fine. Please,

295
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,966
Explain to me
how you chopped

296
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,567
Some guy's head off!

297
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,467
Right. Right, exactly.

298
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,166
Ok? Think about that.

299
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,966
Think about
how crazy that is.

300
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,734
Me? Sam Oliver,

301
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,533
Chopping a dude's
head off? I mean...

302
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,166
Who does that?

303
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,500
Ok? I mean, come on.

304
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,467
There has to be
an explanation
for that, and there is.

305
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,166
Then what is it?

306
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,734
Um...

307
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,333
that's the--
That's the thing,

308
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,700
Is...I can't tell you.

309
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,367
Ok.

310
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:36,533
I have no other choice.

311
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
I have to call the police.

312
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,066
Wait, wait, wait,
Andi, no, you don't!
All right?

313
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,633
What you saw me
doing today,

314
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,233
That was--That--

315
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,767
That was my other job,
all right?

316
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,999
Listen, and I need
a little time
to talk to my boss,

317
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,400
And once I do that,
I can tell you the truth.

318
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,333
Sam! None of this
makes sense!

319
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,300
Yeah, but it will!
I promise, ok?

320
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,600
Just...Andi,
I'm begging you, please.

321
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,066
I need a day.
Just give one day.

322
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,467
I mean, do you really think
I would do something like this?

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,899
You have 24 hours.

324
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,667
What's this?

325
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,999
It's the vessel,
all ready to go.

326
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,133
Just shoot it on down.

327
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,433
What's this?
Nothing.

328
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,800
Just a message
for the devil.

329
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,933
Kind of personal.

330
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,600
All right, fine, I--
I'm kind of in a bind here,

331
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,600
And I really need
to talk to him
about something,

332
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,300
And I didn't know
what else to do,
so I wrote him a note.

333
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,533
Can you please--
Can you please
just send it?

334
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,533
Whatever.

335
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,367
Thank you.

336
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,333
Next.

337
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,133
Are you familiar
with this actress?

338
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,966
The woman does everything.
Amazing range.

339
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,467
It worked.
You got the note.

340
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,266
And you've got a problem.
The soul is still out there.

341
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,467
What do you mean?
I caught him.
I dropped him off.

342
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,933
Not all of him.

343
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,500
You missed a piece.

344
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:14,100
Hey. This isn't
a hook-Up spot.

345
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,066
You want to get
your jollies off,
do it in the alley.

346
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,500
What did you--
Did you kill him?
Is he dead?!

347
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,333
I don't know, Sam,
I'm not a doctor.

348
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,467
He's still
breathing.

349
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,866
Oh, thank heavens.
Now, look,

350
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,100
Can we just talk about
the fact that the soul
is still on the loose?

351
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,767
I told you
I got him.

352
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,066
Really?

353
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:41,033
This footage was taken
less than an hour ago.

354
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,367
Hey, that's him.

355
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,567
How is that
even possible?

356
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,667
Jack's all about multiplying.

357
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,066
He's like a starfish.

358
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,100
Cut off a limb,
grow a whole new Jack.

359
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,400
You must have
missed a piece.

360
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,999
Ok, fine, fine.

361
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,600
I promise,
I'll catch him.

362
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,600
But I need
to talk to you.

363
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,899
Something happened.

364
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,300
I need to tell Andi
the truth about you.

365
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,933
What do you mean,
something happened?

366
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,899
Well, she sort of...

367
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:13,467
saw me chop
Jack's head off.

368
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,500
And why did she
sort of see that?

369
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,567
Because she followed me.

370
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:19,734
Because you're getting
sloppy, Sammy. Jeez!

371
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,367
She said she's going
to the cops!

372
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,933
I don't see
another option.

373
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:25,333
I have to tell her.
I mean, I promise,

374
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,633
I can make her
keep the secret,

375
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,533
But I don't--I don't
see another way.

376
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,633
Well...

377
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,866
maybe we can
work out something.

378
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,667
Anything.

379
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:41,533
Well, one day,
I will come to you...

380
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,266
and I will need a favor.
Done.

381
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,266
Before you say yes,
think on this--

382
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,300
Could be a big favor.

383
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,834
In fact,
it probably will be.

384
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,166
Well, hell, let's be honest,
it'll be terrible.

385
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,767
Doesn't matter, I'm in.

386
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,899
All right.

387
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,600
All right.

388
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,400
Well, then you keep Andi
from talking,

389
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,133
And you can tell her...
about us.

390
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,866
But you'll owe me.

391
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,033
Do we have a deal?

392
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,767
Yeah.

393
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,200
We have a deal.

394
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,227
You promised the devil
a favor.

395
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,327
Is that--Is that what
you're telling me?

396
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,726
That's great, Sam.

397
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,160
Another deal
with the devil.

398
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:32,394
That's, um,
always a good plan.

399
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,593
What choice did I have?

400
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:35,559
It's the only way he would
let me tell her the truth.

401
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:39,127
I have to tell her. Today.

402
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,900
You want us there
when you do it?

403
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,983
Yeah, i could use
a back-Up.

404
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,767
You got it,
homeboy.

405
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:45,200
Hey, Ben,

406
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,800
Could I use
your conditioner?
Hi, guys.

407
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:48,867
Oh, hi.

408
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,999
Yeah, um, it's the one
in the green bottle

409
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,633
With the kelp extract.

410
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,834
Nice. Thank you.

411
00:17:58,567 --> 00:17:59,934
What?

412
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,767
It just helps
to tame the frizzyness

413
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,600
And to really maintain
manageability--

414
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,233
Not the shampoo,
dumb dumb, the girl!

415
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,767
When'd you hook up
with Sara?

416
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,099
What, no? No, i--No.

417
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,567
I just...got married.

418
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,066
What the hell
are you talking about?

419
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,934
She needed a green card,

420
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,867
And I felt sorry
for her, ok?

421
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,633
And, look, it just happened
all really quickly.

422
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,300
Ok, so she's living here now?

423
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,333
Just for a little while,
you know,

424
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Just to make it look real.

425
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,200
You are too stupid
to exist.

426
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,600
Why? I like Sara.

427
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:37,366
I think she's great.

428
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,300
I think she'd make
an excellent citizen,

429
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,467
And she paid me 1,600 bucks.

430
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:43,667
You know, I take it
all back, buddy.

431
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,867
That is awesome.
That is outstanding.

432
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:48,600
She is beautiful!
Beautiful!

433
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,366
We got married!

434
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:53,066
Andi, before I tell you
what I have to tell you...

435
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,033
you should take this.

436
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,400
I'll take it.

437
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,934
Ahem. Andi,

438
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,834
What I'm about
to tell you

439
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,266
Is going
to change everything

440
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,867
You think
you knew about...

441
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,900
the world,

442
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:15,200
The universe,
life, death, everything.

443
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,533
It'll explain
all those times
I've been weird

444
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,433
Or showed up late
to something.

445
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,800
It's that part
of my life I told you
I couldn't talk about.

446
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,934
Sam works for the devil.

447
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:27,033
What? What? It's not
that big of a deal.

448
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,366
My other job

449
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,767
That I was
telling you about...

450
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,467
I'm a bounty hunter
for hell.

451
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,834
Andi, hold on!
Where are you going?

452
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,533
Is this your idea
of some sick joke?

453
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,867
Before I was born,
my parents got into
some trouble.

454
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,333
And to get
out of it, they...

455
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,700
they sold my soul
to the devil.

456
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:49,834
Oh, shut up.

457
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,999
Hey, I'm not
joking, ok?!

458
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,266
Wait a minute!

459
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,333
When a soul
escapes from hell,
I have to capture it.

460
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,733
What you saw us
doing the other day,

461
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,999
That was
an escaped soul.

462
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,366
You only have
a few hours left.

463
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,700
If you don't come up
with a real explanation,

464
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm going to the police.

465
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,233
Wait, Andi!

466
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,733
Andi!

467
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,567
How'd it go?

468
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:13,834
Where the hell
were you guys?

469
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,433
I was dying over there.
She didn't believe
any of it.

470
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,966
Sorry, I had
to wait for the chili
cheese fries.

471
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,633
My wife called.

472
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Oh, where
are you going?

473
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,533
To get the stupid soul.

474
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:27,733
You do know
that the creator

475
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,633
Didn't make you
in his image, right?

476
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,533
The Bible was just
being nice.

477
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,633
Where's Jack?

478
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,533
The soul's not gonna
come back here, Sam.

479
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,333
He knows
you're onto him.

480
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,900
Any other bright ideas?

481
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,166
Yeah. I found his date book.

482
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,200
Shows due dates
for all his
upcoming babies.

483
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:45,800
But you're too
distracted by this
business with the girl.

484
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,567
She didn't
believe you,
did she?

485
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,667
No.
They never do.

486
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,800
So what's
your solution?

487
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:53,934
I'll think of something.

488
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,333
I'm a little concerned

489
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,867
This thing with Andi's
going to continue
to be a problem.

490
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,033
I want it handled.

491
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,934
I said I'll take care of it!
Yeah, I know,

492
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,700
You've said that
to me before.
Too many times.

493
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,467
I just may have
to handle this
problem...myself.

494
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,166
Aaah!

495
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,366
Seattle pd.

496
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:26,700
Hello?

497
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,200
Andy it's me again

498
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,168
Please give me a call
back when you get this.

499
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,501
You can't go to police,
all right? You're in danger.

500
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,968
Not from me...directly.

501
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,667
Just give me
a call back, ok?

502
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,135
Guys, I can't
find Andi anywhere!

503
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,168
Ok, relax,
all right?

504
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:46,768
Take a deep breath.

505
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,001
Relax?! What if she
goes to the police?

506
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,201
Uh, Sam, I wouldn't
worry about that.

507
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,434
Are you kidding me?

508
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,801
You know know what happens
if she goes to the police?

509
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,968
The devil is going
to fix the problem, ok?

510
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,434
And we all know
what that means.

511
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,667
He has a very different
definition of "fix"
than we do.

512
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,768
All right, Sam, listen
to your uncle sock, ok?

513
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,601
Everything is going to be
all right.

514
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,101
Andi's life
is in danger!

515
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,734
She'll be fine.

516
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,634
We...kind of
solved that problem.

517
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:09,701
What does that even mean?
Solved it how?

518
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,701
What are you doing?!
Let her go!

519
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,201
Sam, Sam!
Hey, hey, hey!

520
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,634
This is the only way
to stop her.

521
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:19,868
What, tying her up

522
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,367
And throwing her
in the trunk
was the only way?

523
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,968
She is very comfortable
in there, ok?

524
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,400
I threw her fresh blankies,
some pillows,

525
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:25,534
A little bundle of--
Potpourri.

526
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:26,834
Potpourri.

527
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:28,701
Solving the problem?
This isn't solving the problem.

528
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,901
This is adding a felony
on top of the problem!

529
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:32,601
Better this
than what the devil
would do to her.

530
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,768
He's right, Sam.
Ben speaks truth.

531
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,101
This is a solid plan.

532
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:38,567
All right, all right,
so what's the plan?

533
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:39,901
What are we going
to do with her?

534
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,367
Uh...

535
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:45,634
We didn't actually--
We didn't think
through that far.

536
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,101
Hey, hi, how are ya?

537
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,601
Brought you a juice box.

538
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,101
Sam,
what are you doing?!

539
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:55,501
Get me out of here,
all right?

540
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,367
I can't breathe in here!

541
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,201
Ok, here, here.

542
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:00,534
God, what are you doing?!
Get me out of here!

543
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:02,567
Andi, i can't.

544
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:04,634
No, listen, you know what,
you know what,

545
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,934
I believe you.
Ok? You work for the devil.

546
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,634
Andi, I know
you're lying, ok?

547
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,734
I'll know
when you believe
what I'm saying.

548
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:16,334
Fine. If you can't
let me out of here,

549
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,701
Then can I please
have that juice box?

550
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,901
The potpourri back here
is burning my throat.

551
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:23,634
Yes, absolutely.

552
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,534
Closer.

553
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,801
Get me out of this trunk
right now!

554
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,367
I'm going to rip
your throat out,
you mother--

555
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,701
Let me guess,
the wife?

556
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:33,168
Yeah, she wants me
to bring home
some half and half.

557
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,901
Oh, my god,
the nerve.

558
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,701
All right, look,
you tell her

559
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,868
1,600 bucks
may buy her
u.S. Citizenship,

560
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:41,634
But it does not buy
your wonder twins,
all right?

561
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:42,801
Yeah.

562
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:44,101
Tell that lazy
fog breather,

563
00:24:44,168 --> 00:24:46,400
Go get your own
half and half.

564
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:47,501
Sam! Sam!

565
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,768
Sam! Sammy,
we're here.

566
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,734
Andi, let him go!

567
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:52,601
Keep breathin', buddy.
We got you. Breath!

568
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,634
When i get
out of here,

569
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,768
I swear i'm going
to kill all of you!

570
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,701
That was horrifying!

571
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:59,868
Really, Sam,
horrifying?
Really?

572
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,034
You stick your head
in there, man!

573
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,267
You'll see your own death!

574
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,667
I don't want
to stick my head
in the trunk!

575
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,968
Wait, wait, wait.

576
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:08,068
Wait, that's--That's it.

577
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:10,601
That's how we make her believe,
we scare it into her.

578
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,235
Right here?

579
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:26,534
So that's tony's little
gourmet hideaway, huh?

580
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,601
Yeah, I asked the landlord
where he was forwarding
tony's magazines to.

581
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:30,868
Oh, good.

582
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:33,400
Always wanted
to build a log cabin.

583
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,734
Hey, what's that?

584
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:52,034
They're demons.

585
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,235
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?
What are you doing?!

586
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,667
No, no, no, no.

587
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,201
It's not safe for you
to be coming here
like this.

588
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,267
Ok, it's ok. We're--
Shut up.

589
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,334
Get in a circle.

590
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,501
Out of range
from you-Know-Who.

591
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:07,400
What's
his problem?

592
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,801
Ok, it's safe.

593
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,135
What is wrong with you?

594
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,834
The devil might have
followed you here!

595
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:17,868
What's he going
to find out here?

596
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,801
All of the recruits,
the soldiers for
the new rebellion.

597
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,534
Look, don't get me wrong,
we are happy to have you,

598
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,034
It's just a little
risky, is all.

599
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,601
Tony, we're not here
for the rebellion.

600
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:27,901
You're not?

601
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,434
What--What are you here for?

602
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,235
We kind of have
another problem.

603
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,701
Ok, all right,
all right, ok, now!

604
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:38,901
Ok!

605
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:40,101
Let me go,
you psychos!

606
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:42,168
Hold on, doggie, whoa!

607
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,968
Take it nice
and easy-Like, all right?

608
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:45,934
Oh, she's got nipple!

609
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:47,968
Ok, ok, calm down,
calm down!

610
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,567
It'll be clear to you
in a few seconds.

611
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:50,934
You're going
to see proof, ok?

612
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,734
Andi, you remember Tony?
Please tell them to let me go!

613
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,168
I do not want to be here.

614
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:55,300
They will, Andi.

615
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,367
We just need to show you
something first,

616
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,534
And then you'll be free
to do whatever you choose.

617
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,235
What? Show me what.

618
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,367
Andi...
Tony is a demon.

619
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:06,801
He's a demon
from hell.

620
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:09,135
Show her.
Show her.

621
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:12,001
Ok. 

622
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:14,034
Oh, word of warning,

623
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,567
Please do not
pee on my carpet,

624
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,601
I just put it down.
Ok.

625
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,734
Where's a good spot?

626
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:24,135
Ok.

627
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,801
Phhbbt. 

628
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:33,201
Oh-Ho!
Sweet home Alabama!

629
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,367
Tony!

630
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:37,667
See? It's true.

631
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,768
Why?

632
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:43,901
Ah, that always happens.

633
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:45,667
And it always hurts.

634
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:47,768
I gotta go get her.
Oh, don't worry.

635
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,801
There's nothing
around for miles.

636
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:50,968
She has nowhere
to run to.

637
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:55,135
Uh, did you leave
the keys in the car?

638
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,834
It's possible.

639
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,350
Thanks for the lift.

640
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,944
Oh, well, believe me,
it's always a pleasure

641
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,526
Hanging out
with you boys.

642
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:17,793
Hey, don't be strangers.

643
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,793
We won't. Tone-Ster.

644
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,926
Can you do that thing
one more time? Please?

645
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,392
For me? Come on!
Please, once?

646
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,726
Oh! Ha ha!

647
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:31,227
Oh, now I see why Steve
loved you so much.

648
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,993
That's inappropriate.
That's a compliment, tony.

649
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,760
I know, but it's
still offensive.

650
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,127
Hey, thanks again, tony.

651
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:37,760
No problem.

652
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:39,793
Sam?

653
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,593
I hope everything
goes well with andi.

654
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:42,860
Be patient.

655
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:45,127
I'm sick
of being patient.

656
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:47,993
It's like every time
I get close to her,
something happens.

657
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,026
I don't know.

658
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:51,227
Maybe it's not
supposed to happen.

659
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,793
Do you love her?

660
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,292
Yeah.

661
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,626
Do you know
how rare love is?

662
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:05,726
You can't just turn away
just because you hit
a few speed bumps.

663
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:07,392
Steve and I,

664
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,259
We, heh,
we had our issues,

665
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:10,893
But we worked
through them

666
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,559
Because we knew
at the end...

667
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,259
only love matters.

668
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:18,493
Love is worth...

669
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,160
any sacrifice.

670
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:25,493
Oh, look at me.

671
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,526
Diarrhea of the mouth.

672
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:29,060
All right,
I better get back,

673
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:31,359
Because, um,
I get a little nervous

674
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,626
When I spend
too much time
out of the circle.

675
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:34,893
Be safe.
You, too, Sam.

676
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,459
And hey, wi@need you.

677
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,359
Viva le resistance.

678
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,726
No sign of Andi,
no one's seen her.

679
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,227
She never clocked in
for her shift, either.

680
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,926
Yeah, and she never
went home last night.
She could be anywhere.

681
00:29:57,993 --> 00:29:59,193
I doubt she went
to the police.

682
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:00,993
I mean, what's she
gonna tell them?

683
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,359
"Oh, I saw
a big, gay demon."

684
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,793
Ok, she's probably
hiding,

685
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,659
Praying heavily
right now.

686
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,060
Jack's calendar.
I forgot about this.

687
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:13,227
If we're gonna keep
the devil off our backs,

688
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,926
There's one place
we need to be.

689
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,359
Is--Is she dilated?
How's her breathing?

690
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:20,559
Who are you?

691
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:22,292
The one she'll be
thanking later!

692
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,726
Oh!

693
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:28,926
Which one's yours?

694
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,392
That one right there.

695
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:37,693
And...that one.

696
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:41,326
And maybe that one.

697
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:54,160
Jack's got a busy week.

698
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,793
Real bumper crop
of babies.

699
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,726
All right,
we need to split up.

700
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,659
I'll take
the emergency exit.

701
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:01,593
Sock, you take the front,
ben, go around to the side.

702
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,292
Got it.

703
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,960
Where have you been?

704
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:08,259
Wha--

705
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:11,526
You promised me you'd take care
of this Andi situation.

706
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,760
I tried to, but she
ran away from me.

707
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,127
I can't find her.

708
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:16,593
Oh, I fixed that problem.

709
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,726
She's in the trunk.

710
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:25,793
This is your last chance
to get it right.

711
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,993
Andi! Are you ok?

712
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,259
I don't know!
Come here.

713
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,292
I don't know
how the hell
I got in here!

714
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,559
Are you all right?
You're safe! You're safe.

715
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:41,993
Look, I'm sorry
you're freaked out.

716
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
I didn't know
how else to--

717
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,960
You know, Sam, no, it's ok.

718
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:47,726
I understand.
Ok, after what I saw,

719
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:50,559
And what Tony is...

720
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:52,326
I believe you.

721
00:31:53,726 --> 00:31:55,893
Andi, listen to me.

722
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,993
You have
to promise me

723
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,726
You will not tell
anyone about this.

724
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:03,459
Ever.

725
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:05,326
I promise.

726
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:08,292
You do? That's great,
that's great!

727
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,292
Listen, I--I have
to go do something,

728
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,392
But when I get back,
why don't you come over,

729
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:13,459
And we can talk about this--
No.

730
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:15,659
No, no, I can't.
Why?

731
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,826
I can't handle it.

732
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,626
It's too much.

733
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,860
Andi, I love you.

734
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,392
I know this is
a weird time to say it,

735
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:39,160
But...

736
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:42,392
I love you.

737
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,626
I'm...

738
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,026
afraid of you.

739
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,793
Excuse me.

740
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,493
Where is the place
that women have babies?

741
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,292
Aren't you a little old
to just be figuring that out?

742
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,726
No, I--

743
00:33:08,793 --> 00:33:11,093
I know where women
have babies,

744
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,593
I was, um, referring to

745
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,426
Where the room is, yeah.

746
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,392
It's down the hall.
Just make a left.

747
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,860
Ok. All right. Cool.

748
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,026
Hey, is that
a Sue Grafton novel?

749
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:28,726
Y is for yes.

750
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:38,459
How do you...feel about
mixed martial arts?

751
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,993
Hey.
Hey.

752
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,193
Have you seen
the baby ward?

753
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:43,726
Huh? Oh, no,
I thought I was

754
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,093
Following around
a pregnant woman
for a while,

755
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,026
But turns out it was
just a bloated dude

756
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,626
With a bad case
of the farts,
you know?

757
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,160
It's him.

758
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:52,259
Run.

759
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,227
Jack, don't--
don't run.

760
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,060
Stay back!

761
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,326
Jack, it's over, man.

762
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:09,292
You're not getting past us!

763
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:17,426
[All screaming]

764
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:21,793
Ugh.

765
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,026
Good-Bye, old friend.

766
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:37,292
I got it.

767
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,719
Oh!

768
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,400
Come on, you little
sneawhere are you?Tch.

769
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,066
Oh...

770
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,966
I'm sorry,
don't mind me.

771
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,966
I'm just having a...
a bit of a rat problem.

772
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:11,500
You have delicate wrists.
How do you handle jujitsu?

773
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,133
Benji, need some help!

774
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,267
Runaway hand,
come on!

775
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:19,133
I will be back,
and me and you, ok?

776
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,066
You can't hold me off
forever, Jack!

777
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:25,167
I think
you're right.

778
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:43,133
Sam?
Andi, get out of here!

779
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:01,000
Wait here,
I'll be right back.

780
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,133
It's in here.

781
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,700
Yeah, yeah, it's in here.

782
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:10,066
Ok, let's go ahead
and bag him, yeah?

783
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,600
Ha ha!

784
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,901
Where are you?

785
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,000
Get out of here!

786
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,600
Naked guy!

787
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:23,400
Naked guy!
Naked guy!

788
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:26,400
Naked! Naked guy
on my back!

789
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,267
Somebody help! Doctors!

790
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,333
Oh-Ho, Benji!

791
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,534
Oh, Ben,
that was horrible.

792
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,867
Oh, god.
It looked horrible.

793
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,700
I can still feel it.
Is there a mark?

794
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,033
Andi!

795
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,834
Think she'll show up?

796
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:16,901
Andi?

797
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,300
Sure, she'll
definitely be here.

798
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,100
You know she said
she was afraid of me?

799
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,834
Oh, come on,
you're loveable.

800
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:24,634
Oh, who could be
afraid of this guy
right here?

801
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,634
Look at him!
Look at that
little cheek!

802
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,567
Hey, hey.

803
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:31,600
What? Oh.

804
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,700
The old ball and chain.

805
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:39,233
I got some
wedding rings!

806
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,634
From ebay.

807
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,000
Cool, well...

808
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,066
well, speaking of cool,

809
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,867
Um, I wanted
to thank you

810
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,200
For the pep talk
the other day.

811
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:53,267
'Cause I--I didn't
give up on my list.

812
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,567
And I found
my Phil Collins.

813
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:58,233
And her name is Cassidy.

814
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,000
Yay.

815
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:03,734
I am very happy
for you, but no.

816
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:05,500
What?

817
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,933
Oh, you know,
you're married.

818
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,133
Um, not really.

819
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,901
Um, yes, really.

820
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:13,434
Look, think.

821
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,801
What if immigration
come crawling around?

822
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,966
They are cracking down
on these green card
marriages!

823
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,700
Listen up,
problem solved.

824
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:21,200
You tell them that you have
an open green card marriage.

825
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,700
Thank you, Sock.

826
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,867
Listen.

827
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:25,467
You made a deal,

828
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:27,100
And I expect you
to live up to it.

829
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,200
I'm sorry, but...

830
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,200
I'm gonna go on a date
with Cassidy.

831
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,801
I'm not
letting you go.

832
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:36,567
Fine, then I'll just
report you to immigration.

833
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:38,634
Fine, then I'll report
you extorted money
from me,

834
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,801
And we'll both
go to jail.

835
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:49,300
You know, screw it,
i'll just give
her back her money.

836
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,400
Well, well,
now, Benjamin,

837
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:53,734
Let's not make any rash
decisions here, ok?

838
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,033
'Cause at the end
of the day,

839
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,233
There may not be
all that much "money"
to give back.

840
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,734
We'll talk
about it later

841
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:04,801
While we enjoy
our floor seats

842
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,801
At the blue collar
comedy tour.

843
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:09,000
Lowest common
denominator.

844
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,300
Yeah! Oh.

845
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:14,667
Andi! Hey.

846
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,133
Um...

847
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,634
so...

848
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,066
So...

849
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,600
Weird day?

850
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,400
Sort of.

851
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:30,233
Although,
you've been a weirdo
for months, Sam.

852
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,801
It's just now
at least
I understand why.

853
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:37,033
You were trying
to protect me.

854
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,434
It's true.

855
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,834
It's completely true.

856
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,933
Although,
I've gotta say,

857
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,734
I'm stunned
you've managed to
survive this long.

858
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,400
I mean, I should
have never been
afraid of you.

859
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,966
I should have been
afraid for you.

860
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:53,567
Yeah, it's a miracle
any of us are still alive.

861
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:55,400
Yeah.

862
00:39:57,066 --> 00:40:01,233
Outside the hospital
when you told me
that you loved me...

863
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,567
did you say that
because you meant it,

864
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,367
Or because
you didn't want me
to go to the cops?

865
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:08,734
Both.

866
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,133
Uh-Oh.

867
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,834
Look at this. Look at
how sweet you two are.

868
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,200
I knew that locking her
in the trunk of my car

869
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:19,300
Would work out
for the best.

870
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,367
You loved it,
didn't you? Come on.

871
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:23,233
Don't sweat it,

872
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,000
It's just part
of the job.

873
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,367
Really?
Mm-Hmm.

874
00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:28,033
So does this job
pay anything?

875
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,700
Yes. Sam has
to get us a beer
whenever we demand it,

876
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:31,834
So, you know.

877
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,434
Beer. All we can handle.

878
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,901
Beer.
More beer!

879
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,167
Beer, beer, beer, beer.

880
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,167
Throw your hands up, beer,
throw your hands up!

881
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,400
Darling...

882
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,634
Yeah, what
a lovely place.

883
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,801
So rustic,
so remote.

884
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,200
What are we doing here?

885
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:51,801
Sam, sam, sam,
I think you know
the answer to that.

886
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,066
Remember how quick
you were to give up
that favor?

887
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,434
So impetuous.

888
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,801
You really
ought to think
before you act.

889
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:02,367
There's something
going on in there.

890
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:05,767
Beyond the circle
I can see or hear.

891
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:08,567
I need an inside man.

892
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,801
I want details.
Names, dates, you know,
that sort of thing.

893
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,133
You want me to spy on Tony?

894
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,600
You want me
to betray my friend?

895
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,567
Oh, please, don't be
so melodramatic.

896
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:20,834
But, yes,
if you want to use
those words, yes.

897
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,066
Ugh.
Hey, come on.

898
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,000
That's the deal
you made, man.

899
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,966
You tell Andi
your secret,

900
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:28,267
You owe me a favor.

901
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,901
Or we could discuss
the consequences

902
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:33,100
For you and Andi
if you refuse.

903
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,500
Well, Sam?

904
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,434
It's your answer?

905
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,400
Sam?

906
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,534
Hey!

907
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,233
Thought I saw you
out here.

908
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,734
Why don't you
come on in?

909
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:46,500
I don't--
I don't know--

910
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:48,400
I think you could be
a real help. Come on inside.

911
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,600
There's, uh...

912
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:54,200
there's some people
I really want you to meet.

913
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,667
Come on.

914
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,267
Cold out here.

915
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,100
Yeah, it's freezing.

916
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:07,752
