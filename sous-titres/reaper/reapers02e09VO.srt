00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,390
Alan townsend's flight landed
in rome 2 hours ago.

2
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:06,643
Taking into account time
stuck in immigration

3
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,851
and adding an hour for the cab ride

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,525
he should be safely within
the walls of vatican city... right...

5
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,310
about...

6
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:16,900
now.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,602
- He'll call, Sam.
- I wouldn't sweat it, man.

8
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,554
I have to get ready for work.
Watch my phone.

9
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:28,588
He's so bossy.

10
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,781
I love it.
I knew you'd rock a Turtleneck.

11
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,108
- What are you doing?
- Upscaling your look.

12
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:48,600
- No. I'm fine with my look.
- Sammy, I know you want to resist it.

13
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:52,040
But I really expect you to rise to the
heights of political power here earth.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,774
Seize control of the planet
and hasten the apocalypse.

15
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,816
What you wear reflects
directly on me as a parent.

16
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:01,374
And as a stylist.
Try these slacks.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,855
I'll go dig up a pair of Beatle boots.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,000
I have more good news.

19
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,983
I'm granting you a little
break from catching souls.

20
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,625
- You are?
- Yes, I'm sending you to a tutor.

21
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:18,990
Someone who'll give you a higher
education in the ways of the wicked.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,251
She's expecting you today.

23
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,438
- What's with the circles?
- You like it?

24
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,699
It represents the 9 circles of hell.

25
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:31,168
I contracted an advertising firm
to help me spin a few branding ideas.

26
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:32,790
I think it's nifty.

27
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,018
I have another surprise for you.
A gift.

28
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,763
Something to put a little
testosterone in your tank.

29
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:44,344
- You got me a motorcycle?
- Go on, hop on!

30
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:47,300
I want to see those thighs
vibrating with pure aggression!

31
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,165
All right, what's the catch?

32
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,195
Catch? There's no catch.

33
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:58,127
My generosity, in this instance,
is more a softening the blow.

34
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:01,442
I got him.

35
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:04,268
- Got who?
- Alan townsend!

36
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,917
He never made it to Vatican city!

37
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,581
I had his plane grounded in Vegas,

38
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:10,694
and he went into
a sin spiral so decadent

39
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,769
that he was back in hell before
carrot top took the stage!

40
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,572
I stabbed you in back fair and square
man. It's impolite to leave me hanging.

41
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:20,783
I hate you!

42
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,677
Hey, don't walk away mad, son!

43
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:26,725
I'm not done showering
you with spectacular gifts!

44
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:32,140
Perhaps now is not the time.

Hey. What are you doing here?

49
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,003
Sock and Ben asked me to come
over and watch over your phone.

50
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,501
- Where'd they go?
- They said they had to go exercise.

51
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:06,224
You know what? The call's not coming.
The devil got Alan.

52
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,478
No. God, Sam, i'm so sorry.

53
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:11,546
Don't feel sorry for me.
Feel sorry for the devil.

54
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,905
Because I have had it up to
here with that son-of-a-bitch.

55
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,932
- He is in my sights!
- What does that mean?

56
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:19,322
And why are you dressed
like a 70s porn star?

57
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,941
It means I'm done playing nice.

58
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:24,909
- I'm taking him on!
- How are you going to take him on?

59
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:27,140
I mean, he's the devil.
He's packing a lot of evil.

60
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,980
Yeah, well he's also wearing blinders.
He's convinced that I'm a pushover.

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,398
That I'm afraid to fight
fire with fire. Well, I not.

62
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,892
And I will.

63
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,440
This is only motivation.

64
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,771
What are you doing up there?

65
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:09,999
Listen. I broke up with you, OK?
We're over.

66
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,657
Now I had hoped that you would
respect my decision about.

67
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:17,265
Damn it, Nina!

68
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,514
That is a 62-piece Handy dad socket set.

69
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,216
It's coming out of my paycheck!

70
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,568
OK. Nina, acting out like
this isn't healthy! All right?

71
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,369
I mean, have you ever considered
dicting your rage

72
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,243
into an anger journal or graffiti art?

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,224
OK. Look. Let's not lose sight
of what we shared.

74
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,524
You know, the tenderness.
The pillow talk.

75
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,537
Our lazy afternoons watching Ellen.

76
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,565
Dancing along.

77
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:31,450
Yeah, hi. I'm Sam Oliver.
I have an appointment.

78
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:34,139
I'm not taking appointments today.

79
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:37,131
I was told to come here for tutoring.
The devil sent me.

80
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,540
That bastard. He knows I'm on a cleanse.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,588
Let yourself in.
I'll meet you in the study.

82
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,339
It's the room with the chalkboard.

83
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,299
Let's get the formalities
out of the way, shall we.

84
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:08,037
My name is Sally,
but I'd like you to call me teacher.

85
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,826
- My name is Sam.
- I don't remember asking.

86
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:14,290
Now, am I to assume you are
the devil's offspring?

87
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,654
So I'm told.

88
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:19,148
And am I to assume you are in training
to bring about the end of days?

89
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:23,647
Right. I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Morning show talking points

90
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,947
let me get a better understanding
of what you already know

91
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,140
regarding hell and damnation
and where I need to fill in the gaps.

92
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,343
- Right.
- Do you read Latin?

93
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,512
Have you ever read the Bible.
Either Testament?

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,357
Have you ever heard of the Antichrist?

95
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,732
Yes! Wait.

96
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,215
No. I was thinking the other guy. Sorry.

97
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:47,647
And on a scale of zero to 10,
where would you rank your blood lust?

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,034
I'd have to say a solid 2.

99
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,126
- I can't help you.
- What?

100
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:58,221
Why must the devil insist
on wasting my time?

101
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,140
It's very apparent
that you need preschooling.

102
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
You know what?
I don't want to be here anyway.

103
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,175
- You don't?
- No! I don't any of this.

104
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,606
I don't want to learn about
the devil's business!

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,348
Wait! You know what?
There is one thing you can help me with.

106
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,604
How do I destroy him?

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,394
You want to destroy the devil?
Your father?

108
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:19,624
Yeah. You're an expert on hell
and the devil. How do I kill him?

109
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,404
How do I blow him up? Chop him up?
Acid dip him? Whatever. I'll do it!

110
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,328
You're a liar.

111
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,636
- What?
- You said your blood lust was at a 2.

112
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:35,489
I'd say you're running at at least a 7.

113
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,620
So you're here all by yourself?

114
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:45,990
Yes. My mansion.

115
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,335
12,000 square feet of gilded cage.

116
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,136
But the devil pays the rent.
So who am I to complain? Right?

117
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,328
Must get a little lonely.

118
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:58,500
Yes, it does.

119
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,301
Undoubtedly that was
the devil's intention.

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,127
Can I ask you a favor?

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,026
- Maybe.
- Can I come back tomorrow?

122
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,289
The devil's expecting me to show up.
If I could come and hang out,

123
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:17,875
be out of my hair for a couple hours.
And you'd be doing me a huge favor.

124
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:21,779
Why not?

125
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,435
I certainly could use the company.

126
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,800
Great!

127
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,112
- 'Til tomorrow.
- 'Til tomorrow.

128
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,064
I tell you it was horrible.

129
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,796
Nina's eyes actually roll in the back in
her head when she attacks-like a shark.

130
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,296
I'm thinking about buying a gun.

131
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,723
- What?!
- For protection.

132
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,463
Ben-look, Ben's having crazy ex
problems right now.

133
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:51,920
I've seen my share of nutty bitches.

134
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,200
Ben buying a gun
is a mistake, all right?

135
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,503
Why?

136
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:59,223
'cause Nina's picking a fight, right?
And she wants you to fight back.

137
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:01,303
- Don't play the game.
- You think she playing game?

138
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:04,387
Of course she's playing a game.
They all play games, man.

139
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,630
Look, your rationship went cold,
all right?

140
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,214
She's trying to relight the fire.
Only second time around

141
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:13,063
that fire isn't fueled by love or lust.
It's fueled by anger and petty revenge,

142
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:15,700
which rarely leads
to satisfying hate-sex, all right?

143
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,313
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

144
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:21,240
Listen. Next time Nina comes
stalking around, you ignore her.

145
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,311
Tune her out.
She'll lose interest. I promise.

146
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,265
$400.

147
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,412
I need afternoons off for the next week.
Devil business.

148
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:43,158
I'll see what I can do.

149
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,041
Thanks.

150
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,601
- What?
- There's something I need to tell you.

151
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:51,157
Something potentially upsetting.

152
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:54,176
I met a girl.

153
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,733
Yeah. She works for the devil.

154
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,451
Kind of a professor,
an expert on hell. Very knowledgeable.

155
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,838
Plus I think she's into me.

156
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,049
I just wanted to be up front.

157
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:09,487
Just wanted to make sure you
were cool with what I have to do.

158
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:12,735
I'm planning to seduce this woman.

159
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,799
So that I can
get the devil's secrets out of her.

160
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,731
Secrets that I think will help me
beat the devil once and for all.

161
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:22,164
I get it. Do what you gotta do.

162
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,709
You're not bothered?

163
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,966
Well, you know, it's difficult to feel

164
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,440
threatened when you're not
really a seducer.

165
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,032
Well...

166
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:36,050
I seduced you.

167
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:38,661
You mean, you followed me around
for 7 years like a puppy.

168
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,340
And then wore me down
with your subtle charms.

169
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:45,465
That's not really called seduction.
It's called... erosion.

170
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,422
Here.

171
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:52,859
Maybe this will help speed things up.

172
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,700
You understand
i'm in a war with the devil.

173
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,531
I know.

174
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,206
Delivery from bargain bench.

175
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,426
You just entered a world of pain,
my friend.

176
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:17,800
Work bench blue around here only.

177
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:20,413
That apron makes you look
like a swedish hausfrau.

178
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,654
I don't even know what that is.

179
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,723
So nobody ordered this computer
equipment? There's no John Oliver here?

180
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,226
John Oliver?
That's my dad.

181
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,373
This is fantastic.

182
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,484
I can't believe they delivered
everything so quickly.

183
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,319
What are you gonna do
with all this crap?

184
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,301
I'm Kinda going
stir crazy in this garage.

185
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,125
And I can't go out in the world
for obvious reasons.

186
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,867
So, I am going to bring the world to me.

187
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,924
Chat rooms and Blogs, Facebook.

188
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,906
With the help of this computer,
I am going to have a life again, Sam!

189
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,920
A rich, full life!
Right here in your garage!

190
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,119
- Cool, dad. Cool.
- Yeah, go forth and ride, Mr. O.

191
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,452
You ride that internet,
you weird glorious bastard.

192
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,028
Where are the fries?

193
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:14,658
I didn't order fries.
I got us carrot dippers.

194
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,040
- I asked for fries, Ben.
- I know.

195
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,070
And?

196
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,821
I decided you needed
to take a break from fried foods.

197
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,969
- No! Never. Why?
- I tell you this as a friend, Sock.

198
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:28,079
You have oily hair,
and people are noticing.

199
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,146
I what?

200
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,909
This is hair gel, Ben.

201
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,247
- This is expensive persian hair gel.
- And the beard?

202
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:38,986
To tell me that sheen
comes from a bottle?

203
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:41,006
What sheen? What the heck is a sheen?

204
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,340
What did you hit?!

205
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,300
I didn't hit anything. Something hit us!

206
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,325
Holy, crap! Nina!

207
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,662
Benji, maintain. Remember what
I told you what you gotta do?

208
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:51,926
- I need to ignore her, right?
- That's right.

209
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,346
I see nothing.

210
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,286
That's right. She's not right there.
Just look through her. Just ignore her.

211
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,441
That doesn't scare me.

212
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:17,212
What say we listen
to a couple tasty tunes?!

213
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:19,410
- Sounds great! I love music!
- Me, too!

214
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:27,695
My mom made me a mixed tape!

215
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:33,867
Jammin'

216
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,509
- Aight?
- We're Jammin'.

217
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:49,278
- Think it's over?
- It's over, Benji.

218
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:52,056
We bucked the angry
right outta that beast!

219
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:57,585
- Pretty sure I have glass in my eye!
- Nobody likes a crybaby, Benji!

220
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,041
Suck it up.

221
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,325
Black on black.
Sexy.

222
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,925
What do you want?

223
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,600
I just wanted to find out how
your first day of school went?

224
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:22,860
- It was fine.
- I see. And how was Sally looking?

225
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,841
Still as beautiful as ever?

226
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,715
I dunno. I didn't notice.

227
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,462
- Did she ask about me?
- Not really.

228
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,452
Seriously? Nothing at all?

229
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,788
From what I gathered she's not a fan.

230
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:37,140
- Was there any contempt in her voice?
- Sure, yeah. A bit.

231
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,843
- Fantastic!
- You're happy about that?

232
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:43,248
Sure. You know what that means?
I'm under her skin.

233
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:48,094
Now's the perfect time to strike!
I want you to give this to Sally.

234
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,135
A vegetable steamer?

235
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,520
Yeah. I happen to know she wants
that more than anything else. See?

236
00:14:54,781 --> 00:14:56,559
She dog eared the page in the catalogue.

237
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:59,235
- Where'd you get this?
- I dug it up out of her trash.

238
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,597
You are a stalker.

239
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,092
No, no. Sammy.
I'm a fool for love.

240
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,819
Why do you need me? Why don't
you just give her the present yourself?

241
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,311
You mind if I open up to you a little?
Imperfect father to well dressed son?

242
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:16,135
I have difficulty
maintaining relationships with women.

243
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,923
Mostly because I mistreat them.

244
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,486
You know, I lead them on. I bag'em.
Tag'em. Kick'em down the stairs.

245
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:26,625
And I blame it on my deep
commitment to selflove.

246
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,565
It's my achilles. Anyway,

247
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,984
I appreciate your help.
You're my Cyrano.

248
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,999
Now you get out there
and you reel her in for me!

249
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,862
Hey, you may want to run.
I neglected to pay for that.

250
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,065
I'm in here!

251
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,491
You're very prompt.

252
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,778
What's that?

253
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,639
It's a gift. For you.

254
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,112
I got you a gift.
From me.

255
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:16,604
Oh my god!

256
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,608
How did you know I've been
lusting after a steamer?

257
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,850
Well, I remembered
you were on a cleanse.

258
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,776
So I assumed you were
into healthy foods.

259
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:30,325
Naturally the mind jumps
to steamed spinach.

260
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:32,566
How sweet.

261
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,938
Thank you.
I love it.

262
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,086
Right...

263
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,825
I like your skirt.
It really shows off your figure.

264
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,110
And your hair.
It looks especially nice today. Very...

265
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:55,873
very... bouncy.

266
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:58,528
Sam, what are you doing?

267
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,734
- What do you mean?
- Well, the gift. The flattery.

268
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,791
- Are you hitting on me?
- What? No.

269
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,194
But

270
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,783
now that you've planted the thought.
Which is a great, great thought.

271
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:16,642
How about it?
Will you let me take you to dinner?

272
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,739
My, you are surprisingly aggressive.

273
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:23,762
Well, I'm the kind
of guy that likes to move fast...

274
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,416
When I see something I want.

275
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,199
I mean someone I want.
Not something.

276
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,548
Which could be misinterpreted
that I see you as a piece of meat.

277
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,209
Which, as a woman, and an equal

278
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,236
in every way.

279
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:43,136
If not superior in that it's common
knowledge that women are better pilots.

280
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,009
And gymnasts. The point being,
you most likely don't

281
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,777
appreciate being compared...
To meat that is.

282
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,335
It's not uncommon

283
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,710
for a student to get a crush
on their teacher.

284
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,750
What I'm feeling right now
is no school boy crush.

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,497
I'm fascinated by you.

286
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:13,637
And I know you're intelligent.
What I need to know. What I don't know.

287
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,591
Is if you could ever take me seriously.

288
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,341
Of course I can.

289
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,528
Great.
Then it's a date.

290
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,351
But we must keep it a secret
from the devil.

291
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:34,036
Think about it. His favorite teacher
fraternizing with his favorite son?

292
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,749
I mean,
he could come unhinged.

293
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,161
I once witnessed him just cut a man
in half for giving me a foot rub.

294
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:46,502
Yeah, I'm cool going the secret route.

295
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:57,556
I'm on pins and needles, Sammy!
Tell me, did she love the gift? Did she?

296
00:18:58,657 --> 00:18:59,801
Yes, she did.

297
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:02,419
You're not lying to me, now,
just to protect my feelings?

298
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:04,759
No. She really loved it.

299
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:10,221
A breakthrough! Finally!
And I owe it all to you, kiddo.

300
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,059
No. Really, you don't have to thank me.
Seriously. I didn't...

301
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,711
Now, this is my phone number. OK?

302
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,595
You give it to Sally.
Tell her i'm waiting for her call.

303
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,786
No. Don't tell her I'm waiting.
That sounds desperate.

304
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,921
Tell her I am expecting her call.

305
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,626
I don't get it.
Why don't you just call her yourself?

306
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:27,843
I'm the devil.

307
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,339
I don't Chase Tail, Sam.
Tail Chases me.

308
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:41,782
I called you in because I keep getting
complaints of two fighting in gardening.

309
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,931
We weren't fighting. He attacked me!

310
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,397
- Bullpucky!
- It's true!

311
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,894
I was trying to educate Mr. Chand...

312
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,270
Chandrasekrahn.

313
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,940
On the obvious difference
between seasoned mulch

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,734
and redwood bark chips when he
came at me with a edge trimmer!

315
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,421
You had it coming.
This Dick's always up in my grill!

316
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,706
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yes. Yes. Just one second.

317
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:08,507
You know what? You two need to start
a dialogue about mutual respect.

318
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:11,013
I want this resolved before I get back.

319
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,296
What's up?

320
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,124
I was just wanted to see how
your war with the devil was going?

321
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:20,412
It's, it's moving ahead.
I have a date with my teacher tonight.

322
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:22,757
That was fast.

323
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,264
Just took your advice.
Just jumped right in with both feet.

324
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,149
That's...
That's great.

325
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:31,983
Can you.

326
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,514
Listen, I'm really jealous.

327
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:41,155
- What?
- I'm really jealous of this woman.

328
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,750
And I'm jealous that you
might go out with her.

329
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:46,741
And I'm jealous that something might
actually happen between you two.

330
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,548
And I know I can't even say anything
because I'm the one that put us on hold.

331
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,588
Do you want me to cancel this date?

332
00:20:56,868 --> 00:21:00,793
But I know you can't.
And I can't ask you to.

333
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,408
No, you know what? Don't even
say anything. It's OK. I get it.

334
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:08,964
- I do.
- Bastard! I will cut you!

335
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:14,238
OK. I should probably
get back to my meeting.

336
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,540
- You got another im from Sam's dad.
- Again?

337
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,399
Says, why you haven't signed up
for his fantasy hockey league?

338
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,308
You know what? Why don't you tell him

339
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,054
I only have time to service
one fantasy his wife.

340
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:32,862
I'm gonna let you tell him that.

341
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:36,024
Get into the training room.
Move, move, move!

342
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,396
I want to talk to Ben.

343
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,982
Well, you don't get to talk to Ben.
All right. He's fragile.

344
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,330
Want to send him a message.
It goes through me.

345
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:45,267
Get! Get!

346
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:49,723
Well, I just wanted to say that...

347
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,309
I feel terrible about the way
that I've been acting.

348
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,340
You mean like a girl who eats cars?

349
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm not gonna
try to make any excuses here.

350
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,670
But it's not like
I used no self-control.

351
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:03,111
I mean, your head didn't
end up on a pike, right?

352
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:04,529
If that's all...

353
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:07,350
Thank you.

354
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:11,040
Look, I'm just trying to apologize here.
Do you have to be so rude?

355
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:14,199
OMG. Maybe you didn't hear
it the first time.

356
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,326
Or the tenth time.
You and ben are over.

357
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:19,589
Look at me when I'm talking to you. Ben!

358
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:22,299
I want to talk directly to Ben.

359
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,101
That's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

360
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,033
Are you standing in the way
of our relationship?

361
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,838
No, I'm standing in the way
of your craziness.

362
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,663
So he grounded his plane in Vegas?

363
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,414
And Alan's secrets went
back to hell with him.

364
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,408
That is brilliant.

365
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:02,251
You are up against an evil genius.

366
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,244
If you keep filling my glass with more
wine, I might start blabbing

367
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:10,983
some devil secrets of my own.

368
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,677
God knows I'm sitting on some doozies.

369
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm having such a wonderful time, Sam.

370
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,784
It's been such a long time
since I've been out on a date.

371
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:23,777
Really?

372
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,479
What about you, Sam?

373
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:31,100
Is there anyone special
in your life?

374
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:34,393
Nope. Nobody in my life.

375
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:46,091
What?

376
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,354
I lied.

377
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,787
There is somebody.
Her name is Andi.

378
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,933
If you've got a girlfriend
what are you doing here with me then?

379
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:05,289
Because we can't be together.
It's really complicated. I'm sorry.

380
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,153
I'm sorry for misleading you.

381
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,328
Don't be.

382
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,701
I admire your honesty, Sam.

383
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,263
So here we are at a crossroads.

384
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,281
Do we call it a night? Or do we

385
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,471
press ahead and see where things lead?

386
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:28,002
How does that song go?

387
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:31,052
If you can't be with your true love.

388
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:35,799
The lyric is
"if you can't be with thene you love.

389
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,034
Honey, love the one you're with."

390
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,566
I should know. I wrote it.
Or at least i

391
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,940
provided the weed that provided
the tryst that provided the inspiration.

392
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:47,024
- This isn't what it looks like.
- I'm not talking to you.

393
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,852
And you! You're a teacher!

394
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:52,622
He's your student for goodness sake!

395
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:55,299
Does your perverted
libido know no limits?

396
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,617
What? You're insane!
You're actually insane!

397
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,088
And I don't ever want
to be with you, ever!

398
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:08,002
I'll deal with you later.

399
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:23,754
There you are.

400
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:34,523
Ben's not here.
Ben's working a midnight shift.

401
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:38,334
So I'll thank you
to haul your stalky-ass outta here.

402
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,453
I don't want to talk to Ben.
I want to talk to you.

403
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,200
Well, I don't want to talk to you.

404
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:46,935
So, come on.
Slip it out. Slip it quick.

405
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:52,501
Would you drop
this at the curb. Thank you.

406
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:56,847
May be some recyclables in there.
So would you be a doll and separate

407
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,644
the plastics?
Good times! Later.

408
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:13,657
That's a good little trick.
Really spooky. I'm so scared.

409
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:15,378
Too bad it's pointless.

410
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:18,183
You can stand there staring
at me all night, turn into a big

411
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,599
acid drooling monster. I don't care.

412
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:23,612
Because quality sleep,
little lady, comes first.

413
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,425
12 hours a night.
5 hours a day.

414
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:30,116
- I'm not here to scare you.
- Really?

415
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:33,486
I need to see Ben.
Sock, I need see him.

416
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,422
And I need to tell him how sorry I am.

417
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,535
And, frankly you're just,
you're standing in the way of that.

418
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:44,882
I would do, no.

419
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:48,866
Anything to have ben back.

420
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,602
The question is

421
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:06,921
what would you not do to protect him?

422
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,200
OK. Let me just clear this up.

423
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:14,994
You're thinking you can demon-bang
your way through me to get to Ben?

424
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:18,947
Well, I thought about
bringing a friend. But I wasn't

425
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:21,540
really sure if you like girls or guys.

426
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,100
That... What? I like girls. What are
you talking about? Get out of here.

427
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:27,025
OK well, I just thought...

428
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:28,888
You just thought? You just though what?

429
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,624
You're weirdly close with Ben.

430
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:33,343
No! Not weirdly close. All right?

431
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,331
Awesomely committed. How about that?
There's a big difference.

432
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,087
So you can just forget about
trying to seduce this guy.

433
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:43,545
If I feel the urge to trade my dignity
for a little Drowsy Nasty,

434
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:47,420
i'll listen to Jewel.
Or hit the porn drawer.

435
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:53,944
So there's absolutely nothing

436
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,478
I can do to change your mind?

437
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:59,578
No. Not that I can think of. I'm sorry.

438
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:04,773
Well, then you don't leave me no choice.

439
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,436
Is that mine?

440
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,437
Sam, you wanna toss me one of those
copper spray nozzles? Quick. Quick.

441
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,440
- What are you doing?
- I'm building a flame thrower.

442
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,222
You mind if I ask why?

443
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,863
I'm burning down Nina's lair.
Gonna drive her out of town.

444
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:41,140
Also would you toss one of
those 3/8th couplets right there?

445
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:44,059
Doesn't that sound a little severe,
I mean, even by your standards?

446
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,924
She crossed the line, Sam.
She did that demon trick.

447
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,218
All right, she invaded my dream world.

448
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:52,873
This is my safe place.
No one penetrates my safe place!

449
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:57,478
- Hey, Sock, have you seen Andi around?
- I heard she called in sick.

450
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:05,485
Andi, hey, I heard you were out sick.
I hope it's not because of me.

451
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:09,442
Hey, kiddo.

452
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:12,442
Gloomy sky today.

453
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:14,955
Fits my mood.

454
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:19,640
What are we doing here?

455
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,100
Good question. What the hell
are we doing here?

456
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,128
2 love-struck idiots.

457
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:27,712
Caught under the spell
of the same witchy woman.

458
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,827
So, you're not mad at me?

459
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:34,099
How could I be?

460
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:36,441
What man can resist Sally?

461
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,583
Here.

462
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,376
- A vessel?
- Yes. It's for Sally.

463
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:46,941
She's an escaped soul?

464
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:51,930
I let her out of hell, Sam.
I set her up in this house.

465
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:55,178
Got her a good job,
shower her with affection and still...

466
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,703
It's a matter of honor, Sammy.

467
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,867
Honor.

468
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,421
I was convinced
I'd seen the last of you.

469
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:48,345
Yeah. Was thinking we could talk.

470
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,436
Yes, about last night?
I'm so sorry. What a disaster.

471
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:55,001
I should have known better then
to try and sneak around on the devil.

472
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:57,016
I'm not here about last night.

473
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,106
The devil sent me.

474
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:04,500
To vessel you.
To send you back to hell.

475
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,459
I'm sorry it's come to this, Sam.

476
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:14,028
I really like you.

477
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:19,017
- I like you too.
- Yes, I thought we made a

478
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,791
real connection at dinner last night.

479
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:23,799
If the devil hadn't interrupted

480
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,287
we most certainly would have
ended up in bed together.

481
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:32,023
Is that something that
still interests you?

482
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,267
Being with me?

483
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,908
I have a better plan...
To keep you out of hell.

484
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:40,327
- You do?
- I'll tell the devil the truth.

485
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,768
This was all my doing.
That you're innocent.

486
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,418
I was trying to seduce you.
So that I lied and

487
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,281
took credit for his gift.

488
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:51,300
What? The steamer was from the devil?

489
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:59,697
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't quite
understand. Why the gun?

490
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,340
I mean, why don't you just
tell the devil the truth?

491
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,178
- I mean, why all this drama?
- Cause you still have something I want.

492
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,400
Something you can trade
for your freedom.

493
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:11,920
The devil's secrets.
Secrets that I need.

494
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:16,698
Are you blackmailing me?

495
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,438
Think of it as a trade.
Share what I need to know,

496
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,865
and you'll stay out of hell.

497
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:24,325
I'll get out of from under
the devil. It's a win-win.

498
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:28,038
You're expecting me to betray the devil?

499
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:29,855
Well... yeah.

500
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,805
I can't do that.

501
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:34,868
You can't?
I thought you hated the devil?

502
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:37,152
Well, I do. Sometimes.

503
00:32:37,713 --> 00:32:40,051
But other times.
Other times I find him quite...

504
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:43,452
charming. I mean, he is the devil.

505
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:46,168
The second most powerful
being in all of existence.

506
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:49,173
Now I've never experienced the high that

507
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,961
people say they get from knowing the
love of god. So I can't really compare.

508
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:55,859
But I certainly know the rush

509
00:32:56,663 --> 00:33:00,053
that comes with being
pursued by the dark

510
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:01,562
lord.

511
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,134
This doesn't have to happen, Sally!

512
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:24,416
We can still strike a deal!

513
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:52,103
- Well, this is a first.
- So, are ready to talk trade?

514
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,992
- Put the gun down, sammy!
- What are you doing?

515
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:16,936
How about that entrance?
Snazzy?

516
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,931
God, what are you grinning about?
He could have killed me!

517
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Is that the kind of welcome
that I get? Come on.

518
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:26,229
- Who's your hero?
- You are an ass.

519
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,196
I am the dark lord of asses.

520
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,689
I heard your confession, Sally, darling.

521
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,400
After all these centuries
I finally know...

522
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,312
You're into me.
Yes, so let's cut to the chase.

523
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:42,078
I didn't come here to try to earn your
love and respect. I came here to earn

524
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:43,472
a trip upstairs.

525
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:45,972
You make no mistake.

526
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:48,514
If it were not for that very
thoughtful vegetable steamer,

527
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:50,576
you would not be getting lucky today!

528
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,305
Come on.

529
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,874
I don't feel right about this.

530
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,840
Maybe I should call Nina
and talk things out over coffee.

531
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,740
Too late for coffee, Benji.

532
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,743
I might be able to get her in couples
counseling. Work through the issues.

533
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,713
What issues? There are no issues.
You two are over, all right.

534
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,453
You missed a spot right there.

535
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,648
What are you doing, Ben?

536
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,209
We're setting your house on fire.

537
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,580
Why does it always come to this?

538
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:40,160
Why? This happens a lot?

539
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:43,215
Yes, I've lost track of

540
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,282
how many times angry villagers
have chased me with lit torches.

541
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:48,774
It's a flamethrower.

542
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,691
I guess that's just to be expected
when the world sees you as a monster.

543
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,210
- I don't see you as a monster.
- What?

544
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:56,737
You don't?

545
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:02,039
What about all that
tormenting stuff that I did.

546
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:04,875
- And what about what I did to your car?
- I had it coming.

547
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,997
I should have never put
my grandmother's needs over yours.

548
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:11,217
I mean, she just held the keys
to my inheritance.

549
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,723
You were my girl.
I made the wrong choice.

550
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,411
Yes. Yes you did.

551
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:21,223
Truth is, I missed you.

552
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:26,087
I missed you too.

553
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:30,226
What?

554
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:32,165
- Buddy?
- What?!

555
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:34,936
I think Nina
and I are getting back together.

556
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,250
I know how super important
your quality sleep is to you. But

557
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,413
quality sleep is to you. But

558
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,735
do you think you can get past
what Nina did?

559
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:46,724
For me?

560
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:51,030
You can melt an iceberg with
those deep brown zeros buddy.

561
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:54,133
- I know. Bring it in.
- All right.

562
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,493
Get the tank!
Get the tank! The tank!

563
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:05,863
Get the...

564
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:15,474
That could have gone better.

565
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,929
You want me to talk to Sock?

566
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:28,935
Get him to join your fantasy
hockey league?

567
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,137
I'd rather you didn't.

568
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,792
I hate fantasy hockey, Sam.

569
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,923
- What?
- I hate the internet.

570
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:39,804
I hate trolling dating sites
for women I can never meet.

571
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:42,697
I hate posting a daily blog
that only's er gotten 8 hits.

572
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:47,399
- I hate my life.
- I'm sorry, dad.

573
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,448
Don't be, Sam. Because
you know, I've been thinking.

574
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,873
And I think I know the way
you can help me.

575
00:37:54,551 --> 00:37:55,562
Anything.

576
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,499
Send me to hell.

577
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:00,972
- What?
- Send me to hell.

578
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,391
Let me go look for Alan
townsend for you.

579
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:05,311
Let me help you get out of your deal.

580
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:07,773
I can't do that.

581
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,924
Look at me, Sam.

582
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:17,109
I should have died.
But I can't die. And

583
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,725
I can't live either.
Not like this.

584
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,418
There are answers in hell, Sam.

585
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,741
Answers to fix both our problems.

586
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,249
I was your father once.

587
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:37,974
Let me be that again.

588
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:40,462
Please,

589
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:42,806
let me help.

590
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:10,650
What's this?

591
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,835
A cell phone.
I found it in Ted's pocket.

592
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:15,115
I think he would have wanted
you to have it.

593
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:17,035
Thanks, Sock.

594
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:20,287
Atta boy.

595
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:24,011
Be safe, Mr. O.

596
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:26,240
And thanks for keeping
an eye on king Charlie.

597
00:39:26,684 --> 00:39:28,374
He's such a good rabbit, Ben.

598
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:31,677
If it's okay, I'm just going tell
him that you went on a long cruise.

599
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:32,943
Yeah. Of course.

600
00:39:45,473 --> 00:39:48,766
Come on, Sam,
this is exciting stuff. I mean,

601
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:51,818
I feel like an astronaut
blasting into space!

602
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:55,862
I love you, dad.

603
00:39:58,277 --> 00:39:59,561
I love you too, Sam.

604
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:18,107
Give'em hell, Mr. O!

605
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,437
Count on it, Sock! Count on it!

606
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:50,444
I heard about your dad.

607
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:52,175
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,586
Do you want some company?

609
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,405
I called the bargain bench. Turns out
they have a great return policy.

610
00:41:04,689 --> 00:41:05,689
Good.

611
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:10,786
So, aren't you going to ask me?

612
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,499
- About what?
- About Sally.

613
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:17,023
No... i am not.

614
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:21,587
Nothing happened.

615
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,711
Well, you know, it's really
none of my business.

616
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:40,742
It's my phone.

617
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,059
Text message.

618
00:41:44,614 --> 00:41:45,812
It's from my dad.

619
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:47,226
What?

620
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:50,597
"I'm in.
Will keep in touch.

621
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,054
Should've brought water."

622
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:00,037
He made it.

623
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,232
Team Subs-Addicts"
