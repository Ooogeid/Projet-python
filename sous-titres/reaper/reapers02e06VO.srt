1
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:11,141
This is terrible.

2
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,212
In the best possible way.

3
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,062
Kristen told me about it. Apparently
bug fighting is huge in Japan.

4
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,573
Pretty sure it's their national pastime.

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,212
That tarantula is killin' it right now.

6
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:26,721
I'm gonna go get some chicken fingers
from the snack bar. You want?

7
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,757
No! What are you doing?
You're gonna Miss the end.

8
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:31,235
What? No. I'll be back in time
for the main event...

9
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:34,482
Some weird lobster creature
fighting a centipede. Super gross.

10
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,122
Be back.

11
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,570
Very funny.
Sock, stop!

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,317
We move in on Sam Oliver, curious...

13
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,358
Confused...

14
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,258
And now...
Irritated.

15
00:00:58,481 --> 00:00:59,603
Man, this is amazing.

16
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:02,223
Fits right in the palm of your hand,
and the resolution, unbelievable.

17
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:03,914
Yes. I've seen a video camera before.

18
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,339
But have you seen this?

19
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,814
Please! Help me! Please!

20
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:19,698
Is this thing working?

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,156
What was that?

22
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,876
I'm just futzin' around, you know,
tryin' to get the hang of the camera.

23
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,557
No, That thing, what was it?

24
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:31,454
That's your latest soul, mordecai nash,
real nasty piece of work.

25
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:34,685
He used to lure people to
the dove hollow silver mine,

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,857
promising them to strike it rich.
Then he'd kill 'em and take their money.

27
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:39,493
So he's back as that...

28
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,142
Tentacle thing?

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,704
He's got his hands on everything in
dove hollow, just like he did in life.

30
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,156
I want you to get out there, Sammy.
I want you to grab that guy ASAP.

31
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:50,640
Just look at it as a working vacation.

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,332
You know, it's a beautiful little town.
See for yourself.

33
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,912
All right. If I have to go out there,
maybe I could take Andi and the guys,

34
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,148
- make a road trip out of it.
- There you go.

35
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,586
That would be great.

36
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,682
Now, here's a little
cherry for your sundae.

37
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,794
You're gonna love this vessel.

38
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,275
Is that badass or what?

39
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,211
You don't even have to
get close to the thing.

40
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:22,869
You just lob that baby
and watch the party.

41
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:26,222
This could be good.
Little vacation.

42
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,588
I Miss the main event?

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,362
- Oh, my god.
- Help me! Please!

44
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,691
Please tell me we're gonna see
the scorpion fight that thing.

45
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:44,673
Cool grenade.

00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:13,541
- I'm getting up.
- What are we doin' today?

50
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:17,860
Baby, we spent the whole
weekend together, every second.

51
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,367
I know. It was amazing.

52
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,075
I actually,
have some errands to run today, so...

53
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:26,552
I like errands.

54
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:29,164
It's not really something
that I need company for.

55
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,375
- I'm just gonna get my hair cut.
- What else?

56
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,503
Probably gonna get something to eat.

57
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,876
- OK, cool. I like eating.
- Do you like to eat llamas?

58
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,484
'cause I'm gonna eat a live llama.

59
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:40,681
OK, babe. You can run
your errands by yourself today.

60
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,757
Just call me whenever you can.

61
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,019
Also, I took the liberty of changing
your cellphone plan so we can talk

62
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:48,756
to each other whenever
we want for as long as we want.

63
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,473
I gotta go.

64
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,387
Unlimited minutes, sweetie. OK?
Don't let 'em go to waste.

65
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:05,267
What are you doin' here?

66
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,592
Did Sam ask you to go
on this trip with him?

67
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,784
Ben asked me to go, too.
It sounds like a lot of fun, right?

68
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:19,190
I don't really wanna go.

69
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,185
- How should I tell him?
- How come you don't wanna go?

70
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:26,089
I just I need to be
away from Ben right now.

71
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,392
I'm a solitary creature.

72
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:30,610
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's great. Ben is great.

73
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:31,984
He's just...

74
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:36,145
He's always there staring at me,
telling me how beautiful I am.

75
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:39,562
Ben is adorable,
and I really, really like him, but,

76
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,965
he's just a little clingy!
Sometimes.

77
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,126
Kind of makes me wanna rip out
his internal organs and show 'em to him.

78
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,648
You know? I mean, not really,
but you know what I mean.

79
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:52,801
Look, Ben is just a sensitive guy,

80
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,546
which isn't a bad thing.
Just be honest with him.

81
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:56,899
Right. Honest.

82
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:01,376
I guess I'm just used to dating
guys from hell, you know?

83
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,925
I mean, they treat you like crap,
but at least it's exciting.

84
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:06,691
But who am I talking to?

85
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:09,225
You know all about dating bad boys.

86
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,216
Sam isn't exactly a bad boy.

87
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:16,943
But he's the son of the devil,
so heh.

88
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:20,777
I mean, he's gotta be a little bit evil.
Right? It's sort of in his nature.

89
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,570
This place is perfect,

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,523
- creepy perfect.
- Just like the way I French.

91
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,272
This town is dead.

92
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,706
Good. It means we got
our pick of rooms at the hotel.

93
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,920
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Yes. I'm starving.

94
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,385
Let's go check in. Come on.

95
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:07,455
Look at this.

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,915
Anybody home?

97
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,855
- How can I help you?
- We need rooms for 2 nights.

98
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:23,746
One for Sam and Andi, and one for Ben...

99
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,948
And, then there's me and you, so...

100
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:29,448
I only have 3 rooms upstairs,
each with one bed.

101
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,568
One bed.
That's unfortunate.

102
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,414
But, I'm OK with it
if you're OK with it.

103
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,809
Only if you don't steal the covers,
big bro.

104
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,234
Ah ha! No problems, little sis.

105
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,637
I'm gonna snatch those
covers right off of you.

106
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm gonna tickle you all night.

107
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:50,691
It's my sister.

108
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:52,701
The room should be ready by suppertime.

109
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:56,204
- You two ever been up this way?
- Nope, but I love it already.

110
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:59,529
Well, you should take
your sister to the silver mine.

111
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,206
It's quite a sight.

112
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,041
I've never been to a mine before.

113
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:05,917
Let's go.

114
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,352
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

115
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:21,565
This is so weird.

116
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,867
Good afternoon.
Can I get you guys somethin'?

117
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,093
Yeah. Can we get a couple sandwiches?

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,635
- Chicken for me, please.
- I'll have the same. Comin' right up.

119
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,421
Cute town, right?

120
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,152
Just passin' through?

121
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,078
Actually, no.
We're staying for the weekend,

122
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,902
getting out of the city for a while.

123
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:48,038
This is just the place to do it,
the most beautiful town you'll ever see.

124
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,598
You know what you guys
should do while you're here?

125
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:53,715
- What's that?
- Check out the mine just up the hill.

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,206
You want us to go to the mine?

127
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,159
Absolutely.

128
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,426
It's the best part about
visiting dove hollow.

129
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,517
You'll never see anything else like it.

130
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:07,017
I have a map right here if you'd like.

131
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,458
I'm just sittin' here,
thinkin' about you.

132
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,247
I hope you're doin' well.

133
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,919
I wish you were here.

134
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:16,577
I Miss you soo much.
Smooch.

135
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,468
Talkin' to your girl?

136
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,231
Just tryin' to get her to come up here.

137
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,422
If she makes it out here, you should
take her up to the old silver mine.

138
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:29,983
Women love that place.

139
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:32,796
Well, you kids'll have
the time of your lives up there.

140
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:36,024
Hey, guys.

141
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,958
You know what the guy at
the bar just told me to do?

142
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,765
- What?
- Visit the mine.

143
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,827
That's what the lady
in the diner said, too.

144
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:44,537
Hey, where's Kristen?

145
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:46,079
Takin' a tinkle.

146
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,752
Also, the, creepy hotel guy

147
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:51,375
is trying to kill us,
told us to go down to the mine.

148
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:52,902
Same thing happened to us.

149
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:55,947
- The town's in on it.
- They must be feeding it.

150
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,418
OK, we have to go right now. I only hav
a vessel that can capture one soul.

151
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,353
- We can't fight a whole town.
- Good enough for me.

152
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:11,987
- Where's my car?
- I saw it when I walked into the bar.

153
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:15,981
We're trapped.

154
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,330
hi. I'd like to report a stolen car.

155
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:29,280
Hippie car, hybrid?

156
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:33,233
It wasn't stolen.
I had it towed.

157
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:37,709
- Parked in a loading zone.
- So, when can we get it back?

158
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:41,094
Impound lot's closed now.
You could try back tomorrow.

159
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:44,391
No, no. We were really
hopin' to hit the road today.

160
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:47,259
Well, what's your rush
to leave our little town?

161
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,087
It's a beautiful place,
most perfect place in the world.

162
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,368
Come on. Relax.
Stay awhile.

163
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:57,846
We have beautiful sunsets.
You know, my daddy used to say

164
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,789
sunset is like god
kissin' the world good night.

165
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,443
My daddy was a preacher, big

166
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,636
fire-and-brimstone,
end-of-the-world kind of guy.

167
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:10,108
You believe in hell?

168
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,836
Well, I... I don't really know.

169
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,625
I like to focus on the here and now.

170
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,582
OK. You boys enjoy your visit.

171
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:35,002
So I'm leaving a message.
Again.

172
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,783
I we're sorta trapped here,
but I don't want you to get worried.

173
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,095
I really Miss you,
and I can't wait to see you.

174
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,816
OK, c-call me. OK?

175
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,263
How often would you say you call Nina?

176
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:59,577
Depends.
Every couple hours or...

177
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:03,385
Every hour or sometimes
on the half-hour.

178
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:05,436
What?

179
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:08,524
OK, you know, don't take this
the wrong way, 'cause I think it's great

180
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:12,332
that you're so attentive and loving,
but sometimes girls just need...

181
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:14,508
Space.

182
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,744
- Did she say something to you?
- Well, you know,

183
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:20,071
- the word "clingy" might have come up.
- Clingy?

184
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,118
She called me clingy?
Damn.

185
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,499
I gotta call her to make
sure everything's OK.

186
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,352
You know what? Maybe we should
just turn this off for a while.

187
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,914
There are miles and miles of tunnels,
and they're all underneath the city.

188
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,215
It's gonna be impossible
to find this thing.

189
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,305
You know what? Forget it.
This was a dumb idea.

190
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:46,576
We can't nab this thing now. I mean,

191
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,832
maybe I can sweet-talk
the devil into letting this one go.

192
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:53,140
Sweet-talk the devil?
I mean, you do that?

193
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,322
Not well, but I try.

194
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,426
Thirsty?
Got it from the hotel.

195
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:05,415
Also I have some crackers.

196
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,920
Sam, you know, I just really
don't think this is the time.

197
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,116
No, no. I promised you
a romantic weekend.

198
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:13,361
There's no reason we can't
enjoy ourselves a little bit. Hold on.

199
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:18,472
No corkscrew.

200
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:23,577
Maybe I could just do this.

201
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,449
What are you doing?

202
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:33,871
Every now and then,
I get this weird devil power.

203
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,276
I can't really control i.

204
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:38,305
It usually pops up when a soul is
trying to kill me, but I was thinkin'...

205
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:41,014
Maybe I could...

206
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:52,734
Damn it.

207
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,290
What?

208
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,165
You're getting pretty comfortable
with all of this, aren't you?

209
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,742
- Comfortable with what?
- Capturing souls,

210
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,569
devil powers.
I mean, being the son of satan.

211
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:07,283
- What are you talking about?
- Just...

212
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,579
It seems like none of this
even bothers you anymore.

213
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,189
Andi, how can you say that?

214
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,051
OK, we're having a picnic in
front of a monster lair.

215
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,249
I have to wonder if you're
getting sucked into the lifestyle.

216
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,009
I'm not getting sucked into anything.
I have no choice.

217
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:22,087
That's starting to sound
like an excuse, Sam.

218
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,724
- I knew it.
- What?

219
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:27,721
I thought he would be cool and let
me have one decent weekend away.

220
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,376
- Who?
- The devil. He's always screwing me.

221
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,749
He promised this great weekend,
and I actually believed him.

222
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm an idiot.
No, damn it. This is not fair.

223
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,797
Did you just do that?

224
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,858
Yeah. I don't...

225
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:47,001
I don't know.

226
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:49,473
OK, you know, we should just head back.

227
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,437
I'm so sorry about the whole
one-bed thing. That's nonsense.

228
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,880
But, I think we'll make due, right?

229
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,577
I'm sorry. Sorry.

230
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:10,358
Hey, look. In there,

231
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,923
you know what they don't have
that we need is ice cubes.

232
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:17,540
Really badly.
Because I cannot drink warm water.

233
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,690
Do you think maybe you could
go scrounge a little up for us?

234
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:24,071
Downstairs.
Take your time.

235
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,793
No, you don't.
You are not ruing this for me.

236
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:40,045
You wanna fly, cot?
You wanna fly?

237
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,532
Come here.

238
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,342
Suck it, cot!

239
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,169
No ice machine.

240
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,354
What? That's OK.

241
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,405
It's bedtime anyway.

242
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,521
What's that noise?

243
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,260
Noise. I don't know.

244
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:07,453
I, maybe someone havin' a phone
conversation in the other room.

245
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:10,809
Could be anything.

246
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,296
Don't...

247
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,107
Did you throw that cot down there?

248
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:21,119
What? Why?
Why would i? That's...

249
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:23,743
No. That's crazy.

250
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,212
You did that on purpose

251
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:32,426
so that we'd have to sleep together
in the same bed.

252
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,936
True. Yes.

253
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,267
You told me you would protect me,

254
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,695
- protect my virginity.
- I was protecting it.

255
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:42,429
For yourself, Sock.

256
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,718
- This is terrible.
- Is it? Is it terrible?

257
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:47,392
I don't know. I don't think so.

258
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:50,024
I mean, think about it. Can you
deny that we have a connection?

259
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,014
A brother-and-sister connection.

260
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:55,295
We're not actually related, OK, Kristen?

261
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,368
I mean, if you had've met me
any other way, doing anything,

262
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,612
like if we were paintballing, scuba
diving, hang gliding, I don't know,

263
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,272
you would think of me in
a different way. Admit it.

264
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,462
No. I would not.

265
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,465
I'm really sorry.
I...

266
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,419
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:25,189
Women.

268
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,657
They're like a...

269
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,280
They're like a mystery wrapped inside of

270
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,302
a mystery wrapped inside
of a third mystery.

271
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,560
You know what I mean?
Unreal.

272
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,229
Can I get 2 more of those?

273
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,500
Also can I have a wine cooler,
but put it in a beer glass.

274
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,987
- Make it look extra manly.
- One manly wine cooler comin' up.

275
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,376
Is this seat taken?

276
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,106
Hi. I'm Kristen.

277
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:06,937
Yeah, I know.

278
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,185
Hi. I'm Kristen.

279
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,877
Hi. I'm Sock. What...

280
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,724
wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

281
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,073
I get it. OK, are we pretending
that we're just meeting right now,

282
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:26,547
like randomly at the bar? I like it. OK.

283
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:28,048
I like it. That's hot.

284
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,126
OK, if we were meeting
at the bar right now,

285
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:33,609
I would probably try and pick
you up with my best line.

286
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,879
Pick me up.

287
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,355
Excuse me.

288
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,240
I think you're standing on my penis.

289
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,762
I'm not sure I understand,
but it sounds charming.

290
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:49,143
Well...

291
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:53,446
I have had thoughts,
thoughts about you.

292
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,918
I was raised to push
my feelings away and follow rules,

293
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,478
- but you don't follow rules.
- Rules are for a-holes.

294
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,648
One bed in the room will be fine.

295
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,839
All right.

296
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,505
Where are Sock and Kristen?
They know we're leaving, right?

297
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:32,487
Sleeping, I guess. I knocked on their
door, and no one answered.

298
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:35,527
Wake'em up. I'm getting my car, and then
we're getting out of here right now.

299
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:38,738
The longer we stick around,
the more likely something bad'll happen.

300
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,079
Mornin'.

301
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,530
Mornin'.

302
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,165
We were just comin' to see you so
we could pay the fine and get our car.

303
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,236
Do you have any idea what happened here?

304
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,670
I do not.

305
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:59,497
Well, since you and your friends are
the only ones stayin' here, I'd say...

306
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:02,193
Suspect pool, pretty small.

307
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,163
Morning, friends.

308
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,858
- Sheriff.
- Sir, is this your cot?

309
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,308
You know what?

310
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:18,118
Yeah, it is. I don't care.
I'll shout it from the rooftops.

311
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,665
That is my cot!

312
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:24,667
- That is not my cot!
- Sock, what's going on?

313
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,319
- He vandalized police property.
- Is this really necessary?

314
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:30,695
Degenerate! Last night,
he shared a bed with his own sister.

315
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,789
- No, no. Stepsister.
- It's the same thing.

316
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:36,132
- No! Really, it's not.
- You make me sick!

317
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:37,805
No, no, not sick. Healthy.

318
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,037
You're a very healthy girl!
You are so...

319
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:41,374
We are so healthy!

320
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:47,561
I'm gonna release
your buddy on wednesday.

321
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,094
That should...

322
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,664
Give him enough time
to learn his lesson.

323
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,144
Thank you, sir.

324
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:58,776
I wanna ask you about somethin'.

325
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,079
I found that in your car.

326
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:06,954
That. It's a school project, boring.

327
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,981
- School project.
- Creative writing class.

328
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:12,345
Well, that must be a great class.

329
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,474
Escaped souls, the devil, and a...

330
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:18,035
Hellish being right here in dove hollow.

331
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,249
- Now, that's exciting stuff.
- Thank you.

332
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,897
If only a publisher felt
the same way, right?

333
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:30,958
You know, you can trust me.

334
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:35,312
- Yeah. I know. I do.
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

335
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:39,220
I'm still gonna release your car
to you as an act of good faith.

336
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,573
Does that sound good?

337
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,870
- Yeah. Thank you.
- But I wanna reiterate...

338
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,615
Anything you wanna tell me,

339
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:49,046
anything at all, door's always open.

340
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:51,270
Yes, sir. Thank you.

341
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,911
Glad we got that all cleared up.
Guess we're done here.

342
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:58,695
You're free to go, mr. Oliver.

343
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,550
Thank you.

344
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:19,504
You keep eating.
You get yourself nice and garlicky.

345
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,286
I'll be back in a little while.

346
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,760
Hey. Got the car back.

347
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:31,279
- What's the problem?
- I'm leaving.

348
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,666
I can't stay here anymore.
I'll walk home.

349
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:36,094
No, she's upset about Sock.

350
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:38,271
No. Kristen, we have to stay
here just a little longer,

351
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,947
- until Sock gets out of jail.
- No, I'll take her, Sam.

352
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:43,491
I got a couple things I gotta do anyway.

353
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:47,919
Yeah. All right.
You guys should go back.

354
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,218
Kristen, why don't you go up and pack?

355
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,207
OK. Yeah, so you guys'll go ahead,

356
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,923
and me and Ben'll wait here
until Sock gets released.

357
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,072
Guess so.

358
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm really sorry this weekend didn't
turn out the way it was supposed to.

359
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:14,866
It was never gonna be a vacation, Sam.
The soul was always your first priority.

360
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:18,571
Why don't we just talk
about this when I get back?

361
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,888
I don't want you to worry about me.
I'll be fine.

362
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,091
I'm not worried.

363
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:48,075
Afternoon.
Can I help you?

364
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,256
I am looking for my friends.

365
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:53,211
They enjoy alcoholic beverages,
so I thought they might be here.

366
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:56,345
3 guys, 2 girls, kind of a

367
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,419
- funny bunch.
- That sounds right.

368
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,113
Believe they're out and about,
but you're welcome to wait here.

369
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,791
Great. Thanks.

370
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,398
- I'll just have water.
- Comin' right up.

371
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:11,060
You been out to see the mine yet?

372
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,693
Should take a look.
It's pretty amazing.

373
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:19,713
No, thanks. I'm not here to sightsee,
just surprising my boyfriend.

374
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:22,983
So your friends aren't expecting you.

375
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,903
So nobody knows you're here, then.

376
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,281
Probably not.

377
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:29,949
Interestin'.

378
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,755
You're... off.

379
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:35,429
Beg your pardon?

380
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:38,096
Something's wrong with you.
You're not real. And...

381
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:40,754
You smell like

382
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:43,104
hell.

383
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,502
And you smell delicious.

384
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,528
So, really? Kristen just left?

385
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,473
She boogied out of here?
Did she ask about me?

386
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:09,116
Did she send me a message?
In a bottle or pigeon or something?

387
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,366
We gotta focus,
get you the hell out of here.

388
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:13,383
- We could go shawshank.
- Shawshank?

389
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:15,645
We smuggle in a rock pick,
and Sock could dig his way out.

390
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,528
- That was a movie.
- It was based on a book.

391
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:20,179
- Didn't it take him like, 20 years?
- You guys, we don't have 20 min.

392
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,616
- The sheriff could be here any second.
- All right. OK.

393
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:23,939
Then we break the lock.

394
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:28,239
- Old school.
- Yeah, what does that mean?

395
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,726
I'm gonna go borrow
the pickax from the bar.

396
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:43,255
I was wondering if I could
borrow something... That.

397
00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:47,882
What do you need that old thing for?

398
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,597
I just need to ax something.

399
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,344
A hole, just for fun.

400
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,698
Well, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

401
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,704
That thing's sort of an antique.

402
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,358
Hey, this is Nina's purse.

403
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:03,532
Hey, is my girlfriend here?

404
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,846
Blonde, beautiful,
a little intimidating.

405
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,509
Yeah. Think I saw her.

406
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:10,988
Not sure where she got off to.

407
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,845
On second thought,

408
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,872
you can borrow my ax.
Why, I trust you.

409
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,000
Why don't you come back
here and take it down.

410
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:47,634
I warned him, stay away from you guys.

411
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:50,558
He just wouldn't listen.

412
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:55,344
I've been all alone with this
thing goin' on 10 years now.

413
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,474
That's when people started disappearin'.

414
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:01,274
They didn't just disappear. That thing
ate them, and you fed them to it.

415
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,624
Well, I had no choice.

416
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,646
I did everything I could to
stop people from comin' here.

417
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:08,309
I drove the locals out.

418
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,124
I... I turned away whole
busloads of tourists.

419
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,840
Now look at this place.
It's a ghost town.

420
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,449
I've noticed.

421
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,942
If I'm not here to stop it,

422
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:21,752
then it might go on to the next town,
the next state.

423
00:26:22,754 --> 00:26:24,754
I mean, do you have any idea

424
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:28,263
what it's like to be stuck
in a situation

425
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:31,317
where you have to do something you
don't wanna do and there's no way out?

426
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:34,948
I know exactly what that's like.

427
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,092
Is everybody in the town that thing?

428
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:40,470
I mean, are they all tentacles?

429
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:44,980
It mimics people,
and it uses them like fishing lures,

430
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,793
and then it takes everybody
up in the mine where it feeds.

431
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:49,631
So why'd you decide to help us now?

432
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:52,506
When I read your devil folder,

433
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,661
I figured
maybe you were sent to help.

434
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,580
I told you what it was.
Now you tell me what you are.

435
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,810
I saved your friend's life.

436
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:12,964
Everything you saw in that folder,
it's for real.

437
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,146
I catch souls for the devil,

438
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:19,641
souls that have escaped from hell,
like the one in your mine here.

439
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,089
Has anyone escaped from it?

440
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:25,746
I mean, maybe it...
That thing didn't eat Nina right away.

441
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,861
No. Sorry, son.

442
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,633
Takes everything in one big gulp.

443
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:36,021
- Think she went down swiftly, right?
- Till digestion starts.

444
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:41,009
If you're workin' for the devil,
hope you got a plan.

445
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:43,568
Yeah. I'm gonna send it back to hell...

446
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,311
With this.

447
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:48,306
That... that's just gonna make it angry.

448
00:27:48,372 --> 00:27:50,650
It's not a normal grenade.
It's a vessel.

449
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,361
I just need to get close
enough to the soul to catch it.

450
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:56,614
Nice.

451
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,028
You know, I think I know how I can help.

452
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,561
Gas?

453
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,211
Well, the tricky thing about
this creature is findin' it,

454
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:12,963
so I'm gonna smoke it out.

455
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:16,151
You're gonna be at the mine entrance.
I'm gonna drive it to you.

456
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:17,612
Good idea.

457
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:27,369
- Do you smell smoke yet?
- All I can smell is Kristen.

458
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,890
She was like vanilla, boys.

459
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,174
Vanilla.

460
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:35,117
This is takin' too long. Screw it.

461
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:37,478
- Wait! No, Ben!
- What the hell you doin', man?

462
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
She's dead.

463
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:40,912
Nina's dead.
I have nothing to live for.

464
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:42,995
Don't worry.
I'll take care of this thing myself.

465
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,679
No! Ben, you're being crazy. Come on.

466
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,840
You're gonna get eaten in there.
Listen! Hey, listen!

467
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:49,140
You were dating Nina for,
what, like 3 weeks?

468
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:52,647
I, on the other hand,
just lost a sister and a lover.

469
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:56,127
If we stick together we make it through
this as team, you know what I mean?

470
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,352
I'm not gonna find anyone else.

471
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,509
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

472
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:03,566
- Doesn't matter.
- I mean, who's gonna want me?

473
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:08,254
You bite your tongue. You bite your
tongue till it bleeds in your mouth.

474
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:11,721
You are a beautiful man,
on the outside and the inside.

475
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,761
You got that...
You got that smile

476
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:17,093
that lights up a room,
that laugh, that infectious laugh.

477
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:19,298
And then you got that sexy
latin gaze that just pulls

478
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,223
you in like a magnet
from the mother ship.

479
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:22,836
You... mean that?

480
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,965
Benjamin Casper Perez Gonzalez,

481
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:30,428
I could get lost in your eyes for days.
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

482
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:34,674
You're right.

483
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:36,607
You're right. I don't wanna die.

484
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,725
I'm comin' down, guys.

485
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:40,750
Let's go.

486
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:45,375
Beautiful Ben!

487
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,145
Oh, my god.

488
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:09,243
- We did it. We got the soul.
- And you're welcome.

489
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:14,420
- Now, this is a surprise.
- What is?

490
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,315
Well, I really didn't think,
I'd see you guys again.

491
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:22,192
I'm just very, very surprised.

492
00:30:24,286 --> 00:30:25,665
You didn't set the fire.

493
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:27,193
No, I didn't.

494
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,240
In fact, I warned that thing
that you were comin'.

495
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,587
- You what?
- Yeah, well.

496
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:37,438
It knew you were comin',
and, you guys won out.

497
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,450
- You guys are damn good.
- Why would you do that?

498
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,290
You see, these are my friends,
my family.

499
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:47,975
This little town,
this little slice of heaven

500
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:49,958
is everything I have in this world.

501
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:54,632
You know, I been datin' millie goin' on,
6 years now.

502
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:57,718
Dude, you're bangin'a tentacle?

503
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,970
Please,
don't talk about millie like that.

504
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:05,155
- That's crude.
- Sheriff, you're crazy.

505
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,051
Here we go. Good.

506
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:12,978
You see, I don't like change.

507
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:15,329
I like to keep things pure and simple.

508
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:20,502
And the way I see it, if somebody
has to die to preserve my way of life,

509
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:22,931
that's the price of paradise.

510
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:31,718
I must be crazy.
Forgot to load the damn thing.

511
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:57,437
We're sitting ducks.
What are we gonna do?

512
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,177
Let's run for the car we can make it.

513
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:03,636
OK, good. We need a distraction.

514
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,799
Benji, you run that way,
scream like a maniac.

515
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,998
He chases you. We go back, get the car,
come back around, and rescue you. Break.

516
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,538
That's stupid. That's suicide.

517
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,524
You're willing to kill yourself
over some chick

518
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,544
but you don't sacrifice
yourself for your buddies?

519
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:16,160
That's a good point.

520
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:18,409
That's a terrible point.
We gotta go together.

521
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:24,518
- Shotgun. It's gonna be locked!
- No, man! The windows are wide open!

522
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,083
No keys! I'll bet there's no keys!

523
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:28,305
What's with the negative
energy now, Ben?

524
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,733
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Oh, my god!

525
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,137
Where's the keys?

526
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,555
- Hurry! Way ahead of you!
- Hold on!

527
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:46,016
Put her in hyperdrive, Sammy!

528
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,060
Around this corner,
and we're out of here.

529
00:32:58,148 --> 00:32:59,229
Keep going.

530
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,149
Oh, my god.

531
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:28,669
- Split up!
- Run. Run, run, run.

532
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:40,642
You're lookin' right in the camera.

533
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,767
- You ever hear of the fourth wall?
- The sheriff's tryin' to kill us.

534
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:47,816
Yeah, him and his perfect town.
Just like a David Lynch movie.

535
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,874
I need somethin' to defend myself.

536
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:52,146
Well, all I have is this.

537
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:55,318
No! That's a vessel!
It doesn't work on people!

538
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:58,374
It's more of a bargaining
chip than a weapon, actually.

539
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,890
But it's all you've got.
There is a way out of this, Sam,

540
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,552
and it starts right here.

541
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,754
Another beauty of this town...

542
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,001
Not a lot of places to hide.

543
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,399
Wait!

544
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:25,994
You want your town back?

545
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:29,397
You want your friends,
they all still exist.

546
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:34,131
I put 'em in here,
and I can let 'em out again.

547
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,675
Aren't you just full of surprises?

548
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:49,189
Just let it out,
and then i'll let you go.

549
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:52,211
- You're not gonna let me go.
- Probably not.

550
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,797
But I can make it quick,
or I can draw it out.

551
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:57,103
It's up to you.

552
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:59,212
Come on. You don't have to do this.

553
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:03,789
You spent so many years alone with
that monster. It'd drive anybody crazy.

554
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:07,136
You can you could have a real life again
You just gotta walk away.

555
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,834
Without that creature,

556
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,892
without this town,

557
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:14,010
- i'd be all alone.
- You can get past that,

558
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:15,818
make new friends.

559
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,708
Sheriff, there was a time when you
tried to protect people from this thing.

560
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,821
I know you used to be a good person.

561
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,921
You can be that again.

562
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,539
No. I've done too many
bad things since then.

563
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,935
Doesn't matter anymore.
Nothin' does.

564
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:35,970
Which is why you'd really
better do what I say.

565
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,331
What the hell happened?

566
00:35:58,826 --> 00:35:59,897
I don't know.

567
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,039
- Nina, don't! No! Don't kill him!&
- Help me!

568
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:13,789
He's not a soul. He's a person.
Nina, come on.

569
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:15,327
All right?

570
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:18,770
Keeping him alive is gonna be way worse
than any punishment we can give him.

571
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,105
He'll have to live with what he did.

572
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:22,847
He'll be all alone.

573
00:36:24,544 --> 00:36:25,600
Help me!

574
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,048
But, yeah, if you just wanna throw him,
you can do that, too.

575
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,859
So you're indigestible.

576
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:40,166
Apparently.

577
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:42,546
That thing had 3 stomachs, like a cow.

578
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:44,543
I never made it past the first one.

579
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:46,300
Nice exfoliation, though.

580
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:48,620
Good for you.

581
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:51,521
I get it.

582
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:54,984
- Get what?
- I get why you let him live.

583
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:56,504
You want him to suffer.

584
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:59,392
No. He gets to live because

585
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,199
he's a human being.
We don't kill human beings.

586
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:05,991
But his existence will be terrible.
You said so yourself.

587
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:09,108
He's gonna live a life of
excruciating pain and torture.

588
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:10,637
It'll be hell on earth.

589
00:37:11,158 --> 00:37:12,413
You're diabolical.

590
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:16,086
No, I'm not. It's called justice, Nina.
He did it to himself.

591
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:19,323
No, you are.
You're evil.

592
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:28,909
I find that very attractive.

593
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:33,806
Sweetheart, are you here?!

594
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:41,890
Nina, baby, you're alive.

595
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:44,322
Baby.

596
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,617
You're OK. You're alive.

597
00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:50,058
I knew it.
I knew you'd be OK.

598
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,142
I'm so happy, baby.

599
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:55,831
Why are we whispering?

600
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,482
Baby, Sock fell asleep.

601
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:08,881
Wait. OK. All right.

602
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:12,146
You can't you can't just ignore me.
We have to talk about this.

603
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,690
Wait! Kristen, hold on.
What happened the other night,

604
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,532
that was a good thing.
That was a beautiful, natural thing.

605
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,575
Kristen, look at me, please.

606
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:25,221
OK, I want you

607
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,599
to just tell me what you're thinking
right now, OK? Be honest. It's OK.

608
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:32,966
- I feel ashamed.
- Ashamed?

609
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,935
Was it because of that sweet-ass,
crazy move that I did the other night?

610
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:42,377
- That is nothin' to be ashamed of.
- You don't understand how I was raised.

611
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,746
You don't understand my culture,
how powerful shame is.

612
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:50,014
OK, yeah. You're right. I don't.
I don't understand your culture.

613
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:54,766
But I do understand
that it created a beautiful,

614
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:57,021
smart, funny girl,

615
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:00,445
a girl who is in America now,
by the way, a country

616
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,638
that doesn't give
a rat's ass about shame.

617
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:05,901
It's kind of like the perfect clash
of cultures we got goin' on here. Shame,

618
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:07,873
shamelessness...

619
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:10,613
comin' together to create
somethin'more sexy

620
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:12,365
than anybody could ever imagine.

621
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:16,221
You're right.

622
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:19,128
I will not allow
my country to ruin this.

623
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:20,315
Exactly.

624
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:27,989
- Let's go to our room.
- You got it. Hop on. Come on.

625
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:30,332
We're goin' there.

626
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:42,787
So, it looks like you
two have become friends.

627
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,863
We... certainly have.

628
00:39:46,405 --> 00:39:47,436
We were...

629
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,734
just on our way outside to play horsie,

630
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:54,012
do a little roughhousing, maybe.
I don't know. Lawn darts.

631
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:55,630
Heh. Come on, Sis. Let's go.

632
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,066
Hey, buddy.

633
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:09,363
- What do you want?
- Just to tell you you did a great job.

634
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:11,906
It was a tough one,
but you came through with flying colors.

635
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:14,148
I'm so pleased to see
you coming into your own.

636
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:17,559
Thanks for setting me up
for a train wreck of a weekend getaway.

637
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,265
Do you have any idea how
impossible you've made my life?

638
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,430
Andi is furious with me, and I don't
know how to make it up to her.

639
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:27,179
I wanna tell you that I don't put you
in harm's way just to get my jollies.

640
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:31,673
I put you in these situations
because I have confidence in you.

641
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:34,355
I want you to have
confidence in yourself.

642
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:37,005
- That's great.
- And I also wanna tell you

643
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:39,487
you can handle much
more than you realize.

644
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:43,431
You can withstand any blow, any blow.

645
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:46,651
What are you talking about?

646
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:56,579
Didn't realize you were back.

647
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:59,598
Yeah. I was just about
to come and find you.

648
00:41:01,187 --> 00:41:02,829
I wanna apologize for this weekend.

649
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:05,841
It got messed up in a lot of ways,
and I'm really, really sorry.

650
00:41:06,188 --> 00:41:08,772
But I think we should try it again.

651
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:10,487
You know, just you and me,

652
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:13,911
we take another long weekend.
How about this next week?

653
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,977
I can't.

654
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,527
Wait. What do you mean?
You're the manager now. Just

655
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,815
rework the schedule a little.

656
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:23,990
Sam, I can't make plans for the future,

657
00:41:25,164 --> 00:41:26,925
- not with you.
- What?

658
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:30,680
You know, evil has worked
its way into every part of your life.

659
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,294
I mean, every day, it surrounds you...

660
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:36,211
demons, hell.

661
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,591
I can't help but think
that you're starting to like it...

662
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,323
that it's changing you.

663
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:48,134
Maybe it's always been in you.

664
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:50,792
I just never saw it.

665
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,206
I'm sorry, Sam.

666
00:41:57,529 --> 00:41:58,535
I'm really,

667
00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:00,709
really sorry.

668
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,274
Andi, wait.

669
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,293
Are you breaking up with me?

670
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:07,920
