1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,710
Previously on Reaper...

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,225
My parents sold my soul to the devil,
I'm a bounty hunter for hell.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,894
- You didn't tell Andi?
- No! I'm not gonna tell Andi.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,271
If she knows, she'll think I'm a freak.
She'll never go out with me.

5
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,398
- Flowers aren't from me.
- No, they're from Greg.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,389
I know you've been distracted
by all this Greg business,

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,267
I took the liberty to
dig up some dirt on him.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,199
Well, you know, Greg's dating twins, ok?
2 slutty twins.

9
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,522
They're his sisters.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,530
Someone gave me the
wrong information.

11
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,196
Who? Who would say that?

12
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,375
He's in the bathroom.

13
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:43,217
Oh, man. Look at that crazy.

14
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,722
Hey, these are all about the
world trade organization...

15
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,300
The G-8 summit.

16
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,173
Hey, wait.
What was this soul gonna do?

17
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,803
Sam! Sam!

18
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,100
Can I have this
after we capture him?

19
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,482
- Sock!
- Hey, who's out there?

20
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:06,660
This is a private residence!
I don't think you can be in here.

21
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:08,232
Leon, get out here!

22
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,021
Listen, I'm all better now.

23
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:11,870
I'm not killing
anybody anymore.

24
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,920
We can see your wall
of insanity, ok?

25
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,390
We know what you're planning.

26
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:17,572
No, no!
That's my thought board.

27
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:19,470
My therapist told
me to make it.

28
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,630
Do we have to come in there
or are you gonna come out?

29
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:22,621
Well...

30
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,752
Ok, then.

31
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,672
I want you guys to know

32
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,513
I've worked very hard on
my psychological health,

33
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,350
so what I'm about to do
is very difficult for me.

34
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:42,640
It's really going
to hurt my heart.

35
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:46,020
There's no freaking way
I'm going back to hell.

36
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:10,040
Well, this just keeps
getting easier and easier.

37
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:19,182
Season 1, Episode 6 - Leon
For www.forom.com

38
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,601
Wow. I'm not usually
a morning person,

39
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,860
but I kind of like knocking
a soul off first thing.

40
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,490
Get the rest of
the day to myself.

41
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:30,242
I knew that guy was
going down easy.

42
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,951
He came out, we sucked his ass up,
and boom, end of story.

43
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,283
Sock, I almost got killed.

44
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,190
Whatever. We've almost been
killed way worse than that.

45
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,862
Uh, Sam,

46
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,372
where's Gladys?

47
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,331
Can I help you?

48
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:51,080
- Yeah. Is Gladys here?
- On vacation.

49
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,303
- Do you know when she'll be back?
- No.

50
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,881
Is there something
I can help you with?

51
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,220
That?

52
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,271
I'm just wondering if
you want to take that.

53
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,892
Do I want your snow globe?

54
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,521
I mean, is there a place where
stuff like this gets turned in?

55
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:17,532
Sir, this is the department
of motor vehicles.

56
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,493
Right, right.

57
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,660
Is there anybody else
who could maybe help us?

58
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,920
Do you want his snow globe?

59
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,173
Yeah, I'll take that.

60
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,463
I'm just gonna come
back another time.

61
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,720
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,803
Halloween

63
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,141
is an extremely
important holiday to me.

64
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:51,730
The one time of year
when a person allows

65
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,982
his feelings to take flight...

66
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:56,063
His wishes and desires

67
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,402
to be known to the world.

68
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:03,411
Ted, uh, you do realize
Halloween is still two days away?

69
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,802
Halloween is not a day, ok?
It's a season.

70
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:08,082
Which brings me to
my special treat.

71
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:12,461
Who wants to be our
lucky pumpkin? Huh?

72
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:13,830
Oh, come on, guys.

73
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,932
You get to dress up as
a beautiful pumpkin

74
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,502
and bring joy to children...
and pass out coupons.

75
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,351
You're not going to
be the pumpkin, Sock.

76
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,671
Racist.

77
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:26,263
Andi. Hey. Ouch.

78
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,770
- She still mad at you?
- Andi! Andi, come on.

79
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,271
Andi, yes!

80
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:32,681
You can be the pumpkin.

81
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:35,400
No. I really don't want
to be the pumpkin, Ted.

82
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:39,570
I-I'll be the pumpkin.
I'll... Me. Not her.

83
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,111
Ok. Sorry, Andi.

84
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,900
I guess Sam wants
it more than you.

85
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,491
Ok. I got something seriously
cool to show you guys.

86
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,791
All right. You ready?

87
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:01,050
Sock, stop messing
with the vessel.

88
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,803
Shh, shh! Ok. Do it!

89
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,393
Uh...what do you
want me to say?

90
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,390
It talks!

91
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:13,732
I know!

92
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,952
I know.
I heard it coming from Sam's locker.

93
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,430
How'd you get into my locker?

94
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,521
Oh, bolt cutters.

95
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,871
Look, I think I'm gonna hide
it in Ted's private bathroom

96
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:23,371
so he thinks the toilet's talking
to him. What do you think?

97
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,501
- No. We're not doing that.
- I'll do that.

98
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,750
Just leave it alone. Ok?
We don't want to break it.

99
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:29,242
Listen, I was just wondering,

100
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,620
any chance I can get out of
here for therapy at 3:00 today?

101
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,362
No, I am not letting you out.

102
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,830
Well, why not?

103
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:37,931
Uh, let's start with
the original problem.

104
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,310
Leon, you were an assassin.

105
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,441
You mean shooting
President McKinley?

106
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,391
Are you going to hold
that against me?

107
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,631
Yes, yes, I am.

108
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:46,463
That was a hundred years ago.

109
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,430
I'm completely over that now.

110
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,423
I've been out of
hell over a year.

111
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:52,983
- I haven't tried to hurt anybody.
- You shot at us.

112
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,393
Self-defense!

113
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,441
Leon, you're going
back to hell.

114
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,772
- Do no touch him.
- Oh, come on, Sam.

115
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,790
Why are you doing this?
Why do you care?

116
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,583
Because he's the
devil's bounty hunter.

117
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:04,991
You got that right, Sock.

118
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:08,242
This guy really does
have a stick up his ass.

119
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:11,340
Stick up my ass? What are you,
talking about me behind my back?

120
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:12,781
No, no, it was a joke.

121
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:16,460
But doesn't every joke
have a grain of tru to it?

122
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:18,120
Don't touch it.

123
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:30,592
Hey, what's up?

124
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,932
- Stocking the candy, huh?
- Yep.

125
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,163
All right.
Is that what we're doing now?

126
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,852
One-word answers?

127
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,901
Andi, come on.

128
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,190
I'm sorry, ok?

129
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,642
I didn't mean to
sabotage you and Greg.

130
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:50,002
I'm sorry I even got involved.

131
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:52,783
I was just-- I was truly just
trying to be your friend.

132
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,551
What can I do to
make this up to you?

133
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,333
I'll do anything. Name it.

134
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:01,250
- I just can't.
- Can't what?

135
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,423
It's not what you
said about Greg, ok?

136
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:06,591
It's what that said about us.

137
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,880
And if you could do
something like that,

138
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,681
then maybe our friendship
isn't what I thought it was.

139
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,181
Honestly, I just really don't

140
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,351
know how to be friends
with you anymore.

141
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:23,610
Oh. That's a problem.

142
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,361
I just--I can't.

143
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:52,050
What the...

144
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:12,786
Hello, Spike.

145
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,375
Perfect timing,

146
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,587
because my day didn't
suck enough yet.

147
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,993
Surprise.

148
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:21,160
What's up?

149
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,082
Very little.

150
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:29,210
O-kay.

151
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,120
This is gonna sound weird,
but are you all right?

152
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,350
Holidays always
depress me, Sam.

153
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,521
Holidays?

154
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,561
What? Halloween?

155
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,930
I thought you'd love
this time of year.

156
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,773
I detest it with every
fiber of my being.

157
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:50,192
Back when it was the Ancient
Celtic Festival of Samhain...

158
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,612
Now that--that was a holiday.

159
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:56,701
Dead rising from
their graves...

160
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,950
Damaging crops,
causing trouble.

161
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,621
Good times.

162
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,213
But now you hate it.

163
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,423
It's the
commercialization of evil.

164
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:07,961
The one day

165
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,343
when not a soul on
earth fears me,

166
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,132
or even believes in me.

167
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,051
I become a party gag.

168
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,591
A plastic mask.

169
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:20,681
It's only one day
out of the year.

170
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,123
Are you trying to make
me feel better, Sam?

171
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,061
Yeah. I guess I am.

172
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:27,810
How weird.

173
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:29,310
In any event,

174
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,362
I let hell take a
holiday on Halloween.

175
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,742
Then everything
grinds to a halt,

176
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,820
paperwork gets backs up.

177
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,630
A few days of vacation sets
me back a hundred years.

178
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,160
It's a nightmare.

179
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,410
Ahh. That's why I
couldn't turn in Leon.

180
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,330
The DMV demon was on vacation.

181
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,750
The whole thing makes me sick.

182
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,382
You want to hear a
really scary story?

183
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:07,313
This used to be
a slaughterhouse.

184
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,062
Turn of the century

185
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,131
they were butchering a
thousand head of cattle a day.

186
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,732
And when it rained,

187
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,992
the streets would
run red with blood.

188
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,913
- Ahh.
- Then in the 1940s,

189
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,460
a serial killer terrorized
this neighborhood.

190
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:22,991
Under the cover of night.

191
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,950
He chose easy victims...

192
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:29,791
You know, runaways...
vagrants... prostitutes.

193
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,463
He brought them all here.

194
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,002
They called him the butcher.

195
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,511
And this little guy,

196
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,653
he was on the torture team
for the butcher down in hell.

197
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:42,393
Spike may not look like much,

198
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,520
but can he make grown men cry.

199
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:46,483
So the butcher's on the loose?

200
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,481
He's already
claimed one victim.

201
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,811
And he's going to
try to kill again.

202
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:52,900
Here.

203
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,152
Police finally
caught the butcher,

204
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,481
but they never found
any of his victims.

205
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,950
There were rumors about what
he did with the bodies.

206
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:29,313
Oh, no!

207
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:44,323
She is crying her eyes
out on the inside, man.

208
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,241
Yeah, somehow I doubt that.

209
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:49,002
Oh, come on,

210
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,933
you guys can handle this.
You made a tiny little mistake.

211
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,960
She's gotta forgive
you sooner or later.

212
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,930
She doesn't trust me.
She thinks I'm a liar.

213
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,420
- I can't blame her.
- Yeah.

214
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,213
Oh, here, by the way.

215
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,750
Took him with me to
trivia night at the bar.

216
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:03,841
- What?
- Dude knows his history.

217
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:06,143
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

218
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,652
You took him out with you last night?
Are you insane?

219
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,281
Listen, you can't just
keep him cooped up

220
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,360
in your locker all day and night,
it's cruel.

221
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:13,842
Cruel? Sock, he's a murderer.

222
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,860
It was a mistake.
I realize that now.

223
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,523
It was all misdirected anger.

224
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,640
I wasn't mad at President McKinley,
I was mad at my father.

225
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,251
See? Therapy's working wonders.

226
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:24,911
Last night at the bar,

227
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:27,750
he was totally helping me through
all my mother issues last night.

228
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,702
- What mother issues?
- Well...

229
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,002
The breast feeding.

230
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,502
And how I never wanted to stop.

231
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:42,341
And Leon explained to me
that that is ok. I'm ok.

232
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:43,993
And I can help you too, Sam.

233
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,801
Tell me about your childhood.

234
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,991
My parents sold my
soul to the devil.

235
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,933
So. Ohh. Uh, well,

236
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:52,601
that's some abandonment
and betrayal...

237
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:56,312
And I'm gonna guess there
was a lot of bed-wetting.

238
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,662
- Ok.
- Listen, listen.

239
00:12:57,948 --> 00:12:59,440
The point is,

240
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,242
Leon is trying to make
himself a better person.

241
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,153
Ok? He made mistakes.

242
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,492
Just like you made a mistake.

243
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,372
Doesn't everybody
deserve forgiveness, hmm?

244
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,292
You know what I'm saying?

245
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,672
Hey, Ted.

246
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,150
How come you didn't
dress up for Halloween?

247
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,460
Pumpkin costume is
in my office, Sam.

248
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,803
Thank me later for
having it dry cleaned.

249
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:26,010
The last pumpkin was
quite the sweaty betty.

250
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,521
Scare up some
savings at the Bench.

251
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:39,061
Scare up some savings
at the Bench. 30%...

252
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,732
I hate this costume.
It's so humiliating.

253
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:44,741
Well, I think you look like
a very pretty pumpkin.

254
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,980
- I look like an idiot.
- No, you don't.

255
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,200
You know,
Leon said that you might have

256
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:53,583
some self-esteem issues,
and I can clearly see that now.

257
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,722
- Enough with Leon already.
- Scare up some savings at the--

258
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:58,261
He's right though. Look at you.

259
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,250
You're embarrassed,

260
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,433
you're all afraid that people
will look you in the eye.

261
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:02,813
This is not the Sam I know.

262
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:04,381
Thank you. You're not helping!

263
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:07,890
You know what,
you are letting the pumpkin own you.

264
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,220
You need to own the pumpkin.

265
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,222
- You own the pumpkin.
- Excuse me?

266
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,823
- You own the pumpkin.
- I would kill to own the pumpkin, ok?

267
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:17,280
I would kill somebody to be
in your place right now.

268
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,562
Embarrassment does not
compute up here, Sam.

269
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,191
Matter of fact...

270
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:25,122
I think I might get into my
Halloween costume right now.

271
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,412
Sock? What are you--
what are you doing?

272
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,750
Getting into my costume.
I just told you.

273
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,703
Ah! I am underwear man.

274
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,250
I'm underwear man.

275
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,712
Give me the flyers,
give them, give them.

276
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,211
Listen to me, Sam.

277
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:41,601
Listen to me.
If someone tries to humiliate you,

278
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:44,220
all you need to do is just
look that person in the eye

279
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,960
and humiliate them right back.

280
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,523
Show them you're the cat's nuts.
You know what I mean?

281
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,261
Watch this. Hi, there.

282
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,663
Welcome to the Work Bench.
Happy Halloween.

283
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,482
Totally dominated that guy.
See? It's that easy.

284
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,160
You feel better about
being the pumpkin?

285
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:03,943
Yeah, yeah. I kinda do.

286
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,502
It's actually kinda liberating.

287
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,653
I can feel every littl breeze.

288
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:11,703
Let's check it out.

289
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,452
Come on, come on.

290
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,543
All righ, Sam. Open it up.

291
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,882
What is it?

292
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:31,432
- Some kind of thermometer.
- It's a meat thermometer.

293
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:34,260
You stab it into a pot roast,
turkey or something.

294
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,601
Right, right. The butcher.
Meat. Makes sense.

295
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:37,893
The butcher?

296
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,830
That's a pretty
good name. Yeah.

297
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,072
If I was a serial killer,
I'd want my name to be

298
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,581
something more effective
like murder man and killbot.

299
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,193
Well, it seems user-friendly.

300
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:48,821
Stab it into the soul's trachea,
no problem.

301
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,070
What's with the hell hound?

302
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,381
I think he's supposed to
help us find the soul.

303
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,540
So how do we nab the butcher?

304
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:57,911
Find his hide-out.

305
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,592
I don't know where the
devil took me last night,

306
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:02,340
but for a change, he gave me a
lot of background on the guy.

307
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,133
Good. Let's look him up.

308
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:11,011
We need the computer.

309
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:12,431
No.

310
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:15,270
Hey, they got some candy up front.
You want some candy?

311
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,932
Don't care.

312
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,363
All right. I tried. Come on.
You're out of here.

313
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,771
Type, Ben.

314
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:29,033
Found this on a serial
killer website.

315
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,571
"Barney Kirkwood,
a-k-a the Butcher of Ballard,

316
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,822
a particularly brutal killer,
active in the forties.

317
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:40,040
Nearly escaped prosecution because
the bodies were never found."

318
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:42,301
That's him,
that's who the devil was talking about.

319
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,103
Now they think he chopped up his
victims and fed them to his dogs.

320
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,760
- Now that's gross.
- You're supposed to be the helper, huh?

321
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,602
- Where is he?
- He is called the Butcher of Ballard.

322
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,483
And Ballard is only
a few miles away.

323
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,342
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

324
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,680
No, I think we're wrong.
This isn't where the devil took me.

325
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,322
Looks completely different.

326
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,180
I don't know, then if...

327
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,800
he's in another neighborhood,
we're screwed.

328
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:05,523
Look at that.

329
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,070
"Rebecca Cashman."

330
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:15,493
"Last seen leaving work at the
flower market two nights ago."

331
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,503
Wait a second. This is it.

332
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,330
This is where he took me.

333
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,131
You think he's still
got the missing girl?

334
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:29,752
I doubt it.
Said he'd already killed once.

335
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:32,303
But he's coming back tonight.

336
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,803
Thank god it's not
a full moon tonight.

337
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:40,890
Yeah, I would hate
to have to catch

338
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,770
the butcher under a full moon.

339
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,350
It's getting late,
we should head--

340
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,063
Have you seen Sock?

341
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:49,541
No, he disappeared as
soon as we got back.

342
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:57,950
Hey.

343
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,451
Hey.

344
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:01,372
- What's up?
- What? Nothing.

345
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,690
I was just remembering a really
funny thing that happened.

346
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:06,213
Oh, yeah? What?

347
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,751
Uh...I was just...
having a private moment--

348
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:13,170
- Little joke for myself.
- You have brain damage.

349
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:16,220
Maybe...probably.

350
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,720
All right. So, go on.

351
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,363
So, Ted hears my voice
coming out of his toilet.

352
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:27,313
And he says, god, is that you?

353
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,152
And I said, yes, Ted.
This is god.

354
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,441
And I've got Abe
Lincoln with me

355
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,780
and we both think you're
a huge douche bag.

356
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,241
And then he started
crying, going,

357
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,072
ooh, ooh, honest Abe,
please forgive me.

358
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,551
S, uh, so,
what does the butcher look like now?

359
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,710
I don't know...

360
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,171
What is it? What is it? Whoa.

361
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:53,550
Lassie's going nuts.

362
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh, Sam, is that you?
Are you playing a joke?

363
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,340
It's not funny.

364
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,602
Look!

365
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:07,983
I got to stab it!

366
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:10,102
Go, go, go!

367
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,190
Sam. Listen, Sam,
what do we do?

368
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:20,242
- I have to get close enough...
- But that's insane, Sam!

369
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,750
Just wait. Maybe it went away.

370
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,033
- Maybe it thinks we left.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,173
- It's coming!
- Stab it, stab it now.

372
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:41,261
- I got to do something.
- Do it now, Sam. Do it now.

373
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,180
Look out!

374
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:51,520
Aah! I dropped it, I think.

375
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,061
I lost the vessel!
I lost the vessel!

376
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,240
I'll see you in hell, buddy.

377
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,380
Spike.

378
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,390
Oh my god.
You're the number one.

379
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,142
You are the champion! Ahh!

380
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,741
I've never been so afraid
in my entire life.

381
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:30,480
- What was it?
- The butcher.

382
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:31,991
Hell must've turned
him into some kind

383
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,601
of dog monster or something.

384
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:36,031
Pretzels for the hero, huh?
You saved our asses!

385
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,762
- Take that, take that.
- You know,

386
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,541
I'm gonna have to get
up close and personal

387
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,040
with that thing if I'm
ever gonna capture it.

388
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,710
- That's suicide.
- Tell me about it.

389
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,002
I have an idea.
You're gonna hate this idea but...

390
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,743
Tell me. Anything. Right now.

391
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,880
All right.
I say we ask Leon for help.

392
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,333
- No, no!
- Why? Sam!

393
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,620
We wants to help us.
He knows things.

394
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:56,272
- He's an escaped soul, too.
- You brought him?!

395
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,103
What? He waited in the car,
he's fine.

396
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,513
Listen, listen, Leon.

397
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,440
Leon, just tell him
what you told me. Go.

398
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,643
I was just saying,
I think I know this "butcher" guy.

399
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,733
He used to hang with
some friends of mine.

400
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,650
Right, right.
All the bazillio of people in hell,

401
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,742
and you knew this guy.
The one guy we're looking for.

402
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:13,101
Sam, I can tell you're
under a lot of stress,

403
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,993
and that must be
difficult for you--

404
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,121
Stop talking!
Why do you listen to this guy, huh?

405
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,872
Why? Do you have a
better plan, Sam?

406
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:21,461
Sam, maybe we should really
consider letting him help us.

407
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,903
I mean,
maybe he really is rehabilitated.

408
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,531
- Man, come on.
- Even god forgives sins.

409
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,632
I mean,
and if you're truly repentant.

410
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,081
If you're truly changed,

411
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,052
I mean, is it fair that you
spend an eternity in hell?

412
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,211
I can't believe--

413
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,670
I can't believe this.

414
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,251
Leon has to go back to hell.
Okay? Period.

415
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:42,922
Excuse me! Hi!

416
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,312
I need somebody to take this soul!
Can you, uh--

417
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,890
Can you send someone up please?

418
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,510
No? No, hey, listen.

419
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,901
I need--I need somebody
to take this soul.

420
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,321
I'm gonna kill him!
Can you get the devil for me please?

421
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:54,911
I just need to
talk to the devil.

422
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,441
What are you doing? No.

423
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:00,872
Have ever you thought about
some anti-anxiet medications,

424
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,242
Sam, or yoga,
or maybe journaling?

425
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:04,932
- I mean, that's--
- Shut up.

426
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,051
What the...

427
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,840
Well, don't look so surprised.

428
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,981
You're the one that
wanted to talk to me.

429
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:28,683
Can you-- Can you go?

430
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,851
Oh, please with the modesty.

431
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:32,973
I'm like a doctor, Sam,

432
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:35,270
it all looks like
you awe meat to me.

433
00:22:43,577 --> 00:22:46,571
Hey, listen, as a friend,
I got to tell you,

434
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,200
you're losing it, man.

435
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,663
Take him to hell.
Please. Take him away.

436
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,132
There's nobody down
there to give him to.

437
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,972
You just have to wait
until Halloween's over

438
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,002
like everybody else.

439
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,371
Just one more day.

440
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:01,050
Well, can't you just hold
on to him then till then ?

441
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,311
- What's the big rush?
- He won't stop talking.

442
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,853
He's making me fight
with my friends.

443
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,732
I just--I really
need him to go away.

444
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,052
How's the girl?

445
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,473
- She's not talking to me.
- That's what I thought.

446
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:13,311
Sam...

447
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,982
if I can impart to you
one piece of knowledge,

448
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,351
just one kernel of truth

449
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,572
that I've gleaned over the
entirety of my existence,

450
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,021
it would be this:

451
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:24,780
Betrayal is the defining
trait of humanity.

452
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,861
Your friends will
always let you down.

453
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:29,991
The girl will always leave.

454
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,870
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

455
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:34,911
And your so-called friends
are proving my point.

456
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,291
You're not angry at Leon.

457
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:40,251
You're just upset
because you're realizing

458
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,212
the weakness of your species.

459
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,290
The most untrustworthy,

460
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,883
unreliable creatures
on this earth...

461
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,590
except for bears.

462
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,840
I know this is a hard
lesson for you to take,

463
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,572
and I'm sorry I have to
be the one to teach you.

464
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,232
But it's best you
understand now.

465
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:02,103
You know, in a way,

466
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:05,272
I'm the most trustworthy
person you know.

467
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:07,442
And that's just sad.

468
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,450
No.

469
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,660
Goody. Midnight.

470
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,780
Happy Halloween.

471
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,831
Happy Halloween!

472
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,171
Scare up some
savings at the Bench.

473
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:24,091
You want a scare--no,
you don't want to scare up...

474
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,342
- Hey, Andi.
- Hey.

475
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,260
- You on break?
- Uh, no.

476
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:29,773
Ted wants you to go
to the loading dock

477
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:31,352
when you're done here to
help with a shipment.

478
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,180
Ok. Great.

479
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,511
Wait! Uh...

480
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,770
Are you going to any
Halloween parties tonight?

481
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,001
'Cause I was thinking...

482
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,353
You know, I think that

483
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:40,732
we should just talk
about work stuff. Only.

484
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:42,851
From now on.

485
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:46,481
Uh, yeah. Yeah, great. Yes.
Let's talk about work.

486
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,372
Tonight, have a couple beers.
I can practice

487
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:50,372
my sales pitch on air
conditioner filters.

488
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,582
I think it might change the
way you look at the world.

489
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,163
No, Sam.
Work talk should stay at work.

490
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,491
Because those are
the new rules.

491
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,662
I... I think those
rules are stupid.

492
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:03,121
Ok. Well...

493
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:05,882
It's not about what
you think, Sam.

494
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:08,960
Why not?

495
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:12,131
Andi! Why not?!

496
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:28,190
Son of a bitch.

497
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:31,572
Sock! Leon's gone! He got out!

498
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:35,572
Ok, ok. Don't be mad.
All right?

499
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:37,200
Hands up.

500
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:44,872
Hi, Sam. Did I scare you?

501
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:46,463
Say him you're sorry.

502
00:25:46,757 --> 00:25:48,423
I'm sorry.

503
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:50,751
I'm here to help.

504
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,261
Take it easy! Hey! Guys, guys!

505
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,272
Everything's cool here.
Everything's cool.

506
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,112
No, no everything is cool!
What is wrong with you?

507
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:02,433
Sam, I said don't be mad.

508
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,321
And I said,
do not to touch him!

509
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,413
See, guys, when you play the blame game,
nobody wins.

510
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,991
Stop, stop,
stop with the stupid therapy crap, ok?!

511
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,522
Sam, he is trying to help us.

512
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,191
Ok, Sock, Sock, my man.

513
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,200
Listen, I am
Sam's responsibility.

514
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:17,783
Hey, you know what?
How about-- how about

515
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:20,573
- I prove myself to you?
- How are you going to do that?

516
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,893
Well, you know,
this guy that you're after,

517
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,252
mainly attacks at night.

518
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:27,420
My theory is,
he's a day sleeper.

519
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:30,630
- So?
- So, you find him during

520
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,023
the day when he's sleeping,
the element of surprise.

521
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:34,301
Boom, you've got him.

522
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:36,610
And you know what?
If I'm wrong, if I'm wrong,

523
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,993
I'll go get back in
that vessel myself. Ok?

524
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,051
No complaints,
and if I'm right...

525
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,853
Well, we're work out,
you know, what my reward is.

526
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:52,271
I'm bringing the vessel.
One stupid move

527
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:54,122
and you're going
back inside. I'm...

528
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:56,150
Let's go for a ride.

529
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:02,082
So... you guys been
friends a long time?

530
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,542
Guys, this makes me sad.

531
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:10,230
I feel like I'm the source
of all this conflict.

532
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:12,843
Can you please
just stop talking?

533
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,642
You know, I just--I just feel like--oh,
here it is.

534
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,632
It's coming up right up here.

535
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:19,301
A chinese restaurant?

536
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,141
The soul is at a
chinese restaurant?

537
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,263
It's not that easy.

538
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,950
I mean, I got to, you know,

539
00:27:24,147 --> 00:27:26,032
talk to my people,
find out where he is.

540
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,320
And--and, um...
I should probably go in alone,

541
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,653
you know,
being seen with hell's bounty hunter

542
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:32,730
might be a little bad
on my street cred.

543
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,903
You understand?
Right? All right.

544
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:40,361
Hey, Leon, grab me some mu shu,
will ya? Leon!

545
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,660
Never mind!

546
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,043
I'll just starve.

547
00:27:57,216 --> 00:27:59,011
This is ridiculous.
I'm going in.

548
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:00,683
No, no, no, no, no, hey!

549
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:02,403
Listen, if he wanted to escape,

550
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,531
he would've as soon as I
let him out of the vessel.

551
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,942
Just sit tight.
He's trying to help us. Trust me.

552
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,821
No, Sock.
Clearly, I can't trust you.

553
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,140
Why--why will you not
just give him a chance?

554
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,912
You didn't let him out
to give him a chance.

555
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:14,703
You let him out because
you thought he was funny.

556
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,533
All right, ok, maybe that did

557
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:18,663
play into my decision on that,
all right?

558
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,710
But I just think--
no, Sock, don't think!

559
00:28:20,745 --> 00:28:22,362
Ok? You never think!

560
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,881
You play with a hula doll
and almost get us killed!

561
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,633
You spend more energy
trying to fit 75 gumballs

562
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,583
into your mouth than help me!

563
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:30,502
It's not cute anymore, ok?

564
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,131
It was a hundred gumballs.

565
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:38,672
100.

566
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:44,931
Oh, god. Leon needs a nap.

567
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,510
Where's the butcher?

568
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:50,683
Uh, oh.
You know how to get to the pleasure pit?

569
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:52,850
- The strip club?
- Yes, sir.

570
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,483
I got a hot tip.

571
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,363
Oh, I hate the way you squeak

572
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:58,120
through your nose
when you breathe.

573
00:28:58,366 --> 00:28:59,540
The stuff you put
in your hair makes

574
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,152
you smell like a pixie's ass.

575
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,672
Your mutant pinky toe.
Your one bushy eyebrow.

576
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:04,673
I hate the way you put
ketchup on macaroni and cheese

577
00:29:04,706 --> 00:29:06,032
everytime you eat it.

578
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:08,742
Oh, and you wear mandles.

579
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:12,003
You said the mandles were ok.

580
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:13,581
I lied, Sam.

581
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,541
Mandles are never okay.
I was being nice.

582
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:19,342
Hey, guys.

583
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:23,092
Guys, you got one more stop.

584
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:24,762
We are really close,

585
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:28,100
and, oh, um,
could we drop off Cinnamon?

586
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:30,352
- Her place is on the way.
- Hi, guys.

587
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,622
You know, I think I'm gonna
catch the next soul on my own.

588
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,051
I think that's a great idea.

589
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:42,823
Good.

590
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:43,902
Good.

591
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,412
Ohh. Oh, yeah, hey.
I got a line on him.

592
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,251
Bring the vessel.
It's going down.

593
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:03,342
- Well, we're here.
- Are you kidding me?

594
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:06,021
You took us all over town
to bring us back here?!

595
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,652
I told you,
I had to talk to some--

596
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:10,180
We've already been here, Leon!
We know this place.

597
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:12,891
I am such an idiot!

598
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,313
Follow me.

599
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,993
Ha ha! Boom!

600
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:28,790
How'd you know
about this place?

601
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,202
I told you. I know people.

602
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:34,330
Oh, man. He's there.

603
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,223
All right. Let's do this.
Do you have a flashlight?

604
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:38,461
Of course.

605
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:47,433
Dude, what are you doing?

606
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,512
This is not about you, Sock.

607
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:53,101
So, I'm still going to hell
after all this is over?

608
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:54,832
Leon, put the gun down, man.

609
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:56,701
You know I have to
send you back, Leon.

610
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,231
Ok. Hand over the vessel.

611
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,610
- What?
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

612
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,191
- This is nuts. Ok?
- Hand it over!

613
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:13,701
And now, get in the hole.

614
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:18,040
- That thing will kill us, Leon.
- No, not you.

615
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,790
Just the bounty hunter.

616
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:22,641
- Leon, you don't want to do this.
- I know I don't.

617
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:25,132
That's why I'm going to
let dog boy do it for me.

618
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:28,010
Sock, come on,
stop messing around.

619
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:29,730
Listen, did you really
think I was going

620
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:32,523
to let you put my best friend
down that hole by himself?

621
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,853
What are you doing?

622
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,830
No, if Sam goes in,
I'm going in.

623
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:37,811
- Sock, don't.
- Sam, just stop.

624
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:41,522
Sock, that is...

625
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,480
That's a really
beautiful gesture.

626
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:50,203
You're really decent, but...
really stupid.

627
00:31:50,498 --> 00:31:52,282
- All right, ok.
- Ok.

628
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,660
Take it easy.

629
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:00,581
Boy, my therapist...

630
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,172
is going to be really
disappointed in me.

631
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,311
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna hug you, ok?

632
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,561
- Yeah, ok.
- Like a man hug?

633
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:22,902
Yeah, that'd be nice.

634
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:27,443
- Sock?
- Yeah?

635
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:29,993
What are you--
are you feeling my ass?

636
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,990
- No. No.
- What are you doing?

637
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,952
There's something
in the backpack.

638
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:41,212
Do you think it'll
work on that thing?

639
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:43,330
Ahh! I don't know!

640
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,330
Let's chuck it, chuck it!
Throw it!

641
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:56,842
Sock! Are you all right?

642
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:57,930
Sam!

643
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:01,770
Sam!

644
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,441
- Sock?
- Yeah!

645
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,230
I'm fine. I found the vessel!

646
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,031
Throw it! Throw it to me!

647
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:19,241
Sam!

648
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,043
Sock!

649
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,833
Spike! Good dog!

650
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:25,633
Sam!

651
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:50,281
Oh, god!

652
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,652
That was incredible!

653
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,281
Holy.

654
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,071
That was too close.

655
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,492
Are you ok?

656
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,162
Oh, it's just a flesh wound.

657
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:03,793
You?

658
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,711
I think so.

659
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:10,183
I'm really glad you didn't
get eaten by the dog monster.

660
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,552
Yeah.

661
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,550
I'm glad you didn't get eaten.

662
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,291
All right.
Let's get out quickly.

663
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,930
Come on.

664
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:27,311
What are you doing carrying me?

665
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:30,522
I tell you,
as soon as I get my leg sewn back on,

666
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,251
I am treating you to a
big frosty beer product.

667
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:35,241
Wait. What about Leon?

668
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:36,790
Don't worry about that guy.

669
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,840
I know exactly where
that little traitor is.

670
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:40,083
So my father says,

671
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,672
"why can't you act be
more like your brother?"

672
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,751
Which that--ohh.
That just hurt. You know?

673
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,880
That hurt because...

674
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,960
my brother ends up
being an opium addict,

675
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,353
so, you know,
that didn't work out very well for him.

676
00:34:54,388 --> 00:34:56,430
Plus, every time--

677
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,312
Hello?

678
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:04,562
Oh, no. Ok.

679
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,580
Security says someone is
trying to break into my car.

680
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,023
Let me just check on it.

681
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,613
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
No rush.  No rush.

682
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,662
Guys! Guys! Hey!

683
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,080
Guys, guys!

684
00:35:22,415 --> 00:35:23,870
Hey! Oh, wow!

685
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:25,952
Oh, you're alive! That's great!

686
00:35:26,297 --> 00:35:27,793
How's therapy, Leon?

687
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,172
Therapy? Uh... it's a process.

688
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:32,211
Huh. Process. Yeah.

689
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,953
You got a lot of issues, man.

690
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,210
I do, I do!

691
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,013
You know, and it's weird,

692
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,722
because I'm genuinely--
I'm genuinely happy

693
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:41,523
that all of you guys are alive.

694
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,432
Then, you know, I'm sad

695
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,851
because I'm going back to hell.

696
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:49,692
So I'm carrying around all
these conflicting emotions.

697
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:52,660
I'm carrying around seven stitches.
I wonder what's worse.

698
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:54,110
Oh, yeah. I guess--

699
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:56,990
Not this time, bro.

700
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:58,571
Good one.

701
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,111
Ok.

702
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,133
Here's how it's going to play,
all right?

703
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,410
You let me go,

704
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,913
and I don't blow your
friend's face off.

705
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,083
You're not going
to do that, Leon.

706
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:13,133
You couldn't do it before.
And you're not going to do it now.

707
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:17,050
You've been going to therapy.
Working hard on yourself.

708
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,560
You really want your
therapist to come in here

709
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,493
and find two dead
bodies on the floor?

710
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:23,641
Oh! Sam.

711
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:26,310
Put the gun down, Leon.

712
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,563
You're not that person anymore.

713
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,990
Yeah, ok. You're right.

714
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,452
You got me.

715
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,171
I'm sorry. I didn't--

716
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:56,313
I didn't really want
to blow your face off.

717
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,633
No problem.

718
00:36:57,807 --> 00:36:59,313
I did really want to
break your wrist though.

719
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:01,220
Still might.

720
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:04,380
I'm starting to think I
need the structure of hell

721
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:05,900
for a little while longer.
You know?

722
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:07,610
I'm gonna work on myself
down there for real.

723
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:08,862
Maybe go freudian this time.

724
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:11,543
Five sessions a week.
I'm gonna make you proud, guys.

725
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:13,233
We'll miss you, Leon.

726
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,023
Shh. It's our turn.

727
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:20,942
Hey, Gladys, you look... rough.

728
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,573
Good vacation?

729
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,742
We party hard in
the underworld.

730
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,333
Oh, woman, please.

731
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:28,121
We need to party together.

732
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:32,542
Place the vessel on the mat.

733
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:34,373
Yeah, um...

734
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,633
Can you take good care of it?

735
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:39,591
Or that, either way.

736
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,632
This is fairwell!
And not good-bye!

737
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,190
I made a mistake.

738
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:56,251
I totally admit that,
and I have apologized for that,

739
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,860
- on numerous occasions.
- Sam--

740
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,362
I'm not finished.

741
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,570
You and I started
out as friends,

742
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,411
and even if you don't think it was real,
I did.

743
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:06,952
I still do.

744
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,702
So you have to forgive me,
because one mistake

745
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:11,881
is not enough to just
throw everything away.

746
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,911
Everybody screws up.
I will, you will,

747
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:17,042
and I'll probably,
definitely do it again.

748
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:21,303
But I miss what we had and I'm
not gonna let it go that easily.

749
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:22,670
So...

750
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,420
You practice that speech?

751
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:27,971
Yeah, I did. In my car.

752
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,601
- Good acoustics.
- It was good.

753
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,481
You usually don't take
a stand like that.

754
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,233
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

755
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,151
You deserve better.

756
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:46,321
Good, great!

757
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,260
I got to be honest with you.

758
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:50,282
I was completely miserable.

759
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:55,000
I just can't stand being in a fight.
I'm so bad at it.

760
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:57,712
I don't know, you're

761
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,493
pretty effective with the
whole silent treatment.

762
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,620
Yeah, but I have a
stomachache all day.

763
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:05,383
So...

764
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,393
What should we do?

765
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:10,391
We do what friends do.

766
00:39:11,146 --> 00:39:12,513
We, um...

767
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,060
Get a beer after work tonight?

768
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:18,271
Ok.

769
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,480
Yeah, that sounds really good.

770
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,272
All right.

771
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:25,191
Yeah, all right.

772
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:27,493
Yes!

773
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,373
- Hey!
- You look happy.

774
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,080
Oh, I am. Halloween is over.

775
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,431
My demons are back in hell
torturing the damned.

776
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,113
All is right with
the underworld.

777
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:42,810
All right.
Is this gonna take long?

778
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:42,972
Ted wants me to get back,

779
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:45,883
take care of some
thanksgiving stuff.

780
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,603
I just wanted to see
my favorite employee.

781
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,233
You know,
you were the only one of the lot of them

782
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,511
who actually did his
job these last few days.

783
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:53,391
I'm touched, Sam.

784
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:54,850
Great.

785
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,061
Why don't you and I go out
on the town tonight? Huh?

786
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:02,310
- We'll get a limo.
- Can't. I've got plans with Andi.

787
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,943
Andi who isn't
talking to you? Andi?

788
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,531
She is now.

789
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,532
All right. Tomorrow night then.

790
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:12,450
Meeting Sock. Yeah.

791
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:15,753
All that crap you said about
humanity and betrayal and stuff?

792
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:18,210
You're totally
wrong about that.

793
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:20,211
- Am I?
- Yeah.

794
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:22,142
You are really negative,
you know?

795
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,602
It warps the way
you see the world.

796
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:25,022
You should think
about that a little.

797
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,303
Maybe...

798
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,510
talk to
somebody. Professionally.

799
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:32,512
Anyway, I'm gonna go.
Good talk.

800
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,853
Sam, I invented therapy.

801
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,811
Ok?

802
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:40,940
So that the wicked could
justify their actions.

803
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:44,662
I'm starting to be
able to figure out

804
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,322
when you're lying, as well.

805
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:51,160
Thanks to Raceman
for the transcript.
