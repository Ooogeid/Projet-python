1
00:00:01,753 --> 00:00:04,041
You know what? I'm thinking of
getting rid of my cell phone.

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:05,374
I gonna go a Blackberry?

3
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:08,171
I'm gonna go old school pager
and pay phone.

4
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:10,549
What? You selling dimebags out
of your mother's car again?

5
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,423
I'm sick and tired of people being able
to reach me whenever they want.

6
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:16,976
You know, it's like, " I wanna talk
about. "I have a medical emergency."

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,942
I don't care? I just want to get off
the grid for a while. Crazy-guy style.

8
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,371
All right,
I'll catch you guys back at the house.

9
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:31,366
What the hell? Where am i?

10
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:41,243
Great. No. This is just great. See, I
was supposed to be getting a hot stone

11
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:43,344
massage but instead, I'm with my buddy.

12
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:46,758
Wonderful.
The devil brought us here, you idiot.

13
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:49,278
"Idiot." Nice.
Real mature, bro.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,776
You're short.

15
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:53,438
Maybe next to a weird
frankenstein monster like you.

16
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:55,462
Yeah, what are you? Like 5'4", 5'5"?

17
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:58,930
All right, fellas. Take it easy.
Just take it easy.

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,961
Everybody just... breathe.

19
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,903
Yeah, would you look at that?

20
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:09,478
Makes me sick.
All the co2 spewing into the air,

21
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:11,954
polluting our planet,
choking our beautiful mother earth.

22
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:15,236
Did you know that global warming is
the biggest threat facing us today?

23
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,123
Really?
You care about global warming?

24
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,740
Yes, I care.
'cause it can destroy our planet.

25
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,565
And if that happens,
that jackass upstairs

26
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,269
can count all the casualties as
innocents.

27
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:28,256
That means I get any
of their souls. Zero.

28
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,927
So yeah, man. I'm goin' "green."

29
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,958
You want me to start driving an electric
car? You just say it. I'll do it.

30
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,777
You know what I would really love?
Is if one of you would step up

31
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,712
and prove yourselves worthy
of being my second in command.

32
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,637
OK. But I can see that's not possible.
So, since time is of the essence,

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,681
we're going to have a little contest.

34
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,661
2 vessels.

35
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,154
One escaped soul.

36
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:55,697
The first one of you who brings
this guy back to me in hell

37
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,598
will become my right-hand man...

38
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,745
My human representative in this realm,

39
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,263
serving at my side
as we create hell on earth.

40
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,241
The loser, however, will be cast out.

41
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:13,605
No financial support,
no clothes, no car.

42
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:17,240
Just an eternity of endless
toil as one of my minions.

43
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,433
Put quite simply,
your life will be garbage.

44
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,214
My life is already garbage.

45
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,875
Well then we'll just have to
find a way to make it worse.

46
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,120
Good luck, my sons.

- What?

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:49,336
I don't care what I have to do to win.
But I am going to catch this soul.

52
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:52,159
- I deserve to be by dad's side.
- I couldn't agree more.

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,874
No. No. Seriously. I want you to win.
I'll even help you if you want.

I don't know what mind games you're
playing, but I'm not buying it.

55

One more thing.

56
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:10,642
- What the hell man?!
- Ass-whooping Morgan style.

57
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:12,614
Believe.

58
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,085
Jelly is Jelly whether
it's grape or cherry.

59
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,044
- But I don't like cherry.
- I just.

60
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:24,439
Why is there a small
Mexican lady in our kitchen?

61
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,226
It's my grandmother.
Also, she's not Mexican.

62
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,654
- What, but you're...
- Not mexican either.

63
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,881
You're not? So what are you?
What are you, black?

64
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:41,163
Ethiopian? You're not asian, that's out.
Don't tell me...

65
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,157
American samoan!

66
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,770
We've been friends for how long
and you don't know I'm Puerto Rican?

67
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,469
Benjamin, I don't see colors, all right?

68
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,154
No seriously, I don't.
I'm red-green colorblind.

69
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:53,196
It's called dichromacy.
It's very painful for me.

70
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:56,206
So what it boils down to is that,
no I can't ever be a jet fighter pilot,

71
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,365
but yes, I can have a commercial
fishing license. And that's good.

72
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:01,140
But it's no jet fighter pilot.

73
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:05,185
Look at all the junk food
I found in the fridge.

74
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,563
- You eat all wrong.
- How you doing, grandma?

75
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:11,050
You rember Sock?

76
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,469
Good to see you too.

77
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:19,271
I'm going to plant some veggies
so you can eat like men.

78
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:22,332
How do you expect to find a decent girl

79
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:24,905
when you don't take care
of yourself, Benjamin?

80
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:28,951
Actually Benjamin has a pretty hot thing
going with a nice young lady named Nina.

81
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,754
My personal shopper.

82
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,669
- Thank you, Sock.
- Sure.

83
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,348
Nina's my personal shopper.

84
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,703
She helps get me my hats and shoes,
assorted menswear.

85
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:39,394
What did you say you were going
to plant back there, grandma?

86
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:42,252
Because I'm actually
into eggplant myself.

87
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:45,261
Maybe you could take
a look at the garden

88
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,816
and see if maybe we can make
a nice eggplant plant plant.

89
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,668
Maybe.
Vamanos, chico.

90
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,607
Don't forget You have your cousin's
confirmation party tomorrow night.

91
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:02,509
I hate Hector, grandma.
But I will be there.

92
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,568
What's up?

93
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,083
You don't want grandma to
know you're dating Nina?

94
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:10,511
The woman can see evil, Sock. See it.

95
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,593
Remember knew Sam
something to do with the devil?

96
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,555
You don't think she'd
figure out Nina's a demon?

97
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,975
Yeah, probably. But

98
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,578
maybe she'd be proud that her
grandson is railing a hot demon.

99
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:20,811
A demon who is way out of his league,
I might add.

100
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,478
- She would disown me.
- That seems a bit much.

101
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,026
But I do know how you
mexicans have a spicy temper.

102
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,160
OK. So we're all set.

103
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,029
Congratulations.
Welcome to the Workbench team.

104
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,866
And this is for you.

105
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,535
Thank you so much.
This is such a blessing.

106
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,766
And let me promise you,

107
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,557
i'm gonna work my sack off.

108
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,142
I was thinking that maybe we could drive
the cemetery tomorrow and look for Alan.

109
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,085
I'm working a double shift tomorrow.

110
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:11,464
Well, i'm giving you the day off.

111
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,128
- What?
- No it's just...

112
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:19,451
I seriously doubt Alan's gonna
help me get out of my deal.

113
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,015
He's too afraid of the devil.

114
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,708
It's worth a shot, right?

115
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,384
Yeah, I guess it is.

116
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:29,080
OK, well, I think we should
pretend to be mourners.

117
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,916
'cause then it's less
conspicuous that way.

118
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,005
And there's a funeral
we can hit at 4:00.

119
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:34,449
We're crashing a funeral?

120
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,485
Yeah, don't you want us
to get back together?

121
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,850
- I do.
- OK. Good.

122
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,337
- OK. So how we gonna do this?
- I think we should split up.

123
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:47,016
Ben, why don't you take the funeral?
You can keep a lookout from there.

124
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:49,630
Me and Sock can pretend to be
mourning at grave sights and,

125
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,998
I don't know,
why don't you go back to the work-shed?

126
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,464
Actually, Andi, I think maybe
I better handle the funeral.

127
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:55,143
Why?

128
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,926
It's going to require some real acting.

129
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:59,321
And I just don't think
you have the chops, Benji.

130
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:01,248
I find you to be over-the-top.

131
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,420
Hey, go big or go home, dawg.

132
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,904
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

133
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,103
So, do you like funerals or...?

134
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,375
How'd you know her?

135
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,267
She was my high school english teacher.

136
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:30,713
Same.

137
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,932
God, what I wouldn't give to be
sitting in her classroom one more time.

138
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,701
You know, just reading, learning.

139
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:38,798
Reading.

140
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,172
I don't know if it'll help

141
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,961
but me and some other students
are having a candlelight vigil.

142
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,789
- You should come.
- Definitely! That'd be awesome.

143
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:50,183
I mean, yeah. Yeah. Yes.

144
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:53,053
That will be very sorrowful.

145
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,050
Alan! Hey, wait! Wait!
Hold on! I just wanna talk!

146
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,561
There he is!

147
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,238
It's OK.

148
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,905
It was her time.

149
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,437
- She was only 46.
- Shut up.

150
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,323
You know what I mean.

151
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,836
By those who loved her.
A prayer frompsalms.

152
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,450
"For we know that neither death,
nor life, nor angels...

153
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,266
"nor any other creature...

154
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,310
"Shall be able to separate us
from the love of god...

155
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,875
Which is in Christ Jesus."

156
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,112
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just boys being boys. Right?

157
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,167
Read the...

158
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:11,567
Read the Bible.

159
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:16,260
Hey, sorry. It was a
really powerful service.

160
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,061
- How's it going?
- He won't talk.

161
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:23,211
Well, maybe he just needs
a little bit of encouragement.

162
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:33,492
Know where we are, Alan?
At the track. Look familiar?

163
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,579
We know you were
a gambling addict, Alan.

164
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,364
And you're out of hell
on a technicality.

165
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,675
So if you sin once you'll
be sent back immediately.

166
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:43,616
Now if I remember correctly,
gambling is a sin.

167
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,523
So here's the deal.

168
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:48,713
You tell us how you got out
of your deal with the devil or

169
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,558
we open this door and we leave you here.

170
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,662
Now, maybe you'll march on home
to your little cemetery

171
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,527
there and everything's hunkydory.
But maybe-just maybe.

172
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,575
You take this fresh $100 Bill I got
right here and these racing forms

173
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,008
hop on in there and see how
the ponies are running today?

174
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,015
Place a couple bets like
the good old days, whipperoo!

175
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,715
Guys, this is not cool.
All right? Just take me home.

176
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,684
You sure? Because the races are
gonna start any minute now.

177
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:13,987
- Please, I'm serious.
- They got slot machines and Keno.

178
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,655
Wait, guys, guys. Wait.

179
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:19,199
- Video poker, scratch-offs, twinquin...
- Sock, stop.

180
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,997
Just let me bet this race!
Just let me bet this race!

181
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,969
I need someone to bet $100
on the sixth horse to show.

182
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:29,115
It's a lock! Someone help me out here!

183
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,161
Why are you people ignoring me?!

184
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,637
Hey, guys, thanks for the impromptu
torture session.

185
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:45,552
- It's a great way to break up the day.
- Sorry to bother you.

186
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,558
If you just told us what we needed
to know, we would leave you alone.

187
00:10:48,744 --> 00:10:50,531
- Not possible.
- Why not?

188
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:53,625
'cause if I talk to you,
i'll be back on the devil's radar.

189
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,495
And he'll be trying to tempt me
back to hell, non-stop.

190
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,488
Although going back

191
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:01,539
to hell would be better living
cooped up on this little postage stamp.

192
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:04,140
Must be tough.

193
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,761
What choice do I have?

194
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,003
I brought Vietnamese food.

195
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:21,911
I thought maybe we could go
watch a movie, flying later?

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,675
- Yeah. Great. Thanks. I...
- You going somewhere?

197
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,717
Got on your going-out chain.

198
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,772
I have to go to my little
cousin's confirmation.

199
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:33,148
And I was gonna invite you, sweetie,

200
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,318
but you know, everyone's
gonna be speaking spanish,

201
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,317
there'd be all these strange
people to meet.

202
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,186
I knew you'd hate it.
It'd be wicked boring.

203
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,186
That sounds like fun.
I'd love to go.

204
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,286
That's really sweet, thank
you. Really. But it's OK.

205
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,512
- Do you not want me there?
- I do, it's

206
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,880
just. It's not that. It's...

207
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,505
It's my grandmother. She...

208
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,642
Sort of has the eye.

209
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:58,217
The eye?

210
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,901
She can see evil.

211
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,431
And since you're a demon,
i'm not sure she'd approve.

212
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:07,481
Well, you're a grown up, ben.
Why can't you just standup to her?

213
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,478
Because she's scary.
That lady does pilates every day.

214
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,683
Her core? Right here?
The lady's rocking a sixer.

215
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,028
Is that her?

216
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:26,130
I won't be long OK?
So just stay here, relax.

217
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:30,190
Watch some Tv, do the dishes. And,
we'll talk about it later, all right?

218
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:35,712
OK. Ya Voy.

219
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,352
What are you doing?

220
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,718
What? You can't let her be bullying you.

221
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:46,652
Besides, i'm like 90% not-evil.
That's less evil than most humans.

222
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:47,831
She's gonna love me.

223
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,164
Please don't do this.
Don't do this. Don't. Don't.

224
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,478
I'm Nina.
It's so nice to meet you.

225
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,907
Abuelita, Nina's a friend of mine.

226
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,152
And she was thinking
of coming to the party.

227
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,212
That thing is not going to my party.

228
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,479
You keep her away from me.
Far away.

229
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,576
Listen. Listen. Look at me.
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,929
I'm sorry. I promise this whole
thing will work itself out. OK?

231
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,641
I'll call you when I get back.

232
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,442
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:37,145
Sorry I slapped you. It was wrong.
Even if it was incredibly satisfying.

234
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,852
So, you still up for lending
me a hand with this thing?

235
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,302
Helping me win this?

236
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,593
Cause I'm having a teeny bit of trouble.

237
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:49,827
I can't believe this.

238
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,882
Aall right, his name is Bud Brown.

239
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:56,575
Pretty bad dude.
Adultery, theft, murder.

240
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,790
Says he owned a chop shop by the piers.
Have you checked that out?

241
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,155
- Not yet.
- What about his apartment?

242
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,843
- I didn't read that far down.
- What have you done?

243
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,351
What I'm here, aren't i?

244
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,784
- What is he building in there?
- I don't know.

245
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,812
Hey, let me see your vessel.
I think it's different than mine.

246
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,328
Pretty sure they're the same.

247
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:40,367
All right, so the devil didn't
say that the winner was the one

248
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:42,921
who vesseled him, just the one
who sends him back to hell. So

249
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:45,354
I'm gonna go in there capture him.
Then I'll give you the vessel

250
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,139
you can drop it off at the DMV,
and then boom. You get the credit.

251
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:49,901
Good plan man.

252
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,816
I was just wondering if you
guys bought spare auto parts

253
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:11,461
because I have an old car I no longer
use, and it's got some good stuff.

254
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,751
- Get out.
- I don't think so, bud.

255
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,653
It's not working.

256
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:59,249
So you can get us in at 7:30, right?

257
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,527
OK. Great. But will you just make
sure that I get a window seat?

258
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,424
I was the middle the restaurant
I could just

259
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,984
Barely hear myself think.

260
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,355
No. Thank you very much.

261
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,925
All right.
See you tonight.

262
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:18,134
- You're alive.
- What the hell did you do to my vessel?

263
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:21,087
I broke it,
and I gave you a real fire extinguisher.

264
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,398
What?
Why? I almost got killed in there!

265
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:27,546
I know. I just figured once you were
gone, this whole competition

266
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,792
- would get a whole lot easier.
- Are you an idiot?

267
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,750
I don't know how I can be any clearer.
I. Don't. Want. To. Win.

268
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,035
Sticking to your story. Nice.

269
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,743
No. Morgan,
you gotta believe me. What are you...

270
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:39,790
Boring!

271
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,134
Seriously, we didn't have
any bigger globes than that?

272
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:52,806
Hey! Where you been?

273
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,647
Dealing with Morgan
and this stupid contest.

274
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,823
I'm trying to let the idiot win,
and he won't let me.

275
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,612
I wish I looked like Morgan.

276
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,429
He's such a handsome gentleman.

277
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,390
Yeah, and he has a perfect
body for clothes,

278
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,218
you know what I mean? The way
his suit hangs off his broad shoulders.

279
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,027
He's Kinda Barrel-chested, narrow waist.
And it's subtle but you look

280
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,696
closely you can notice all
the awesome muscle tone underneath.

281
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:15,175
OK, yes. He's great.
He's also incredibly lazy.

282
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:18,182
That's why I've gotta make sure he wins.
If the devil's stuck

283
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:21,376
with him for the rest of eternity, the
whole world's gonna be a lot better off.

284
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,015
What are you guys doing?

285
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,866
We have an idea about how to
convince alan to tell you the secret.

286
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,871
I appreciate the thought,
but I think alan's a lost cause.

287
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,904
We got it. Alan's sick of being
stuck at the cemetery, right?

288
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,023
But he's gotta be there because
the ground's consecrated.

289
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:40,211
What if we sent him to a city where
every inch of the ground is consecrated?

290
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,952
Yeah. Where he can actually
have a real life?

291
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,744
Where the devil couldn't find him.

292
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,482
All right, alan, we
made a little film for you. OK.

293
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,211
It's a little rough still, music
spotting's in places. But...

294
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,925
But it'll give you a good idea of how
fun life is gonna be in Vatican City.

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,241
'cause it is.
It's gonna be off the Chain.

296
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,174
So, what do you think?

297
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,862
We can help you with plane tickets,
a passport, everything.

298
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:36,934
- And in return?
- You help me.

299
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,450
You tell me what you did to get
out of your deal with the devil.

300
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:48,111
- Let's do this.
- Serious?

301
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:51,077
Yeah, I can't live like this anymore.
It's driving me crazy.

302
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,605
I'm going to leave this with you.

303
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:56,235
But if this winds up on Youtube,
I will sue your ass.

304
00:18:57,612 --> 00:18:59,330
- Have fun.
- Let's go.

305
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,193
- Has it started yet?
- Not yet. Here.

306
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,240
No need. I brought my own.

307
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,538
Hawaiian sandalwood.
It was her favorite.

308
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,155
- How you holding up? You OK?
- Doing OK.

309
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:33,371
- You?
- Well, you know, baby steps.

310
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,659
I was thinking it might be good
to do something Kinda fun tonight.

311
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,887
Shake it up. Get out
of my own head for a while.

312
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:41,119
- I could definitely go for that.
- Yeah?

313
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,358
What do you say to a little
round of bowling?

314
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:50,876
Or not. Just an idea.
Leisure activity.

315
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,032
No. It's not that. It's just,
you know...

316
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,440
She just loved bowling so much,
it wouldn't really seem right.

317
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,445
Of course, bowling.
I know what an idiot. I'm sorry.

318
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:01,897
I can't believe I forgot that.

319
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,111
When she rolled that 300 last year,
she was so proud.

320
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:08,298
I know. The elusive 3 Hondo.

321
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,600
Man, that lady could roll.

322
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:15,162
So I brought a poem.

323
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,969
I thought maybe I could read
to the gang tonight.

324
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:19,695
You should save that for thursday night.

325
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:20,874
What's thursday?

326
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:22,926
We're having a Memorial service for her.

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,972
Another one?

328
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:27,066
This one's gonna be more intimate
Just her closest family and friends

329
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,469
sharing their memories
and stories one more time.

330
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,168
- A final goodbye.
- I don't know.

331
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,817
- Maybe we can go bowling after that.
- What time does it start?

332
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,223
You see grandma out there,
planting some healthy food?

333
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,600
Don't tell her, but I'm gonna
throw those veggies in the trash.

334
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,642
Come on Chico,
let's go in the living room and wrestle.

335
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,116
Maybe this is a bad idea,

336
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:03,632
but I like your Grandson
way too much just to let this go.

337
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,503
I'm not evil.

338
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,534
You're not seeing me
for what I actually am.

339
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,540
A fallen angel.
While I may know what hell is,

340
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,315
I've also seen the highest
reaches of heaven.

341
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:17,985
And

342
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:21,320
I can tell you honestly,
that's where I'd rather be.

343
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:25,195
- Have you met St. Peter?
- I have.

344
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:26,785
What is he like?

345
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:30,846
God!

346
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,913
When you're around him, you just

347
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:36,640
you feel this incredible sense of calm.

348
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,062
It's quite amazing.

349
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,052
You're so lucky.

350
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,737
Nina, you probably
don't want to do that?

351
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:45,583
Ben, it's OK. We're fine.
We're just having a chat.

352
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:48,098
Chico. No!

353
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:54,090
Oh, my god! Abuela!

354
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,661
How's your grandma?

355
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,561
Minor heart attack.

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,846
But she's doing fine. She's gonna
be there a couple of more days, so...

357
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,099
Minor heart attack?

358
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,940
If I go out, i'm going out huge.
Double heart attack.

359
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:14,153
Left ventricle all over you.

360
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,327
Have you talked to Nina?

361
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:19,321
She flew off right after it happened.

362
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:23,266
You know, I specifically asked her not
to talk to my grandmother.

363
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,093
That I had it under control.
Did she listen to me? Not at all.

364
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:28,438
In all fairness,
the Chihuahua did attack her.

365
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:30,578
I don't know what to do.

366
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,027
What do you guys think about my pants?

367
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:38,731
- Are those pinstripe?
- Yeah, it's a very subtle stripe.

368
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,607
But still noticeable. Well played.

369
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,427
Thank you. I'm going to a memorial
service tonight. Gotta look good.

370
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,552
You still chasing
after that funeral chick?

371
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:47,915
- Persistent.
- Yeah, I know.

372
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,017
I'm gonna convince that
she's done grieving tonight.

373
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,752
I think it's safe to expect a little
tongue action after this memorial.

374
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:55,122
Maybe during.
I don't know. We'll see. Who knows?

375
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,951
I'm gonna go back to the hospital.

376
00:22:58,234 --> 00:22:59,453
Thanks, friends.

377
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,200
No problem, Benji.
Always here for ya, man.

378
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:08,208
Hi, I'm here to honor the deceased.

379
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,744
Of course. Please sign in.

380
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,640
Were you one of Mrs. Simon's students?

381
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,153
I was. Yeah.

382
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,411
But I'd like to think I taught
her as much as she taught me.

383
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:26,464
Well, I must say, her students certainly

384
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:29,246
loved her.
Please go in. Have a seat.

385
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:49,739
- How are you holding up?
- I'm pretty good. You know.

386
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,552
I'll tell you what happened.
I woke up today

387
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:54,626
and I said to myself out loud,

388
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,163
"Sock you are done mourning."

389
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:02,040
- Really?
- I did, really. Yeah, I've grieved.

390
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,185
I've just grieved so hard.
I've grieved for so long.

391
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,642
Now I have to move on.
I want to embrace life.

392
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:09,700
I want to make out
with strangers. We all should.

393
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:14,087
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

394
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:17,287
We need to put this
death behind us and live.

395
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,127
You got it.

396
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:21,838
It's what Mrs. Simons would have wanted.

397
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,542
Mrs. S.

398
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:25,603
I'm so happy I met you.

399
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,440
You're an amazing man, Sock.

400
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,100
I am. I know.

401
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,076
This is nate, my boyfriend.

402
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,401
He's really been crushed by all this.

403
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,402
Yeah. Your what?

404
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:39,926
Sock was just talking me
through my grief.

405
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,227
And it helped, it really helped.

406
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,696
Maybe you can help nate too.

407
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,438
We all really need each other right now.

408
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,439
We can pull through this.

409
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:52,500
OK. I'm out.

410
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:58,260
Excuse me. Before I begin the

411
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:02,000
remembrances,
I have a very important announcement.

412
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,440
As you know, Mrs. Simons was a
philanthropist as well as a teacher.

413
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,292
So her dying wish was to bequeath
her entire fortune to her students.

414
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:10,416
So,

415
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:14,722
all of you students who attended today's
special memorial will receive $10,000.

416
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:18,640
You will then be asked to donate that
money to a charity of your choice.

417
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,555
Any worthy charity.

418
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,120
As a way of honoring
mrs. Simmons's memory.

419
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,453
Thank you.

420
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,690
And, I'm back.

421
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:32,586
Hi. Do you have direct flights
to vatican city?

422
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:35,200
Rome's the closest?

423
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,900
Rome's good.

424
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:41,700
No, it's for a friend.
His name is Alan townsend.

425
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:46,485
Order up!

426
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:48,703
He'll call you back.

427
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:51,050
Sorry. You were being rude.

428
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,258
And given the fact
that you two let the soul go,

429
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,743
I should think you'd both be
a bit more ashamed.

430
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,202
You fellas ready to order?

431
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:02,300
- Hi. Yeah, I would love the chicken...
- He will have nothing.

432
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:07,723
I'll a cup of coffee, black, 2 sugars.

433
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,317
Dad, allow me to apologize.

434
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:13,725
You have any idea how
disappointed I am in you two?

435
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,301
I mean, to think that one day one
of you might actually help

436
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:21,240
me guide mankind
on a path to destruction.

437
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:23,414
It just simply boggles the mind.

438
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,832
- But dad, let me explain.
- No, let me.

439
00:26:25,972 --> 00:26:28,211
You know what I see
when I look at you, Morgan?

440
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:32,498
I see a big, Lazy puppy dog

441
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,011
with lazy puppy-dog eyes

442
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:38,586
and a little puppy-dog brain.
So eager to please and yet so...

443
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,181
Incapable.

444
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,142
Thank you, dear.

445
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,522
And you.

446
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:50,284
Such a whiny little baby.

447
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:53,994
You won't be laughing tonight.

448
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:56,140
When that soul finishes
what he's been working on.

449
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,288
- What's that?
- A portal

450
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:01,340
allowing his buddies,
a bunch of degenerate souls,

451
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,838
my hard-earned souls by the way,
to escape from hell.

452
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,363
He needs to be caught.
Now.

453
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,627
Whenever you're ready.

454
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:29,365
Is that really how he sees me?

455
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,864
As a big, lazy puppy dog?

456
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:38,100
- Come on, be honest, man.
- You really care what he thinks?

457
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:42,102
- Yeah. He's my dad.
- Yeah, but he's the devil.

458
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,245
He's never gonna be a real dad.
He can't. It's impossible.

459
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,331
He's all I got.

460
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:50,052
I just want to make him happy.

461
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,825
I've lived my entire life
trying to measure up

462
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,386
and then failing miserably.

463
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,002
You know, you want to do him right?

464
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:03,815
Let me help you win this. OK?
Morgan, you have to believe me.

465
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,996
I don't like working for him, I don't like
knowing him. I don't want any part of this.

466
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,136
- You being serious?
- I promise.

467
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,333
OK, good. Let's go do this.

468
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:21,824
Sorry bud.

469
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,137
We're gonna have to put an end
to your experiment.

470
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,004
Sorry boys.

471
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:32,500
You're too late.

472
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:40,353
Hurry up! Get him. Get him!

473
00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:58,581
The vessel's not working!

474
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:01,600
Not on these two.
The vessel will only work on him.

475
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:06,539
Go! I'll keep these guys busy.

476
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,916
Morgan! Run! Get out of here!

477
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:42,529
Sam, the vessel's gone.

478
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:28,913
Thank you for saving my life.

479
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:37,498
Bud-the soul.
You sent him back to hell.

480
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:40,411
You won the contest.

481
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:43,135
No. No! I...

482
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:46,029
I didn't do anything.
You did everything. I just...

483
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,391
I gave him a little push.
There's no vessel right?

484
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:51,611
I mean, there's no way to prove
which of us sent him back. Right?

485
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,516
- I guess you're right.
- You a good liar.

486
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:57,399
We'll just lie, tell the devil you won.
There's no proof otherwise.

487
00:30:57,463 --> 00:30:59,814
I can do that.
I do like lying.

488
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,756
You sure you're cool, man?

489
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:07,307
Just say you run a charity that
helps the community or something.

490
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,211
I got this.
I know a lot about charities.

491
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:11,100
Good, good, good man. Good.

492
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,902
- Hello, Mr. Wysocki.
- Hello again.

493
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,839
Hello. And you are?

494
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:23,071
This is my associate Ben.

495
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:26,588
He runs a non-profit based
organization that I'm very,

496
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:29,594
very passionate about.
I'll be donating the money to him.

497
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:34,351
- What type of charity is that?
- He reads to the blind people.

498
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:37,799
And delivers food
to hungry orphans on Christmas.

499
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:40,868
Sock, please allow me.
While it is true that I am involved

500
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,128
in various community activities,

501
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,468
the most important thing that I do
is work my laboratory.

502
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,703
You see,

503
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:53,893
how can I put this? I'm creating a
machine that will help the entire world.

504
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,297
An invention that will
help liberate mankind.

505
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:01,180
Please, do tell?

506
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:06,085
It's a straw.
A self-sucking straw.

507
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:11,252
And it will help people who
have problems using their Jaw

508
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:14,387
enjoy the wonders of using a straw.

509
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,917
- There you go.
- Sir,

510
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:22,132
I'd like to call this invention
the straw-to-matic.

511
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:34,185
A self-sucking straw?

512
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,734
OK. Sounds good to me.

513
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,540
I just needed to put something
on the form here.

514
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,889
Straw-to-matic.

515
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,577
Good. There's your money.

516
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:48,966
All the best. Thanks for everything.

517
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:51,681
And I'm sure somewhere up there
mrs. Simons is smiling.

518
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:54,440
- Yeah. Yeah probably.
- Good day to you, sir.

519
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
And to you.

520
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,502
A self-sucking straw?

521
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:05,787
How long have you been sitting
on this gold-mine, Benjamin?

522
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,640
I guess I thought about it when I was 8.

523
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,440
8? You thought about this when you were
8, you didn't tell anybody until now?

524
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:12,348
I told my mom and dad
but they didn't get it.

525
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,290
Of course not they're idiots.
Now listen to me,

526
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:16,607
we're gonna take that 10 grand
use it as seed money to build

527
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,997
something that's called a prototype.
After that happens, ka-ching.

528
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,752
What do you mean "living expenses?"

529
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,390
He's talking to Alan.

530
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,186
You want full row of seats to yourself?
You know how much that costs?

531
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:32,900
No, that wasn't part of the deal!

532
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,251
- Whatever. I'll call you back.
- What?

533
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:37,401
He has a list of new demands.

534
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,560
He's afraid of being tempted so he
wants to fly in an aisle all by himself,

535
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,807
he wants money for a one
bedroom apartment.

536
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,140
No. He can't do this.

537
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:46,461
Well he says the deal's off
unless I meet all of them.

538
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,053
We're talking thousands of dollars.

539
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:51,612
Would you-would you
excuse us for a moment?

540
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:54,078
Be right back.

541
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:56,666
Walk normal. Walk normal.

542
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:58,391
Just walk normal.

543
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:01,765
- What are we thinking?
- Honestly I'm torn.

544
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:03,011
I know, me too.

545
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:06,021
On the one hand, we got Sam's soul,
and yeah, that is important.

546
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:08,383
But then on the other hand
you got the straw-to-matic.

547
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,340
I mean, that's a straw that
sucks on your lips, Benjamin.

548
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,683
Sucks on your lips. I mean, it hurts
your Brain at how amazing that idea is.

549
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:17,435
- That's a once-in-a-lifetime idea.
- Yeah. Lightning in a bottle.

550
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,691
You know what, it's not like
Alan's going anywhere.

551
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:23,040
Not at all. But somebody could think of
the straw-to-matic beat us to the punch.

552
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,559
Here's what we do.

553
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:28,074
We make our millions and then
we help Sam deal with Alan.

554
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,897
Why is there an envelope
full of cash out here?

555
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:32,502
- That is...
- For you.

556
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,637
We wanted it to be a surprise
to help you with Alan.

557
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:37,371
How did you know about Alan?

558
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,427
Do you want the money or not?

559
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,840
Yes, thank you.

560
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,640
There he is!

561
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,026
Congratulations, man. I
knew you'd win the contest. Knew it.

562
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:57,181
Even bet my secretary that you would.
Now she owes me a dinner at Houston's.

563
00:34:57,241 --> 00:34:59,595
No, Morgan won.
He pushed the soul through the portal.

564
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,980
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Come on, Sammy.

565
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:04,936
You think I don't know how
things go down in my own house?

566
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:08,024
Enjoy it, man.
You're my second in command.

567
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,676
What the hell is going on here?

568
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,299
Well, we're celebrating Sammy's win.
Very impressive.

569
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:17,322
No. I keep telling him
that I didn't win, you did.

570
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:19,741
Hey, drop the false modesty all right.

571
00:35:20,027 --> 00:35:22,726
We all know that you wanted
this from the very beginning.

572
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:25,728
You screwed me?

573
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:28,211
You've been playing me
since the beginning?

574
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,539
No. I wasn't. I...

575
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,751
You don't have to explain
anything to him.

576
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:35,738
He's a nobody. He doesn't
even deserve your attention.

577
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:38,567
But don't you worry.
Even though you lost,

578
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:40,600
you get a nice consolation prize.

579
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,105
10 bucks and a bus pass.

580
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:45,900
Enjoy!

581
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,899
Please, I'm not taking your pity prize.

582
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,970
Really? Even after you find out
that everything else is gone?

583
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:55,474
Your keys. Your wallet. Your clothes.

584
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:57,928
Your car. Your condo. Everything.

585
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,639
You looking for these, buddy?

586
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,851
You're a dead man. Dead man.

587
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:10,816
That guy?

588
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,676
Lots of bark and no bite.

589
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:22,766
I can't believe it.
This is actually happening.

590
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:24,951
I'll call you guys when I get there.

591
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:28,899
Isn't there something
you want to tell us?

592
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,171
- Right.
- Right.

593
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,417
What most people
don't know about the devil

594
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,519
is that he can't resist a competition.

595
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:40,600
OK, so what does that mean exactly?

596
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:43,200
You know that whole devil
went down to Georgia thing?

597
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:45,488
He challenged a guy
to a fiddling contest.

598
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,000
He's so incredibly vain,

599
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,195
he doesn't think that anybody
can beat him at anything.

600
00:36:49,255 --> 00:36:52,488
- For me, it was poker.
- So, I have to beat him at poker?

601
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,600
You do what you're good at.

602
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,826
Figure out what that is
and challenge him.

603
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:01,636
However, there's one more step to get
the devil to agree to the challenge.

604
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,501
- OK. What's that?
- I can't tell you that right now.

605
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,232
- What? We had a deal!
- Look, until I'm safe,

606
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:11,873
standing on consecrated ground,
I have to keep one ace up my sleeve.

607
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:15,106
I promise you I'll call you as
soon as I set foot in the Vatican.

608
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:17,985
You have to believe me.
I want to help you.

609
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:22,175
I just wish I could be there to see
his face when you do beat the bastard.

610
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,139
Call me the second you land.

611
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,016
You believe him?

612
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,039
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

613
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:35,747
You?

614
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:37,400
Yeah, I do.

615
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,799
- For your grandma.
- Thanks.

616
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,240
How's she doing?

617
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,340
Better. Doct said it should be a couple
more days and then she can go home.

618
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,349
Ben, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

619
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,520
Sometimes when I get startled
I just lose control.

620
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:08,323
I know. It's fine. Let's just forget it
and move on all right?

621
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,532
But we still have to figure this out.

622
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,786
I mean, did you
talk to her yet about us?

623
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,652
I did. And it's handled, baby.

624
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:20,662
- Good. What happened?
- I told her I dumped you.

625
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,290
So now we can just date secretly and
see where that takes us. It's win-win.

626
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:27,540
Are you kidding me?

627
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,282
I don't have any other choice here.
What do you want me to do?

628
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,115
I want to go to the hospital right now

629
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,676
and tell your grandma that you love me,
and you want us to be together.

630
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:38,640
- You serious?
- Why not?

631
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,153
For one thing, visiting hours
are over. I couldn't get in.

632
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:42,556
Ben you could get in.

633
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,796
I don't want to put her under that kind
of stress. I mean, not in her condition.

634
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,157
- You told me she was feeling better.
- She's in the ICU!

635
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:50,300
Our relationship's in the ICU!

636
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,412
Ben, you're letting her bully you.

637
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:55,198
- And now you're bullying me.
- You're not giving me any choice.

638
00:38:55,273 --> 00:38:58,455
I just want you to be a man.
Have a backbone.

639
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,963
Backbone? -You want backbone?
How about this-it's over.

640
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,803
Don't say that unless you mean it.

641
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:09,066
I mean it.

642
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,855
You broke my heart once,
and I forgave you.

643
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:20,642
But not this time.

644
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,613
This time you're going to wish
you never met me.

645
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:30,053
Tough beat, my brother.

646
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:31,948
She's amazing woman.

647
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,996
I would kill that ass.

648
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:42,796
Alan just texted me.
His flight's about to take off.

649
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,940
I can't believe this.
I'm going to beat the devil.

650
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,400
I know.
How does it feel?

651
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:53,699
I feel like me again.
Does that make any sense?

652
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,127
Yeah. Totally.

653
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,877
I did it. I beat the devil!
I'm done!

654
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,210
Sorry.

655
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:05,178
I don't care.
It feels so good.

656
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:08,945
So what are you going to do
with your new-found freedom?

657
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:11,430
- I might learn a new language.
- Really?

658
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,196
No. Probably just gonna nap a lot.

659
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,726
Thank you so much, though.

660
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,667
- For sticking with me.
- Of course.

661
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,388
OK. Sorry.

662
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,999
Sorry, I just had to do that.

663
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,681
Yeah. Yeah. We just kissed a lot.

664
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:44,176
And I want to do it again.

665
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:46,391
Me too.

666
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,213
But, we should...

667
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,587
we should wait until tomorrow.

668
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:57,723
I'll be out of my deal with the devil.
Then we can kiss as much as we want.

669
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,900
You're right. It sounds like a plan.

670
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,104
Thank you.

671
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:11,640
Hi. This is your captain speaking.
We just got word from flight Deck

672
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:15,448
that we need to go ahead and make
an unscheduled maintenance stop.

673
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,884
We apologize for this inconvenience,

674
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,393
but the good news is, we'll
be stopping in Las Vegas!

675
00:41:22,795 --> 00:41:25,440
You will each receive
$100 in casino chips.

676
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,045
To tide you over
while we're on the ground.

677
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:32,410
So please, enjoy your time in the
gambling capital of the world.

678
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:35,788
Can I get you something to drink?

679
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,416
