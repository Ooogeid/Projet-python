1
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:51,710
 No blood --what a beautiful idea.

2
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,845
 Brother, I just found the fucking ice truck.

3
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,215
It is my new friend.

4
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,507
When he broke into my apartment,

5
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:06,204
he took some time to get to know me --

6
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:10,052
my life, my secrets.

7
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,399
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

8
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:15,807
 No shit.He's in jail.

9
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:20,119
But, see, he still owes me for two ounces
of blow,which means you owe me.

10
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,522
The coyote wanted more money,and I didn't have it.

11
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:27,365
Poor bastards --spend their life savings,get stuffed into a fish hold.

12
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:30,599
If they can't pay...they disappear.

13
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,673
Jorge Castillo --the only suspect even remotely
close to the park where yelina was supposed to drop the money.

14
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:36,683
Excuse me.

15
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:38,245
Private yard.

16
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:41,295
Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

17
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,529
American, pal,just like you.

18
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:50,376
Just like me.

19
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:51,467
CoÑO.

20
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,753
Get back in there,you Cuban piece of shit.

21
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,783
They're even better-matched than I thought.

22
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,012
Fucking animals.

23
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,403
God bless American.

24
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:04,411
No.

25
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:13,323
Taking the extra time to kill Valerie may have been ill-advised.

26
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:16,939
My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

27
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,316
But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

28
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:43,886
Life is so fleeting,so fragile,
every breath the potential to be our last.

29
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,083
You ready?

30
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:02,255
Can I have my cereal now?
We all grieve in our own way.

31
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,240
Sure.

32
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,723
I prefer t he 6-year-old approach.

33
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:10,556
Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

34
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:13,284
Well, not quite.

35
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:24,487
Hey,what about this one? I want angel cake.

36
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:27,695
It's angel food, stupid,and you don't get a vote.

37
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:29,033
It's my birthday.

38
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,172
Guys.

39
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:39,178
So how'd it go?
Bob the goldfish --may he rest in peace.

40
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,330
Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

41
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,548
Dead stuff.

42
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:45,101
I know.

43
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,264
Well, go have a seat.

44
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,890
Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

45
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:58,269
I don't get birthdays --the party, a song.

46
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,862
Celebrating another year just being alive feels forced.

47
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,536
That one.That's the one I want.

48
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,322
 Coconut it is.

49
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:10,897
I hate coconut.

50
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,009
You've never had coconut.

51
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:18,604
It's dispatch.I might have to settle for toast to go.

52
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,335
Morgan.

53
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:30,822
Sure, what's the location? I'll be right there.

54
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,228
The crime scene.

55
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,652
My crime scene.

56
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:08,384
I shouldn't have killed them both.

57
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:09,831
I didn't have enough time.

58
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:18,550
A footprint,a microscopic drop of blood
--what did I leave behind?

59
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,646
Impossible.

60
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:42,565
Nice place setting,huh? We're running her prints now.

61
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:43,941
It had to be him.

62
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,622
He's watching me.

63
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:49,640
Dex?
Good.

64
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,504
I.D.The victim.

65
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:00,544
You find anything else?
That ain't enough?

66
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:04,760
Any eyewitnesses? Just do your job.Worry about the blood.

67
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,197
You gonna answer that?

68
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,864
This tin can smells like ass.

69
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:17,552
The sooner you get busy,the sooner we can finger who did this.

70
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,407
You heard the man.

71
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:37,196
He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

72
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:41,925
He's getting back at me for not killing that security guard.

73
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:45,612
Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck killer.

74
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,205
I've got the press sniffing outside.

75
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,337
No, it's not his M.O.

76
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,351
We got an I.D.--Valerie Castillo.

77
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:52,567
Her husband, Jorge,owns the salvage yard.

78
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:53,986
Well, then,try and track him down.

79
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:56,062
Sir, we found something.

80
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:05,871
You got anything? Masuka: No bruising.

81
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,601
Nothing under her nails.

82
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,697
She didn't put up a fight.

83
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:15,665
If she was killed here,which I doubt,whoever did it was a real pro.

84
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,726
Under normal circumstances,I'd take that as a compliment.

85
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:20,678
Prints?She's clean.

86
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:23,989
This trailer --that's another matter.

87
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:28,661
I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

88
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,853
Yo, dex,I think I found something.

89
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,247
Zoom in on this,will you?

90
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,122
I'm kind of low on batteries here.

91
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,390
Dude, it'll take, like,two seconds.

92
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:43,063
Yo, what's up with you today?You're throwing off my chi.

93
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:45,240
You're not Chinese.

94
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,137
I'm not?Look, right here.

95
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:52,261
Does that look like a needle mark to you?

96
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:57,773
It's more like a bug bite,blemish maybe.

97
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:03,238
Yeah, I guess.

98
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:07,376
I'm gonna let the coroner bag her.

99
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:10,367
I'm hungry.

100
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:17,005
Oh.

101
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,507
this ain't no auto garage.

102
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,839
Oh!Oh, god.

103
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,454
Oh, I didn't need to see that.

104
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:34,384
You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?
Yeah, just not indoors.

105
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,624
Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

106
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,755
I feel a desert storm story coming on.

107
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:41,610
Digging holes for people to take a dump?That was most important.

108
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,082
I'm not really getting that.

109
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,180
It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar.

110
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,768
Everybody's shit stinks.

111
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,011
We were partners a long time.

112
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:53,914
From the looks of things,Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

113
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,754
You like the husband for this?It's always the husband.

114
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:04,942
What have you got?It looks like a phone number and a name -- mariel.

115
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,541
Call it in to Batista.He can run it down for us.

116
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,973
Sergeant doakes.

117
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:11,401
We heard movement in the trunk.

118
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,390
I got it.I got it.

119
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:20,148
Padre nuestro que est*en los cielos.

120
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:21,972
Santificado sea tu nombre.

121
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,423
Venga tu reino.H*gase tu voluntaden la tierra.

122
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,162
you all right, kid?Come on, man.

123
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:26,883
No.

124
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:27,949
Subtle.

125
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,220
Maybe you should cuff him.

126
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,156
Mi hijito,todo est* bien.

127
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,700
Te vamos a ayudar.

128
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,389
The noose is tightening.

129
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,807
This is how it ends --in the hands of a 7-year-old?Hey, deb.

130
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:08,143
I usually like kids.

131
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,494
Who's the boy?

132
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,030
All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

133
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,023
Spend enough time in a trunk,she'd look good to anybody.

134
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:21,243
Did he, you know,see anything?

135
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:23,683
I'm not sure.He's pretty out of it.

136
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,947
Social services is on the way.

137
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:30,103
You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

138
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,255
Morgan,bring some water!

139
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:34,381
 I love her.

140
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:37,987
Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

141
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:46,714
My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me,
and I can't tell a soul,especially not deb.

142
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,351
Deb,we've been through this.

143
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,648
But I have my books.

144
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:56,746
I mean,I could just stay in the car or I can walk with you guys.

145
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:59,257
I promise I'll be quiet.You won't even know I'm there.

146
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,928
The pheasants will know you're there.

147
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,490
But dexter was my age when --deb, that's enough.

148
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:05,183
The Logan's are waiting.

149
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,114
Did you pack your swimsuit?

150
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,388
Yes.

151
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:10,484
Good girl.

152
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:13,407
I want to see that back flip when we come home.

153
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:16,146
All right.Go on out to the car.We'll be there in a sec.

154
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:21,984
She does kind of have a point, dad.

155
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,984
What we do your sister can never know about.

156
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,432
Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive.

157
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:34,400
and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

158
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,860
Guys, hurry up.You're gonna be late for school.

159
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,707
I'm headed to the store.

160
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:53,079
Is there anything else you want?Balloons aren't much of a list.

161
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:54,190
It's okay.

162
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,751
It don't need that other stuff.

163
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,423
It's too expensive.

164
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:01,398
How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?It's your party.

165
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,470
You can have whatever you want.

166
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:12,768
Hello? Paul:Hey, babe, it's me.

167
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,681
Go wait in the car.

168
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:22,259
What's wrong with mom?
She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

169
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,158
Hi.

170
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:31,208
I was able to track down that name, mariel,with the number that you called in.

171
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,628
She's a Cuban refugee.She's staying with cousins.I had a cop bring her in.

172
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:36,879
Why scratch the number in the floor?

173
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,897
Next of kin,in case something happened to her.

174
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:43,287
Guys like Castillo are ruthless.They prey on families.

175
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:46,728
He was holding marieland six others captive at a salvage yard.

176
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:47,857
That explains the garage.

177
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:52,327
If the relatives don't pay the release fee,the coyote would dump their ass overboard.

178
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,479
Cocksuckers make me sick.Come on.

179
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,817
Mariel, estos son mis amigosque yo te dije.

180
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,554
Sargento doakesy la detective morgan.

181
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:05,913
Puede sentar.

182
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:10,057
Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

183
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,512
¿Cu*ndo fue la ultima vezque t?viste a Jorge Castillo?

184
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:17,448
Cuando me encerr?con los otrosdespués de bajarnos del barco.

185
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:21,210
When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

186
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,226
No teníamos comida ni agua.

187
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:28,180
Un hombre trat?de escapar.Jorge lo agarr?y lo golpe?

188
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,875
They went without food and water.

189
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,859
Some guy tried to escape,but he was beaten by Jorge.

190
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:35,326
How'd she get free?

191
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:39,494
¿Cómo escap?Alguien abri?la puertaal garaje.

192
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,189
Y nos escapamos.

193
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,167
Somebody opened the door to the garage.

194
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,824
Cuando los agarren, espero quelos hagan sufrir mucho,

195
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:56,129
especialmente esa conchaque nos trat?como perro.

196
00:14:56,866 --> 00:15:01,969
She said,"when we find them,"to make them suffer for what they did,

197
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,133
especially that conchathat treated her like a dog.

198
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,859
"Concha?Ah, got you.

199
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,476
Fuck me.The wife was in on it.

200
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,742
Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

201
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:14,881
¿Y quién era el niÑo pequeÑoque estaba con usted?

202
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,177
¿Qu?niÑo?Yo nunca vi un niÑO.

203
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,283
She never saw a boy.

204
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:30,504
No hair, no fibers,C.O.D.Exsanguination --so far, so good.

205
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:31,396
You're hovering.

206
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:32,436
Keep reading.

207
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:33,431
Wait for it.

208
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,831
This is a prelim.

209
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:38,479
I don't have time --"m" fucking 99.

210
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:44,613
Etorphine hydrochloride?An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

211
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:47,637
It causes total paralysis.

212
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:51,533
That mark on her neck kept bugging me,so I ordered up a tox screen.

213
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,748
That's it.No more doughnuts for masuka.

214
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:58,043
Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

215
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:01,018
E only way to get it is with a D.E.A.License.

216
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,651
I put a request in for the list.

217
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,779
I should have it for doakesin the morning.

218
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:09,343
Nice.

219
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:11,663
Yeah, baby.

220
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:16,497
I'm on that list,and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

221
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,857
Ticktock.

222
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:26,631
Hey, you.

223
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,218
Thank god you're there.

224
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:29,761
I really need to talk with someone.

225
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:34,722
Everything okay?Paul called after you left.

226
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:37,948
Paul? Who's Paul?My soon-to-be ex.

227
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:41,391
He's already out of jail --overcrowding.Can you believe it?

228
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,542
Every time something goes just a little bit right,something like this happens.

229
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,936
He wants to comet Astor's party.

230
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:50,406
What did you tell him?I'd have to think about it.

231
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:54,056
But even if I say "no,"he won't listen.He never does.

232
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:58,711
Can you --can you come over tonight?

233
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:01,231
I'm kind of under the gun here,big case.

234
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,832
I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.I'm sorry.

235
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:05,423
No, don't be.

236
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:08,608
Tell you what,I'll stop by if I can.I promise.

237
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,719
Okay.

238
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:12,191
I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

239
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,135
Thanks.Bye.

240
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:18,530
Check the marinas.Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

241
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,066
We'll search the house.

242
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:26,418
Where's laguerta?Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

243
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:32,043
Sketch?He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

244
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:37,306
Valerie Castillo?Sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

245
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,485
Personally,I'd shake this guy's hand.

246
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,590
Yeah, you say that now.

247
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,506
Found his passport.

248
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:59,379
God, I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

249
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,794
Well, keep searching --phone records, bank accounts,credit cards.

250
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,947
Maybe the wife got greedy,and that's why he killed her.

251
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:07,804
Maybe.

252
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,953
This morning at the salvage yard,what was that thing by the car?

253
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:19,510
What thing?Before you opened the trunk,you tried to cock block me.

254
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:21,689
I was just looking outfox my team.

255
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:23,203
I didn't see you looking outfox laguerta.

256
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,822
I would if she'd asked.

257
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:25,817
I didn't ask.

258
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:26,554
Fine.

259
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,344
Next time,just get your ass shot.

260
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:34,349
It's possible our guy left town.

261
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,574
If he even did it.

262
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:39,137
What if we have a copycat killer?

263
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:41,027
That's a bit of a stretch.

264
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:47,067
What if the person who killed Valerie Castillo was trying
to bleed her out like the ice-truck killer but didn't know how?

265
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:47,980
She wasn't a hooker.

266
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,427
She was killed someplace else and laid out in a ritualistic manner,just like all the others.

267
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:53,501
She wasn't in pieces.

268
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,200
She had cuts on her neck.

269
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,087
I'm just saying,with all the media coverage on the ice-truck killer,it's possible.

270
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,601
What do you suggest,Morgan?

271
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,111
Let me work up a profile in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

272
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,812
Fine.Whatever.

273
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,659
That's the second time you've made that face.
Who are you avoiding?

274
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,869
We got one more stop to make.

275
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,927
Nothing lasts forever.

276
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,210
Just ask a ford pinto.

277
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:39,493
Eventually,most serial killers get caught.

278
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:42,859
There's really not much of a retirement plan.

279
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:45,864
But it can't end like this.

280
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:49,195
It's too soon.I'm not ready.

281
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,208
He saw me.

282
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:25,277
What's this?You've been asking who's been calling.

283
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:26,754
My mom lives here.

284
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,183
Did you forget your laundry?

285
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:32,551
She's been on me to stop by for dinner.Now, he's the plan.

286
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,288
We go in.We eat.We out before the cheesecake.

287
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:36,117
You got it?

288
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,037
I'm, what,your exit strategy?

289
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,333
You can stay out here if you want.That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier,

290
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,858
or you can come in and have some free food.It's your call.

291
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:48,860
Shit.

292
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,735
My sisters are here, too.

293
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:57,941
Fucking family reunion.

294
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,243
This john comes out of nowhere.He's got me by the throat.

295
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:06,624
I can't reach around and get my gun,and I see he has a nipple ring.

296
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,645
I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

297
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,295
Morgan.

298
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,824
Oh, I'm sorry.Cop mouth.

299
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:17,948
We're used to it,when James graces his family with this presence.

300
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,483
Some of us don't work at a bank.

301
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:23,551
First words out of my baby brother's mouth were,"got milk, motherfucker?"

302
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:26,567
Oh, okay, now,that's enough, all of you.

303
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,960
That security guard is gonna be all right?

304
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,587
If someone did a hatchet job on me,I'd cash it all in.

305
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:32,852
Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

306
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:35,417
The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

307
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:39,121
He's just got this spirit about him.

308
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:43,679
The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck killer,and he's still hitting on me.

309
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:49,690
That's because men only think with one body part,and that one was not cut off.

310
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,401
Ma!Well, it's the damn truth.

311
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,255
Morgan, come on.We got a case to solve.

312
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:58,084
Oh, are you sure, honey?I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

313
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,134
Yeah.We're sure.

314
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:04,828
You know...I would love some cheesecake.

315
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:06,089
You can wait in the car.

316
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,116
That's your call.

317
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,550
He'll wait.

318
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:11,828
I'll help you.

319
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,632
Ooh, I'm sorry.

320
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:18,937
I wonder, in time,if they'll even remember me,

321
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,241
other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

322
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,567
I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

323
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:30,648
He is their father.They have a right to know he's been released, right?

324
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,264
Yeah, sure.

325
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,110
Even if I tell Paul not to come,he'll show up here eventually.

326
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,140
I know him.

327
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,070
Everything'sbeen going so good at work...with you.

328
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:49,095
I don't know what to do.

329
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,463
He's really got a hold on you,doesn't he?

330
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,578
Paul always had a temper,but when he was using...

331
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:03,337
he said if I left,he would find us and hurt the kids.

332
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:06,908
Somehow,I thought that by staying,I was protecting them.

333
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:13,480
Cody doesn't remember the worst of it,but Astor...

334
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:18,379
she was the one who called the police the last time.

335
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,540
She was protecting me.

336
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,532
You're not that woman anymore.

337
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,714
You're stronger than that now.

338
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:30,050
If their dad shows up,we'll deal with it together.

339
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,979
Dad's coming home?

340
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,818
Can he sleep in my room,mom?Can he, mom?

341
00:23:42,818 --> 00:23:44,522
I shouldn't even be here.

342
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:47,651
Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

343
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:50,563
Her husband was a crack head,and her boyfriend's a serial killer.

344
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,615
It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

345
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,296
Better get inside, son.Storm's on its way.

346
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,943
Why didn't you tell me what you are, dex?

347
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:17,388
Any last words?Figures.

348
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:34,494
I don't have bad dreams.

349
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,467
When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

350
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:40,033
Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

351
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:51,731
I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

352
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,180
What's happening to me?

353
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,242
If my back wasn't against the wall,I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into masuka's e-mail.

354
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:11,258
Once I got past all the porn,it was easy.

355
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:15,522
And there I am.

356
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:20,810
Dr.Patrick bateman --so wholesome, so inconspicuous.

357
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:25,589
Harry would frown upon destroying evidence,but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

358
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,745
What are you doing in here?

359
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:30,887
My computer went down.I was just checking some e-mail.

360
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,140
Can you take a look at this for me?

361
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,526
Copycat killer?I worked all night on that profile.

362
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:44,356
I'd like to give it to laguerta,but I want to make sure it's good enough.

363
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:46,400
I'm honored.

364
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:52,895
"The similar manner in which the body was displayed"suggests this killer

365
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:59,074
feels a connection"to the ice-truck killer,excited by what he's doing.

366
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:09,373
""The cut on the victim's cheek,while not fatal,"appears to be a signature of sorts.

367
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:13,260
"Because of the lack of evidence"collected from the crime scene,"

368
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,435
the suspect may be familiar with law enforcement or forensics procedure.

369
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:23,476
"Oh.Why'd you quit?You're getting to the good stuff.

370
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:28,901
Let me guess --single white male, mid-30s,
lives alone,disconnected from his emotions.

371
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,119
It's a little textbook,don't you think?

372
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,351
But it totally fits this case.

373
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,131
You're trying to make it fit.

374
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:44,040
My advice?Keep this to yourself.

375
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,786
Really?Deb, you're new to homicide.

376
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:53,301
This blows up in your face,you've given laguertathe excuse to send you back to vice.

377
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:04,198
No.I'm on to something here.I feel it.

378
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,586
Like one of your hunches.

379
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,339
Way to have my back.

380
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,972
Where's your sister?

381
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:27,765
Debra, what the hell do you think you're doing?

382
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:33,704
How did you get into my cabinet?

383
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:37,519
You hide the key in the pantry on the top shelf.

384
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:44,236
You and your brother known ever to touch my guns unless it's under my direct supervision.

385
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,627
But I was being really careful.I mean,

386
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:48,952
I was only shooting at the cans and the bottles.

387
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:52,640
And I'm really good,like dexter,and now we can all go hunting together.

388
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:55,227
I'm disappointed in you,Debra.

389
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,698
Grab your things.

390
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:06,324
Thanks a lot.

391
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:14,967
Starting this morning,we have cadets from the
academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

392
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,383
Those days I don't miss.

393
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:20,332
The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo.

394
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:26,520
Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo,
lieutenant laguertais bringing him into attempt a sketch.

395
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,358
Come on, sweetheart.

396
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:33,673
Let's take the seat belt off.

397
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,785
There you go.Come on.

398
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,443
Come on, sweetheart.

399
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,719
You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

400
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,543
Come on, sweetie.Let's go.

401
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,181
Thanks for bringing him by.

402
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,544
Hola, oscar.

403
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:55,265
¿T?quieres venir conmigo?

404
00:29:57,743 --> 00:30:01,626
Normally, I wouldn't approve of something
like this,but you've made quite an impression.

405
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:07,451
You have kids?No.

406
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:13,217
I was like him once --a stranger in a strange place,

407
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:17,779
left to grow up with strangers,all for a better life.

408
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:22,055
Well, police lieutenant --I'd say you've done okay.

409
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,955
Any luck with the family?

410
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,565
No.He talks about an uncle Roberto.

411
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:28,951
He just uses the first name.

412
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,033
Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

413
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,657
I hope so.

414
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:35,329
I hate to send another one into foster care.

415
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,211
Thank you.

416
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:40,877
Bye, sweetheart.

417
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:47,004
Meanwhile, we'll follow upon the D.E.A.Listof m-99 buyers.

418
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:52,355
That would include vets,doctors,animal control,even circuses.

419
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:54,684
Be thorough.Check everyone.

420
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:58,262
Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

421
00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:00,136
Still processing, sir.

422
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:03,571
If the husband-is a dead end,then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

423
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:07,541
Morgan, any ideas?Don't do it, deb.

424
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,713
Don't do it, deb.

425
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:13,303
The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

426
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,343
We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck killer.

427
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,487
If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

428
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:24,150
I have a profile I'd be happy to show it to you.

429
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,227
I'll be in my lab.

430
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,523
Hello, dex.

431
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,178
 Oscar...

432
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:47,681
¿el hombre que visteera como yo o m*s delgado?Mi hijito, est* bien.

433
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:53,142
Cuéntanos.

434
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:55,706
Cuéntanos lo que t?visteesa noche.

435
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,612
I'll be right back.

436
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:03,778
No.

437
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:19,334
Est* bien,me quedo aqu?

438
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,134
Rgot how much I lovedpastelitos growing up.

439
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:33,363
He just needed a little reminder of home.

440
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:36,537
I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

441
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,808
I threw up the whole damn way.

442
00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:43,925
¿Quieres m*s?Mm-hmm.

443
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:50,069
¿Cinco?Go get the artist.I think somebody's ready.

444
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,197
Save me some.

445
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:54,635
No, dice que no.

446
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:57,015
Cinco no puede.

447
00:32:57,015 --> 00:33:00,702
Pero tres, s?No es 5, es 10.

448
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:08,031
?0? Te digo que t?hablascon el seÑorcuando el venga,y entonces, s? yo te doy 10,lo que t?quieras.

449
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:09,219
20.

450
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:10,620
30.

451
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:12,996
50.

452
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:27,977
Did you thank mrs.Carroll for picking you up from school for me?

453
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:29,344
Yes.

454
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:39,050
So, what do you think?

455
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,559
Everything okay?You want to talk about it?

456
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,315
Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

457
00:33:49,315 --> 00:33:50,886
Honey, that's not true.

458
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:52,739
I spoke with their moms last week.

459
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:57,131
It's all Cody's fault.He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

460
00:33:57,131 --> 00:34:00,593
Did not!You told everyone!

461
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:12,192
I have to know.

462
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,834
Dexter.

463
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:22,607
thank god.

464
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,357
My arm's asleep.

465
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:28,406
How long have you two been like this?Half an hour.

466
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:31,425
I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

467
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:35,750
At that age,when they're out,they're out.

468
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,829
You could brush his teeth,and he wouldn't wake up.

469
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:44,919
Here.Lift up his head.I'll slide this underneath.

470
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:02,969
Oh, thanks.

471
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,562
What are you doing here?

472
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:11,127
I'm waiting on some lab work.I had some time to kill.

473
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:12,718
Go ahead.

474
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,194
We didn't get very far.He's so tired.

475
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:18,373
We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

476
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:24,421
It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

477
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,262
If you, um.

478
00:36:00,262 --> 00:36:01,762
here.

479
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:04,919
You want help or not?

480
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:10,130
I have a hair or somethings tuck on my lens.

481
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,548
You're in good hands.I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

482
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,057
Boys?Yeah.

483
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:17,541
What I really needed was tits.

484
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:19,414
I had Winnie the poohs on my bras until I was 16.

485
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:21,826
As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

486
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,622
Try not to blink, okay?

487
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:29,807
Okay, okay.I'll do it.I'll do it.

488
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:32,998
Let me ask you something.

489
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:35,419
Your brother's adopted,right?

490
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:37,650
Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

491
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,864
How did the department feel about harry getting personally involved in a case?

492
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:44,487
It didn't seem to be a problem.My parents never talked about it.

493
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,738
Oh, but still,raising a boy,it's a lot of work, no?

494
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,336
Dex?God, no.I got in more trouble than he did.

495
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:52,727
He was the perfect one.

496
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:54,640
Here, I think I see it.

497
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

498
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,536
There's the bastard.

499
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:04,086
Thanks.

500
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:12,130
Let me ask you a question.

501
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:14,809
Why do you have it in for me?

502
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,543
You're loud,you're impulsive,and you constantly question authority.

503
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:24,330
Fair enough.

504
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:28,514
I hear you have an interesting theory on --

505
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:37,645
The report on scandal-plaguedafl's transactions in Florida showed transportation depart

506
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:44,773
mentemployeesreceived more than$460 in gifts,ranging from golf balls and free dinners...

507
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:46,005
honey, what is it?.

508
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:50,382
Several local retailers in return for buying supplies worth $7,000.

509
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:56,563
Sweetie.

510
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:59,423
I'm sorry.It was an accident.

511
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:00,625
It's all right.

512
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,048
These things happen.

513
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:04,439
Go get changed,and I'll fix the bed.

514
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:18,410
Mommy?Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

515
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:58,249
It's only a matter of time before tt boy finishes telling
the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard -- me.

516
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:02,441
Once the sketch is finished,there will be no place left to hide.

517
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,199
If I want any chance of survival,I have to get rid of it all.

518
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,031
I have to let go.

519
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:50,169
Alex timmons -- sniper.

520
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:52,640
Yes, I did it.

521
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,530
Is that what you want to hear?

522
00:39:57,466 --> 00:40:00,532
Gene marshall -- arsonist.

523
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,607
Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

524
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,898
Cindy landon -- black widow.

525
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:10,371
I'll fuck you if you let me go.

526
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,256
Such fond memories of them all.

527
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:16,245
They all accepted their fate in their own way.

528
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,179
Now it's time for me to do the same.

529
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:22,311
Valerie Castillo --my last victim.

530
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,151
He's not angry.

531
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:35,324
That's not what this is about.

532
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:37,467
He's testing me.

533
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,666
I was wrong the whole time.

534
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:45,947
My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see

535
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:50,943
if I'd find my way out,if I'd fight to survive.

536
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,587
If you have a well-preserved sample,

537
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:21,521
transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy,

538
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,189
almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints

539
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:28,815
from his boat and putting them on this knife.

540
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:02,420
Just got off the phone with the FBI.

541
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,964
Now for the hard part.

542
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:06,072
I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

543
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:09,048
I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck killer list.

544
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:10,812
11 new hits.

545
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:14,107
How about we hold off till we get a sketch,take it from there.

546
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,051
I know, I know.I want to get a head start on this.

547
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:21,173
We could look these over at lunch -- my treat.

548
00:42:21,714 --> 00:42:23,334
You never give up,do you?

549
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,014
Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

550
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:31,375
Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

551
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:33,104
You held your own.

552
00:42:33,104 --> 00:42:36,229
Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

553
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:41,566
In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --Morgan tradition.

554
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:43,357
I miss that kind of stuff,you know?

555
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:44,656
I found something.

556
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:48,597
The wife's blood?You're sure?

557
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:50,784
This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

558
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,474
We check all the clothing items that come in.

559
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,469
Because of sheer volume,that takes time.

560
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:56,408
It doesn't prove anything.

561
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,790
Not by itself.

562
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,030
I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

563
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:03,793
Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

564
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:05,531
They're long and deep.

565
00:43:05,531 --> 00:43:07,237
Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

566
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,021
No shit.

567
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:11,668
The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck killer.

568
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:14,137
He was...in a hurry.

569
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:15,586
He was probably afraid of getting caught.

570
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:16,534
Most killers are.

571
00:43:16,534 --> 00:43:20,104
Except if this was a copycat,he wouldn't be in a rush.

572
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,188
He would savor his first kill.

573
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:27,521
He would control the precise moment Valerie
Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

574
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:32,675
This is all too...passive.

575
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,666
Have you completely ruled out the husband?

576
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,955
Why are you doing this?

577
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:42,114
The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

578
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:44,804
He was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left

579
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:46,547
to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

580
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:47,959
You really think it's the husband?

581
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,845
He's a deep-sea fisherman.Most know how to use a knife.

582
00:43:51,683 --> 00:43:53,093
Plus, he's still missing.

583
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:59,123
Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

584
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:02,125
I'll have them send the cadets out again.

585
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:06,517
Hey, I'm sorry.

586
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:11,241
I know how hard you worked on that profile.

587
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:14,236
No, dex, I really don't think you do sighs

588
00:44:25,786 --> 00:44:27,970
How long are you grounded for?

589
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,480
Two months.

590
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:34,615
Deb, I had to tell him.

591
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,978
No, dex, you didn't.

592
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:40,061
You could have kept your fucking mouth shut.

593
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:41,885
Dad was worried about you,and so was I.

594
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:44,572
Well, now you can spend more time together.

595
00:44:44,572 --> 00:44:46,379
I'm not stupid, dexter.

596
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:47,641
That's always what you wanted.

597
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:49,117
No, it's not.

598
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:52,293
Deb, you're my sister.

599
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:54,808
No, I am not.

600
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:56,839
And he is my father.

601
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:00,010
There are so many times,I swear, dexter,

602
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,944
that I wish he would haven ever brought you home.

603
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:08,848
Dexter,I am so sorry.

604
00:45:08,848 --> 00:45:11,870
I really, really didn't mean it like that.

605
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,584
Here.

606
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,967
I thought you might want that.

607
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,136
You're a better shot than me anyway.

608
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:05,163
Hello? Paul, hey, it's me.

609
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,819
Look,we need to talk.

610
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:08,784
Sure thing.

611
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:14,757
I know you want to see Astor,but, I mean,the kids are doing so well now.

612
00:46:14,757 --> 00:46:21,572
Maybe it would be a good idea if you don't come to the party.

613
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:23,964
She is my daughter,too, Rita.

614
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:25,283
I have every right to be there.

615
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,285
You know what?I'm sorry.

616
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:32,302
I'm sorry,but I have full custody now,
and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

617
00:46:32,302 --> 00:46:35,493
Now, I checked.The restraining order is still in effect.

618
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:38,751
If you step one foot on this property,the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

619
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:40,924
The second call is to your parole officer.

620
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:06,619
I need a sergeant.

621
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:18,288
Morgan.

622
00:47:21,843 --> 00:47:23,027
I'll be right there.

623
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:24,683
 Est* listo.

624
00:47:27,642 --> 00:47:30,413
Ya lo tir?Oscarsito.

625
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,567
Itío roberto!

626
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:38,347
The uncle called our office this morning.He lives in Tampa.

627
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:42,537
That's great.

628
00:47:42,537 --> 00:47:44,044
He should be with family.

629
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:45,978
Can I take him home?

630
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:48,967
We're good.

631
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:50,157
Mm-hmm.

632
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,717
Thank you.

633
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:56,036
Thank you for finding him,huh?He's a very special boy.

634
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,434
I know.

635
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,761
Cuídate, ¿huh?

636
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:24,582
L.T.,You need to see this.

637
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:37,310
You okay?These contacts.

638
00:48:41,762 --> 00:48:43,848
Dios míO.

639
00:48:48,815 --> 00:48:51,121
Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

640
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:56,757
The husband stashes a knife inside and lets
a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

641
00:48:56,757 --> 00:48:58,292
No more murder weapon.

642
00:48:58,292 --> 00:48:59,746
There's blood.

643
00:48:59,746 --> 00:49:02,117
Want to bet it's the wife's?

644
00:49:02,117 --> 00:49:03,593
It's always the husband.

645
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:04,466
You were right all along.

646
00:49:04,466 --> 00:49:06,497
Shake it off, Morgan.Homicide takes time.

647
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:09,012
Deb will forgive me eventually.

648
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:13,382
That's who she is --bighearted, kind,nothing like me.

649
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:15,172
Laguerta thought you should see this.

650
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:19,306
That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

651
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,426
Son of a bitch.

652
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:28,028
Dex.

653
00:49:28,028 --> 00:49:33,535
Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock,
a knife with his prints,and a drop of his wife's blood.

654
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:38,878
Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...I hope.

655
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:50,261
Too fucking weird.

656
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:51,952
Jesus Christ saved this kid.

657
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:56,074
On his own for as long as Oscar was,who's to say he didn't?

658
00:50:04,895 --> 00:50:08,395
When did lighting candles become
more fun than blowing them out?

659
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:09,989
Nice turnout.

660
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:16,394
I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

661
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:20,712
Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

662
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:27,065
After presents.

663
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:31,751
Ready?

664
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:36,503
Make a wish, baby.

665
00:50:36,503 --> 00:50:38,721
Just don't tell anybody,or it won't come true.

666
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:40,857
It already came true.Dad's not here.

667
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:49,817
I want the middle piece.

668
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,092
Okay.

669
00:50:51,092 --> 00:50:53,017
I was wrong about birthdays.

670
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:57,462
Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer

671
00:50:57,462 --> 00:50:59,594
--the hope of living to see another one.

672
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:06,490
The thing about deb forgiving me --I better give her a few more days.

673
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:15,117
I barely escaped getting caught this time.

674
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:19,006
I realize now my days are numbered.

675
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:21,739
So I better make the most of them.

676
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:36,449
All along,I thought this was a game my alter ego and i were playing.

677
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,220
But relationships change,evolve,and this one's getting deep.

678
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:58,079
Like harry said in my dream.....the storm's on its way.
