00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,460
<i>Previously on </i>Dexter...

2
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,399
It's for sure. I'm pregnant.

3
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:54,529
<i>What kind of father would I be?
After all, I kill people.</i>

4
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:57,365
<i>Me?</i>

5
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:59,701
<i>Demented daddy Dexter.</i>

6
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:02,578
This child is happening.

7
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,469
But your role in its life
is entirely up to you.

8
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,939
Yesterday morning you said,
"When the case ends, we end."

9
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:11,033
I thought you understood
when we got involved.

10
00:02:11,158 --> 00:02:12,864
I track killers, that's what I do.

11
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,966
A pattern of bodies
was identified in Oregon.

12
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,938
- My flight leaves tonight.
- We gotta work out logistics.

13
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:20,471
Do you honestly
want to go down this path?

14
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,307
I don't know
if I'm gonna be a father.

15
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,685
How could you even say
you're not gonna be a father?

16
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:28,229
I mean, where would
you be without Harry?

17
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:31,642
<i>Harry knew my mother.
Laura Moser was his informant.</i>

18
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,276
<i>Was he just using her?</i>

19
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,939
<i>Was he using me?</i>

20
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,071
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

21
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,990
What did he do?
Cheat on mom?

22
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:40,644
Bullshit! Who?

23
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:44,092
I need all the records you have
on my dad's confidential informants.

24
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:47,582
- Attractive female CIs.
- Why? You know something?

25
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,126
There's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

26
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:53,254
Internal Affairs is investigating you.
There's something you're not telling us?

27
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,650
- Anton's not officially a CI.
- What do you mean?

28
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,550
I never filed
an arrest report on him.

29
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,011
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

30
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,348
Just sending out my positive intentions
to our baby.

31
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,268
You know, we're connected.
You're what makes me real.

32
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,562
Please, say yes.

33
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,380
Yes, we will marry you.

34
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,150
Syl has offered to list my house,

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,277
so we can buy something bigger.

36
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,906
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

37
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,200
I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

38
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,452
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

39
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,288
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

40
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,649
<i>Is it possible
I had actually made a friend?</i>

41
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:32,815
<i>Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?</i>

42
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,671
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

43
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,092
<i>Miguel really did it.
And I taught him how.</i>

44
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,552
<i>Harry was right.
He used me.</i>

45
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,680
You're all just
unchecked versions of myself,

46
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,392
what I would have become
without my father's code.

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,188
I could kill you now.

48
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:53,989
I've never felt this.

49
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:57,110
You've never had a son before.
You want to see him come into the world.

50
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,321
I never wanted anything
so much in my life.

51
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,411
<i>I have moved on from my father.</i>

52
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:08,538
<i>But I still need his code.</i>

53
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,790
<i>But right now, life is good.</i>

54
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,960
<i>Dexter Morgan, family man.</i>

<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

57
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:47,941
<i>The night when a primal, sacred need
calls to me.</i>

58
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,408
<i>I've waited</i>

59
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,372
<i>and waited,</i>

60
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,640

<i>Tonight's the night I finally...</i>

64
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,331
<i>sleep.</i>

65
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:28,418
Oh my God! No!

66
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:38,897
Okay, Harrison.

67
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:42,062
The driving thing didn't work.
The singing thing didn't work.

68
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:45,254
You planning on both of us
not sleeping for another three months?

69
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,226
Apparently so.

70
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,439
Okay, I want to take you inside,
but I don't want you waking mommy.

71
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,507
If you could talk you'd tell me
not to worry about you, right?

72
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,590
Please!

73
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,070
Please!

74
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,701
It's already over.

75
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:49,751
Marco?

76
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:50,876
Polo!

77
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,196
Marco?

78
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,091
Polo!

79
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,571
<i>There's this cliché where serial killers
are always described</i>

80
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,206
<i>as quiet, kept to themselves,
kind of a loner.</i>

81
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,147
<i>And it's a cliché for a reason.</i>

82
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,099
Has anybody seen my keys?

83
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,551
Astor, I asked you to keep it down.

84
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,043
Why do you hate my music so much?

85
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,777
I don't hate your music.

86
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:20,902
You don't?

87
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:24,395
Cody, get out of the Larsons' pool.
It's time for school!

88
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,108
If I had an iPod,
you wouldn't have to listen to my stuff.

89
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,035
You want an iPod, earn one.

90
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,944
- Do your chores. Unpack your room.
- God, you're so unfair!

91
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,131
Did you get any sleep?

92
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,703
An hour and a half, maybe.

93
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,374
And you have court. Look,
I appreciate you taking the night shift,

94
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,168
but when you have a big day like today,
it's okay to wake me up.

95
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,338
Well, it's kinda
on-the-job training, you know.

96
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,547
All that matters
is his father's there for him.

97
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:55,872
- I cannot find keys.
- Cody!

98
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,288
Astor, the music!

99
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,765
- You usually leave them by the phone.
- I know.

100
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,685
- School. Clothes. Now.
- Sorry.

101
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,424
You don't get some sleep,
it won't be your keys that get lost.

102
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:11,999
It'll be your mind.

103
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,105
I lost that years ago.

104
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,627
<i>Dexter Morgan,</i>

105
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,770
<i>good suburban husband</i>

106
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,595
<i>Happy father of three.</i>

107
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:36,050
<i>On paper, anyway.</i>

108
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,858
Hey, Dex! What's the news?

109
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:41,597
Too soon to tell.

110
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,781
Dex, you forgot your cellphone.

111
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,779
Good morning, Elliot!

112
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:52,035
Another beautiful day.
More pool time for the kids.

113
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,986
You already took the morning shift,
so I'll watch them this afternoon.

114
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,262
Takes a village.

115
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,610
Carpools and swimming pools...

116
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,294
How much are we living the dream?

117
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:14,269
So much.

118
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,718
<i>Living the dream...</i>

119
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:31,022
Do you think you can TiVo
Jon Stewart for me?

120
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:36,255
You're thinking about Jon Stewart?

121
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,594
Well, he is handsome

122
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:42,707
and funny.

123
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,452
I love you.

124
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:52,377
Oh, fuck me.

125
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,844
Well, that's kinda
where this is heading.

126
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:56,381
No, I'm late for work.

127
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,766
It's a good thing you moved in,
or I'd never see you.

128
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:09,166
One of us has to live here.

129
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,813
At least with the cruise ship
I get to see you every few days.

130
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,899
- I went on tour.
- I know.

131
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:17,985
It's okay, I kinda like it.
Keeps you from getting sick of me.

132
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:21,698
- That's never gonna happen.
- Yeah, because you're never here.

133
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:24,924
No, because you make me happy.

134
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,501
And what conclusions did you draw
from the blood evidence, Mr. Morgan?

135
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:37,255
I was able to determine
the victim's movement and direction...

136
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,173
after the initial blunt force trauma

137
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,926
to the head
caused by the defendant's fist.

138
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,830
- How so?
- I...

139
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,108
reconstructed...

140
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,270
timeline and sequence of events
by examining...

141
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:54,817
It's here somewhere.

142
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:58,151
I noticed
a passive flow pattern bloodstain,

143
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,392
approximately two meters in length,
emanating from the head wound,

144
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:06,284
and the sample was consistent with
the sample from the defendant's shirt.

145
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:10,455
You did say
"passive flow pattern bloodstain"?

146
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,540
Quote, unquote.

147
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,125
What exactly do your notes say?

148
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,525
"The bloodstain described
a passive pooling

149
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,150
"and flow configuration
type 0-negative,

150
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:26,012
"matching the sample taken from...

151
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,488
"Leonetti's

152
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,666
"shirt."

153
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,189
But this is the Gomez hearing.

154
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:40,318
Yes, Mr. Morgan.
The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.

155
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,361
I must have brought the wrong notes.

156
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,530
Do you frequently become
confused and disoriented

157
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,886
when conducting your spatter analysis,
Mr. Morgan?

158
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,141
No, I do not.

159
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:53,122
We just had a new baby. Things were
a little hectic this morning.

160
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:55,833
So you're sleep-deprived
and it's affecting your judgment?

161
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,101
No, it's just a momentary mix-up.

162
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,088
Wrong notes, wrong blood type,

163
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,507
wrong defendant, wrong case...

164
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,761
That's what you call a momentary mix-up
in a murder trial?

165
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,886
I misspoke.

166
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:12,195
The witness has just demonstrated
how unreliable he is in a courtroom.

167
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,103
I would have to ask
how reliable his work is in the lab.

168
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,452
Or on a crime scene.

169
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,189
Moreover, how reliable
is a police department,

170
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:22,434
that they would place so much trust
in his expert opinion.

171
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:33,121
I'm halfway
through the CI files you gave me.

172
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:34,774
If I were you,

173
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,077
I'd spend more time
with that man of yours

174
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,711
and less time looking
for some old confidential informant

175
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,838
your daddy might've diddled
back in the day.

176
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,298
I meet another one tomorrow.

177
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,276
Maybe then I'll finally
get some answers.

178
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,594
Say you do.

179
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,846
Then what?

180
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:51,897
Then...

181
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,930
I'll know.

182
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,140
That my perfect fucking father
wasn't so fucking perfect.

183
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,440
So that's what, the meaning of life?

184
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,172
The meaning of my life.

185
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,399
Hey, buddy.

186
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:12,475
Guess where I was yesterday.

187
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,610
I'm not sure...

188
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:16,998
I was at a store.
Wanna take guess what kind of store?

189
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,810
- I don't know. Grocery?
- Clothing.

190
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,421
You know me, I'm pretty into that shit.
Gotta come correct. But not yesterday.

191
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,798
- If this is about...
- Come on, buddy. Let me finish.

192
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,408
I was at a store helping a lady
to pick out a suit for her son.

193
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,441
Know why?

194
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:32,354
'Cause he had to be in court.
See the guy who killed his old man.

195
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,600
Kid's first fucking suit.
Something a father should be doing.

196
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,268
- Sorry.
- Little late for sorry.

197
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,438
- That asshole you let walk?
- Benito Gomez.

198
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:42,690
Now you get it right.

199
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,817
You actually see
what that fuckhead did?

200
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:48,624
Gomez hit the kid's old man so hard,
his cheekbone broke,

201
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,125
pushing his eyeball
up and out of his face.

202
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,063
Then Gomez, sweetheart that he is,
kills the guy in front of his own son.

203
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,578
- I know.
- And this beauty?

204
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,796
Gomez did 5 years
for beating his girlfriend so bad

205
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,798
even her dentist
had a hard time with the ID.

206
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:02,481
So is your "Sorry" gonna keep Gomez
from pounding somebody else

207
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:04,647
- into the next world?
- Jesus, chill out, Quinn!

208
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,403
No, Deb, he's right.

209
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,258
I screwed up in court today.
Gomez walked. This one's on me.

210
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,375
Thanks. That means so much to me.
Why don't you hold onto those for me?

211
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,174
I'm sick of looking at them.

212
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,932
You screwed up?

213
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,668
Big time.

214
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,244
Should I be worried?

215
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:23,381
No, I'll be okay.

216
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:28,409
<i>Maybe it's Benny Gomez
who should be worried.</i>

217
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:31,823
And good solve
on the Reynolds case, guys.

218
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,074
Next up,

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,765
chief's office wants...

220
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,079
Anything I can do to keep that Irish
off your ass, let me know.

221
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,651
You're a real friend, Vince.

222
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,110
<i>Quinn is a good cop.</i>

223
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,634
<i>I need a good kill.</i>

224
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,764
<i>And sometimes
one just falls into your lap.</i>

225
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,889
We've got a body in Kendall.
Morgan, Quinn, you're up.

226
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,350
And Dexter. There's blood.
Lots of blood.

227
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,359
Talk about your blood bath.

228
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:14,857
Tough room.

229
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,036
Femoral artery severed.
She bled out in minutes.

230
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,329
- Suicide?
- No weapon on the premises.

231
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,701
Exactly. The coroner can suck
my uncircumcised dick

232
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:25,844
- if he doesn't rule this as a homicide.
- That's way TMI, Masuka.

233
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:29,220
Employment records show
she just got promoted to sous-chef.

234
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:32,842
A total babe, and she could cook.
Had it all going on.

235
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,483
Then this.

236
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,056
It's a very well-organized crime scene.
The assailant took his time,

237
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:42,394
cleaned up after himself.

238
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,631
<i>Obviously doesn't have kids.</i>

239
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,355
Keep an eye on our expert witness.

240
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:50,693
In case our girl's parents want to see
someone go to jail for doing this.

241
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,372
Harsh.

242
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,290
Christine Hill,
<i>Broward Journal Dispatch.</i>

243
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,675
And?

244
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,169
And was Miss Bell the only victim?

245
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:10,992
Who gave you her name?

246
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:13,674
I searched the address
on this thing called the Internet.

247
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:17,261
What can you tell me about the murder?
Suspects?

248
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,245
Murder? Suspects?

249
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,224
We still haven't officially
ruled out suicide.

250
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,017
So it was pills?

251
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,063
Then she bled out.

252
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,594
Women pretty much
only do one or the other.

253
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,943
You break this case before we do,
give me a call.

254
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,815
It's Detective Joseph Quinn.

255
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,955
Miami-Metro, extension 3734.

256
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,122
Cell number?

257
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,357
Nice touch, Joseph.

258
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:02,422
Damn it!

259
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,428
Can't anyone fill up the...

260
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,270
fucking water thing?

261
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,441
- Tough crime scene?
- No.

262
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,155
Kind of.

263
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,871
When things are going good,

264
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,094
that's God's way of saying
to cover your ass,

265
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,581
because something's gonna jump up
and bite it, hard.

266
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,583
Well put.

267
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,211
- You and Anton are doing okay?
- Knock on wood.

268
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,948
Any sign your ass is gonna get bit?

269
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:35,798
None.

270
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:39,010
- So this is you making yourself crazy?
- That's kind of what I do.

271
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:42,764
What?

272
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:45,224
It's just I've taken that trip
a thousand times before.

273
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,602
- And?
- And knock it off.

274
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:49,854
Is that an order, boss?

275
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,233
Just some free advice
from someone who's been there before.

276
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,636
Did you ever go out with that guy
that Anton wanted you to meet?

277
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,592
Musicians aren't really my thing.

278
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,291
He owns a restaurant.

279
00:20:04,564 --> 00:20:06,703
Three of them.
Cuban restaurants.

280
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:09,450
What the fuck is
wrong with musicians?

281
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,235
That came out wrong.

282
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,730
What makes you think
a Cuban restaurant matters?

283
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:16,547
That came out wrong too.

284
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:21,094
I'm not looking for anyone new anyway.
But when and if,

285
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,388
I'll let you know.

286
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,684
Thanks.

287
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,208
<i>Finally, peace and quiet.</i>

288
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,059
<i>No crying baby.</i>

289
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,532
<i>No Marco, no Polo.</i>

290
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:44,485
<i>Just me...</i>

291
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,536
<i>and blood.</i>

292
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,465
<i>And Mr. Benito Gomez.</i>

293
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>Where to find
a washed-up boxer like you?</i>

294
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,473
<i>Trailer Park. Great.</i>

295
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,846
<i>Kids, neighbours.</i>

296
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:10,679
<i>More kids.</i>

297
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,395
<i>Sounds like my world.</i>

298
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,806
<i>But this...</i>

299
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:24,699
<i>the only still open for business
establishment in a lonely strip mall.</i>

300
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,854
<i>That's kind of calling to me.</i>

301
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,195
<i>This feels good.</i>

302
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:34,709
Hey, you.

303
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:36,627
Hey, Dex. You're alone?

304
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,962
Yeah, why?

305
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,839
Harrison won't go down for his nap.

306
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:41,674
Surprise, surprise.

307
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:44,177
Maybe you could sing to him?

308
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:46,243
You bet.

309
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:49,559
I will gonna put you on speaker.

310
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:57,090
<i>Oh beautiful for spacious skies</i>

311
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,706
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

312
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,907
<i>For purple mountain majesty</i>

313
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,203
<i>Above the fruited plain!</i>

314
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:16,658
<i>America! America! God...</i>

315
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,800
He's finally calming.

316
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,590
Thank you, Dexter.
We love you.

317
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:24,664
Me too.

318
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:28,681
<i>First up today
finish the Lisa Bell blood work.</i>

319
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,896
<i>Tonight, a little Benny Gomez recon.</i>

320
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:35,317
<i>Then go home and sing the last 95 verses
of</i> America, the Beautiful <i>to my son.</i>

321
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,511
<i>Who knew life could get so...</i>

322
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,749
<i>unsimple?</i>

323
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,871
I can deal. I can deal.

324
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,949
- Boobs plus drinks equals...
- Titty bar. Can't. Got a date.

325
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:03,150
How about you, Morgan?
Stud muffin still out of town?

326
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,896
It's tempting, Masuka.
And elegant.

327
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:08,094
Fuck off and die.
Then die again.

328
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:09,482
So that's a no.

329
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,657
- I'm feeling no love here, folks.
- Then it's working.

330
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:14,700
Hey, slacker! Half day?

331
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,228
This is me leaving, Vince.
I do it every day.

332
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,414
Every day wasn't like today.
What you went through?

333
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,274
Drinks are on me.
It'll cheer you up!

334
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,420
I'm not uncheered.

335
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,027
Tell that to your face!

336
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:28,173
- I'm going home to my family.
- Vastly overrated.

337
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:29,696
Just got a call from robbery.

338
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:32,018
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

339
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,500
Grave condition.
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

340
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,260
Nice fucking wedding gift.

341
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,435
Yeah, the file is gonna land on my desk
first thing in the morning.

342
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,109
And robbery's got squat.

343
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:42,942
It's gonna be a total goatfuck.

344
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,797
It sounds like you need
a drink, <i>papi</i>.

345
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,314
You know what, Vince?
I can use a <i>Cuervo</i>. Or ten.

346
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,105
<i>My dark passenger is like
a trapped coal miner, always tapping,</i>

347
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,835
<i>always letting me know
it's still in there, still alive.</i>

348
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:28,525
<i>Quinn's legwork may have shown me
where to find our friend,</i>

349
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:30,576
<i>but this, Benny...</i>

350
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,971
<i>My bloodwork is the stuff
that seals your fate.</i>

351
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,698
No security cameras.
Parks away from the lights.

352
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:54,911
You just come and go as you please.

353
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:58,121
But as of tomorrow night,

354
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,327
those days are over.

355
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,311
I wasn't sure
you'd actually come by.

356
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:17,480
Put in my face time with Masuka.

357
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:20,184
And then I came
to where I really wanted to be.

358
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:28,860
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

359
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,965
Yeah, it's crazy.

360
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:34,533
Crazy good.

361
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,717
Keep shooting.

362
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,846
He's so sweet, when he's sleeping.

363
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:02,331
We were all like that, once.

364
00:26:03,172 --> 00:26:04,270
Pure and innocent.

365
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07,372
But then we grow up,

366
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:09,922
things happen.

367
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:13,643
Nothing's gonna happen.

368
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,150
Not when he has a great dad
watching over him.

369
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,396
Yeah, he's a lucky guy.

370
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:31,047
- Mom!
- Turn that down!

371
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,965
We wouldn't have this problem,
if you...

372
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,507
This is not how you go
about getting an iPod.

373
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,472
Since you woke your brother up, you can
walk him around until he falls asleep.

374
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,891
- But he never sleeps!
- Think about that next time.

375
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,873
There we go.

376
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:53,743
You'd like an iPod,
wouldn't you, little Harrison?

377
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,884
Why not just end the terror
and give her an iPod?

378
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,701
No, it's a power play.

379
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,507
She's trying to manipulate us
to get what she wants.

380
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:04,829
Not in this family.

381
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,207
Oh, right.

382
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:07,667
Of course.

383
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:11,419
Cody?
No more Marco Polo in the mornings.

384
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,923
- But it's important!
- So is being ready for school.

385
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,676
When I grow up
I wanna be just like you.

386
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:19,053
Do what I want, when I want.

387
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:20,635
<i>You and me both.</i>

388
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,223
I wanna be just like you.

389
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,053
Great time last night, Angel?

390
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,914
What? You could've totally fucked
that stripper.

391
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:55,223
Get to work, gentlemen.

392
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:58,982
What got into her?

393
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:19,793
What is this? <i>Extreme Home Makeover:
Forensics Edition</i>?

394
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:23,117
The first pass through, I found blood
that didn't belong to the victim.

395
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:25,119
Possible DNA from the Killer?

396
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,246
Don't think so.
The sample was pretty degraded.

397
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:30,583
- Then what's the source?
- Not sure... yet.

398
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,168
Coming from you,
why does that not surprise me?

399
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,919
You know he's my brother?

400
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,881
Found something.
Mr. Morgan.

401
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,178
It's blood.

402
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:48,324
Pool pattern, not incidental spatter
from the recent murder.

403
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:50,770
- This is something else entirely.
- Where is it from?

404
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,566
Bathtub.

405
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:58,688
So, you're taking an already
extremely difficult case

406
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:00,945
and polluting it
with your, what, theories?

407
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:03,698
- I didn't put the blood there.
- Neither did our killer.

408
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,937
Joey, why don't we step outside,
let the geeks get their geek on?

409
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,236
I gotta be somewhere,
so see if you can hold things down

410
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:13,626
without going all asshole
on my brother, okay?

411
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:31,227
<i>Blood tells. Blood always tells.</i>

412
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,447
How is my favorite
blood spatter analyst?

413
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,409
Great.

414
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:48,661
How is my favorite
serial killer hunter?

415
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,790
- You just missed Deb.
- Actually, I'm here to see you.

416
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,338
Database has
a girl killed here recently.

417
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,316
Severed femoral artery?

418
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:02,258
Pretty brutal.

419
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:06,804
Crime scene telling you anything?

420
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:08,721
Not much.

421
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,310
Killer was careful, right?
Immaculate.

422
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:15,447
Very.

423
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,277
You're in the middle of something here.
I don't want to interrupt.

424
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,950
Mind if I drop by the station later?

425
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:27,533
Sure, not a problem.

426
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:31,744
Good seeing you again, Dexter.

427
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,330
<i>Shit!</i>

428
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,229
Hello, detective.

429
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,304
Won't you come in?

430
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:03,791
I'm here to talk about Harry Morgan.

431
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,313
I'm his daughter, Debra.

432
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:08,444
Debra Morgan.

433
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,288
Handsome Harry Morgan.
How is he?

434
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:17,208
He died a while back.

435
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,420
Life does tend to suck.

436
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:25,751
Did you and my father have...

437
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,596
a good relationship?

438
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:33,369
No.

439
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,647
Your father was a driven man.

440
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:41,981
He saw something he wanted,
nothing got in his way.

441
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:45,124
You're talking about women?

442
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:47,879
Women. Bad guys. Anything.

443
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:50,685
Anyone.

444
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,277
Harry always said, the only word
that wasn't in his vocabulary was "No".

445
00:31:58,078 --> 00:31:59,678
Did you say no to him?

446
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,740
I said yes.

447
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,163
All the time.

448
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:08,179
Shit.

449
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,535
Hundreds of times.

450
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:14,721
Only problem was...

451
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,979
Only problem was what?

452
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:26,527
I was saying yes to a question
he never asked.

453
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,697
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

454
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:35,799
I don't know who you're looking for,
honey, but it ain't me.

455
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,674
<i>Shut down for decades.
Way out of town.</i>

456
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:50,752
I'm liking this.

457
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,585
<i>Broken-down boxer.
Broken-down arena.</i>

458
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:59,185
<i>A fitting place for a punk like
Benny Gomez to go down for the count.</i>

459
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:08,168
Where you been?

460
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:12,323
- Looking for misery.
- No upside to that.

461
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,823
So I'm fucking learning.

462
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,785
That's all we got on the groom.
Plug was pulled 4:45 this morning.

463
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:20,096
It's all yours.

464
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:24,005
A man's life and death,
reduced to a few...

465
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:25,978
- What do you call them?
- Bytes.

466
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:27,503
A few bytes. Just like that.

467
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,633
This economy. Last thing
our city needs is dead tourists.

468
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,133
"Welcome to Miami.

469
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:33,551
"Have a nice day."

470
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:35,678
Is that our tourist?

471
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:36,574
It is.

472
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:38,863
The mayor's already given me
an aneurysm over this one,

473
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:40,476
so make it a quick solve.

474
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,857
So, whatever happened between you
and that Barbara Gianna from vice?

475
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:49,762
We broke up.

476
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,799
Wanted different things.

477
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:54,595
Office romances.
Doom before they fucking start.

478
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,224
Do you mind if I ask her out?

479
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:57,483
Knock yourself out.

480
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,465
<i>The perfect husband would've
gotten rid of his old apartment.</i>

481
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,729
<i>But I kill people.
Not exactly the perfect husband.</i>

482
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:35,948
Someone new is moving in.

483
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,701
Be nice.

484
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,048
<i>The land that time</i>

485
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:32,374
<i>and Florida Electric forgot.</i>

486
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,512
<i>Look at this place!</i>

487
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:53,240
<i>All the cheering,
all the triumph, all the blood.</i>

488
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,818
<i>All for sport.</i>

489
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:58,773
<i>Until tonight.</i>

490
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:39,922
<i>Keep at it, Benny,
and you'll be feeling no pain.</i>

491
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:43,526
<i>Better that way.</i>

492
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:10,560
Tell me you got a reason
for sleeping alone in your car

493
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:12,478
outside a bar
other than you're drunk.

494
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:15,040
I'm tired.

495
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,941
License and registration, please.

496
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,653
Sorry about this, officer.
This is not what it looks like.

497
00:37:30,764 --> 00:37:33,000
- You're with homicide?
- Yes, sir.

498
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:35,990
Then you ought to know better.
Get out of the car, please.

499
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:43,427
You know your ABC?

500
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:46,846
- Of course I do.
- Give me 'em backwards.

501
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:03,404
Shut up already. You're not drunk...

502
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,572
yet.

503
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,786
<i>Damn it, Benny.</i>

504
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:12,789
<i>I can't go chasing after you
with a cop up my ass.</i>

505
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:16,983
You got more important
places to be, Mr. Morgan.

506
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:20,945
Tell me about it.

507
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,545
I thought you were working late.

508
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,186
So did I.

509
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:38,392
Baby's down.

510
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:40,531
You know what that means?

511
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:43,069
- Sleep.
- Sex!

512
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:49,471
And I'm not talking the rushed,
frantic, the-kids-are-asleep sex.

513
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,452
But slow, hot,

514
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,937
steamy, naughty sex.

515
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:54,962
Look, if you're too tired...

516
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,501
Ever since the move and the baby,

517
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,603
we've had, like, zero time together.

518
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,679
I mean, aren't you as horny as I am?

519
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,556
'Course I am.

520
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:15,692
All right. Well, just...

521
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,403
close your eyes.

522
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:23,148
<i>Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap.</i>

523
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:24,777
Okay, open.

524
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:29,898
<i>Or not.</i>

525
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:33,244
I was saving these for when we finally
got some real time alone.

526
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,663
And...

527
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:41,999
And tonight's the night.

528
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:00,311
It's alright. I'll go.

529
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,591
You've already done so much.

530
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,355
Look at that.

531
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:17,690
Yeah, who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

532
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:29,854
Wanna know a secret?

533
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,248
Daddy kills people.

534
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:40,265
Well, bad people.

535
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:46,421
Not really anybody else
I can tell about that, you know?

536
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:56,936
Daddy's not going anywhere, buddy.

537
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,760
I've already lost my innocence.
I'm not going to sacrifice yours too.

538
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,851
Triple Red-Eye, please.

539
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:22,528
That's your third one today, bro.
You don't cut back,

540
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:24,830
and you're tempting the heart gods.

541
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,455
Least of my worries.

542
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:28,294
Bro.

543
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,528
Brought you a copy of my article.

544
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:32,889
Figured you're a dumb cop
and don't read the paper.

545
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:34,699
I never miss the obituaries.

546
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:38,578
- Front page. Nice.
- Yeah, I do what I can.

547
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:41,080
My editor okayed a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

548
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:43,407
I would if I could,
but I got nothing.

549
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:46,632
Besides, off the record,
we got bigger fish to fry.

550
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:48,880
What kind of fish?

551
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,720
Off the record.

552
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,961
You know those pricks
who've been shaking down tourists?

553
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,430
- The vacation robbers?
- No, the vacation murderers.

554
00:41:57,991 --> 00:42:00,767
They shot some poor newly wed.
Didn't make it, so

555
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,311
we're more than a little distracted.

556
00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:07,774
You want another distraction?
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

557
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,234
You know, to thank you

558
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,820
for your help
with the bathtub story.

559
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:18,583
- I'm so not hitting on you.
- Yeah, me neither.

560
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,827
Let's make it dinner.

561
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:28,006
I've got the blood work back
from our bathroom do-over.

562
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,031
- You ran it through the database?
- No point.

563
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:32,269
The blood you swabbed
showed shit-all on the DNA front.

564
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:34,680
Our chances of finding out
who it belongs to are about

565
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:36,636
one in six fucking billion?

566
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:40,567
What was Lisa Bell's address?

567
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:43,601
1578 Glencoe, why?

568
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:47,391
If the DNA won't tell us
who it belonged to,

569
00:42:47,516 --> 00:42:48,823
maybe the address will.

570
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,025
1578 Glencoe.

571
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:53,903
April 11, 1979. Homicide.

572
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:55,613
1979?

573
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,844
Vicky Noonan, 22.
Found in the bath tub.

574
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:06,332
Bled out.
Incision to her thigh.

575
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:09,054
What are the chances of that?

576
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:11,129
What are the chances of what?

577
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,671
Special agent Lundy.

578
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:15,675
Vincent Masuka, if memory serves.

579
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:18,558
That's right.

580
00:43:19,092 --> 00:43:20,096
LFI on the PHB.

581
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:24,398
You're working a case, right?
Feds need us to...

582
00:43:24,523 --> 00:43:26,185
Mind if I speak with Dexter?

583
00:43:29,245 --> 00:43:32,445
Well, I go to records
and get the write-up on Noonan.

584
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:35,508
Just doing my job.

585
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:42,327
He's right.

586
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:43,995
About?

587
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,670
Why I'm in Miami.

588
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,081
It is a case.

589
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,258
Yeah, I figured.

590
00:43:49,957 --> 00:43:52,920
But why do you need me?
You have the full resources of the FBI.

591
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:55,152
Not anymore.

592
00:43:55,557 --> 00:43:56,633
I'm retired.

593
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:00,011
Their loss.

594
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:01,754
Yeah, well...

595
00:44:02,317 --> 00:44:03,890
I fish, travel,

596
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:05,501
and...

597
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,520
now I have the time to track down
the twisted son of a bitch who got away.

598
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:13,650
So, who is
the twisted son of a bitch?

599
00:44:14,775 --> 00:44:16,361
I call him the trinity killer.

600
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,738
Kills in threes.

601
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,240
Been doing it all over the country
for years.

602
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:23,871
Problem is, I can't prove he exists.

603
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,647
Law enforcement
doesn't talk to each other.

604
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,499
So no one at the FBI
is even on board.

605
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,168
Just me.

606
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,165
I've been looking for a break.
Then this happens.

607
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,290
Lisa Bell.

608
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,640
Her murder profile
fits the previous victims.

609
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:43,455
Trinity is in Miami, Dexter,

610
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:46,355
starting his cycle all over again.

611
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,067
How far back do your cases go?

612
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:57,860
About fifteen years.

613
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,253
The house and room,
where Lisa Bell was murdered,

614
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,994
was the site of a very similar homicide
thirty years ago.

615
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,555
Take a look.

616
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:19,716
Always come full circle.
He's back where his killing began.

617
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,510
Thirty years.

618
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:23,970
You know what this means?

619
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:28,745
Trinity's the most successful
serial killer to ever...

620
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:30,967
get away with it.

621
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:55,859
What? I'm fine.

622
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,081
I can't wait to see you.

623
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:05,092
Anton, I have to go.
I have a meeting.

624
00:46:09,173 --> 00:46:10,323
Hello, Debra.

625
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,264
Motherfucking fuck.

626
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:18,309
Nice to see you too.

627
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:19,845
Fuck.

628
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,340
What are you doing here?

629
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:25,406
Are you here on a case?

630
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:28,826
Actually, I'm retired now.

631
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,037
Yet you're here.

632
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,508
Life has a natural forward momentum.

633
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:36,793
Certain things are inevitable.

634
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
Like you.

635
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,341
Making detective.

636
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,177
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

637
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,945
I never had any doubt.

638
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,936
How long will your forward momentum
keep you in Miami?

639
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,438
Not sure exactly.

640
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,569
Be seeing you.

641
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,480
I guess. Maybe.
I mean, I don't know.

642
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,895
Big plans this evening, sergeant?

643
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:32,134
The usual, lieutenant.

644
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:46,799
Hey, guys.

645
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:49,946
Drinks?

646
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,997
<i>I had Benny Gomez
on the ropes and let him slip away.</i>

647
00:47:56,784 --> 00:48:00,788
<i>No way I can go to that bar again.
Officer Alphabet made sure of that.</i>

648
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,790
<i>Which means I grab Benny
where he lives.</i>

649
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,299
<i>A higher degree of difficulty,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

650
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:10,439
<i>If I want to be around for my son,
I have to do this right.</i>

651
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:13,014
<i>I'm killing for two now.</i>

652
00:48:37,732 --> 00:48:38,748
The fuck you want?

653
00:48:40,388 --> 00:48:41,388
You.

654
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:55,618
<i>Look at him.</i>

655
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:57,025
<i>Fast asleep.</i>

656
00:48:58,289 --> 00:48:59,289
<i>Lucky guy.</i>

657
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:25,116
I know you.

658
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:30,550
I'm the blood guy.

659
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:54,032
You've made a lot of people
very miserable.

660
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:56,385
Me included.

661
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:02,024
Till now.

662
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:10,853
<i>Because now I get to answer
life's big question.</i>

663
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:12,300
<i>My life, anyway.</i>

664
00:50:18,456 --> 00:50:20,556
Can I do it?
Can I have it all?

665
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,229
Shit!

666
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,530
Dexter, I need you to go
to an all-night pharmacy right away.

667
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:38,182
- I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- Harrison has an ear infection.

668
00:50:38,307 --> 00:50:41,496
He's in a lot of pain, Dexter.
Whatever you're doing can wait.

669
00:50:43,265 --> 00:50:45,083
Right, my mistake.
I wasn't thinking.

670
00:50:45,348 --> 00:50:46,548
I'm on my way.

671
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,046
Kids...

672
00:50:57,956 --> 00:50:58,956
Gotta go.

673
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,323
The clock's ticking.

674
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:04,030
But it's all about sacrifice.

675
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,390
The good of the family.

676
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:56,878
<i>Maybe tonight wasn't perfect.</i>

677
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:59,698
<i>Maybe I need to reboot
the way I do things.</i>

678
00:52:03,262 --> 00:52:05,288
<i>But at least I'm on the right road.</i>

679
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:09,047
<i>I'm on my way
to taking care of my family,</i>

680
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:10,333
<i>raising my son.</i>

681
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:12,820
<i>And all the while doing
what I have to do</i>

682
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:15,741
<i>to satisfy a calling
that I can't ignore</i>

683
00:52:17,853 --> 00:52:18,853
<i>or deny.</i>

684
00:52:21,157 --> 00:52:22,471
<i>I can do this.</i>

685
00:52:31,702 --> 00:52:33,398
You don't need to sleep!

686
00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:37,611
You need to wake up!
