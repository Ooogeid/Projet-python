00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,007
<i>Previously, on </i>Dexter...

3
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:48,778
God, you're on fire.

4
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:53,116
- Oh, shit.
- What?

5
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,745
I'm pregnant.

6
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,163
I just got word Angel will be

7
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,373
detective sergeant Batista.

8
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,959
<i>Fred Bowman, a.k.a. Freebo,</i>

9
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:06,420
<i>kills two college girls and escapes
on a state police screw-up.</i>

10
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:08,172
Looking to hold some product.

11
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:11,258
- I need a hit.
- Did you hear what I said?

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,052
- Fuck off, Teegan.
- Your dick can suck itself from now on!

13
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:19,475
Freebo, get back here!

14
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,397
Who are you?

15
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,649
Who are you?

16
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:28,358
- I got it, Dex.
- Got what?

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,112
Only the case that's gonna get me my
shield. It's huge. Angel put me on it.

18
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:34,490
Who he is
is what makes this case huge.

19
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,702
It's Miguel Prado,
assistant district attorney.

20
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,412
- He and laguerta go way back.
- The other guy's Ramon Prado,

21
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,333
Miguel's middle brother. Lieutenant
with the sheriff's department.

22
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:45,627
And...

23
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,752
Oscar.

24
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,172
- Prado?
- As in baby brother.

25
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,446
<i>I've never killed anyone
I didn't vet before,</i>

26
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,081
<i>whose guilt I wasn't
absolutely certain of.</i>

27
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,347
<i>Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo.
Then he tried to kill me.</i>

28
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:01,017
- <i>He's gotta be guilty of something.</i>
- Why would a blood spatter analyst

29
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,979
spend time searching for information
on my dead brother?

30
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,649
This one, this death got to me.

31
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:09,399
Morgan, right?

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,736
- Do I know you?
- Yuki amado, internal affairs.

33
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,988
- And?
- You know Joey Quinn?

34
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,282
I'm gonna do you a favor.
Call this guy,

35
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:18,358
tell him you wanna
cash in one of my coupons.

36
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:20,829
He's an informant
from my days in narcotics.

37
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,233
- You're Anton?
- You got something to show me?

38
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:24,833
What about this Prado guy?

39
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,438
I've seen him before.

40
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:30,046
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash.

41
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,923
You getting along
with the new boss man?

42
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,812
Fuck him. He took me off
the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.

43
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,761
Some dead-end Jane Doe.

44
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,424
<i>Teegan.</i>

45
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,902
<i>Freebo's girlfriend.
Looks like he's still in miami.</i>

46
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,988
<i>We're supposed to see hope
in children.</i>

47
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,812
<i>But right now, all I see are
little bundles of uncertainty.</i>

48
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,203
<i>And germs.</i>
But that's another matter.

49
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,148
<i>I love kids.
I can play with them, enjoy them...</i>

50
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:07,917
<i>And leave.</i>

51
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:12,065
<i>I don't have to worry
about what they'll become.</i>

52
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,874
<i>A nobel prize laureate.</i>

53
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:19,846
<i>A drunk.</i>

54
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:23,479
<i>President of the United States.</i>

55
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,515
<i>Or someone like me.</i>

56
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,494
<i>Why do parents take the chance?</i>

57
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,232
<i>I've never felt compelled.</i>

58
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:35,266
<i>But why would i?
I'm not in the business of giving life.</i>

59
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,747
It's for sure.

60
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,470
I'm pregnant.

61
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:56,674
What should we do?

62
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:00,720
I don't know.

63
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,446
We should talk.

64
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,525
Weigh all the options.

65
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:18,696
Together.

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,825
I have to get to work.

67
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:27,835
<i>Weighing options.
The pros and cons.</i>

68
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,332
<i>Something I'm good at, usually.</i>

69
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:38,786
What the fuck, Dex? I was yelling at you
to hold the elevator, ass-wipe.

70
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,969
Sorry, I'm feeling

71
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,979
- off.
- So see a doctor.

72
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:44,964
Saw one.

73
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:46,808
Really didn't help.

74
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,115
The Oscar Prado case?

75
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,611
Yeah, fuckers are on
the career-maker of the year.

76
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,451
They nail this Freebo guy
and they're golden.

77
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,513
The courts already let Freebo go once
for those two girls in the Everglades.

78
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:01,321
That was then. This time,
he killed a senior A.D.A.'s brother.

79
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:04,251
Afternoon fix.

80
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,786
<i>Except he didn't kill Oscar.</i>

81
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:08,906
<i>I did.</i>

82
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,611
<i>If it hadn't been for Freebo,
Oscar would still be alive,</i>

83
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,209
<i>and I wouldn't be in this mess.</i>

84
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:15,598
<i>Besides, he's seen my face.</i>

85
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,012
<i>I've gotta find Freebo
before they do.</i>

86
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,678
<i>That's one thing I'm sure of, at least.</i>

87
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,052
Nice watch.

88
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:26,008
- Knockoff?
- Me? No. Real thing only.

89
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:27,945
I sold a kidney to get it.

90
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,269
- I'll show you the scar sometime.
- I'll give you a kidney not to.

91
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:33,146
Hey, Dex, do me a favor.

92
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:36,918
Go over the Prado blood evidence
one more time, okay?

93
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,193
- Maybe you missed something.
- Okay, but...

94
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,466
- We got narcotics on the line.
- All right.

95
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,172
Wait up.

96
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:50,413
My Jane Doe.

97
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,457
See what you see.

98
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:54,834
Already saw what I saw,
which was nothing.

99
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,627
So see what you see again.

100
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:00,214
I can't afford none solved, **** fuck all, on this.

101
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:03,009
Coroner found a pharmacy in her.
Big surprise, right?

102
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,979
Body dumped near
the waterfront stroll. Shocker.

103
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:08,056
Looks like every other
tweaker hooker case.

104
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,183
Except the tattoo
peeled off her shoulder.

105
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,061
Coroner says not a tattoo.

106
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,898
You're getting interested.

107
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:19,024
Actually, I'm getting sleepy.

108
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,845
<i>It's reassuring to know
I'm not the only one at sea.</i>

109
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:37,543
<i>I could throw them a line,
tell them their cases are linked.</i>

110
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:41,047
<i>That Jane Doe is actually
Freebo's girlfriend.</i>

111
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,013
<i>That it was Freebo who killed her.</i>

112
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:48,179
<i>But I need the head start.</i>

113
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:55,728
Step away from the incense.

114
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,776
This is america, buddy.
Freedom of religion.

115
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,197
I didn't realize you were a buddhist.
Japanese are traditionally shinto.

116
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:07,907
Are we?

117
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,117
Whatever.

118
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,058
I bought all this shit
off my manicurist.

119
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,936
Need all the luck I can get.

120
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,665
Got a crucifix up there too.

121
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,417
'cause it did so much for Jesus?

122
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:22,338
'cause forensics quarterly is deciding
whether or not to publish my article.

123
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,538
You know, the one you read.

124
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,008
And proofed.

125
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,844
The incense stays.

126
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,950
Could I use you
at the doctor's office?

127
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:41,147
But you've got to use me, Maria.

128
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:43,902
A.D.A.s can put pressure
on other agencies.

129
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,445
We have Ramon, who's
with the sheriff's department.

130
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,612
Tranquillo.

131
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,604
I know that you and Ramon
are going to help.

132
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:54,879
And it's hard to let somebody else
handle Oscar's case.

133
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,331
But I have my best
detectives on this.

134
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:59,876
- I got the best forensics team...
- Morgan,

135
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,445
- right?
- He's part of it.

136
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:04,559
We are tracking down every one
of Freebo's known associates.

137
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,258
Looking under every rock.
We will find him.

138
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:10,066
This is a good team.
This is the same team, by the way,

139
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,637
that shared a roof
with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

140
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,745
That was totally out of line.

141
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,228
I'm sorry, Maria.

142
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,927
It's just that my fuse is so short

143
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,499
ever since Oscar.

144
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,781
Even with Syl.

145
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,379
I'm driving her nuts.

146
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,329
I doubt that.

147
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,373
She knows what she's got.

148
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,319
- The Bay Harbor Butcher situation...
- No, don't...

149
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:52,439
Please...

150
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,095
I was too personally involved

151
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:01,395
to see it clearly.

152
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:05,608
And that's why I've distanced
myself from things.

153
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,293
You should do the same with Oscar.

154
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:18,514
I know.

155
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:24,085
I know. You're right.

156
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:27,669
Some things never change.

157
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:37,260
We're not as close
as we used to be.

158
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,517
But at least I still
have you as a colleague.

159
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,106
And I'm glad that it's you
that's here.

160
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:47,999
Gracias.

161
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:01,914
<i>Miguel Prado's already seen too much
of me. I can't comfort the grieving.</i>

162
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:06,961
You got this?

163
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,956
I got this.

164
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,433
Don't look familiar, hon.

165
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:23,171
But those are some fine streaks.

166
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,229
Who did her hair?

167
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,565
Christophe of Beverly fuckin' Hills.

168
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,359
Yeah, do you have his number?

169
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,612
Petunia, you are the dumbest whore
on this stroll.

170
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,549
Sorry, sugar.
Don't got a name for you.

171
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,239
Keep walkin', girl.

172
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,132
It's all you're good for.

173
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:43,164
S'up, deb?

174
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:46,052
The shemales give you any leads?

175
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,981
- It's officer morgan to you.
- Right, not a detective yet.

176
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:53,014
Course, an unsolved isn't gonna get you
any closer to a shield.

177
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:55,259
Look, I don't know
why I.A. picked me...

178
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,595
'cause detective Quinn
likes the ladies.

179
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:00,569
Well, then you don't need a snitch.
You need a fuckin' slut.

180
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,590
So why don't you go talk
to Petunia over there?

181
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,436
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

182
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,023
I'm a sergeant, after all.

183
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,625
You'd give me a shield
for being a rat?

184
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:16,072
For being an honest cop, Debra.
Like your father.

185
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,513
You are not god damn digging
into my father right now.

186
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:21,948
Digging? Please.

187
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:24,496
The old-timers at I.A. talk about him
like he's a brother.

188
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,750
The old-timers also talk about
how popular that made him.

189
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:32,263
God. That really matters
to you, doesn't it?

190
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,714
Your cop friends.

191
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,630
It's your whole life.
Them, the job, the shield.

192
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:40,250
Far as I can tell, without that,

193
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:42,807
you've got nothing.

194
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,933
Except your, treadmill.

195
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,535
Kind of cunt, aren't you?

196
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:56,452
Nice.

197
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:01,112
But seriously, you should look into
expanding your world a little.

198
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,960
You know, finding
something else fulfilling. Like...

199
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,845
gardening or...

200
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:07,806
scrapbooking.

201
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,232
Just in case.

202
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:22,246
Get me a name.

203
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:24,664
Teegan.

204
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,018
<i>Drove a Volkswagen rabbit.</i>

205
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,272
<i>That should buy me
an address for her.</i>

206
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:34,106
<i>If I'm lucky, she left me
a lead to Freebo.</i>

207
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,845
Tee... gun.

208
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,030
<i>How many parents would give
their kid a name like that?</i>

209
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:43,451
Florida.

210
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,286
<i>Nope. Nope.</i>

211
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:48,179
<i>Bingo.</i>

212
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,837
<i>Teegan Campbell.</i>

213
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:51,744
<i>Address on sorority row.</i>

214
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,479
<i>Guess I know
what I'm doing tonight.</i>

215
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,198
Teegan.

216
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,305
<i>No, not a name I'd choose.</i>

217
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:01,939
<i>Megan. Mary.</i>

218
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,580
<i>Those are classics.</i>

219
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,749
<i>Or, for a boy, Charles...</i>

220
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:09,656
<i>Or Philip.</i>

221
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:13,939
<i>Or Richard.</i>

222
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,151
<i>Or what's so bad about...</i>

223
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,467
<i>Dexter, Jr.?</i>

224
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,095
Reminds me of you, Dex.

225
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,454
<i>Harry.</i>

226
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,381
<i>The last person I'd turn to
for advice on fatherhood.</i>

227
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,133
<i>Old habits die hard.</i>

228
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:44,108
<i>Gotta focus on something
easier to kill.</i>

229
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:45,124
<i>Freebo.</i>

230
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:46,332
Dexter!

231
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,225
Shit.

232
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,561
<i>Sorry, I'd rather go rifle
through a dead girl's apartment.</i>

233
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:53,935
Dexter.

234
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,769
We...

235
00:14:57,377 --> 00:15:00,276
I never really got to thank you
for coming to Oscar's wake.

236
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:04,952
It really means a lot to me
and my family, knowing that you...

237
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,576
Are taking a personal
interest in the case.

238
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,079
Okay. Well, you're welcome.

239
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:12,957
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.

240
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:14,542
Then, you'll come for dinner.

241
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:17,335
I rarely take no for an answer.
You're gonna learn that about me.

242
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,018
- I will.
- Honestly...

243
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,246
I wanna pick your brain
about something.

244
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,379
And Syl and I,

245
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,469
You know, we could use the company.

246
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:31,267
The more people around,
the less we think about, you know.

247
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,789
Sure.
You married? You got kids?

248
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:36,596
- No. No kids. A girlfriend.
- Ah, bueno, bueno.

249
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,976
Bring her.

250
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:39,984
Unless you were lying.

251
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,862
You know, about
doing nothing tonight.

252
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:30,282
<i>We're gonna towel off,
and we'll be right back.</i>

253
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,790
Officer Morgan, a music lover.

254
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:40,827
You ever seen this woman?

255
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,838
Quinn send you?

256
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,902
- Different case.
- My debt's to Quinn.

257
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,843
Your debt's with the department.

258
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:52,532
I'm not an information ATM.

259
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:55,976
I'm fucking desperate!

260
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,212
All right?

261
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,802
I got a steaming heap
of crap all on this case.

262
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:04,109
I'm gone through every
scum-sucking ball sack of a pimp I know,

263
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:08,145
every whacked-out hooker.
You are my last-ditch ass-fucked effort!

264
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:13,661
God damn, you got
a mouth on you, woman.

265
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:15,778
Great, thank you.

266
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,584
It's cool. Show me the picture.

267
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,211
Not from the neighborhood.

268
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,884
But from the looks of her, I doubt
she had to pay cash for her habit.

269
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,834
A strawberry? Right.

270
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:33,555
So I'm looking for a dealer
who'll take payment in sex.

271
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:35,391
That'll be about all of 'em.

272
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,556
Yeah.

273
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,898
Look, I can ask
around for you, okay?

274
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,442
Thank you. I'd appreciate it.

275
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,528
But you should stay.

276
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:48,808
Grab a drink

277
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:52,130
and work some of that massive tension
out on the dance floor.

278
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,411
It smells like armpits in here.
And I got a lot of work to do.

279
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:58,457
- There is more to life than policing.
- So I've heard!

280
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:14,495
If we had a house this big, it would
make sense to have another child.

281
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,123
It's a valuable lot.

282
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,618
Look at the lawn. It's so thick.
Be a great place for kids to play.

283
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,349
Zenith zoysia.
Thrives in warm weather.

284
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:27,651
I'm not talking about grass.

285
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:30,778
You're not?

286
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:33,282
I've been trying to talk
about the pregnancy the whole way here.

287
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,911
Maybe you should be
a little less subtle in the future.

288
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,712
I'm trying not to pressure you.

289
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,752
But we have to make a decision
before one's made for us.

290
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,065
You're right, I know. Okay.

291
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,246
Welcome. I'm so glad you came.

292
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:02,279
Made it.

293
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,912
- I'm rita.
- Miguel. Bienvenidos.

294
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:07,513
- So you've met Sylvia?
- Syl, please.

295
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,599
- So you have a beautiful home.
- Great place for kids.

296
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,566
Come on, i'll give you the tour.

297
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:19,138
Strong family resemblance.

298
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,784
My father.

299
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:26,250
He was a drunk and a bastard,
but he had a distinctive chin.

300
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,004
Some people just shouldn't
have kids, you know?

301
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,474
Wish there were a test.

302
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,258
Oscar,

303
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:36,678
he got the best
and the worst of dad.

304
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,350
Me, I just tried
to stay clear, you know?

305
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,474
But...

306
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,150
I suppose he's in me too.

307
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,837
Hard to avoid.

308
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:48,570
Welcome.

309
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,403
I shouldn't drink.

310
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,172
What, are you pregnant?

311
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,663
- You are.
- My God, that's terrific.

312
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:07,204
Or not.

313
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,417
That sounded really bad.

314
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:11,683
I meant...

315
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,052
Miguel and I have actually
been trying for a while now.

316
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,884
It even took once.

317
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:20,051
And Miguel, he...

318
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,690
Wants to start a family before
he makes his run for the D.A.'s office.

319
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,283
But I don't know.

320
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:27,484
I'm happy with the way things are.

321
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,717
I don't wanna force
Dexter into something.

322
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,437
That's kind of what happened
with the ex-husband.

323
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:34,570
Well, that and the fact
that he was a sociopath.

324
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:39,440
I had an ulterior motive
for inviting you here tonight.

325
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,762
Does it involve charging me
with a felony?

326
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,250
No, the truth is, uh,

327
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:50,462
I wanted to talk to someone
inside of this investigation.

328
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,150
See, 'cause all I keep getting
is reassurances, reassurances.

329
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,923
Reassurances make me nervous.

330
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,509
You want me to put you at unease?

331
00:20:57,928 --> 00:20:59,751
I want you to be straight with me.

332
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:02,806
How certain are you that
this bastard Freebo will be found?

333
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:07,714
Very.

334
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,118
So I'm gonna get my shot
at him in court?

335
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:11,899
Well, that could take a while.

336
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:15,138
No more waiting. I'm done waiting.

337
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,238
Is there another option?

338
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,277
I'm an A.D.A.
My brother Ramon is a sheriff.

339
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,517
You don't think we got resources?

340
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:27,956
If our lead pans out,
then we'll talk to homicide.

341
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,317
You have a lead? That's great.
How can I help?

342
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:33,712
Ramon, has his own way of doing things.
I don't wanna drag you into it.

343
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,818
Come on.
You're talking to the guy

344
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:39,426
you caught breaking into
your brother's secure files.

345
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,337
All right.

346
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:47,851
Ramon...

347
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:50,098
may have...

348
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,772
Borrowed a cell phone...

349
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,403
That belonged to Freebo's mother.

350
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,598
He calls mommy...

351
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,115
We can track him.

352
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:05,118
Mother's cell phone.
That's good thinking.

353
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:06,703
It may lead to nothing.

354
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:09,790
<i>Or it may lead them to Freebo
before I can get to him.</i>

355
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,793
<i>I need to check out Teegan's place
as soon as I can get out of here.</i>

356
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:18,847
<i>The hunt.</i>

357
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:22,617
<i>My vision is much sharper
through the eyes of my shadow self.</i>

358
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:25,055
<i>If only I could see this baby
situation as clearly.</i>

359
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,384
<i>I promised Rita
I'd be back in an hour.</i>

360
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:31,728
<i>So she's nesting while I'm hunting,
stalking my prey.</i>

361
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:34,384
<i>I'll start with his prey: Teegan.</i>

362
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,192
<i>What she left behind will talk to me,
guide me to him.</i>

363
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,861
<i>Or...</i>

364
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,720
<i>To a kegger.</i>

365
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:18,274
- What's the password?
- There's a password?

366
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,361
I'm just looking for my girl Teegan.
Where's her room again?

367
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,731
Teegan?
That girl's a ho bag.

368
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:25,490
- She's a ho!
- She's such a ho bag.

369
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,726
She doesn't live here anymore.

370
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:31,038
She's hoeing off campus,
probably living in her ho pad.

371
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:32,951
Give me the address of her ho pad

372
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,000
so I can go tell her
what a ho bag she is?

373
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,752
You have any party favors?

374
00:23:37,637 --> 00:23:39,463
Sorry.
I don't have anything on me, but...

375
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:42,404
- We put out.
- We totally do.

376
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,291
All right, that is so
totally off the hook.

377
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:48,949
But how about I just
trade you for Teegan's address?

378
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,528
22 lincoln log.

379
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:01,193
- I suspect that's Lincoln lane?
- Whatever.

380
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:02,392
Let's get high.

381
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:05,083
You two wait here.
I'll go get my stash.

382
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:11,203
<i>The leaders of tomorrow.</i>

383
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,310
<i>Their parents must be proud.</i>

384
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,177
<i>How much worse
could my child turn out?</i>

385
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:23,112
<i>Do I even wanna know
the answer to that question?</i>

386
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,051
<i>Teegan's ho pad will have
to wait till tomorrow night.</i>

387
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:31,076
<i>I've got a girlfriend and a baby
waiting on my promise to come back.</i>

388
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:32,817
<i>Is this what my life will be like:</i>

389
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,483
<i>Making promises
I'm not sure I wanna keep?</i>

390
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:36,851
<i>It's complicated.</i>

391
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:39,635
<i>The pros and cons
of responsibility.</i>

392
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:41,358
All right.

393
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:42,884
Pros.

394
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,918
Can't we just talk?

395
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,796
Sometimes lists are easier for me.

396
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:53,780
- Give it!
- It's my turn.

397
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,804
All right, pros.

398
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,792
Kids are cute.

399
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:04,047
- Mom!
- No soccer in the house!

400
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,817
Cody!

401
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,491
I have to practice!

402
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:08,969
Cons?

403
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,817
Noise.

404
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:12,931
Time... money.

405
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:15,177
Stretch marks. Saggy boobs.

406
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,515
Less personal freedom.

407
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:21,989
Personal...

408
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,470
freedom.

409
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:28,738
I thought
I said no soccer in the house.

410
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,104
Now just go to your room
until it's time for school.

411
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,046
Son of a...

412
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:44,921
What am I even thinking?

413
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,051
Zack Adelman?

414
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,733
We need to talk
to you about Fred Bowman.

415
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:09,696
Who?

416
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,651
Your pal, Freebo.

417
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,919
The dealer you got
busted with two years ago.

418
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,202
Yeah. Right, right.

419
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,851
Yeah, I haven't seen him in, like...

420
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:20,299
two years.

421
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,211
You mind if we come in, Zack?

422
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,463
He actually doesn't have a choice.

423
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:29,810
- He's a parolee.
- Oh, gosh, you're right.

424
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,150
Couldn't find anything new
on your Jane Doe, sorry.

425
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:43,484
- How's it going?
- Backward.

426
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,233
I don't even think
jane was a hooker.

427
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:49,118
Bummer. So who you looking for?

428
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,753
Her dealer.

429
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:52,937
What the fuck is scrapbooking?

430
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:56,683
The tradition of putting
photos and memorabilia

431
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:00,287
into family keepsake albums,
along with relevant journaling.

432
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:02,415
I don't even want to know
how you know that.

433
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,951
So do you know which dealer
you're looking--

434
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,912
Got it. I'll meet you there.

435
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,589
Might have found
some luck of my own.

436
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,871
The lead on Jane's I.D.

437
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,051
<i>As soon as it gets dark,
I'm back on the hunt</i>

438
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,283
<i>so I can stay ahead of my sister.</i>

439
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:27,732
<i>This department is becoming
annoyingly effective.</i>

440
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:30,804
- You home alone here, Zack?
- Totally.

441
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:34,183
Get on your knees.
Put your hands on your head.

442
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:35,448
Don't move!

443
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,076
W-w-wait! It's just a cat, man.

444
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,328
- It's cool, guys!
- Shut the fuck up!

445
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:49,379
This fuckin' paperwork's
gonna take forever.

446
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,951
Come on, drop it.
Drop it! Come on.

447
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,450
- Just a few pills, man.
- What's the big deal?

448
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,178
The big deal is you're making me cancel
on a very willing woman.

449
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:59,097
Get on your knees
next to your boyfriend.

450
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:02,100
- Let's make a deal, then. Let's trade.
- Stop there, asshole.

451
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:05,384
We don't got time to process
a bribery charge too.

452
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,982
I'm not offering you cash, man.
I've got valuable information.

453
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,358
On Freebo?

454
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,279
Even better.

455
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,717
Chicky Hines.

456
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:16,156
Who the fuck is Chicky Hines?

457
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:19,200
Chicky Hines just went down
for a carjacking homicide.

458
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,450
He's waiting on sentencing now.

459
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,929
Yeah, this guy zack says
Hines didn't do the crime.

460
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,449
He's offering up an alibi for Hines
and another suspect.

461
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,770
I know all about
the Chicky Hines case.

462
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:31,713
He was a big one for the prosecutor,
and guess who that was.

463
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,214
Shit.

464
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,550
Miguel Prado.

465
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,884
So now, not only won't
I be bringing him good news

466
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:41,306
about his brother's case. Worse I'm
gonna undermine his latest conviction.

467
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,158
Think that's what
he wants to hear right now?

468
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:45,185
Doubtful.

469
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:48,450
Christ, vet this.
Oh, yeah, vet this.

470
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,208
Completely.

471
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:54,069
I wanna be absolutely certain that this
is solid before I bring it to Miguel.

472
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,995
Case going all right?

473
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,667
No leads, no insights?

474
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:12,071
Just the pressure, bro.

475
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:15,713
Expected to make decisions,
take responsibility.

476
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,584
You don't know what it's like.

477
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,183
Probably like finding out
your girlfriend's pregnant.

478
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,931
Rita's pregnant?

479
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:24,804
Looks like it.

480
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,512
Holy shit.

481
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:30,971
That's fantastic.

482
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:32,970
It is?

483
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:36,486
My little girl
is the best thing I ever did.

484
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:38,238
I've messed up a lot.

485
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,317
But in my darkest hours,

486
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:42,484
Auri's my light.

487
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:43,660
You wait and see.

488
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:46,697
Thank you.

489
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:48,506
I feel better.

490
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:55,913
<i>A light.</i>

491
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:00,204
<i>Is that even possible?</i>

492
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,603
Higher, daddy!

493
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:14,213
Dexter, come play with us!

494
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,325
Come play with us, daddy.

495
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,321
I'm right behind you, buddy.

496
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,804
You're it, baby.

497
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:40,844
Cody and astor
would be older, you know.

498
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:44,303
I like them this age.

499
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:49,051
I always wanted to be a grandfather.

500
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:53,204
I think we're better off
without you.

501
00:30:55,414 --> 00:30:58,151
Well, it's a beautiful family
you got there, Dex.

502
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:01,361
You couldn't picture this,
could you?

503
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:05,684
I could have surprised you.

504
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,329
Yeah, there's no reason
it couldn't turn out like this.

505
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:30,557
What have you done?!

506
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,518
Where the hell have you been?

507
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:53,304
Street wasn't clear, yo.

508
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:56,172
I get spotted with you,
no more trusty C.I.

509
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:58,996
- Fine. What have you got?
- All right, apartment six.

510
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:01,756
Pimp named Javier, completely new
to the game, but he already has a rep

511
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,494
for his stable of white girls.

512
00:32:03,614 --> 00:32:06,884
If your Jane Doe is a strawberry,
chances are he tried to recruit her.

513
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,012
This is good. Thank you.
Yeah.

514
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,728
You get spotted with me,
no more trusty C.I.

515
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:19,524
- Yeah, but he likes 'em white.
- Does he like 'em strapped?

516
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:24,097
All right, it's cool. But I'll be here,
anything goes sideways.

517
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:35,012
Miami metro.
I'm looking for Javier.

518
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:36,291
Entra, por favor.

519
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:49,285
You're a little young to be
in business for yourself.

520
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,805
I'm a wonder kid.

521
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,267
Can you identify this woman?

522
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:59,522
You'd make a shitload more money
on all fours than you do as a cop.

523
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:02,051
Like I haven't heard that before.

524
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:04,319
Look, little one,
give me a name for this girl,

525
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,696
I won't bust you for being
a piece of shit.

526
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,712
Never seen her.

527
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,751
Besides, she looks
too used up to be an earner.

528
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,989
But you, damn, mami.

529
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,717
I could get you a thou a night.

530
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,126
Give you some spending money for...

531
00:33:20,286 --> 00:33:21,794
extra curricular activities.

532
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:25,369
Think I need to hear that?
Ohh! You sleazy piece of shit!

533
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:28,651
I'm a cop! That's all I need! I'm not
gonna do any fucking scrapbooking!

534
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,136
You got it?! Scrapbooking?

535
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:31,888
You fucked her.

536
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,036
You've seen her?

537
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:39,084
On his dick.

538
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:42,704
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

539
00:33:42,824 --> 00:33:44,817
I think she does.
you fucked a girl who's now dead.

540
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:47,617
Fuck. I picked her up at some party.

541
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,378
All right? I thought

542
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:51,282
- that I could turn her out.
- Her name?

543
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:54,452
I don't know!
Bitch, cunt, "hey, you."

544
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:56,204
Yeah?

545
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,751
This doesn't look good, Javier.

546
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:02,168
All right, I passed her to a friend

547
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:04,796
- who could feed her habit.
- A friend, right.

548
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,547
Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.

549
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:09,584
Freebo?

550
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:10,621
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:12,951
He could deal with her shit
longer than I could.

552
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,084
Maybe he's a patient guy.
I don't know.

553
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:16,684
Maybe not.

554
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:20,150
<i>If my first stab at Freebo
had gone as planned,</i>

555
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,692
<i>Oscar Prado might still be alive,
Miguel wouldn't know who I was,</i>

556
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,751
<i>Teegan would have
lived to ho another day,</i>

557
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,051
<i>and Deb wouldn't be
chasing a Jane Doe.</i>

558
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:31,984
<i>And I wouldn't be watching the clock,
counting the mins till darkness comes,</i>

559
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,016
<i>trying to get the jump
on my friends in blue.</i>

560
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:34,909
Anything?

561
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:38,984
Uh, running additional dna tests
on Oscar Prado's clothing.

562
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:42,125
If Freebo's cut himself,
his blood could be on these clothes.

563
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:45,283
Slam dunk in court.
Is there a chance?

564
00:34:45,403 --> 00:34:46,700
<i>Not even remotely.</i>

565
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,837
Good.

566
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:52,285
Any idea what your sister found?

567
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:55,304
She found something?

568
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:56,729
I'm asking you.

569
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:59,051
She left a message saying
she was vetting a big lead

570
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:00,730
that's gonna make me happy.

571
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,570
No idea.

572
00:35:03,598 --> 00:35:05,398
Got the call.
I'm getting published.

573
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,942
Congratulations.
The shrine worked.

574
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:09,598
Totally.

575
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:20,326
Freebo just called his mother's cell.
I'll have his address by tonight.

576
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,037
And then you will
let me deal with him.

577
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,748
You've done your job.
I'm gonna take it from here, okay?

578
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,982
- Go be with your family.
- Don't fucking sideline me on this!

579
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,808
Hey, Maria.

580
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,048
Your assistant
told me you were here.

581
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:37,427
What do you have
on Freebo, Maria?

582
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:40,617
Well, we're working
on some new angles.

583
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,433
- Means you got shit.
- Excuse us.

584
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:47,397
Go home.

585
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,606
'Cause you're not helping here.

586
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:00,429
- Ramon and his temper.
- Yeah, I remember.

587
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:02,312
But... i get it.

588
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:04,713
I mean, him and Oscar were close.

589
00:36:06,774 --> 00:36:09,083
Miguel, I need to talk to you
about something else.

590
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:12,043
I remember that look.

591
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:19,888
Chicky Hines.

592
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,641
He didn't do
that carjacking homicide.

593
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:29,059
We found new evidence,
and it checks out, Miguel.

594
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,857
I think you convicted
the wrong man.

595
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:35,985
You're serious?

596
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:39,071
I was gonna wait.
I mean...

597
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:41,699
the timing is...

598
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:43,745
But

599
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,646
if Hines is innocent...

600
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:50,458
Miguel, I'm sorry.

601
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:56,201
Oh, this is frustrating
and disappointing.

602
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,742
I really hate my job right now.

603
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:04,068
But, hey...

604
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:07,183
Don't ever think
about holding back on me.

605
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:10,426
Just like now,
you tell me straight.

606
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:14,192
That's the Maria
I've always counted on.

607
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:16,609
Always can.

608
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,406
When all of this is behind us,
I want to get together.

609
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:26,661
The three of us.
You know, as friends.

610
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,746
It's long overdue.

611
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:36,957
Night time.

612
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,703
Why you think Freebo's
still in town?

613
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,345
Because I think he killed
his girlfriend on sunday.

614
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:55,690
Jane Doe.

615
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:59,068
- How do you know it's his girlfriend?
- The C.I. gave me a lead.

616
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,528
I did some follow-up.

617
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,697
- My C.I.?
- Do you have a name

618
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,987
for jane yet?

619
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,618
No, but she was strangled,
wich is consistent

620
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,078
with Freebo's M.O.

621
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,997
If you're right, the Oscar Prado
and Jane Doe cases are linked.

622
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:15,877
I guess
we'll just have to merge them.

623
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:22,925
Freebo's still out there.

624
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,595
- We've got to catch him fast.
- But we got a lead now.

625
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,909
We find the girlfriend's i.d.,
we find her place,

626
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,642
her friends, her family,
then we find him.

627
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,533
I'll coordinate
with the feds.

628
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,756
Ramos, reach out to street patrol.

629
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:39,150
Anton is my contact.

630
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,937
If you wear him out
or blow his cover--

631
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:43,529
I know how to work a C.I.

632
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,491
So unless there's another reason
you don't want me to talk to him...

633
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:54,749
Solid police work.

634
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:56,750
That's how
you earn your shield.

635
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,580
Thanks, sarge.

636
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,256
We're gonna be
working late on this.

637
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:05,656
<i>I'll be working late too.</i>

638
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:14,386
<i>Ho pad indeed.</i>

639
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:40,170
<i>All right, Teegan, tell me
where your homicidal beau might be.</i>

640
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:52,979
<i>Freebo.</i>

641
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:55,467
<i>Hiding out
at his dead girlfriend's house?</i>

642
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:56,634
<i>Risky.</i>

643
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,897
<i>Then again, took me a while to find the
place, knowin' who I was lookin' for.</i>

644
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:05,569
<i>No tools, no syringe,</i>

645
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,706
<i>no kill room, no sure thing.</i>

646
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,006
<i>Hang tight, Freebo.
I'll be back before you know it.</i>

647
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,582
<i>Detached garage.</i>

648
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,501
<i>Perfect place for a kill room.</i>

649
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,088
<i>M-6 bayonet, Vietnam-era.</i>

650
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:32,399
<i>A family keepsake, maybe?</i>

651
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,641
<i>Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.</i>

652
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,431
<i>It's only fitting
I use it to complete the task.</i>

653
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:02,896
It's time for a decision.

654
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:10,614
Having this child
is a huge mistake.

655
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:14,096
I've weighed out all the pros and cons,
and all I've got are cons.

656
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,812
I've been thinking the same thing.

657
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,024
I'm keeping it.

658
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,987
I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

659
00:41:31,237 --> 00:41:33,240
But being a mother
was never one of them.

660
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,328
Dexter,
I'd rather do this with you.

661
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,748
But I've been a single parent
for a long time,

662
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,000
and I think astor and cody prove
that I'm pretty damn good at it.

663
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:47,296
Is this you being subtle again?

664
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:52,911
No, this is me...

665
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:54,726
in all sincerity

666
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,258
saying I will honor your choice.

667
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:00,912
This child is happening.

668
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,557
But your role in its life
is entirely up to you.

669
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,500
<i>Should I take the out rita gave me?</i>

670
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,242
<i>What kind of father
would I be?</i>

671
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:16,700
<i>After all,</i>

672
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:18,703
<i>I kill people.</i>

673
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:42,733
Long time, no see.

674
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:00,021
What the hell is this?!

675
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:06,083
Show and tell.

676
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:12,127
It's been so long since you killed them,
I was afraid you'd...

677
00:43:12,294 --> 00:43:13,299
forgotten.

678
00:43:14,316 --> 00:43:16,996
Oh, I'm sure Teegan
is fresh in your mind.

679
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:32,122
See, now, I didn't--

680
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,268
You killed those girls
in the Everglades,

681
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:42,469
and you got away with it
on a bad warrant.

682
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:44,809
I love those.

683
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:48,459
And then Teegan came along.

684
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:09,637
First, you drained her
of her self-respect

685
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:11,091
and hope.

686
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:15,859
Then last sunday,
you choked the life out of her.

687
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,828
Last sunday...

688
00:44:18,324 --> 00:44:19,693
I was gettin' high with--

689
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,700
It was Cheri or... Carrie.

690
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,946
She's at--

691
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:25,412
She's at--
She's at alpha fee--

692
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:33,567
You seem uncertain.

693
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:37,259
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

694
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:41,605
Just when you've answered
all the questions,

695
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:43,388
another one smacks you
in the face.

696
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,771
Life, life, life.

697
00:44:47,856 --> 00:44:49,479
Life is just like that.

698
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,362
Which is why I prefer death.

699
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,667
Dexter?

700
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:57,546
Is that you?

701
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:06,680
I had the phone records.

702
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,224
Well, what are--

703
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:13,270
Is he in there?

704
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:20,269
Alive?

705
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:39,421
It was self-defense.

706
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:48,672
I found a forensics lead.

707
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,727
It was a long shot.
I wanted to check it out before...

708
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:56,324
I wasted anyone's time.

709
00:46:57,304 --> 00:46:59,691
I didn't expect Freebo to be here.

710
00:47:00,538 --> 00:47:02,421
He surprised me.
He jumped me...

711
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:03,993
with this knife.

712
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,934
That looks like my father's knife from--
From Vietnam.

713
00:47:07,184 --> 00:47:08,714
He gave that to Oscar.

714
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,585
I didn't know what to do.
I fought back.

715
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:27,970
The knife ended up in his neck.

716
00:47:37,556 --> 00:47:39,689
I'm gonna tell you something.

717
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:42,280
I wasn't sure that I could do this.

718
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:44,736
But you did.

719
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:46,662
You did.

720
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,376
We're gonna get rid
of the evidence.

721
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,476
You should leave. Now!

722
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:56,388
Plausible deniability.

723
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,238
Thank you.

724
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:12,081
You're welcome.
