00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,410
previously on "dexter"...

5
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,920
Open up,perry,it's the police.Open up.

6
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,280
Hey,angel,I got him!

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,880
They really found the ice-truck killer?

8
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,200
I saw him,dex.

9
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,830
I chased him.

10
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,200
The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

11
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,010
Son of a bitch.

12
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,270
I have so many questions for him.

13
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,050
What was his message to me?

14
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,130
Now I need to know him.

15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,450
Fuck are you?

16
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,370
Paul bennett,father on parole.

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,680
Dexter morgan.

18
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,220
I can't think of anything clever to say.

19
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,560
Divorce papers -- sign them now,and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

20
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,160
You think you can really make me back down?

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,690
Are you fucking my wife?

22
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,540
I just wish he'd go away.

23
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,780
I mean,why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,530
All along,I thought this was a game my alter ego and i were playing.

25
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,970
But relationships change,evolve,and is one's getting deep.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,710
I realize now my days are numbered.

27
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,780
So I'd better make the most of them.

28
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,730
Your instincts were dead-on.

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,520
They're always dead-on when it comes to killers.Why is that?

30
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm watchin' you.

31
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,300
(shrink wrap)

32
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,670
What are we looking at here?

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

34
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,080
You?

35
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,250
No,it looks like a lobster.See the claws?

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,590
Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

37
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,160
I like seafood.

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,570
Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

39
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,890
Not as hard as her.

40
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,750
It does look like a suicide.

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,940
Can I get some light in here,please?

42
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,160
Damn power outages.

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,580
I don't know,angel.Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

44
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,120
Women slash their wrists,take pills,something more ladylike.

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,930
Not in miami.

46
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,350
We closed a couple of suicide cases just like this last year,remember?

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,630
Look at this mess.

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,460
That's a fancy bathtub.Rich husband?

49
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,730
House husband and aspiring artist.

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,390
Promising.

51
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,500
So,she supported him? -It looks like that.

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,170
She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

53
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,340
Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women,too,right?

54
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,770
I don't know.

55
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,890
I think so.

56
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,430
Note to self.

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
I don't care what it looks like.Somebody killed her.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,870
We're checking out all the possibilities.

59
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,150
Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

60
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,480
You ow,job stress,the usual,but she was working through it in therapy.

61
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,150
She have any other problems that you're aware of?

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,830
Are you listening to me?

63
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,580
Vanessa didn't kill herself.Criminals stage suicides all the time.

64
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,910
xxxxxxxxx

65
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,550
We'll check into it.We need to collect your clothes for evidence -- standard procedure.

66
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Come on.I got to go.

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,350
There's a dead body in that house.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,360
There's a hot body in here.

69
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,580
I so want to maul you right now.

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,120
I so want you to.

71
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,260
Call me when you're done,okay?

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,510
I'll bring handcuffs.

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,140
Morgan,what took you so long?

74
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,780
Playing "hide the salami" with mr.Prosthetics?

75
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,130
I don't fuck and tell.

76
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,280
Since when?

77
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,150
Can we go inside?I'm kind of wet.

78
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,610
Don'T.

79
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,550
No,I need you to find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

80
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,150
It's always the husband,right?

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,320
Looks like a suicide,but you never know -- younger guy,unemployed.

82
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,410
Maybe he was a boy toy and killed her for her money.

83
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,930
I'm on it.

84
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,500
Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in rain and you're not putting up a fight?

85
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,870
I'm a team player.

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,260
You are?

87
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,360
Fuck you!

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh,hey,dex,come on in.

89
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,520
Where's rita?

90
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,510
Uh,she's stuck in traffic.

91
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,800
Power's out in half the city.

92
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,080
Of course,I love the extra kid time,but,uh,court supervisor

93
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,180
-- not so much.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,950
Hey,you know,I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,150
I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you.

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,010
What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

97
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,530
Sorry.

98
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,050
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,100
Thanks for holding down the fort.

100
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,570
Do you mind if I get going?

101
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,660
I got kids of my own at home to look after.

102
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,720
No,no,no.It's okay.Dexter and i are here now.

103
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,930
great,thank you.Bye,kids.

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,830
Mom,dexter,the lights are out.

105
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,900
They are?Hey,I brought hot chocolate.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
Dad already made us some.

107
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,880
With extra marshmallows.

108
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,460
Tag -- you're it!

109
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,260
I'd love some hot chocolate.

110
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,220
Take two.Looks like he's got extra.

111
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,200
Come here,buddy.

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,630
Mom,can dad stay and put us to bed,please?

113
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,710
I think that's why dexter's here,sweetie.

114
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,860
Dexter doesn't mind.

115
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,970
Only a song,no story -- it's way past your bedtime.

116
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,010
All right,bedbugs,let's leave these two alone.

117
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,860
It's not like they need a chaperone.

118
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,230
Meghan dowd,carolyn jillian,and now vanessa gayle --

119
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,440
all three powerful women,all three shot themselves in the past two years.

120
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,710
They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

121
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,020
Why the sudden interest in suicides?

122
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,890
Morbid curiosity.

123
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,040
What can I do for you?

124
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,010
So many things.

125
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,200
I need the blood-spatter report on vanessa gayle.

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,290
Blood spatter's inconclusive.All I can tell is she was shot at close range.

127
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,180
I wish I had more for you.

128
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,600
Me too.

129
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,830
Maria,the D.A.Needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-killer case.

130
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,540
I'm working on it.

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,870
When'd you talk to the D.A.?

132
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,040
We had dinner last night.

133
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,440
Mayor allen took us out to celebrate neil perry's arrest

134
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,470
-- hell of a good time.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,900
You puta.

136
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm the one who gets perry to confess,and he's got the mayor kissing his ass.

137
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,120
I wouldn't be too upset.Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face.

138
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,120
You still believe we got the wrong guy?

139
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,930
Perry's the pretender to the throne.

140
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,000
The real king is still out there,and he'll kill again.

141
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,580
It's just a matter of time.

142
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,350
Or the ice-truck killer will use perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

143
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,300
You really think that might happen?

144
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,710
If perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall,definitely.

145
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,990
Thanks,dexter.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,940
What if laguerta's right?

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,810
What if the ice-truck killer does disappear?

148
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,410
No.He's got unfinished business with me.

149
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,010
Still,I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

150
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,860
I need a distraction.

151
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,500
Nothing like some little debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear out the old noggin.

152
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,670
Talk to me,ladies.

153
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,270
What do you have in common?

154
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,450
Same sorory?

155
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,260
Pilates instructor?

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,740
Dr.Emmett meridian.

157
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:13,970
The three suicide sisters shared the same therapist -- dr.Emmett meridian.

158
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,670
He must be terrible at his job.

159
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,100
So far,he comes up squeaky clean -- no malpractice suits,no disgruntled patients.

160
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,340
And I thought i was a master at damage control.

161
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,540
Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

162
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,790
Come on in,sean.

163
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,530
Have a seat.

164
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,380
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

165
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,670
Hey,I expect the police show up when I call,right?

166
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,940
The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

167
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,530
So,what brought you here?

168
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,850
A friend of mine died.

169
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,450
She killed herself.

170
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,970
I need to understand why.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,080
How come?

172
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,390
She had everything going for her.It doesn't make sense.

173
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,770
To some people,death makes perfect sense.

174
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,090
Life -- now,that's the puzzle,like you,sean.

175
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,420
What really brought you here?

176
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,070
I just told you I came -- to talk about your friend's suicide,I know.

177
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,350
I think you're using this suicide deal as an excuse to come see me.

178
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,410
You're absolutely right.

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,280
How could you tell?

180
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,220
I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

181
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,160
And what are my real intentions?

182
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,970
As soon as I pay for my lunch,you're gonna tell me that.

183
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,880
Excuse me a second.

184
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,090
Judging from what I've seen so far,I probably will.

185
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,160
This guy's good.

186
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,290
So why do his patients keep dying?

187
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,030
Vanessa's estimated time of death was monday at 7:00 P.M.

188
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,590
Meridian was in session with scott solomon.

189
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,960
I wonder if mr.Solomon kept his appointment that night.

190
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,620
So,we got almond chicken,pork fried rice.

191
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,230
So,sean,let's start with the basics.You married?

192
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,840
No.

193
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,760
Girlfriend? -Yes.

194
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,250
Sex life?

195
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,870
It's personal.

196
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,470
And this is therapy,where we share personal things.

197
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,830
You know,it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself.

198
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,630
Why did you become a psychiatrist?

199
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,860
See what you just did?

200
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,650
Trying to take control like that?

201
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,440
You probably get away with it most of the time,too,right?

202
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,260
That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

203
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,190
Let me ask you something,sean.

204
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,200
Have you ever been close to anybody?

205
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,500
My foster father.

206
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,600
He's the only one who ever really knew me.

207
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,120
You're adopted?

208
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,870
Harry took me in when I was 3.

209
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,540
So tell me about harry.

210
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,940
What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

211
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,800
You know,normal father-son stuff.

212
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,610
All right.Stop.Enough.

213
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,970
Are you all right?

214
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm fine.

215
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,800
Nice ambush.

216
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,150
That was the perfect point of attack.

217
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,040
I can't believe I finally got you.

218
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,230
I won.

219
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
This isn't a game,dexter.

220
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,900
No,I-I know.

221
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,200
It's not supposed to be fun.

222
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,650
Yeah,yeah,it's just -- you think I want to teach you these things?

223
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,350
This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair.

224
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,400
This is about survival,dex,nothing else.

225
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,990
Got it?

226
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,040
You've got a visitor,perry.

227
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,690
Miss me?

228
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,140
Don't flatter yourself.

229
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,280
I have to comb through your case before the trial,

230
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,270
make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck killer.

231
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,530
Um,I confessed.

232
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,930
What more do you need?

233
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,600
The evidence to line up.

234
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,370
We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper

235
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,510
we found at the abandoned hospital.

236
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,730
Liquid nitrogen--I use it to freeze the body parts.

237
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,720
It's extremely effective,but it burns like a bitch.

238
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,100
Or you knew your prints wouldn't match,

239
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,510
so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

240
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,790
Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

241
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,920
Just covering my bases,neil.

242
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,380
We both want the same thing.

243
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,070
10 minutes alone with angelina?

244
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,520
To see you convicted.

245
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,480
What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

246
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,560
how about immortality?

247
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,290
We found your mother's body under your house.

248
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,600
Now,you can go down as a pathetic loser who killed mom

249
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,200
or the most heinous killer in florida's history

250
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,650
-- your choice.

251
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,040
If I'm going to become a legend,

252
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,550
I need to be memorialized.I want a reporter here to interview me -- front page.

253
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,880
You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

254
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,510
If you want me to cooperate,

255
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,340
I'm sure you'll find a way.

256
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,090
Meridian had one thing right.

257
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,420
I do crave control.

258
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,790
The longer the ice-truck killer maintains radio silence,the less control I have.

259
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,080
Craigslist--it's desperate,I know,but apropos.

260
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,820
Personal ads are filled with desperation.

261
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,800
"Tyler from key west," "speedos tanning on the beach,"

262
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,720
"touched your tits on friday night"

263
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,540
at least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen,

264
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,370
and neither am I.

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,420
"Dear ken,I'm in pieces.

266
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,290
Why the cold shoulder?

267
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,870
Love,barbie.

268
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,190
Hey,I got it.

269
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,420
Thanks.

270
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,870
Hey,I know you -- monday night at meridian'S.

271
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,670
You're always leaving your 7:00 when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

272
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,030
You missed last week,right?

273
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,990
No,I was there.

274
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,060
I don't remember ever seeing you,though.

275
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,320
How do you like him?

276
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,070
Meridian?

277
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,360
Best thing that's ever happened to me...

278
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,230
so far.

279
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,490
How about you?You finding him helpful?

280
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,480
I'm a sociopath.There's not much he can do for me.

281
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,460
Cute and funny.

282
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,170
Let me guess -- taken.

283
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,950
Girlfriend.

284
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,540
Lucky girl.

285
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,690
Well,thanks for the help,but I can handle it from here.

286
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,470
All right.

287
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,880
So meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

288
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,570
My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside,

289
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,300
I need a follow-up appointment to dig a little deeper.

290
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,340
Isn't that what therapy's all about?

291
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,350
I love your body.

292
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,120
I love your legs.

293
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,270
I love your arms.

294
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,370
I couldn't have made them better myself.

295
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,160
Are you crying?

296
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm fine.

297
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
Th what?

298
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,750
I don't know.

299
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,740
I'm sure this is really hot,crying after sex.

300
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,420
Everything about you is hot.

301
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,260
Tell me what you're feeling.

302
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,390
It'S...

303
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,410
it's just...

304
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,560
every time I've ever been naked with someone...

305
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,200
we just fuck.

306
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,140
But not this time?

307
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,640
This is different.

308
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,400
It feels like...

309
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,240
I hate saying this.It sounds so fucking cheesy.

310
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,500
It feels like making love.

311
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,380
yes

312
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,010
But,ew,promise me you'll never say that again.

313
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,360
What if I do?

314
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,490
Are you gonna cry about it?

315
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,720
You're so fucked up.

316
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,220
What's up,rock star?

317
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,650
Look at you.

318
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,610
What you doing?

319
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,210
Where's the supervisor?

320
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh,she called on my cell and canceled.

321
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,350
Who wants to play monster tag?

322
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,910
I do.

323
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,870
I'm coming after you.

324
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,400
You better run.

325
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,640
Paul,you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

326
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,030
I know.Big bad paul needs a babysitter.

327
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,060
It's your day off,right?

328
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,990
Now,would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

329
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,000
I have a lunch date with dexter.

330
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,790
Come on.It'll be fun.

331
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,620
Mom,dad,come on.

332
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,720
I guess I could call dexter.

333
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,400
It's officia-- I'm nominating you for mom of the year.

334
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,130
Here comes the monster.

335
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,290
Contrary to what dr.Meridian thinks,I don't always keep others at a distance.

336
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,270
Things are looking up already.

337
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,760
Hey,Barbie,how'd you like to suck my cock?

338
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,650
Or not.

339
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,490
Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

340
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,940
Hey,what's up?You were looking for me?

341
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,970
What did forensics come back with on vanessa gayle?

342
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,340
Gunpowder on her hand,none on her husband's,

343
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,670
high-angle trajectory,no drugs in the tox screen.

344
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,990
It all points to suicide.

345
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,520
No chance it was murder? -Too bad,huh?

346
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,140
I had the husband pegged,too.

347
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Was hoping he could help me score my own sugar mama.

348
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,240
Try craigslist.

349
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,820
I already did -- nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

350
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,800
Miami metro can close this case as a suicide,but I'm still not convinced.

351
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,880
Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

352
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,200
You seem on edge today.

353
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,470
I'm not getting what I came here for.

354
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,710
What'd you come here for?

355
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,960
We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about suicide.

356
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,860
Or feelings. -Heaven forbid.

357
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,850
So,what do you want to talk about?

358
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,340
Fakes--

359
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,150
people who pass themselves off as something they're not.

360
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,850
Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

361
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,060
A brave politician.

362
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,540
A jew for jesus.

363
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,040
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

364
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,010
Is that how you feel,sean?

365
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,310
Like you're hiding a dark secret?

366
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,420
No,I wasn't talking about me.

367
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,360
Who were you talking about?

368
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,710
You.

369
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,330
That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

370
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,650
You think I can't care about you,that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

371
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,920
Bingo.

372
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,270
You got me.

373
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,930
I do have another motive.

374
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,540
It's called a paycheck.

375
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,930
But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

376
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,300
How are things at your job?

377
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,630
Frustrating,to tell you the truth.

378
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,090
What kind of forensics do you do?

379
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,850
Blood spatter.

380
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,160
Most people can't stand blood.

381
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,100
I hate it.

382
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,540
Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

383
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,160
Yeah,it is,actually.

384
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,040
So,okay,how are things with your girlfriend?

385
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,380
She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

386
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,820
Sounds like things are out of your control right now.

387
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,790
No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

388
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,420
That way you never have to feel powerless.

389
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,600
So,then,what should I do?

390
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,420
Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

391
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,720
Let go.

392
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,460
Hey,morgan--I can't believe,out of two million sperm,you were the fastest swimmer.

393
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,980
What are you gonna do about it?

394
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,660
I wanted to kill him,dad.

395
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,470
It must have been tough for you to walk away,son.

396
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,890
I'm proud that you did that.

397
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,990
Don't be,because I still want to kill him.

398
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,930
When's that gonna go away?

399
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,000
I think I have everything I need,mr.Perry.

400
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,600
When's the story gonna run?

401
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,200
Well,they're saving space for tomorrow,front page.

402
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,630
I just got to get back and write.

403
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,920
Thanks so much for your time.

404
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,280
Laguerta: How was your interview?

405
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,720
It was fine.

406
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,330
You ready to talk about the case?

407
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,680
Sure,as soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

408
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,030
You just did.

409
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,920
Oh,give me a break.That poser was one of your cop buddies,but nice try.

410
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,100
In case you forgot,neil,you're the one in jail.I call the shots.

411
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,050
I could invoke my miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

412
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,210
If you wanted a lawyer,you'd have one by now.

413
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,480
I know your game,lieutenant.

414
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,690
You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it,but the truth is you're the fraud.

415
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,530
You know what,neil?

416
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm really not in the mood for your shit today.

417
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,370
I found out how you got promoted.

418
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,220
Back when you and sergeant doakes were still partners,

419
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,090
doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer,brought you along for the ride.

420
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,860
How did you get -- when the perp bailed from a third-story apartment,

421
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,650
doakes took the fire escape,sent you to cover the stairs just in case.

422
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,820
Only you got lucky and you made the headline grab,and so the legend began.

423
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,600
I wonder if doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

424
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,080
I deserved that promotion.I'm sure you did.

425
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,530
It was a big bust.

426
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,880
Not as big as catching me,of course,but,uh,let's be honest.

427
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,230
You didn't catch me.

428
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,830
Your captain did.

429
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,790
At least that's what they're saying on the news.

430
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,300
My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

431
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,190
Tragically for him,he's not out of my hands,

432
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:23,510
not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

433
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,190
Breaking and entering.

434
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,750
I hope he got my good side.

435
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,140
Now,what's he recording for posterity's sake?

436
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,760
Goodbye,dexter.

437
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,480
Hello,ladies.

438
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,540
I need another prescription.

439
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,050
I'm sorry,vanessa.I can't do that.

440
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,430
Just one more,please.

441
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,180
We talked about this.

442
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:39,310
The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

443
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,950
But you don't understand.

444
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,580
I can't do this on my own.

445
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,610
I can't even get out of fucking bed.

446
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,030
I just -- I want to die.

447
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,030
Look at me.

448
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,050
I understand the appeal of death,okay?

449
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
No more pain.

450
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,990
All the career pressure,the hopelessness,gone.

451
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,130
In many cultures,there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

452
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,870
Suicide's respected,even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

453
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,690
How do most people do it?

454
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,390
Well,painkillers are the most common.

455
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,200
But they're entirely unreliable.

456
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,290
The truly courageous of heart...

457
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,630
use guns.

458
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,530
You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment,

459
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,300
and rather than help them,you suggested they end it all.

460
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,650
God,you even gave them permission to use a gun.

461
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,950
Oh,you're a mean one,mr.Shrink.

462
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,310
Create their drug addiction,pull them off,

463
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,950
then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of suicide.

464
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,400
I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

465
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,710
come over,i need you.-rita

466
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,350
Hey,I got your texts.

467
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,700
Is everything...

468
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,160
okay?

469
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,700
It is now.

470
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,210
Okay,just,I wanted to see you.

471
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,870
I felt bad about missing lunch to be with paul and the kids.

472
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,570
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

473
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,840
No,of course not.

474
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,180
How'd it go?

475
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,610
Really good and incredibly scary.

476
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,290
For the first time in a long while,

477
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,590
I saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

478
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,230
Why is that scary?

479
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,310
Because...

480
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,570
I like my new life.

481
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,370
And I finally feel like I'm in control.I never felt that way with paul.

482
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,200
I do with you.

483
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,720
This is a disaster.

484
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,810
I chose rita because she was damaged.

485
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,570
If she gets better,I'll lose her for sure.

486
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,070
I'm ready,dexter.

487
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,910
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

488
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,970
You're the perfect boyfriend.

489
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,150
I want you to spend the night,for real.

490
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,340
I'm so sorry.

491
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,840
I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

492
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,750
But tonight's really not a good night.

493
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm right in the middle of a case.

494
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,310
I'm way too distracted.

495
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,730
Now?

496
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,520
It's so late.

497
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,390
That's all the more reason to get back to work.

498
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,050
The clock's ticking.

499
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,950
But I'll call you tomorrow.

500
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,920
Okay?

501
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,950
Okay?

502
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,650
I can't have sex with rita.

503
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,320
Every time I sleep with a woman,she sees me for what I really am

504
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,600
-- empty

505
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,030
and then she's gone.

506
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,170
But I don't want rita to go,which means I have to deal with this.

507
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,680
I can't kill meridian yet.I need another therapy session.

508
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,030
Stay where you are.

509
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,730
I'm armed.

510
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,740
With bad puns?

511
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,640
You said you needed a favor.What's up?

512
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,780
Take off your pants.

513
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,580
Oh,I should have known it was that kind of favor.

514
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,480
You never ask me to come by before work.

515
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,950
No,but I like the way you think.

516
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:38,120
I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident,really brutal.

517
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,490
Like your mom?

518
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,450
Which is why I want to do something special for her.

519
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,900
I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs

520
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,330
-- yours. -No.

521
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,170
Let me just take a cast. -No way.No.

522
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,120
It'll take 20 minutes,tops.

523
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,800
Come on,please?

524
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,180
Stop being such a chick.

525
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,970
Sit down.

526
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,440
Feels good.

527
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,100
Can I make one of your cock?

528
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,710
That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen,huh?

529
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,850
Not likely.

530
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,840
I haven't told anyone about us.

531
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,030
Embarrassed about banging captain hook?

532
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,350
Not even a little.

533
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,710
Then why?

534
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,440
I guess this matters to me.

535
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,160
So if I talk about it and it goes away,

536
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,980
I'm actually losing something.

537
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,770
That retarded?

538
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,950
No.

539
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,050
I got to tell you,I'm not going anywhere.

540
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,680
Seriously?

541
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,750
And neither are you,'cause I got your leg.

542
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,290
Where the hell you been?

543
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,740
With my boyfriend.

544
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,240
Boyfriend?

545
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,410
We just fucked in his office.

546
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,420
And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

547
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,450
You looking for me?

548
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,600
Shut the door.

549
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,270
Did you tell anyone about our bust,the one that got me promoted?

550
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,410
No.

551
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,300
Nobody in the press?

552
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,190
Maria,we talked about this when it happened.

553
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,850
It would fuck up your rep and make me look like a whiny bitch.

554
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,310
It's bad for both of us.

555
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,570
So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report,right?

556
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,410
I guess.

557
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,290
We have to have our firewall checked.

558
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,980
She was sitting on top of me,basically naked...

559
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,800
asking me to spend the night,

560
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,270
and didn't know what to do.

561
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,770
It's okay,sean.

562
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,800
Don't beat yourself up.

563
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,680
Your girlfriend really means something to you.

564
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,350
I know that.

565
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,460
If she means something,why do I run away from her?

566
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,860
The same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

567
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,290
You're afraid they won't like what they see.

568
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,590
Yeah,I think you're right.

569
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,210
How can I change that?

570
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,910
Well,for starters,you accept the fact that we all have a big,bad wolf hiding inside of us,

571
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,890
a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

572
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,490
Do you?

573
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,600
Of course I do.

574
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,810
Really?

575
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,080
And how do you deal with your wolf?

576
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,090
Well,first of all,I accepted that it was therE.

577
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,910
I made friends with it.

578
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,260
And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

579
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,480
At least three times that we know about.

580
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,090
Can we get back to the sex thing?

581
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,020
This is all about sex.

582
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,810
The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

583
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,760
No,I've surrendered control.

584
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,480
It's not like my girlfriend hasn't been,you know,south of the border.

585
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,040
That's not what I'm talking about.

586
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,320
Intimacy--really letting go face-to-face--there's nothing more difficult than that.

587
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,510
there's nothing more difficult than that.

588
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,220
The minute you start to accept who you are,

589
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,510
you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

590
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,290
What are you doing?

591
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,030
I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

592
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,250
It might bring some things to the surface.

593
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,730
What kinds of things?

594
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,360
Well,there must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless,right?

595
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,290
Foster child,no control over your destiny.

596
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,580
If we can bring some of those memories to the surface,we might find the root of your control issues.

597
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:43,490
First,I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

598
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,480
I want you to count each breath,okay?

599
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,850
In,1,and out,2.

600
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,270
Just give it a try.

601
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,270
This is ridiculous.I could be killing him right now.

602
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:06,500
Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

603
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,350
Hey,morgan.

604
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,890
You still fucking your sister?

605
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,020
Leave me alone,josh.

606
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,230
I told you to walk away.

607
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,370
God damn it,dexter.

608
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,020
There are consequences to everything you do in life.

609
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,720
Lose control,become powerless,and it's over.

610
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,260
I found the grave,son.

611
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,570
U're saying I'll be like this forever.

612
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,700
Mommy!

613
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,520
I have to get out of here.

614
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,890
Sean,come here.Sean,sean.

615
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,380
Oh,my god.

616
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,480
Are you okay?

617
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,110
Stay.Stay with me.

618
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,570
You're sweet.

619
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,400
I am?

620
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,770
Next time,we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

621
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,790
You want there to be a next time?

622
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,200
And a time after that.

623
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,820
Don't you?

624
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,250
No.I mean,yeah.

625
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,540
I just...

626
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,410
I didn't freak you out?

627
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,050
Why would you think that?

628
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,660
Dexter,there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

629
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,760
I really hope you came to apologize.

630
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,010
Nope.

631
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,930
I came for a consult.

632
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,730
And you brought beverages?

633
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,650
I got this on loan from the morgue.

634
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,570
Now,I could use an expert opinion,specifically your expert opinion.

635
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,880
See,we can't figure out exactly how the killer cut off this head.

636
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,850
Can you?

637
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,070
Nope.

638
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,060
Really?

639
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,630
I think you can.

640
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,540
I mean,you chop people up,don't you?

641
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,560
Maybe you need a closer look.

642
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,560
No.Keep it away.

643
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,400
I talked to the medical examiner.

644
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,730
He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

645
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,470
Said it might have been a heart attack.

646
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,760
I killed her.

647
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,380
You don't have the balls.

648
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,960
I mean,you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

649
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,640
And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

650
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,650
Not exactly the same stuffing roadkill,is it?

651
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,520
Oh,fuck you.

652
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,720
Serial killers get all the glory,don't they,neil?

653
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,700
Especially the ice-truck killer.

654
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,450
You know,you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

655
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,390
Oh,bullshit.I know details about the case,

656
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,390
things that weren't published in the newspapers.

657
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,870
That's because you hacked into our computer system.

658
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,330
I had the I.T.Guys check our firewall.

659
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,170
The dmz was breached.You read all our police reports.

660
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,100
You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

661
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,450
Nice touch,by the way.

662
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,260
Why are you doing this?

663
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,790
Because you're not a killer.

664
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,500
You're a coward and a fake,aren't you?

665
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,160
Maybe you need another look.

666
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,230
No,take it away.

667
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,850
All right,I lied,okay?

668
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,610
Just,I need you to take it away from me...

669
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,760
please.

670
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,590
So,what's on your mind,lieutenant?

671
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,380
We got a lot to get done before perry's trial.

672
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,230
Yeah,about that trial -- I've got some bad news.

673
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,970
Perry recanted his confession this morning.

674
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,290
What are you talking about?

675
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,780
I was going over some details with him at county,

676
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,390
and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

677
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,180
He's a wannabe,tom.

678
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,490
Just wanted his 15 minutes,that's all.

679
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,840
How do you know which time he was lying?

680
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,020
All due respect,maria,

681
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,560
if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession,

682
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,830
our jails would be empty.

683
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,980
We're going to trial.

684
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,200
All due respect,captain,that's really not up to you.

685
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,300
It's up to the D.A.

686
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,750
I understand your frustration,maria,

687
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,710
but I reviewed the D.A.Work sheets.

688
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,520
The evidence is compelling.

689
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,260
We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

690
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,110
Fair enough.

691
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,770
If that's what you two want,I'm fully behind it.

692
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,210
I was really worried about you.You sure you're all right?

693
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,180
I kept calling your house,but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

694
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,770
You wouldn't have reached me anyway,'cause I was at my girlfriend'S.

695
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,330
I spent the night,face-to-face.

696
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,500
Sean,that's very good.

697
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,890
It's all good,doctor.

698
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,990
I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

699
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,160
You can't control other people,you know?

700
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,910
This is a real breakthrough.You should be proud of yourself.

701
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,650
I am proud.

702
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:11,310
Truth be told,I never expected to make progress in therapy.

703
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,240
That's not true.

704
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:16,500
If that were true,you never would have come in here in the first place.

705
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,860
What do you want to focus on today?

706
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,220
I'm glad you asked that.

707
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone befor

708
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,020
okay.

709
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,720
I'm a serial killer.

710
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,820
Oh,god.

711
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:52,820
Oh,that feels so amazing to say out loud.

712
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,980
Well,you must be letting go,because I've never heard you make a joke before.

713
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,950
I'm not joking.I kill people.

714
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,690
There it is again.

715
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,180
You should try it.

716
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,820
I know.

717
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,450
Your big,bad wolf has racked up a ti little death toll.

718
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,930
I'm just kidding.I disabled the cameras,and I copied the files.

719
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

720
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:25,750
Then focus on your breathing,and maybe you'll remember -- meghan,carolyn,vanessa.

721
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,880
Those sessions are confidential.

722
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,780
I'm a control freak,I know.

723
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,050
But I watched your home movies.

724
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:35,000
It's amazing stuff--drugs,guns,and a crazy psychiatrist.

725
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,010
No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

726
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,760
You got quite the god complex.

727
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,290
This session's over.

728
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,690
Not so fast,doc.

729
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,580
You're awake.

730
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,730
Shall we analyze your dreams?

731
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,990
No.

732
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,950
That's right.You've already told me everything I need to know,

733
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:29,120
except why powerful women?

734
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,720
You took powerful women and made them powerless.

735
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,170
They left behind families,children.

736
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,290
I have to confess,I'm a little conflicted.

737
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,530
You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

738
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,020
The fact that I'm a killer...

739
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,690
that's something I can't control.

740
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,840
You helped me to accept what I really am.

741
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,190
I'm grateful for that.

742
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,820
But...

743
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,630
I was raised with a certain set of principles.

744
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,650
I'm sorry,doc.

745
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,590
Actions have consequences,and this is yours.

746
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,100
I'm gonna have to let you go.

747
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,970
Is that eric carmen?

748
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,510
no.

749
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,720
What's up?

750
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,740
I'm running late.I'm in the middle of some housework.

751
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,580
If I don't get it done,it's gonna drive me crazy.

752
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,350
I never knew you were so anal.

753
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,630
And I'm a neat freak.

754
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,280
You're just full of surprises,huh?

755
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,120
Oh,you have no idea.

756
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,860
I'll be there as soon as I can,okay? -Okay.

757
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,450

758
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:15,060
