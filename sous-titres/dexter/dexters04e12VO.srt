00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,639
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,042
Dexter Morgan,
good suburban husband,

3
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,144
happy father of three...

4
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,145
living the dream.

5
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,496
daddy kills people.

6
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,698
- it's always the same
three kills with trinity:

7
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,500
a young woman in a bathtub

8
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,636
followed by a mother
falling to her death

9
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,471
and ending with
a man getting bludgeoned.

10
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,508
- trinity...
he doesn't belong here.

11
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,876
it doesn't make sense.

12
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,412
- hi, honey.
- trinity's a husband.

13
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,531
a father.
he's...

14
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,000
like me.

15
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:17,536
- lundy came to miami
to hunt this guy.

16
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,806
i think he got too close,
and i think it got him killed.

17
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,693
- i need a partner, dexter.
someone i can trust.

18
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,979
unless you can be
completely honest with me,

19
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,015
i don't want to do this
anymore.

20
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,200
i'm married.

21
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,118
- stay the hell away
from my wife.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,319
- ah!

23
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,637
- there's only one person
who can help me.

24
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,189
- arthur mitchell.
- kyle butler.

25
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,423
- four walls, one heart.

26
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,908
we build homes
for the homeless.

27
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:43,178
- still so much to learn
about handling the kids

28
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,646
and the wife.

29
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,182
- choose your weapon.
- or maybe not.

30
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,253
- kill him now.

31
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,089
- no more confessions,
no more good deeds,

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,375
and no more fucking remorse.

33
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,676
this isn't how you die.

34
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,511
- it's been my dad's baby
for years.

35
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,264
fucking hate you!
fucking asshole!

36
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,567
- get the fuck...

37
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,220
off of him!

38
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:12,658
i should have fucking killed you
when i had the chance.

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,028
- did you and my father
have a romantic relationship?

40
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,281
- i was one of his girlfriends,
if that's what you're asking.

41
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,398
- there were others?

42
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,618
- laura moser, my mother.

43
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,853
- you remember now?
- i have a brother.

44
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,055
- watch your mom die...

45
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,675
- it's all right, little guy.
you're safe now.

46
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,010
- arthur!

47
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,149
oh, my god.
the boys begin the cycle.

48
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,600
if i can make the police think

49
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,918
the trinity killer
is someone else,

50
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,353
arthur's all mine.

51
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,138
stan beaudry.

52
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,257
a decoy.

53
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:49,194
- i just need to make sure
the police find arthur's dna.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,780
stan beaudry
is now the trinity killer.

55
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,283
- i killed lundy.
- wait-no!

56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,567
don't, don't!

57
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,605
- who are you, kyle?

58
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:03,108
what is it you want?

59
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,552
hello...

60
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,421
dexter morgan.

61
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,365
- he knows my name,
occupation.

62
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,700
he can find out
about my family.

63
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,153
my family.

64
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,656
what the hell have i done?

65
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,962
i'm sorry, sir.
you're on the wrong floor.

66
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:43,248
- no, it's exactly
the right floor.

67
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:52,908
- we should talk
somewhere else.

68
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:55,294
- somewhere private...

69
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,748
so you can extort money
from the trinity killer?

70
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:06,171
- so what do you want?

71
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,225
- i want you to disappear
from my life.

72
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,144
like a ghost.

73
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,980
a really annoying ghost.

74
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,999
- and you'll disappear
from my life?

75
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:20,202
- i couldn't care less
about your life.

76
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,954
or death.

77
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,525
unless you get in my way.

78
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,036
if i were you,
i'd give up vigilante-ism.

79
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:41,056
you're not very good at it.

80
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,110
good-bye...

81
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:49,765
dexter morgan.

82
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,850
- he's right.
i screwed up.

83
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,770
i let it come to this.

84
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,246
but no more.

85
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,569
no fucking more.

86
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,224
- morgan.

87
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,959
- come on, quinn.
not today.

88
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,128
- jesus, morgan, middle
of the day, you're out again?

89
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,947
- yeah, i have some
secondary analysis to do

90
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,782
on the kyle butler case.

91
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,384
- there's a spatter report
on christine hill's suicide

92
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,752
sitting on your desk-
you even look at it?

93
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,070
- i don't need to.
it's a cut-and-dry suicide.

94
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,905
- yeah, but you have
to sign off on it.

95
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,273
that's how it works-
you sign off, case closed.

96
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,608
it gets put in a file cabinet

97
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,843
so i don't have to think
about it or hear about it

98
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,412
or be fucking reminded of-
- i'll get to it.

99
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,414
- what, when you're done
chasing tail?

100
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,183
- you do not want to question
my loyalty to my family, quinn.

101
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,484
not today.

102
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,120
- do your fucking job!

103
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,562
- great.
fucking mess.

104
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,818
- do you even have
a plan here?

105
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,770
- follow him and look
for an opportunity.

106
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:20,655
- what if he keeps on
driving?

107
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,827
then i keep on driving.

108
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,029
it's rita.
- don't answer it.

109
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,498
- could be important,
about the baby or something.

110
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,199
hey, you.

111
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,452
- i have something
very important to say.

112
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,519
- everything okay?

113
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,324
- i want my honeymoon
with you

114
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,860
this weekend.

115
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,865
- it's not really a good time.

116
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,433
- it's a perfect time.

117
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,436
astor and cody
will be in disney world.

118
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,940
- with paul's parents.
i know, i remember.

119
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,759
- and harrison will be with us,
but it'll still be romantic.

120
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:00,328
- i think it's...
fantastic.

121
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:04,449
- great. i'll start booking
flights and a hotel-

122
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,219
- hey!
- gotta go.

123
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,204
- what the... fuck, man!

124
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,023
told you not to answer it.

125
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,708
- i'll deal with it later.

126
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,578
- the messes are piling up.

127
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:41,836
¶ ¶

128
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:06,027
- isolated.
no security. perfect.

129
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,748
gotta risk it.

130
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:14,352
may be the only
opportunity i get.

131
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,686
- three post cards
don't have a match.

132
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,655
trinity sent these
to christine from cheyenne,

133
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,123
topeka,
and bloomington, illinois.

134
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,092
- morgan-
- lundy never uncovered

135
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,160
trinity killings
in these cities...

136
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,496
which means there could be
as many more as nine murders.

137
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,231
- go home.
- i'm gonna call homicide

138
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,599
in each of these cities.

139
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:47,402
- christine hill
just committed suicide.

140
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,603
in front of you.

141
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,705
four hours ago.

142
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,308
now, take a personal day.
get some closure.

143
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,110
that's an order.
- these cities-

144
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,896
- i'll call their
homicide departments.

145
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,447
- stan beaudry is-

146
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,900
- is our number one
trinity suspect.

147
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,718
we're on it.

148
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:06,888
- what's she still
doing here?

149
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:10,992
- she's going.

150
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,995
closure, huh?

151
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,502
- some of the cities
on these post cards...

152
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,306
what?

153
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,875
- you're my husband.

154
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,344
- and i have a wife.

155
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,714
- so... what do we do now?

156
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,849
- we find the trinity killer.

157
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,718
- no. i mean, do we...

158
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,503
move in together?

159
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,489
- married people do that.

160
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:45,677
- my house?
- your house sounds fine.

161
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,030
- valerie?
debra morgan.

162
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,398
yeah, fine.

163
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,951
you said my dad left you
for another c.i.?

164
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,869
you followed him
to her house?

165
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,622
any chance you remember
where she lives?

166
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,425
really?
great.

167
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,579
my day just got wide open.
you up for a road trip?

168
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,884
¶ ¶

169
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,291
finally, it's over.

170
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,842
savings account closed.
checking account closed.

171
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,131
you were gonna leave town,
weren't you?

172
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,134
and probably leave
your family destitute too.

173
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,970
eventually the police
will see through stan beaudry,

174
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,223
and they'll get on to you.

175
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,778
but you'll be missing
with all your money,

176
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,930
and everyone will assume...

177
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,767
that you skipped the country.

178
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:19,654
luck is finally
working with me.

179
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,357
- that's the car right there

180
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,259
that swiped me
over on riverside.

181
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,027
- seriously?
fuck!

182
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:44,279
- hey, that's him!
that's the prick.

183
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:46,481
- who, me?
- you fucking hit my car!

184
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,800
learn how to drive,
you idiot.

185
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,101
- 'cause being rude
always helps

186
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,669
in a tense situation, right?

187
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,654
- calm down.

188
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,655
- look, i'm sorry.

189
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,857
i was on my way
to a crime scene.

190
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,358
miami metro, forensics.

191
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,811
- come on, he's working
the whole cop brotherhood angle?

192
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,129
no one's above the law, pal.

193
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,414
- okay. be cool.

194
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,166
diplomatic.

195
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,669
look, obviously, i'll pay
for whatever the damage is.

196
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,920
- you fled the scene
of an accident.

197
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,872
- i didn't flee.
i was in a hurry.

198
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,874
to solve a crime.
- so you stop at a bank?

199
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,925
that's bullshit!

200
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,260
- i'm just asking for

201
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,312
a little professional
courtesy here.

202
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:18,813
- you might pull that shit
down at miami metro,

203
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:19,914
but here
at the sheriff's department,

204
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,032
we don't put up
with that shit.

205
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,267
- come on!
- caught on tape, asshole.

206
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,335
- don't fucking point
that thing at me.

207
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,687
- all right, come here.

208
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,506
okay, buddy...
we're taking you in.

209
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:32,811
- so much for diplomacy.

210
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,449
- you sure
this is the right block?

211
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,720
- pretty sure.

212
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,522
want one?
- quit.

213
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,525
- ugh. i remember when
your dad stopped, cold turkey.

214
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,427
if harry said he was
gonna do something, he did it.

215
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,696
he was a good man.
- he was a man-whore.

216
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,598
- yeah, but he was a lot
of other things too.

217
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,433
like he always
made me feel safe.

218
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,201
and the crowd i ran with-
that meant a lot.

219
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,237
here it is.

220
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,893
what's wrong?

221
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,378
- fucking can't be.
- no. this is it.

222
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,147
i remember the porch.

223
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,901
why, what is it?

224
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,621
- i've been here before.

225
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,108
aah!

226
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,125
oh, god!

227
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,911
he brought me here.

228
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,663
- who did?

229
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,586
- the ice truck killer.
brian moser.

230
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,488
- that was her name!

231
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:37,725
laura moser.
she had two little boys.

232
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,999
- dad, who the hell
were you?

233
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,928
i don't have time
for this shit.

234
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,696
- why are you even in here?

235
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,932
- because of
arthur fucking mitchell.

236
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,368
- wrong.

237
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,102
- all right,
i'm here because

238
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,622
i didn't follow the code.

239
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,542
everything you taught me
was to keep me out of here.

240
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,411
- what else?
- what do you want me to say?

241
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,713
i'm here because i lost it?
yes. i fucking lost it.

242
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,882
- on a fucking cop!

243
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,918
like a fucking amateur.
- fuck you!

244
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,303
it's your number one rule,
don't get caught.

245
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,638
they were gonna find him.

246
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,790
they were gonna find me
with an unconscious man.

247
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,226
- that's not why you lost it.

248
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,511
that's not why
you're in here.

249
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,648
- i couldn't just let them
find him, goddamn it.

250
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,985
<i>i have to be the one
to kill him.</i>

251
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,023
i have to know he's gone.

252
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,141
for my family.

253
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,277
- exactly.

254
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:50,665
you can't think clearly
because of them.

255
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,452
they've done this to you.

256
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,838
- no, my dark passenger
has done this to me.

257
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,041
it's ruining my life.

258
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,494
- it is your life.

259
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,051
- i don't want it to be.

260
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,388
i don't want it.

261
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,709
- you said you had something?
- nothing good.

262
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,494
been back-checking
stan beaudry's trucking routes,

263
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,629
dug up a couple
of past employers.

264
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,465
they put him 3,000 miles away
from pittsburgh in '89

265
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,950
and sacramento in '92.

266
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,569
- and beaudry's only been
connected to a prostitute kill.

267
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:29,837
nothing ritualized about it.

268
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,188
- i told matthews

269
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,658
it was too soon to release
beaudry to the press.

270
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,210
if he's not our guy,
we're gonna look like fools.

271
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,913
- i knew it wasn't beaudry.

272
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,082
what? i'm smarter
than the rest of you.

273
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,935
- then how do you explain
trinity's dna showing up

274
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,154
in beaudry's rig and shack?
- yeah, smart man.

275
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,256
- well, i can't... yet.

276
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,692
- sergeant,
you find something?

277
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:53,828
- i spoke with
bloomington homicide.

278
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,663
i asked about the dates
on this postmark.

279
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:58,716
summer of '92,
there was a bathtub murder,

280
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,568
a jumper,
and a bludgeoning.

281
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,354
- i see a big "but"
on your face.

282
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,389
what?

283
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,807
- guy said it was

284
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,358
the worst month of his life.

285
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,876
in addition
to those murders,

286
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,428
there was
a ten-year-old boy missing

287
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,581
five days prior
to the bathtub kill.

288
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,617
- last week, that ten-year-old
boy went missing here.

289
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,753
- scott smith.
- exactly.

290
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,455
so i called a few cities.

291
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:23,291
- ten-year-old boys
missing?

292
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,409
- every time.

293
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:28,245
five days before
each cycle began.

294
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:30,381
- and lundy was only
looking at homicides,

295
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,966
not missing persons.

296
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,301
- get scott smith down here.

297
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,086
let's check
every trinity city

298
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,387
for missing ten-year-olds.

299
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,807
we may be looking
at a whole new pattern.

300
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,672
- "brian and...

301
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,876
dexter moser"?

302
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,616
- dexter morgan?

303
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,617
- yeah.

304
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,785
- it's your lucky day.

305
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,620
- yeah. it feels like it.

306
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:13,091
- we're outta bunks
for the night.

307
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,176
- there's a shot
arthur's still unconscious.

308
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,178
bummer.

309
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,764
- yeah, well, budget cuts
are gettin' worse and worse.

310
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,149
but since you're miami metro,

311
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,084
we figured we could at least
do you the favor

312
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,920
of calling your wife,
have her come pick you up.

313
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:27,722
- my wife?

314
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:39,000
how is it i can kill people
and feel no regret...

315
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,451
but disappointing rita

316
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:43,704
makes me feel like
the scum of the earth?

317
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,957
i'm sorry.

318
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,993
- i know.

319
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,213
- i just had a...

320
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,798
bad day and...

321
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,683
let it get to me, i guess.

322
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,185
- first it was smashing
that light,

323
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,387
which was weird.

324
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,123
and then you punched elliot,
which i actually liked.

325
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:07,028
but now you...
pick a fight with a sheriff?

326
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,230
i don't understand.
i want to, but...

327
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,232
- i wish i could explain.

328
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:14,535
- try.
please.

329
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,857
- sometimes i'm...
just goin' along,

330
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,712
and everything seems okay,
and then this...

331
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,499
darkness creeps in,
and it takes over.

332
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,752
- makes you sound crazy.

333
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,506
- maybe i am.

334
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,558
- no.

335
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,561
no, i don't believe that.

336
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,736
- i'll be right behind you.

337
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:12,293
¶ ¶

338
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,594
shit.

339
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,018
- well, you actually think

340
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,221
dad'll let you go
to the winter prom?

341
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,757
- he doesn't have to know.
- we can figure something out.

342
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:31,462
- arthur!

343
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,030
we didn't know when
to expect you-

344
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,615
- bring me your jewelry-
gold, silver,

345
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,766
anything with a stone in it.

346
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,551
and all the cash in your purse.

347
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,736
- why? what's wrong?

348
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,771
- and your wedding ring.

349
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,290
- no. this is mine.

350
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,624
arthur!
- hey!

351
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,742
- don't, jonah, no!

352
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,327
okay.
- daddy, what's happening?

353
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,796
- i need the money you keep
behind your headboard.

354
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,447
don't pretend.
i know it's there!

355
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:52,500
- no, daddy-daddy, why-
- the silver pendant i gave you.

356
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,802
now!
- what the hell is goin' on?

357
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,172
what did you do?
- arthur, please, no!

358
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,625
- you're lucky i don't pull
the fillings out of your teeth!

359
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,961
don't ever question me!
i gave you everything you have.

360
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,265
i will take it all away!

361
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,933
collect your things.

362
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,651
i've got some business
to attend to.

363
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,772
- other than stealing
from your family?

364
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,309
<i>- someone stole something
from me.</i>

365
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:22,613
and i'm gonna find him.

366
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,032
- we-we should just go.

367
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,118
leave and never come back.

368
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,836
- he'll find us.

369
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,621
- this-this is our chance.

370
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:33,341
he's-he's in trouble.
he's insane.

371
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,126
mom!
- what?

372
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,677
- please.

373
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,213
- we'll live in fear.

374
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:43,884
- we already do.

375
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,128
- debra.
oh, sorry.

376
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,180
detective morgan.
have a seat.

377
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,399
- thanks for your time,
deputy chief.

378
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,867
i know you're busy.

379
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,403
i need to talk to you
about a case.

380
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,573
it was one of my father's
old cases from a long time ago.

381
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,542
and you're the only one
still around from those days.

382
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,412
- suddenly i feel ancient.

383
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,749
- look, it was
a quadruple homicide...

384
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,668
out at the ports.

385
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,870
- in a shipping container.

386
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,723
- you were there?
- no. wasn't my case.

387
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,876
but i remember harry's face
when he came back from it.

388
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:28,879
said he'd never seen
so much blood.

389
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:44,195
- my dad said dexter's parents
died in a car accident.

390
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,564
that's not true, is it?

391
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,417
- no.

392
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,621
- my father's c.i.,
laura moser,

393
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:57,842
was murdered
in that shipping container.

394
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,245
she had two boys.

395
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:06,884
one of those boys was dexter?

396
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,854
please tell me the truth.

397
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,426
- harry adopted him.

398
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:17,978
the other boy was too damaged
by the incident.

399
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,930
no shit.

400
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:24,151
he grew up to be
the ice truck killer.

401
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,153
you knew.

402
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:31,275
- debra, your father
wanted to protect you.

403
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:34,328
he didn't want either one of you
to ever know.

404
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,081
and you both turned out
pretty damn well.

405
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,133
so i think
he made the right call.

406
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,452
- yeah?

407
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,638
well, i know now.

408
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,725
what the hell am i supposed
to do with this?

409
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,778
- you keep it to yourself.

410
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,481
- oh, fuck! jesus!

411
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,483
quinn, what?

412
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,402
i'll be right there.

413
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,824
- we should go
to the keys tomorrow.

414
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:38,642
for our honeymoon.

415
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,978
- no, i'm not sure
that's-

416
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,296
- you can fly down
in the morning.

417
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,849
i'll follow you after work.
have a spa day. indulge.

418
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:49,453
please?

419
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,704
- dexter, uh...

420
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,457
- look, i know you're upset.

421
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,194
you have every right to be.

422
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:01,582
you had to pick up
another husband from jail.

423
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,388
- y-you think i'm upset
because you're like paul?

424
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,390
- i'm worse.

425
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,792
i know.
- dexter.

426
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:17,064
whenever... they picked up paul,
it was a relief.

427
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,100
and life got easier.

428
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,354
without you...

429
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:31,145
you're the most important
person in our lives.

430
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,149
what's upsetting me
is the idea of losing you.

431
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,886
you have your demons.

432
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,121
i accept that.

433
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,158
because i know that you don't
have to be a slave to them.

434
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,844
- i wish that were true.

435
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,698
- it is.
i know you.

436
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,750
better than
you know yourself.

437
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:56,303
you can conquer

438
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,088
whatever darkness
there is in you.

439
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:01,559
i know you can.

440
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,899
- i want to be that man.

441
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,772
- you already are.
- please.

442
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,410
please fly to the keys
tomorrow morning.

443
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:24,214
i wanna meet you.

444
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,718
truly, there's nowhere
i'd rather be.

445
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:43,150
- trinity sure went through
a lot of effort

446
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,153
to make us think
that beaudry was our guy.

447
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,622
- planting dna.
planting lundy's murder books.

448
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,425
- have we heard back from
any more homicide departments?

449
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:52,660
- almost every town.

450
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,528
ten-year-old boys missing
in all of them.

451
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,096
quinn is talking
to scott smith now.

452
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,481
- no, i'm not.

453
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,667
i called in someone who knows
about being kidnapped.

454
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,037
- someone took me once too...

455
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,172
without my permission.

456
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,840
- were you scared?

457
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,960
- most scared i've ever been
in my life.

458
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:14,048
and...
as much as i want to forget,

459
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:19,136
there are all these
little things i remember.

460
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,272
the way his breath
smelled like medicine.

461
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,558
- the bad man.

462
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,843
used medicine on me.

463
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:30,147
when i was getting
in the van.

464
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,349
- do you remember any
little things about the van?

465
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:37,154
- it was empty.
except for some papers.

466
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,740
there was a picture on it.

467
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,193
- do you remember
what it looked like?

468
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,462
- uh...

469
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:03,364
- we're looking
for this logo.

470
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,025
we've got something.

471
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,628
we walked cadaver dogs
over the whole area.

472
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,597
they led us to this spot,
and the guys started digging.

473
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,468
- they found something
buried under the patio.

474
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,823
- all right, hold up.

475
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,277
male victim.

476
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,113
approximate age...
ten years old.

477
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,265
badly decomposed.

478
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,784
looks to be wearing
pajamas.

479
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,602
- they found scott smith
wearing pajamas.

480
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,320
- i'll call judge morales
at home,

481
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,289
have her get
a warrant started.

482
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,225
- i'll get the names of everyone
who volunteered on this build.

483
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,461
- make it everyone
who volunteered for four walls

484
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,796
nationwide.

485
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,597
cross-check 'em
with trinity's cities.

486
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:11,932
we'll find trinity's
real name,

487
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:14,301
then we'll take
this motherfucker down.

488
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,815
- you're a little piggy,
dexter morgan.

489
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:56,159
"debra morgan."

490
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:58,829
debra morgan!

491
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,380
fucking debra!

492
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,051
- astor and cody,
disneyworld awaits.

493
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:07,454
they'll be safe there
with mickey, minnie,

494
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,890
and their goofy grandparents.

495
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:18,632
now for the rest
of my family.

496
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,834
found it!

497
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,653
oh...

498
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,157
- wish i could go
with you right now.

499
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,375
- me too.

500
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,327
- i just got a few loose ends

501
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,912
to tie up at work,
and i'll see you tonight.

502
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,832
- can't wait.

503
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,384
- me either.

504
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:41,088
can't wait to be
with my family.

505
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:44,358
can't wait to be done
with arthur mitchell.

506
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,097
i just need a clue
where he's headed.

507
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,901
receipts.

508
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,052
drug store.
auto shop estimate.

509
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,522
dry cleaner, groceries,
gas.

510
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,558
no bus, train,
or plane tickets.

511
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:07,030
only one other place
i can check.

512
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,372
- mr. butler, what-

513
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,957
- jonah, have you seen
your father?

514
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,542
- yeah, he blew through here
last night

515
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,594
looking for anything
he could sell.

516
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,412
- jonah!

517
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,931
who is-kyle.

518
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,232
- he's asking about dad.

519
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,618
- can you tell me
what's going on?

520
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,436
- i'm not sure.

521
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,388
- i hope he stays gone
this time.

522
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,807
- he took... everything.

523
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,277
- it's gonna be okay.
i promise.

524
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,062
i'll make sure you get
arthur's money.

525
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,164
did he say where
he was headed?

526
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,149
- he never does.

527
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,934
- did he take his tools...

528
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,802
pack a bag?
does he have a passport?

529
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,954
- i don't know.

530
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,956
when we got up this morning,
he was gone.

531
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,000
- shit.

532
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,921
- aah!

533
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,256
- get down!
down on the ground!

534
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:15,649
- we create our own destiny
every day we live.

535
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,495
- freeze! hands up.
- forensics.

536
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,730
- all right.

537
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,740
- dexter.

538
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,044
where's your flak jacket?

539
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:47,381
- i left it in the car.
do you see this?

540
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,766
<i>- cabron!</i>

541
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,686
and over here...

542
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,122
look.
it's a framing hammer.

543
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:58,675
- i'll get masuka in here,
get some dna.

544
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,682
what?

545
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,486
- how'd you get here
so fast?

546
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,372
- word's everywhere.

547
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,824
you found trinity.

548
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,575
- yeah, the four walls
national database

549
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,160
led us to arthur mitchell.

550
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:20,797
can you believe that fucking
monster had a family?

551
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,333
and he abandoned them?

552
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:24,718
- he's gone?

553
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,170
- yeah, he emptied out his
bank accounts and disappeared.

554
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:30,724
he's probably halfway
around the world by now.

555
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,410
- probably.

556
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,329
- deb, what's-

557
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:37,681
- why don't you get
your fucking flak jacket

558
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,550
so everyone knows
you're one of us?

559
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,840
- hey... it's the fucking
karate kid.

560
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,942
- yeah, about that, uh...

561
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:50,277
- you pull that shit again,

562
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:53,880
next time i won't be the one
who's on my ass.

563
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,769
- this is their future,
dexter.

564
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:34,654
we both know it's inevitable.

565
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:39,076
- no. arthur
abandoned his family.

566
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,495
i would never do that.

567
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,946
- arthur left his family
too late.

568
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:44,631
the damage was already done.

569
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,001
you can still
save your family.

570
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,405
- by leaving them?

571
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,791
- you'll always need
someone on your table.

572
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:56,326
if you stay,

573
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,844
sooner or later,
you'll be caught,

574
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:01,515
and they'll pay a terrible
price for what you've done.

575
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,937
because long after
you're executed...

576
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,655
they'll still have
to go through life

577
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,025
with your name branded
across their foreheads.

578
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,860
- dex.

579
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,356
i have something
to tell you.

580
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,175
and maybe i shouldn't.
i don't know.

581
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,427
- okay.

582
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,930
- i found another c.i.
dad was sleeping with.

583
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,049
a woman named laura moser.

584
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,685
- harry was right.
this is it.

585
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,855
- does that name
mean anything to you?

586
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,674
- should it?
- it doesn't?

587
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:47,427
look, she died,

588
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:51,781
but she left behind
two little boys.

589
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,684
and one of those
little boys was you.

590
00:35:56,737 --> 00:36:00,207
laura moser
is your biological mother.

591
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,525
- don't say the rest.
don't know it.

592
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:05,629
- the other little boy,
your brother,

593
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,249
was named brian.

594
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,303
brian moser.

595
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,223
the ice truck killer.

596
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,925
- she knows who i really am.
it's over.

597
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,895
- i wasn't gonna tell you,
but then i saw trinity's family,

598
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,149
and i thought that it's better
for you to know the truth.

599
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,885
- the truth?

600
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,554
the truth...

601
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,000
that's a lot to take in.

602
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,168
- i know.

603
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,837
- and that's all she knows?

604
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,223
you think brian
knew about me?

605
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:52,559
- i don't know.

606
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,845
- he must have glommed
onto you as a way to...

607
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,798
get to me.

608
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,433
don't you see,
it wasn't your fault.

609
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,787
he wasn't your fault.

610
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,522
if i'd never been
in your life-

611
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,607
- fuck you.

612
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,775
- fuck me?

613
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,410
- if you hadn't been
in my life,

614
00:37:10,444 --> 00:37:15,365
i wouldn't be who i am.

615
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,319
you've given me confidence

616
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,789
and support.

617
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,374
and...

618
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,962
you've been
the one constant-

619
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,632
the one constantly good thing
in my life.

620
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,968
- i've been good for her.

621
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,837
and rita says i'm good
for her and the kids.

622
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:41,224
no one would ever say that
about arthur.

623
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,792
maybe harry's wrong.

624
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,262
maybe things could turn out
differently for me.

625
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,462
- morgan.

626
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,614
debra morgan.

627
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,784
need you inside.
- i'll be right there.

628
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:58,441
- i love you.

629
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,980
- i'm so thankful.

630
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,798
the mustang.

631
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,219
arthur brought it in
two days ago.

632
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,054
should have known
he wouldn't leave it behind.

633
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:30,707
- here.
take the rest of this.

634
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,192
- mr. mitchell,
this gonna be nice.

635
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,444
- ah, it's beautiful work,
julio.

636
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,881
especially
on such short notice.

637
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,218
<i>- por favor, the paint.</i>

638
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,704

it needs more dry!

¶ ¶

642
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,608
- the wife had no clue
what the husband was up to.

643
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:39,993
- do we believe her?

644
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:42,829
- she threw up when i showed her
the pictures of what he did.

645
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:45,432
- that can be faked.

646
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,067
- this is the team
that broke the case.

647
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,135
lieutenant laguerta,

648
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,521
special agent davis of the fbi.

649
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,190
- first-rate job.
congratulations.

650
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,092
- it was detective morgan

651
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,927
who brought these killings
to the department's attention.

652
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,279
- building on the work
of one of your own.

653
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,930
- special agent lundy.

654
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:03,817
- fuck yes,
special agent lundy.

655
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,985
he told you guys-
- it's been a long day.

656
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,638
- no disrespect,
but she's right.

657
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,940
- i agree.
in retrospect,

658
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,709
the bureau should have
proceeded differently.

659
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:17,113
- well, your retrospect
cost a man his life.

660
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:18,798
- we'll be taking over
from here.

661
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,967
- so after we do
all the heavy lifting-

662
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,669
- you get all the credit.

663
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,338
- i'm sure they're grateful
for all your hard work.

664
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,425
- we are.

665

motherfuck.

ah!

00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:11,811
- guess you were picturing
a different scenario.

681
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,336
- i was following my path.

682
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,939

- ¶ ta da ¶

687
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,106
- oh, look at you.

688
00:42:57,124 --> 00:42:59,108
i never took pride
in what i did.

689
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:02,278
- no, you're a very special
kind of monster.

690
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:03,830
you destroyed
your own family.

691
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,617
- i gave them everything!
- no, you took everything.

692
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:10,470
their future.
their dignity.

693
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,472
their hope.

694
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,140
christine...

695
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,509
even killed herself.

696
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,597
- no!

697
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,567
- because of you.

698
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,637
- s-she was weak.

699
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,022
- i can't believe
there was a time

700
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:32,191
when i actually thought i could
learn something from you.

701
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,660
- you think you're better
than i am?

702
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,213
- no.

703
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,083
but i want to be.

704
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,253
- you can't control
the demon inside of you

705
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,490
any more
than i can control mine.

706
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:52,378
- did you ever actually try?

707
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,713
oh, my god, yes.

708
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,349
i prayed to be changed.

709
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,935
to be made... different.

710
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,771
- that's not trying.
that's waiting to be stopped.

711
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,507
- it worked, didn't it?

712
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,860
case in point.

713
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,680
- so what's the alternative,
arthur?

714
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:14,567
leave?
disappear?

715
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,353
fake my own death
and start over again?

716
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:20,657
- no.

717
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,191
you'll still be you.

718
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:26,028
- i have a family too,
arthur.

719
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:29,699
and i'm good... for them.

720
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:35,371
you're like a child.

721
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:38,374
- a child with a big knife.

722
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:40,843
- you dream of a heaven
you'll never see.

723
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:44,263
- i don't believe in heaven.
- oh, but you do.

724
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,215
this isn't your doing.

725
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,735
this is god's plan.

726
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,438
i accept that now.

727
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,274
you have to do the same.

728
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,161
- i accept... nothing.

729
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,246
nothing is inevitable.

730
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,333
- it's already over.

731
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:09,872
it's already over.

732
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,963
could you...

733
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:27,256
thank you.

734
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,567
- ¶ i promise that i always
will be true ¶

735
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,870
- ¶ i'll give her all the love
i have to give ¶

736
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,157
¶ as long as we both
shall live ¶

737
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,908
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

738
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:47,276
¶ ooh ooh ooh ¶

739
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:50,946
¶ hey, venus ¶

740
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:55,551
¶ oh, venus ¶

741
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,920
- now it's over.

742
00:45:57,954 --> 00:45:59,589
- ¶ make my wish come true ¶

743
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,590
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

744
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:04,293
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

745
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:29,168
- i wonder if rita's
looking at this same moon

746
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,204
at this same moment.

747
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,872
i like that...

748
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,658
connected by light.

749
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:38,261
the dark passenger's
been fighting against it,

750
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,680
trying to keep me
all to himself.

751
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,765
but it's my turn now...

752
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,335
to get what i want.

753
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:49,572
to embrace my family.

754
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:58,114
and maybe one day
not so long from now...

755
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,983
i'll be rid of
the dark passenger.

756
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,542
it all begins
with a getaway.

757
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,078
time away
from the old me.

758
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,437
it's okay.

759
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,574
life doesn't have to be
perfect.

760
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,828
it just has to be... lived.

761
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,960
unheard message.

762
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,012
- hey, sweetie,
i'm a dope.

763
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,630
i was in such a rush
to get harrison organized

764
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,583
i forgot my i.d. for the plane,
so i'm zooming home for it.

765
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:09,468
means i'll be
on a later puddle jumper,

766
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,771
but we'll still be there
waiting for you.

767
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,307
oh, and i know you're not
into this stuff, but...

768
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,692
the moon tonight
is gonna be amazing.

769
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,978
so take a moment.
you deserve it.

770
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,263
we love you. bye.

771
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,026
rita?

772
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:12,865
no.

773
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,896
born in blood...

774
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,782
both of us.

775
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,951
harry was right.

776
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,070
i thought i could
change what i am,

777
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,456
keep my family safe.

778
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:06,085
But it doesn't matter
what i do,

779
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,037
what i choose.

780
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:11,173
I'm what's wrong.

781
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,762
This is fate.

782
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,815
