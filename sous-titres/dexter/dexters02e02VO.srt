1
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:47,631
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter...

2
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:48,992
<i>I'm on edge.</i>

3
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:51,935
<i>Thirty eight days have passed
since I killed my brother.</i>

4
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:55,029
<i>In that entire time,
I haven't had a single night to myself.</i>

5
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:57,191
<i>Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.</i>

6
00:01:57,428 --> 00:02:00,418
<i>With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.</i>

7
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,533
<i>My brother would be so disappointed.</i>

8
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:04,870
Don't forget:
tell the universe what you need.

9
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:07,591
<i>I really need... to kill somebody.</i>

10
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,678
I've been waiting a long time for this.

11
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,001
What the fuck...

12
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,067
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

13
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:21,489
<i>I follow the code. The stalk was good.</i>

14
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,893
<i>I'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.</i>

15
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:27,006
<i>Debra can't sleep
in an empty house anymore.</i>

16
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,979
<i>I guess that's what happens
when your fiancé</i>

17
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,813
<i>tries to slice you up
into small bloodless pieces.</i>

18
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:33,327
Welcome back, Morgan.

19
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:35,636
Thanks.

20
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,179
You just gotta look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

21
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,880
- Are you that...
- What the fuck are you doing?

22
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,643
Rita, I'm not doing
real good in here, okay?

23
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:45,765
Will you help me?

24
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:47,473
I found the fucking shoe, okay?

25
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,706
That's great!
I'll call the lawyer in the morning!

26
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:53,009
<i>I'm not gonna let you drag
Dexter into this!</i>

27
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,926
The prison called.

28
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,421
Paul's dead.

29
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:58,655
And I could have helped him.

30
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,613
That was his own fault.

31
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:02,894
Was it?

32
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:05,867
What's the matter with you today?

33
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,593
Just a little off my game.
I'll get it back.

34
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,658
Felt like she was asking me something.

35
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,260
That's her son.
She says she knows who killed him.

36
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:16,661
Some guy named Little Chino.

37
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:19,935
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

38
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,736
Are you willing to testify

39
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:26,171
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death?

40
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,078
Come on, don't back down now.

41
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,835
I want him to pay.

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,250
<i>A challenge.</i>

43
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,109
<i>A mountain to climb.</i>

44
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:36,548
<i>I need this one.</i>

45
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:38,834
<i>The scene of the failed crime.</i>

46
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,579
<i>No better place to try again.</i>

47
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,981
<i>I don't normally
experience failure.</i>

48
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,365
<i>Thirty nine days, twenty two hours,</i>

49
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:52,109
<i>and eighteen minutes
since I killed my brother.</i>

50
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,557
<i>I am cursed.</i>

51
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,101
<i>Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today,</i>

52
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,280
<i>when they stumbled on what appears
to be an underwater graveyard,</i>

53
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,305
<i>in a crevasse, off the coast of Miami.</i>

54
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,234
Do you know what that means?

55
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:07,250
There might be
a new mass murderer out there,

56
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:09,246
way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.

57
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:17,196
Waiting to exhale(del vo)

58
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,881
<i>I'm drifting.</i>

59
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:28,223
<i>I finally get a chance to kill
and I can't do it.</i>

60
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:35,625
<i>And a second chance and he gets away.</i>

61
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,546
<i>And now all my secrets are floating
to the surface.</i>

62
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,044
<i>Where is the orderly, controled,
effective, Dexter?</i>

63
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:51,306
<i>How did I loose him?</i>

64
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,558
<i>How do I find him again?</i>

65
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:57,608
<i>I'm drifting.</i>

66
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,415
<i>But not to sleep.</i>

67
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:10,780
<i>A shocking and grusome discovery
of the cost of florida yesterday.</i>

68
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,376
<i>Police are still searching through</i>

69
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:15,301
<i>mountain of evidence
found lying at the bottom of the ocean.</i>

70
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,402
<i>Sources say
there could be multiple victims...</i>

71
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:43,344
<i>Here I am.
Back in the belly of the beast.</i>

72
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:45,143
<i>But how can I solve a crime</i>

73
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,698
<i>when I can't even solve
what's wrong with me?</i>

74
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,599
<i>Yet, duty calls.</i>

75
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:57,946
Eight confirmed.

76
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,473
Eight confirmed, here?

77
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,316
- Here is just one.
- We're talking 8 confirmed victims

78
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:04,793
in the Bay Harbor Butcher.

79
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,202
"The Bay Harbor Butcher"?

80
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:11,974
That's what the press is calling
where were dumped those bodies of shore.

81
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:13,866
Has a nice ring to it, no?

82
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,555
Well, it's a little...

83
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,858
lured.
- Lured and possibly wrong.

84
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:22,303
Part of me is hopping they found
the ice truck killer dumping ground.

85
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:23,457
Tell me about it.

86
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,766
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

87
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,578
Eva Raines.

88
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:33,392
All she wanted was justice against the 29th St. Kings for whacking her son.

89
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,836
- First she is the messenger.
- No, she's the god damn message.

90
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:40,870
Death by machete.

91
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,706
Again.

92
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,571
We got a *bollo* on Little Chino.

93
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,713
Gang crash unit, all local patrols after than grabon.

94
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:51,224
<i>Last thing I want is for the cops
to bring Little Chino in.</i>

95
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:52,562
<i>He's mine.</i>

96
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,761
Why don't you take a picture?
Morgan, it will last longer.

97
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,489
What would I do without you sergeant?

98
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,554
Please signora, *mas dispacio*

99
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,116
Please slower...

100
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,895
She saying any fucking cops
aren't do nothing.

101
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,072
- Grand Ma really talk like that?
- Not exactly.

102
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,582
But you got the point.

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,982
Right, bitch?

104
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,450
Fuck the people don't want our help.

105
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,198
Shit, she got a little girl.

106
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:34,991
I know.

107
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:39,111
This stuff never gets to you?

108
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:43,531
I'm more of a crying
on the inside kind of guy.

109
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:47,019
Mister Ice Truck Killer
look like a god damn artist.

110
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,243
Sorry, Morgan.

111
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:54,889
What?

112
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,331
I'm so over that.

113
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,974
You're just fucking with me.

114
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,271
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

115
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:13,912
Fiancé...

116
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,675
*Incarnate*. Couldn't pick a worst time, right?

117
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:19,949
Hey Yasmeth:

118
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:22,592
How about you take off,
let me handle this?

119
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,169
I couldn't let you do that.

120
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:30,247
I'll write up the report and e-mail it to you for signature.

121
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay?

122
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:40,250
I want Morgan to report to me
first thing in the morning

123
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:41,811
about that bar fight of hers.

124
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,657
I owe you.

125
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,417
Get in there.

126
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,556
There's somebody else, get in there now.

127
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,164
<i>Pobrecita.</i>

128
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,171
Seeing her mother that way...

129
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:27,533
can you imagine that?

130
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,101
I can even go there, Angel.

131
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,016
This one's on us, man.

132
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,590
<i>If I had kid Chino last night</i>

133
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:53,334
<i>that little girl's mother
would still be alive.</i>

134
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,702
<i>I gotta find Chino before he finds me.</i>

135
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,644
<i>...bringing to an even dozen the number of bodies
found off-shore.</i>

136
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,019
<i>I have to focus.</i>

137
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:24,457
<i>Tune everything out.</i>

138
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,066
<i>So far, authorities have no clue
as to who that criminal...</i>

139
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:29,788
<i>If I don't, being linked
to my beautiful bodies at work</i>

140
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,782
<i>will be the least of my worries.</i>

141
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,606
<i>Shit! Little Chino.</i>

142
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:37,354
<i>He was out there.</i>

143
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:38,907
<i>Timing could be better.</i>

144
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,375
<i>That, plus I don't have my tools, but...</i>

145
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:48,749
<i>It does give me the chance
to tie up one mess of loose end.</i>

146
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,188
That's you, sergeant.

147
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,530
Who else you got following you?

148
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,326
Apparently no one.

149
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,079
Go ahead. Try it.

150
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,286
I've been waiting.

151
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:17,512
In this neighborhood?

152
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:19,716
It's full of crazies.

153
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,002
I'd lock my doors.

154
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,360
Bathroom's all yours.

155
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,303
It kind of always was.

156
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,685
We ran out of glasses?

157
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:52,988
- Clean ones.
- Come here a sec'.

158
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:56,574
I found a couple of places on Craigslist
that you should check out.

159
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,670
Two bedrooms, two baths,
limited water views...

160
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,764
- It has its own gym.
- I hate it.

161
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:03,581
Alright.

162
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,783
One bedroom, one bath,
art deco building?

163
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,124
Shitty neighborhood.

164
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,560
It gets morning sun!

165
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:14,582
- Come on, Deb, give it a chance.
- Look, Dex,

166
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,175
I appreciate the brotherly love,

167
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:18,163
but I've got the lieutenant
in like an hour.

168
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,537
See you at the job.

169
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,718
<i>I will not kill my sister.</i>

170
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,189
<i>I will not kill my sister.</i>

171
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,750
<i>I will not kill my sister.</i>

172
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:39,785
RITA CALLING (del vo)

173
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,229
- Hey you!
- Dexter?

174
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,070
Astor? Sweetie, what's the matter?

175
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,339
Mum's acting all weird and stuff.

176
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,628
What kind of weird?

177
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,555
She keeps talking to people
on the phone about my dad,

178
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,524
<i>then she starts yelling at them.</i>

179
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,339
<i>Then, she yells at me and Cody.</i>

180
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:01,552
I'm on my way.

181
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:07,821
No. Calm is what I was 35 minutes ago.

182
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,268
Pissed is what I am now.

183
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:12,366
Hey! Who wants Eggos?

184
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:15,377
I got blueberry or chocolate. Or both.

185
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,274
- Both.
- I don't care.

186
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:20,684
Assholes!

187
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,209
They did everything but help.

188
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,340
Which assholes were you talking to?

189
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,659
Funeral home assholes.

190
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:31,837
You're having a funeral for Paul?

191
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,878
Not for Paul.
For the kids.

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
For me.

193
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,677
We had this old insurance policy.

194
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:40,208
It's about five thousands,
but it should cover everything.

195
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:42,422
You know, the county
will bury Paul for free.

196
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:43,875
I mean...

197
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,366
He wasn't even your husband.

198
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Any more.

199
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:48,729
Technically.

200
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:53,517
Then, you could use the insurance money
for a starter scholarship for the kids.

201
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:58,855
Dexter, I didn't ask for your help
or your advice.

202
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:04,266
<i>I'll never understand how people
deal with death.</i>

203
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,402
<i>What they can't just... put it in its place.</i>

204
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:13,352
<i>Now, I have to find someone
who knows I'm looking for him.</i>

205
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:16,572
<i>Not exactly ideal
in the element of surprise department,</i>

206
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:20,593
<i>and I have to find a new way to dispose
of Little Chino's body.</i>

207
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,427
<i>If I can close the deal, this time...</i>

208
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,641
You totally douched me in there.

209
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,742
You clocked a guy in a bar,
who touched your arm.

210
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:41,097
Yeah, I told the lieutenant
you weren't ready for active duty.

211
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,503
Well, thank you for the fucking vote
of confidence.

212
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Nice.

213
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,726
13! Confirmed.

214
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:52,857
You know, buzz in the halls
is that the Feds are coming in

215
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,100
on the Bay Harbor bodies.

216
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:57,222
Well, that figures.
FBI does all the heavy lifting,

217
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,918
Captain Matthews takes all the credit.

218
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,324
Nice political move

219
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:03,590
- when you're buckin' for deputy chief.
- Any idea who the FBI's sendin'?

220
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:06,317
- Some guy named Landy.
- Frank Landy?

221
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,263
He's a rock star.
The Green River killer

222
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,695
and the DC sniper?
The case was impossible, he broke it.

223
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,559
We're damage goods
around here, but you...

224
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,970
You should do whatever you can to get on Landy's task force.

225
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,783
It's a career maker.

226
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,869
Just visualize that door of opportunity
just opening up wide for you.

227
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,855
And just walk right through it.

228
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:32,936
Angel, you keep up with this whoo-hoo
shit, I'll walk right through you.

229
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,176
<i>Little Chino... Shit!

230
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,546
<i>This guy is officialy
the highest point in all Florida.</i>

231
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,709
<i>But what's he doin' here?</i>

232
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:51,997
People tell me
you're lookin' for my client.

233
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:58,861
People tell you right.

234
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,951
Fuck, he's big!

235
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,386
The harder they fall...

236
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:13,428
That come with the story?

237
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,965
Cut myself shaving.

238
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:18,915
Well, you should be more careful.
Amigo

239
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,368
My client's been repeatedly
harassed by this department.

240
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,557
- Frankly we considering...
- Cut the shit, Raul.

241
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,392
<i>There was another murder
in East Kendle yesterday and my client...</i>

242
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:30,882
Word on the pavement is
you're lookin' for me regarding this...

243
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,751
- Tragedy.
- You bet your ass, we are.

244
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:38,690
The victim was the mother of one of your
<i>compadres</i> who we know you killed.

245
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:41,824
- But can't prove. Right, Officer?
- It's "Detective".

246
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:46,219
- And can't prove <i>yet</i>.
- Show 'em the disc.

247
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,554
Time-stamp has this at
yesterday afternoon.

248
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,876
- Same time as...
- Eva Raine's TOD.

249
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,496
That's bullshit. Anyone can reset a time-stamp.

250
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:05,617
Check it out.

251
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,280
Yesterday's paper.

252
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,218
That arrogant prick.

253
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,709
He knew we'd peg him
for Elena's murder so...

254
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,113
he covered his ass,
had someone else do the deed.

255
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:18,375
- That makes him an accomplice, right?
- Not without evidence.

256
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,539
Cut him loose.

257
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:34,342
<i>Red Rover, Red Rover
send Chino back over.</i>

258
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:49,066
Dex, check this out.

259
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,565
Thirteen and counting.

260
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:02,439
They're so swamped up there,
they had to bring in outside talent.

261
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,544
Which would be <i>moi</i>.

262
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:10,586
Bet this guy never expected
his work to see the lighta day.

263
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:13,301
I bet you're right.

264
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:17,092
Still it can't be easy
to hide a body now-a-days.

265s
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,078
You shittin' me?

266
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,951
Hypothetical:
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

267
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:23,903
How do you make sure
disposed body stays disposed?

268
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:26,787
Tons of options:
Everglades, alligators...

269
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:30,253
pig farms, sulfuric acid,
wood chipper, incinerator.

270
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:32,459
Hell! Even meat pies.

271
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:33,872
The mind boggles.

272
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:36,596
Don't all those run the risk
of contact with the outside world?

273
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,690
You got a better idea?

274
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,638
<i>And that's the problem. Where do I put
Chino when I'm done with him?</i>

275
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:51,627
Captain's comin' up with that FBI guy.
He's got a fuckin' entourage.

276
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:03,509
<i>So this is the man who stands</i>

277
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:05,496
<i>between me and death row.</i>

278
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,322
Listen up, everyone.

279
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,835
Briefing room in 2 minutes
for show and tell.

280
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,726
All right.
The Bay Harbor Butcher case

281
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,636
is now a Miami Metro case.

282
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,541
And it is shaping up to be
the biggest one in our history.

283
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:32,575
Now it's fourteen confirmed.

284
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,475
The FBI has sent over

285
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,482
their top man, Special Agent Frank Landy
to help solve this crime.

286
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:38,859
Now...

287
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,055
This will not be
a jurisdictional circle jerk.

288
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,451
This will be a shining exemple

289
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,263
of two agencies

290
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:50,310
working together for the public good.

291
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,306
Agent Landy...

292
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:55,595
Hello, everyone.

293
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:58,657
There is no such thing
as the perfect crime.

294
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:01,093
Not in my experience anyway.

295
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:02,437
With your help,

296
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,269
and with the mistakes
this person has made...

297
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:07,247
and will eventually make,

298
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,471
we'll find whoever did
this aweful thing.

299
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:11,953
I need everyone in every department

300
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,125
up to speed on what we're doing.

301
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,522
While I review your files
and put our task force together.

302
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:21,949
So, let's get a jump start
on the Bay Harbor Butcher.

303
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:25,061
A moniker which by the way repulses me.

304
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:26,963
<i>Well, we have something in common.</i>

305
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:28,149
Someone get the lights?

306
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,350
First report from the field
had these parts as comin'

307
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:39,256
- from one body.
- <i>Actually it's two.</i>

308
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,405
Actually it's two.

309
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,963
There has been speculation that this

310
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,062
human harvest might be connected
to a case you've recently solved.

311
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,746
But there are
several inconsistencies between

312
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,426
the two sets of body parts.

313
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,702
Gender, exsanguination...

314
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,158
specific methods of dissection.

315
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,430
<i>Not to mention my guys deserved it.</i>

316
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,535
The evidence just isn't there
to piggy-back this

317
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,469
onto the Ice Truck Killer.

318
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,960
We're looking for a different suspect.

319
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:08,120
All information regarding this case...

320
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:09,874
Miss me, brother?

321
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:18,971
<i>I can't afford to lose it like this.</i>

322
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>Not with Special Agent Rock Star
on my case.</i>

323
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,530
<i>I need to clear the decks.</i>

324
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:28,448
<i>And my head.</i>

325
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:39,547
<i>I'm coming for you tonight,
Little Chino.

326
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,855
<i>And this time
there won't be any screw ups.</i>

327
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:44,217
You just slam in your CO2 cartridge here.

328
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:46,716
Put in your tranq dart and let it rip.

329
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,098
Wham bam

330
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,948
lights fucking out.

331
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:52,378
So gators givin' you trouble, Dex?

332
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,990
They... ate my puppy.

333
00:21:58,589 --> 00:21:59,261
This sucker...

334
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,756
You load her up right should take down

335
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,388
the goddamn grizzly.

336
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:05,914
You may have to get closer
than you like.

337
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,435
She'll do the job, I promise you that.

338
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,971
So which'll be?

339
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,578
Both.

340
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:16,888
Excellent.

341
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,599
First time?

342
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,047
Sort of.

343
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:10,622
Yeah, I been boxing since I was 10.

344
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,429
- Tough neighborhood?
- Tough family.

345
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,614
And those were just my sisters.

346
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:20,507
Want some help?

347
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,761
I'm doin' enough damage on my own.

348
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:25,272
Is that a yes or a no?

349
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:28,772
That was a yes.

350
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:30,988
It sounded like a no, but...

351
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,474
Good answer.

352
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:42,438
First...

353
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,149
we need to wrap your wrists.

354
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,832
So you don't hurt yourself again.

355
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,662
I'm sorry.

356
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,449
You scared the shit outta me.

357
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:29,659
How you doin'?

358
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:31,749
How am I doin'?

359
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:34,989
I saw the man I thought I loved.

360
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:39,320
No, did love.
Up on some goddamn screen.

361
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:42,638
With a gallery full of women
he murdered and cut into pieces.

362
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,556
Don't.

363
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,858
You fuckin' asked.

364
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:49,953
So how am I doin'?

365
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,974
I'm just fine.

366
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,662
<i>I might be playing fast and loose</i>

367
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:17,286
<i>with my father's code, but I don't think
Harry would disapprove.</i>

368
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:19,213
<i>Considering...</i>

369
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:23,291
<i>Attaboy, Chino. A little closer.</i>

370
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:33,431
<i>Come on, don't get the shakes now.
This is no time for performance anxiety.

371
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:54,394
I've been waitin' for you.

372
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:57,683
Take him.

373
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,213
He's there.

374
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:14,133
I don't know.
I don't know where the fuck he is.

375
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:25,261
Come out, come out whereever you are, <i>cabr
n.

376
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:31,427
We'll be out here
all night long if we have to.

377
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:33,422
You find him, okay?

378
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,938
<i>What the hell is wrong with me?</i>

379
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:49,215
<i>Someone's coming.</i>

380
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,920
It's okay, I got you.

381
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,196
- Please don't hurt us!
- Oh, my God!

382
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,346
What the fuck is this?

383
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:20,154
Dexter, don't leave me!

384
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,300
Biney!

385
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:28,200
- Don't leave me!
- Get in there!

386
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:30,700
Please, don't leave me!

387
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,221
- Somebody else get in there now!
- Biney!

388
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,195
<i>Wait! Don't leave me!</i>

389
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:42,541
Bryan... My brother.

390
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,477
Come on,
somebody must've seen somethin'.

391
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:52,399
Seing and talking
are 2 different things.

392
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,798
Want me to knock out some doors?

393
00:27:53,997 --> 00:27:55,402
Or maybe some heads.

394
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:57,173
Sorry, I'm late.

395
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:59,544
What fucking asshole left this here?

396
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:02,002
It's Special Agent Fucking Asshole.

397
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,586
- Morgan, right?
- We got witnesses to interview.

398
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,469
You seen my brother?

399
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,106
Excuse me, sir.
You have a minute?

400
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,574
Or three.
Good tea takes time.

401
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,062
What's up, Sergeant?

402
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:39,122
It's about your task force. I think
I can bring something to it, sir.

403
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:42,681
I've looked into your jacket,
sergeant.

404
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:44,694
You've done some fine work here,
in Homicide.

405
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:47,249
- Miami Metro's lucky to have you.
- Thank you, sir...

406
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,609
But I don't think you'd be
a good fit for my team.

407
00:28:50,823 --> 00:28:52,177
I thought you just said I was qualified.

408
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,885
I said you've done some fine work in Homicide.

409
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:57,074
Frankly, sergeant, you're more
of a leader than a team member.

410
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:01,419
I'm not convinced
you play well with others.

411
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:13,823
Can someone clean this shit up?

412
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,704
<i>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle
missing a piece.</i>

413
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,971
<i>And I'm not even sure
what the picture should be.</i>

414
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,238
I've been calling you for hours.

415
00:29:30,946 --> 00:29:32,342
I kinda pulled an all nighter.

416
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:34,701
I called the station.

417
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:38,412
I was off the clock.
It's this huge case I'm workin'.

418
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,640
It's...

419
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,299
It's taking me to places
I never thougt I'd go.

420
00:29:46,803 --> 00:29:47,437
What?

421
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,561
I've been thinking a lot...

422
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:54,961
about Paul's death
and how I'm gonna deal with it.

423
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:59,439
- And?
-  First of all, I'm not gonna let the county burry him.

424
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,149
I'm using the insurance money to give
Paul a proper funeral. It's in an hour.

425
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,761
Paul was such a...

426
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,916
destructive force.
Why can't you just put him behind you?

427
00:30:10,332 --> 00:30:12,013
It's about saying goodbye.

428
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:14,968
Goodbye to him
and the grip he had on my life.

429
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:17,131
It's called moving on.

430
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:22,130
Go clean yourself up.
The kids are expecting you.

431
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,311
- I'm just gonna make you late.
- Dammit, Dexter.

432
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:27,490
I need you there, too.
You have no idea what this feels like.

433
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,669
Just gimme 10 minutes.

434
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,974
Come in.

435
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,234
I can't wait to get another door
slammed in my face.

436
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:49,821
If I lived in this neighborhood,
I wouldn't talk to the cops either.

437
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:51,138
Brave guy like you?

438
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,440
It's about survival.
These people have families, kids...

439
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,852
It's not easy to be talkative
when you got the 29th St. Kings

440
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,092
playing whack the witness.

441
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,393
It just takes one, right?

442
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:01,869
That's it!

443
00:31:02,134 --> 00:31:03,572
Put that out into the universe.

444
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,429
Alright?

445
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,826
Miami Metro! Can we talk to you?

446
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,224
Go to hell!

447
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:16,287
Okay, but before we do that, ma'am,
can I ask you a few questions?

448
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:17,894
How many is "a few"?

449
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:19,632
Three.

450
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:20,822
But one's a two parter.

451
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:23,694
Go away before I call the police!

452
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,443
We are the fucking police!

453
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:30,129
I am talking to no one
with language like that!

454
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Look at the bright side.

455
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,096
- What bright side?
- Comically?

456
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,004
We're batting a thousand.

457
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,915
There's something balancing
about that kind of consistency.

458
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,108
Goddamn it!

459
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:55,489
Shit!

460
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:14,063
What were you thinking?

461
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,451
Were you thinking that you can spray your damn crap on a police car
and get away with it?

462
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:19,917
Get off of me, lady! Unless you wanna
fuck me like you fucked that Ice Truck guy too!

463
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,242
You little deadbeat -- we better get every piece of shit!

464
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:25,416
Please! I'll tell you where the shit is!

465
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,767
The drugs and shit!

466
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:29,054
- Please, don't shoot me, miss!
- Morgan!

467
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:49,198
<i>If I believed in God,</i>

468
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,617
<i>if I believed in sin,</i>

469
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:55,860
<i>this is the place where I'd be
sucked straight to hell.</i>

470
00:32:58,033 --> 00:32:59,280
<i>If I believed in hell.</i>

471
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,452
Come on, Dexter. It's alright.

472
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,997
... hard story of who this man was.

473
00:33:27,178 --> 00:33:30,475
Born into innocence,
as are all of God's children,

474
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:35,437
are truly the living personification
of God through the magic of family.

475
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:38,353
Giving love... it was with his children,

476
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:40,335
that he truly flourished.

477
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:44,044
It was with his children,
that he, for all his blemishes,

478
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,470
reembraced the perfect innocence.

479
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:49,014
And that was through his children,

480
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:50,489
that once again,

481
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,040
God's smiled on Paul Bennett.

482
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:57,331
And now, the family will come forward
for a few moments of silent prayer.

483
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:19,768
I hope you find your peace, Paul.

484
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:34,895
Bye, dad.

485
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:58,879
I'm so sorry for your loss.

486
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,082
Thank you.

487
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,810
Father.

488
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,143
I'm not sorry.

489
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:10,758
You're still here.

490
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:12,820
I never left.

491
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,991
Yeah, you did. I killed you.

492
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:18,204
You just took my life.

493
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:25,318
So, how do I make you go away?

494
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:30,946
Well, you can try doing
what these people are doing.

495
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:34,992
I'm not like them.

496
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:44,952
Now, if it helps,

497
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:46,852
then I can tell you it's not your fault,

498
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:48,709
what you did to me.

499
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:50,324
I never said it was.

500
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:51,481
But you feel it.

501
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:53,955
How do you know that?

502
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:56,808
It's human nature.

503
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:00,303
I'm not human.

504
00:36:03,192 --> 00:36:04,192
You're just fucked up.

505
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:18,986
I need to let you go.

506
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,404
You think it's as simple as that?

507
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,908
Nothing's simple.

508
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,505
Does this mean you will be my dad, now?

509
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,356
29th St. Kings?

510
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:07,862
Yeah, we got them.

511
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:11,098
SWAT did a sweep on some auto shop those
animals were using as a front.

512
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:14,419
Maybe we didn't get them on murder,
but we busted their asses on drugs,

513
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:16,121
weapons and money laundering.

514
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:19,038
Half of them are three strikers,
so they're gonna go away forever.

515
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,066
Thanks to officer Morgan.

516
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:34,976
Hey, something you should know.

517
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,841
Deb pulled her gun on an unarmed boy

518
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:39,358
to get him to give up the gang.

519
00:37:39,628 --> 00:37:41,387
Some kid named Joey Nunez.

520
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,178
Thanks, Angel. I'll talk to her.

521
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,635
I'll give her one thing, though.

522
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:47,285
She's in a motherfucking good shape.

523
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:49,091
Here comes another one.

524
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,649
We got Little Chino too?

525
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,472
That cocksucker wasn't there.

526
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,608
It's too bad.

527
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:02,116
What you got?

528
00:38:02,437 --> 00:38:03,437
It's none of your business.

529
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:05,271
Damn

530
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,059
Excuse me, Esme.
I opened this by mistake.

531
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,630
It said lieutenant.

532
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,638
No worries.

533
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,543
Today, Maria, it is all about the win.

534
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,685
I think we really should enjoy this.

535
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,272
Stop me if you think
I'm speaking out of turn,

536
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:29,875
or above my station, but...

537
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:33,487
We really don't use to department resources
around here for personal matters.

538
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:35,572
What are you talking about?

539
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:37,388
Well, let's, for argument's sake,

540
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,848
say those phone records
belong to your fiancé.

541
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:44,338
It could open a shit ugly can of worms
you might not be able to close.

542
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:47,128
Only if someone mentions it.

543
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:51,639
This is me not mentioning it.

544
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,669
I'm new at this... This.

545
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,126
Not trusting the man
that I thought that I loved, and...

546
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:10,035
I really appreciate your support.

547
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,201
Hey, Deb. It's me.

548
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,790
Again. You're probably at the gym.

549
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:30,825
Again.

550
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,522
Look, I got some unfinished business
outside the office

551
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:36,448
I'll probably be a little late tonight.
I'll catch up with you later.

552
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:46,198
<i>It was simple, really.</i>

553
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:50,387
<i>All I had to do was put myself
into the mind of a killer.</i>

554
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,194
<i>Hardly a stretch.</i>

555
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:55,185
<i>It was only a matter of time
before Little Chino</i>

556
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,640
<i>went after Joey Nunez
for snitching them out.</i>

557
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,378
<i>Here's, hoping I'm back on my game.</i>

558
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:37,975
Trust me, you're not going anywhere
this time.

559
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,684
Who the fuck are you?

560
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:45,546
That kind of talk is just gonna
bring you closer to your victims.

561
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:52,507
Who the hell are you? A cop?

562
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,291
'Cause I was cleared of that bitch!

563
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:59,858
No, maybe you didn't do the deed,
but her blood is on your hands.

564
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,379
A lot of blood is on your hands.

565
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,319
Why do you care about these people?

566
00:43:15,305 --> 00:43:16,305
Actually...

567
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,696
Fuck!

568
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:19,424
I don't.

569
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:22,709
Why are you doing this to me?

570
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:31,208
I'm not so much doing this to you
as I'm doing it for me.

571
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:35,263
What's that?

572
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,449
I haven't killed no kid.

573
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:52,110
But you killed most of her.

574
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,267
Her mother.

575
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,736
Her brother.

576
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:01,600
Her innocence.

577
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:07,241
You leave pain wherever you go.

578
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:13,966
If you kill me,

579
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:16,487
what do you leave behind?

580
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,292
A world without you.

581
00:44:20,316 --> 00:44:22,209
Look at that, steady as a surgeon.

582
00:44:53,285 --> 00:44:56,846
<i>This kill was the first
of the loose ends I needed to tie off.</i>

583
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:00,482
<i>I found a newer, safer place to dump
my trash.</i>

584
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,218
<i>Moving at over 4 miles an hour,</i>

585
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:06,631
<i>the Gulf Stream is one of the world's
most powerful deep water currents.</i>

586
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,938
<i>This time tomorrow, Little Chino
will be north of Palm Beach.</i>

587
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:13,694
<i>After that, it's on to Georgia,
South Carolina,</i>

588
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:16,573
<i>North Carolina, until, eventually...</i>

589
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:20,740
<i>Well, let's just say that the North
Atlantic is a pretty big place.</i>

590
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:38,714
- Hey, you.
- I need to see you.

591
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:41,654
I was just dropping somebody off,
can't it wait?

592
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:43,195
No, it can't.

593
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:45,641
Alright, then.

594
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:01,314
A shoe?

595
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:06,048
You want to see me about a shoe?

596
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:09,740
It's Paul shoe.

597
00:46:21,307 --> 00:46:22,351
What do we do with it?

598
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:30,631
Paul kept insisting to me
that you knocked him over the head.

599
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,766
Dragged him to his hotel
and shot him with drugs.

600
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,959
Sounds like one of his stories, huh?

601
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:44,239
He asked me
to look in the yard for his shoe.

602
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:46,597
Finally, I did.

603
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,505
- Baby...
- Let me finish, Dexter.

604
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:58,020
I didn't have a lot to hope for...

605
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:00,165
until I met you.

606
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:03,450
You gave me something,

607
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:05,286
to believe in, when...

608
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:07,431
I didn't even believe in myself.

609
00:47:09,189 --> 00:47:10,513
Maybe I was...

610
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:13,865
Maybe I was so desperate
that I looked to the other way.

611
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,382
Paul begged me...

612
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,488
to help him.

613
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:21,188
And what did I do?

614
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:23,275
I hung up on him.

615
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,424
And he was so upset,
he got into a prison fight,

616
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,550
and he was beaten to death with a pipe.

617
00:47:29,052 --> 00:47:30,443
It's not your fault.

618
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,785
A part of, it is.

619
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:36,108
A part of me believes that...

620
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:38,543
with all of Paul flaws,

621
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,729
he paid the price for my dreams.

622
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,891
Did you attack him, Dexter?

623
00:47:57,596 --> 00:47:59,992
I'd understand if you did,
he attacked me.

624
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,070
I hit Paul to protect you and the kids.

625
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:17,464
It's totally an act of impulse.

626
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:30,988
Where did you get the drugs?

627
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,590
Stolen from the evidence locker.

628
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:45,545
Wait.

629
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:47,612
Wait.

630
00:48:48,424 --> 00:48:49,699
Wait, I mean...

631
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:51,922
First you tell me that you...

632
00:48:52,617 --> 00:48:54,260
acted on impulse,

633
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:59,447
and then you tell me that you stole
the drugs from your police station?

634
00:49:00,713 --> 00:49:02,781
What are you trying to say, that you...

635
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:05,022
planned on acting on impulse?

636
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,225
It's all kinda jumbled now...

637
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,042
How did you know how to cook the heroin?

638
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:12,740
How did you know
what dose to give a big guy like Paul.

639
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:22,995
Oh my God,

640
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,642
Oh my God, why didn't I see this?

641
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,623
They were your drugs?

642
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:31,768
Now, it makes sense.

643
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:34,570
That's where you disappeared to
at all hours of the night like...

644
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:36,135
Clark fucking Kent

645
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:41,063
Look, if there is anything,
left between us,

646
00:49:41,217 --> 00:49:44,540
you'll answer me this one question
and you will tell me the truth.

647
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,148
Are you an addict?

648
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:04,472
Yes, I have an addiction.

649
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:23,602
That's good.
It's the first step.

650
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,901
Admitting you have a problem.

651
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:28,075
We get you into a program.

652
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,084
We get you the help you need.

653
00:50:31,204 --> 00:50:32,808
And I will be there for you.

654
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,137
<i>If the eyes were a window to the soul,</i>

655
00:50:47,025 --> 00:50:48,784
<i>then grief is the door...</i>

656
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:57,189
<i>as long as it's closed, it's the barrier
between knowing and not knowing.</i>

657
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,869
<i>Walk away from it
and it stays closed forever.</i>

658
00:51:02,173 --> 00:51:04,608
<i>But open it, and walk through it,</i>

659
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:08,252
<i>and pain becomes truth.</i>

660
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,821
<i>And now I'm faced with the struggle
for my own survival</i>

661
00:51:16,995 --> 00:51:18,782
<i>that I always knew was coming.</i>

662
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,731
<i>I've been preparing for this
my entire life.</i>

663
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:36,732
<i>When all is settle down, Chino,
you're the same size as everyone else.</i>

664
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,582
Hey Dex, what the fuck?

665
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,596
Hang on, I'm coming.

666
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,718
It's annoying, isn't it?

667
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,128
I'm not taking the bait.

668
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:04,964
- You're up late.
- Yeah, just surfing.

669
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,954
You go to the gym?

670
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:10,258
Then I was sort of driving around.

671
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,625
Around what?

672
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:14,906
Around town.

673
00:52:16,722 --> 00:52:18,251
- Because?
- Saw some buildings

674
00:52:18,425 --> 00:52:20,525
with some "for rent" signs.
I'm gonna check them out.

675
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:26,973
Then, "Chez Dexter",
can return to its original

676
00:52:27,224 --> 00:52:29,988
semi-lived-in-museum-quality-state.

677
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:34,375
- Deb, you don't need to do this.
- Yes, I do.

678
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:35,786
You don't need to do this now.

679
00:52:35,998 --> 00:52:38,355
And what about the video tours
of eligible apartments?

680
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:41,002
Temporary insanity.

681
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:46,200
You sure?

682
00:52:48,848 --> 00:52:50,491
No. Get out.

683
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:53,931
Asshole.

684
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:58,452
<i>This way I can take care of my sister
the way Harry would have wanted.</i>

685
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:00,887
You really wreak.

686
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:05,128
You right.

687
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:07,254
I smell like a fucking sewer.

688
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:14,346
- <i>For every door that closes...</i>
- Fuck.

689
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:18,265
Sorry.

690
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:25,056
<i>... it was always right there.</i>

691
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:31,163
<i>I had to say goodbye,
in order to reconnect</i>

692
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:33,501
<i>with what's really important.</i>

693
00:53:35,317 --> 00:53:36,650
<i>With who I was.</i>

694
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:41,846
<i>With who I have to be.</i>

695
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:31,633
Rest in peace.

696
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:43,292
I am.
