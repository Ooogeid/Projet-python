3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,890
Previously on dexter...

4
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,610
I loaned freebo that money.

5
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,420
This is about respect.

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,950
Anton!

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,720
morgan, get out of the way!

8
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,100
You found me.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,860
I never meant for any of this
to go down the way it did.

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,550
I shoulda told you you were free and clear.

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,330
- So that was you?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,150
Debra, you lied to me!

13
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,530
I am not the enemy here.

14
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,140
I need for you to seriously think about us.

15
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,280
Life vests?

16
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,120
We can't exactly load up the cart
with axes and machetes now can we?

17
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,310
Last thursday I was having drinks with her,

18
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,110
and then the next day I'm
staring down at her dead body.

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,220
see, she's lucky to have you watching out for her.

20
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,480
It's just like you watched
out for me oscar's case.

21
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,350
Wait.

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
I told sylvia about miguel and laguerta.

23
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,190
So she thinks miguel is at laguerta's?

24
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,200
You fucker! You are too good a liar, miguel.

25
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,520
- come on, baby, listen to me.
- Don't touch me! I'm done!

26
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,270
Did you see anyone else on the street?

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,130
There was some douchebag with
his high beams on blinding me.

28
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,380
what kind of car?

29
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,330
dark, black, suv.

30
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,460
Think that's funny?

31
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,420
Not at all. They said that stain would come out.

32
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,130
I am the last person you wanna fuck
with because I will fuck you back!

33
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,420
- Count on it!
- I will.

34
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,030
Even harry would agree.

35
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,520
Miguel has left me no other choice.

36
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,640
I kill him.

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,730
- Get a good look at him?
- His name?

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,040
Dexter morgan. you want freebo?

39
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,820
Then you need to have a
long conversation with him.

40
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,320
<font color=#00FFFF>Dexter Season03
Episode11 I Had a Dream</font>

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,060
so this is how it ends.

42
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,340
I've pictured it a thousand ways, but never this.

43
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,880
Me bound in the trunk of a car.

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,010
Fuck.

45
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,880
I am so fucked.

46
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,210
must be what your victims feel like.

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,530
Trapped, hopeless.

48
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,690
You got anymore words of encouragement
or are you just here to gloat?

49
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,190
I'm here for moral support.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,960
You were right about miguel.

51
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,010
He must hara sent mon after me.

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,560
- Dexter-- - I know I
only have myself to blame.

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,160
I don't blame you for wanting a friend.

54
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,140
A normal life.

55
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,810
You don't?

56
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,090
I'm actually proud of you for trying.

57
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,690
- It was brave.
- Yeah. Yay me.

58
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,060
I should have g ckinkilled
miguel when I had the chance.

59
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,460
You still can, dexter. Don't give up.

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,410
- What is this?
- Your bachelor party, hermano!

61
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,550
Ah, watch the grill, george foreman.

62
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,090
All aboard the party boat!

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,390
holy shit. Your eye's already swollen.

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,740
here he comes.

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,980
Ten minutes on. Ten minutes off.

66
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm sorry, vince. I just
thought-- I don't know.

67
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,580
that's fucking hilarious!

68
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,310
- You were freaked, right?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,220
Premium alcohol, all-you-can-eat buffet,
plus high-class adult entertainment.

70
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,900
Kill me now.

71
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,730
You guys, this is... awesome.

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,100
No, no, that's fucking awesome!

73
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,990
- Hey, ladies, what's going on?
- Hi, sailor.

74
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,590
The best man arrives with his brother.

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,410
Designated driver or bodyguard?

76
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,060
I'll find out later.

77
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,400
Right now, time to put on my party face.

78
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,900
Bachelor parties.

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,340
While I do understand the need for ritual,

80
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,970
I've heard these events
aren't really for the groom.

81
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,680
They're for everyone else.

82
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,300
I have plans to make for my own big day.

83
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,230
The day I kill miguel.

84
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,910
okay, okay, let's get the music down.

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,950
Okay, boys and girls! Put
those packages away, please.

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,030
So as you all know, we're here to, uh,

87
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,250
celebrate the impending marriage
of our dear friend dexter.

88
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,970
And while my job as best man
is to offer a few remarks,

89
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,200
you're gonna have to forgive
me for keeping them g-rated,

90
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,320
because I'm running for office after all.

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,760
Better run fast.

92
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,320
Dexter's a hard guy to get to know.

93
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,520
And for a smart guy, sometimes he doesn't have
the good sense that god gave little chickens.

94
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,420
I mean, like this doughnut
thing. What's up with that?

95
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,400
You bring doughnuts to work
so that people can like you?

96
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,950
Thanks for the diabetes and
the clogged arteries, dexter.

97
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,330
I mean, why don't you just stab
a pal in the ventricle, huh?

98
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,260
But in all seriousness. I, uh...

99
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,290
I wanna say a few words about friendship.

100
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,570
Friends are always honest with each other.

101
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,540
They can see past their differences.

102
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,140
When they have a conflict,
friends are there to forgive.

103
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,320
A true friend...

104
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,970
knows when to bury the hatchet
because friendship is a sacred bond...

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,410
built on trust.

106
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,930
And, dex, I have learned so
much from you about, uh...

107
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,070
trust.

108
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,210
So, cono. Hey, to dexter!

109
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,800
I have to be at work in 45 minutes.

110
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,590
Maybe I can squeeze in a
power nap and a quick shower.

111
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,680
Maybe not.

112
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:38,430
Good morning. Look, bagels. Soak up the alcohol.

113
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,240
Actually, I'm late for work.

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,690
How was it?

115
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,210
I survived.

116
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,100
If you're wondering if I did anything stupid...

117
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,650
I didn'T.

118
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,540
Mmm, well, it must have been very tempting.

119
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,790
Very.

120
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,150
Syl told me she kicked out miguel.

121
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,110
How is he?

122
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,400
Uh, I think he feels betrayed.

123
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,140
Why? He's the one who threw his
marriage vows out the window.

124
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,910
Who does that?

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,950
- A man without a code.
- Exactly. So.

126
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,460
What?

127
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,280
Well, I mean, just-- do you really want him
standing beside you on the biggest day of our lives?

128
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,480
Actually, no.

129
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,170
But I thought I should play
nice until after the wedding.

130
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,120
Just think about it, okay?

131
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,220
What is that?

132
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,630
Oh, it's a, uh, hour-by-hour
schedule for the day of.

133
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,140
There's hair and makeup for me.

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,390
Transportation, pictures, ceremony.

135
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,180
Things are bound to go wrong. The
less left to chance the better.

136
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,800
- Wise words.
- I'll make you a copy.

137
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,610
Great. But can we talk wedding stuff later?

138
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,020
I really gotta get in the shower.

139
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,620
You want some company?

140
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,450
Yeah. But I'm too late.

141
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,110
after last night, they all
think we share a secret.

142
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,920
But miguel's the only one who knows mine.

143
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,230
I could tell the rest of them,
but then I'd have to kill them.

144
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,340
Just like I'm going to kill miguel.

145
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,710
What am I, the morgan family punching bag?

146
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,090
Thanks for not inviting me
to dexter's party, you ass.

147
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,730
It was a bachelor party. Dongs and gongs required.

148
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,980
Unless you wanna be
talent. In which case--

149
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,380
- gross, he's my brother.
- Not by blood.

150
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,720
Oh, thank god. My head.

151
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,160
Your head should be in the
ellen wolf case, detective.

152
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,080
Let's review.

153
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,070
toby edwards. Bartender/booty-call.

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,710
Saw a black suv outside ellen
wolf's place the night she died.

155
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,090
Miguel's black suv.

156
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,980
And the grid we set up, what did we get?

157
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,850
jack diddly.

158
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,360
There's no traffic surveillance
footage of any black suv

159
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,710
between ellen's house and the
cemetery where her body was found.

160
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,890
Maybe I could kill him in his
car. It has that big backseat.

161
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,240
Let's recanvass. Somebody saw
something, and we're gonna find them.

162
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,740
Next order of business. The skinner. George king.

163
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,760
The nicaraguan embassy is
still giving me the runaround.

164
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,730
Ramos. Go there in person.

165
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,210
Until we know king's true
identity, there's not much to go on.

166
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,160
And finally, anton briggs is coming
in today to go over his statement.

167
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,540
Today?

168
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,420
What's the matter, you forget your lip gloss?

169
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,810
quinn. I want you to stay clear. No more sparring.

170
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,370
And, morgan, I know he's your
informant, but I wanna cover it.

171
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,720
Get myself up to speed with the case.

172
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,350
All right, people. That's it. Go, catch bad guys.

173
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,070
Fuck you, lip gloss.

174
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,390
No unusual activity?

175
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,780
There was some douchebag with
his high beams on, blinding me.

176
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,140
Actually, it wasn't high beams.
It was those big-ass halogens.

177
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,970
What kind of car?

178
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,890
Suv. Dark, blue... black.

179
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,640
Something like that.

180
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,500
<i>LINCOLN, NAVIGATOR, SUV, BLACK</i>

181
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,590
Hola, miguel.

182
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,640
Mmm, asi, asi.

183
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,960
Yeah, listen, after that
scene with syl the other night,

184
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,730
I think we should talk.

185
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,410
That's great.

186
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,930
Get a 20 on anton briggs.

187
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,820
Have his uni watchdogs bring him in.

188
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,880
You always look so happy to see me.

189
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,250
It's 'cause I always am.

190
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,030
I brought you these.

191
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,710
Italian hangover remedies perfected by
centuries of over-indulging ancestors.

192
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,870
There's saffron lemon risotto,
white pizza, cayenne tea.

193
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,630
Sounds great.

194
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,070
But I'm not hung-over.

195
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,490
I behaved myself last night.

196
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,020
I'm a plus-one now, remember?

197
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,470
Still, man has his needs.

198
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,020
Trust me.

199
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,370
My needs are covered.

200
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,640
cold feet?

201
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,840
What?

202
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,720
No, rita's great.

203
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,030
Getting married's easy, dex.

204
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,580
All you have to do is show up.

205
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,340
But killing miguel prado?

206
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,660
<i>KILL PLAN FOR MIGUEL PRADO</i>

207
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,720
That'll require some finesse.

208
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
He's a public figure. Well connected.

209
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,010
Dad, I got it. Miguel dies, people notice.

210
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,550
Which means you can't just make him disappear.

211
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,060
So I'll pin it on someone else.

212
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,920
How about your timeline?

213
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,410
Definitely after the wedding.
It'd be crazy to do it any sooner.

214
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,240
And an alibi?

215
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,140
The wedding night.

216
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,380
Rita's pregnant, exhausted.

217
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,730
After our wedding and a glass of
champagne, she'll be out like a light.

218
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,510
Unless she wakes up and you're not there.

219
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,910
That is not the way you want her
to remember your wedding night.

220
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,940
Are you hiding or something?

221
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,030
Anton will be here in a
minute. I don't wanna see him.

222
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,320
I know it's real mature, but if
I see him, I'll just miss him.

223
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,910
So tell him.

224
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,900
I can'T.

225
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,690
I need to be with somebody
who's got his shit together.

226
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,480
Somebody with a real job.
Somebody with strong morals.

227
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,700
Somebody like dad.

228
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,110
Dad wasn't perfect, deb.

229
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,030
Yeah, well, he wasn't a drug user or a C. I.

230
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,310
Well, anton's not a C. I.

231
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,580
Dad still wouldn't approve.

232
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,870
You'd be surprised.

233
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,060
What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,300
- Nothing.
- Something.

235
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,790
You've had a bug up your
ass about dad for months now.

236
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,710
What did he do?

237
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,920
You don't wanna know.

238
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,580
No, I really do.

239
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,980
He wasn't on the take.

240
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,940
He didn't break any laws. He didn't cheat on mom.

241
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,510
Bullshit.

242
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,120
Yeah, you're right.

243
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,470
Bullshit! Who?

244
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,060
A C. I.

245
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,790
You always wanted to be like dad.

246
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,180
Seriously?

247
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,510
Anton is here to go over
his statement... with you.

248
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,140
I thought you were covering this.

249
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,580
I was.

250
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,640
But you're the only one he trusts.

251
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,210
Well, it's really hard to find
people that you trust these days.

252
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,680
- Deb.
- Blow me.

253
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,950
My sister never says that.

254
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,650
Oops.

255
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,480
Shit, this was a bad idea. Send in the other guy.

256
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,760
What?

257
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,810
It's pretty clear you don't wanna be here.

258
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,340
I'M... sorry. This is not about you.

259
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,210
I mean, it's about you. It's just...

260
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,450
something else just happened.

261
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,240
Are you okay?

262
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,070
No.

263
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,910
Can I help?

264
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,890
You can take a look at this and see if
there's anything that you wanna change or add--

265
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,300
you know that's not why I'm here.

266
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,350
Right now I really need it to be.

267
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,780
What?

268
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,180
Is there a mistake?

269
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,850
No. It's just, um...

270
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,480
these words, they don't really say it.

271
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,260
You know, what-- what
happened to me.

272
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,870
What do you mean?

273
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,610
Debra, I could hear it, you know?

274
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,540
The sound...

275
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,760
of the blade cutting into me.

276
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,990
That and, uh, the sound of me screaming.

277
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Like it was somebody else.

278
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,000
And I remember thinking,

279
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,810
"that guy screaming...

280
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,340
he's gonna die."

281
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,880
But, um, then he just stopped.

282
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,410
Why?

283
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,350
To go through my pockets.

284
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,040
He took my wallet and my cell phone.

285
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,050
Cocksucker even took my change.

286
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,940
Your change?

287
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,200
How fucked up is that?

288
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,500
He give you anything?

289
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,930
Nothing we can use.

290
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,100
Sure, we'll walk the crime scene.
See if there's anything we missed.

291
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,270
Whatever it takes to fucking catch this guy.

292
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,440
Please tell me you're not freezing sperm in there.

293
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,590
This only gets down to
minus 40 degrees centigrade.

294
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,320
Freezing sperm requires a
vessel to be at least minus 200.

295
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,780
What? I'm a donor. It's my way of giving back.

296
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,440
God help the children.

297
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,180
Hey, um, is the, uh, server down?

298
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,480
Why, what do you need?

299
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,480
Um, I wanted to run a background check.

300
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,470
On who?

301
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,070
Tammy okama.

302
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,710
You slept with her, didn't you?

303
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,230
Vince masuka does not kiss and tell.

304
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,520
Okay, fine, I banged her.

305
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,760
And?

306
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,840
And...We just stayed
up all night just--

307
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,530
just talking.

308
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,850
So you like her?

309
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,160
The problem is she likes me.

310
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,690
I mean, there's gotta be
something wrong with her, right?

311
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,470
Well, I'll let you know when the server's up.

312
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,200
if home is where the heart is, where
do you go when you don't have a heart?

313
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,060
In miguel's case, a five-star hotel.

314
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,300
I used to know miguel's schedule inside and out.

315
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,440
After all, we were best friends.

316
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,590
But things change.

317
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,950
Now that syl kicked him out of the house,
he has a new routine I need to learn.

318
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,700
Can I get my keys? I forgot something.

319
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,930
Oh, yeah, there you are, mr. Prado.

320
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

321
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,320
Or I could wait for him to do something stupid.

322
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,430
Like ditching ramon.

323
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,520
You close to your father?

324
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,680
No. He was, uh, deadbeat
trailer-trash. It's why I became a cop.

325
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,620
You got a rich mother or something?

326
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,220
She died when I was five. Why?

327
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,980
The car, the watch.

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,390
Just wondering if you had a trust fund,
or you were day trading, or something.

329
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,560
No. I got an uncle in boston.

330
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,380
He died, left me a building. Total surprise.

331
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,470
Family's are full of 'em.

332
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,300
Just wait till dexter's wedding.
Brings out the best and the worst.

333
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,720
Weddings kinda suck when you're single.

334
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,690
Single? I thought
you and anton were--

335
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,830
we're not. Not anymore.

336
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,720
So, uh... you wanna, you know, carpool?

337
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,140
What? High gas prices, you know?

338
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,240
- Are you hitting on me?
- I'm sorry.

339
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,760
- Hello?
- Morgan.

340
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,050
- Hello?
- Hello?

341
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,350
God damn it, fucking cell phone reception.

342
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,760
It's batista.

343
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,470
Probably wants a status update.
We should give it to him.

344
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,630
Hey, you have any change? I
saw a payphone up the street.

345
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,090
Think so.

346
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,920
Motherfuck!

347
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,730
- Holy jesus on a stick!
- What?

348
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,880
No cell phone reception. That's
why george king took anton's change.

349
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,810
To use that payphone.

350
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,760
We gotta dump the phone records.

351
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,020
- Oye.
- Si?

352
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,110
I'm glad you called today.

353
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,460
I was surprised, but, uh, glad.

354
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,450
The last thing I wanted to do
was put you in the middle of--

355
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,470
maria, you gotta know that I've been
thinking about us for a long time.

356
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,170
Way before ellen wolf, rest in peace.

357
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,310
'Cause, hey,
what we had--

358
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,540
we were different back then. Really different.

359
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,080
So why is it every time I look at you I still
feel the same way I felt when we first met?

360
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,130
- Water's boiling.
- Boiling, yes, ooh.

361
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,910
It's mi sopa.

362
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,230
And I got you some red stripe.

363
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,160
Oh, wow, great.

364
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,110
Somewhere. Shit, I left it in the car.

365
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,010
- Oh, I'll go get it.
- No, no, no, no.

366
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,160
You stay and make sure it doesn't boil over.

367
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,730
Okay.

368
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,280
Miguel probably thinks he's getting lucky.

369
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,490
Looks like he's getting screwed.

370
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,970
They make a cute couple.

371
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,160
Too bad they're both lying through their teeth.

372
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,740
<i>LIFTGATE/GLASS AJAR</i>

373
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,410
Don't go there, miguel.

374
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,140
You start thinking laguerta's on to you,

375
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,540
you'll decide to do very bad
things to another innocent person

376
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,270
and I can't let that happen.

377
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:47,030
Things to do today: Find a non-blowback
way to dispose miguel's body.

378
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,450
I need you to run hair and fiber for me
against all victims for the last ten days.

379
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,530
But I'm the blood guy.

380
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,270
Who also does forensics.

381
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,320
Who I trust to keep a confidence
and the lab results off the record.

382
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,440
Well, keeping secrets is one of my strong suits,

383
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,030
but I kinda got my head handed to me the last
time I did some off-the-grid testing, by you.

384
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,070
This is different. That was bureaucratic bullshit.

385
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,750
And this is, "do as I say, not as I do"?

386
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,050
You ever get a voice inside nagging at you?

387
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,090
I'm aware of the phenomenon.

388
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,800
Well, I'm hoping I'm wrong about this.

389
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,060
But if I am and anyone finds out, it'll bring
a shit hurricane down on the entire department.

390
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,440
And if you're right?

391
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,070
Same hurricane, different landfall.

392
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,680
Got it. Either way, I need a raincoat.

393
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,810
No, I don't want you getting
into any trouble over this.

394
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,760
Use my authorization code to make it happen.

395
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,040
Procedure aboveboard, results... under the table.

396
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,830
You good with that?

397
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,920
Absolutely. If you need something
under the table, I'm your guy.

398
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,910
That didn't come out right.

399
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,100
How soon before you can get back to me with this?

400
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,770
A- s-a-P.

401
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,490
Accessing samples from
homicides in the last ten days.

402
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,610
Fast tracked and confidential.

403
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,710
Authorization code requested.

404
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,620
Processing. Approved.

405
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,230
You're the best.

406
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,600
I have to be.

407
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,630
muds and luds from that payphone.

408
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,870
George king was using it like an office line.

409
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,410
He called clients, he called workers,
he ordered nicaraguan take-out.

410
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,030
- That doesn't help us.
- Well, maybe it does.

411
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,700
I just got off the phone with some
lady that he called up in new jersey.

412
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,570
She winters down here at coconut grove.

413
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,990
She just re-hired george king
to re-landscape their lawn.

414
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,040
- So...
- so he knows the place is empty.

415
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,660
You think he'd be using it to lay low?

416
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,340
We got fuck-all else.

417
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,600
Vince.

418
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,090
The server's back up, so I ran your girl.

419
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,080
Bad news. She's got a rap sheet.

420
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,460
She rammed her car into someone
else over a parking space.

421
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,270
Yeah.

422
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,220
Big fine, anger management.

423
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,810
That means she's got issues.

424
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,210
So she's not outta my league.

425
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,640
Happy to help.

426
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,390
Both caucasoid. Evenly
distributed pigment granules.

427
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,260
Same dye job. In other words, both ellen wolf.

428
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,260
No news there.

429
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,060
Do I let laguerta in on this?

430
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,050
But why stir up the hornet's nest?

431
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,840
Miguel's going to get the
justice he deserves soon enough.

432
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,440
Hey, dex.

433
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,440
Too late to bring a date to the wedding?

434
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,910
No, rita's still collecting rsvps.

435
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,450
What you working on?

436
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,590
I, uh, found a gray hair. I was curious.

437
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,910
Oh, dude, I've totally done that.

438
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,820
You're bald.

439
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,430
Maybe we should call for backup?

440
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,330
Let's see what we got first.

441
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,890
Someone took the jungle cruise at magic kingdom.

442
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,460
Creeping mother of mary!

443
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,860
Door.

444
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,130
Fuck, there he is. Go around front.

445
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,020
Requesting all units, 931 harbor drive.

446
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,440
Fuck!

447
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,190
Fuck!

448
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,220
Jesus, quinn, are you okay?

449
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,440
Officer down. 931 harbor drive.

450
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,280
Requesting an ambulance, also
air surveillance of our 20.

451
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,550
What's this?

452
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,620
Dexter, I need to see you for a minute.

453
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,120
You found the hair analysis results?

454
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,580
Sorry, it-- you were out, and
they were just sitting there,

455
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,820
and I really needed to know what came back.

456
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,880
So. Now you know. Question
is, what are you gonna do?

457
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,880
It's complicated.

458
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,930
I understand complicated. Maybe I can help.

459
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,970
Okay.

460
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,870
You're close with miguel prado, and so am
I, which is what makes this very difficult.

461
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,550
What's this gotta do with miguel?

462
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,900
Ellen wolf was threatening to wreck his career.

463
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,640
Well, he has a black suv and
no alibi for the night she died.

464
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,690
You think miguel had something
to do with her murder?

465
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,680
I found this sample in the back of his car.

466
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,620
I told you this was complicated.

467
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,050
Dexter.

468
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,090
I need your word this stays between us.

469
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,080
Yeah, you have it.

470
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,710
No wonder all the secrecy.

471
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,900
I'm assuming there's no chain of custody on this?

472
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,580
I'll go to a judge for a warrant.

473
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,270
Get evidence through proper channels.

474
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,980
Which will tip off miguel and
put laguerta in his crosshairs.

475
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,800
You really think a judge is gonna issue a warrant

476
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,970
against a well-respected officer
of the court without probable cause?

477
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,940
I don't know, dexter. And I can't do nothing.

478
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,300
Not after these results.

479
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,360
Maybe you could sit on it. For a while.

480
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:53,170
Let miguel think he got away with murder.

481
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,900
It'd give you time to build a solid case.

482
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,660
I've got some serious soul searching to do.

483
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,940
Take as long as you need.

484
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,050
- Thanks for your help, dexter.
- Yeah.

485
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,500
While laguerta's deciding,
I'll be eliminating her problem.

486
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,520
And george king's going to help me.

487
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,470
I'll copy his M. O.

488
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,910
They won't even look for another suspect.

489
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,140
- What happened?
- king.

490
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,540
I told him to go home, but he's hell-bent
on proving he has cajones of steel.

491
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,480
- You good?
- Superficial cut. Let's keep moving.

492
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,480
All right, get me your report as soon as you can.

493
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,150
The brass is gonna be asking questions.

494
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,010
We had aerial surveillance, a security
perimeter, at least 50 officers.

495
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,920
It's like george king is a ghost.

496
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,790
Sorry, sarge.

497
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm not.

498
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:55,020
I need king out there long enough
to peg miguel's murder on him.

499
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,420
How long have you known?

500
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,700
About dad and his C. I.

501
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,020
Uh, couple of weeks.

502
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,240
Camilla told me right before she died.

503
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
- I didn't know if
I should-- - tell me?

504
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,080
Yes, whenever you have an earth-shattering,
ball-crushing, mind-fuck of a secret,

505
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,170
you should tell your fucking sister.

506
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,870
Sorry.

507
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,550
You can get that now.

508
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,030
Rita wants to know if you're
bringing anton to the wedding.

509
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,710
Bad timing.

510
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,310
No, I'm not bringing him.

511
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,520
Quinn sort of asked if I would go as his date.

512
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,270
But as much as I'll hate going
stag to my own brother's wedding,

513
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,380
being quinn's date depresses me even more.

514
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,190
He seems okay.

515
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,620
Yeah, he's fine. On paper he's a cop.

516
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,690
Good career.

517
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,740
Like dad.

518
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,770
Yeah. Well, it seems I don't know
dad as well as I thought I did.

519
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,090
Turns out I'm just as big a fuck-up as he was.

520
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,000
You're not a fuck-up.

521
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,810
You're the hardest working person I know.

522
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,850
You're loyal to a fault.

523
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,650
In all the years I've known
you, you've never let me down.

524
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,000
You should be my best man.

525
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,210
What?

526
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,200
Miguel is your best man.

527
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,200
He's not even a good man. I shoulda
asked you in the first place.

528
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,070
So why didn't you?

529
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,620
I don't know. I thought the best
man was supposed to be a man.

530
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:56,800
But I trust you... more than anyone.

531
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,340
That's way more important.

532
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,290
You better not be doing
this because you feel guilty.

533
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,750
Would you just... stand up for me?

534
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,990
Abso-fucking-lutely.

535
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,770
Long time.

536
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,350
Too busy with that new boyfriend of
yours to come down and talk shit with me?

537
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,680
What? Word travels.

538
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,990
Well, not fast enough. We broke up.

539
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,450
Hey, fuck him. His loss.

540
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,100
Yeah, well... I kinda need a favor.

541
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,800
That's what I'm here for. What you need?

542
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,010
All the records you have on my
dad's confidential informants.

543
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,410
Your dad?

544
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,890
I know it's a big dig, but I
just need the female C. I.'S.

545
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,250
And probably just the attractive ones.

546
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,420
Someone said something to you...

547
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,770
about harry and one of his C. I.'S?

548
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,950
His attractive female C. I.'S?

549
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,090
Why, you know something?

550
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,020
What I know is, your dad wouldn't be
the first cop to fuck around on his wife.

551
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,710
Look, I know you have
a lot of requests, but--

552
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,210
but nothing.

553
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,250
My dad stepped out on my mom.

554
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,250
Woulda cut off his dick if I coulda.

555
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,150
I'll put a rush on it.

556
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,460
Thank you.

557
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,080
Miguel's a night owl and a newly minted bachelor.

558
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,360
No way he's in bed this early.

559
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,110
are you kidding me? I'm not going to sleep.

560
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,640
The way the prados are knocking them
back, they're not going anywhere soon.

561
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,180
Just as well. I have some stalking to do.

562
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,710
- Hotel belvedere.
- Miguel prado, please.

563
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,520
Yes, sir. I'll connect you right away.

564
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,470
Got it.

565
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,850
- Excuse me.
- Si?

566
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,860
Could I get turndown service? Room 138.

567
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,160
Thanks.

568
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,930
Hello? Yeah.

569
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

570
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,640
Can I call you back on a landline?

571
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,490
Okay, bye.

572
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,530
I'm sorry, that's my boss.
Can you come back later?

573
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,230
Oh, si.

574
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,680
- Gracias.
- De nada, senor.

575
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,800
I can park right there.

576
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,000
Use this as my point of entry and make the grab.

577
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,500
I'm in and out undetected.

578
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,620
A life vest? Shit.

579
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,870
He's been back to that hardware
store. He's planning to kill again.

580
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,040
Fucking miguel and his innocent victims.

581
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,430
That's why he's at the bar.

582
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,320
Get ramon blackout drunk so miguel
can claim he was here the whole time.

583
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,540
Tonight's the night.

584
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,890
Maria?

585
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,880
Lieutenant, dexter here.

586
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,360
Hey, I came across something
you'll be interested in.

587
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:54,800
Kinda has to do with the whole miguel prado, ellen
wolf thing you wanted me to look at. You there?

588
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,520
We should meet.

589
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,320
I'll be at the rising moon cafe
at 91st and channel at 8:00 P. M.

590
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,280
I'll try your cell.

591
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,670
- Jesus!
- finally.

592
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,580
No, no, no, no, man.

593
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,970
Oh, god.

594
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,470
Maria.

595
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:03,780
Okay. Okay, okay,
I-- I know I--

596
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,250
I crossed the line here. I know that now.

597
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,570
It doesn't have to come to this.

598
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,690
But it always does.

599
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,380
I had higher hopes for you. For us.

600
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,050
But I finally just have to
accept it. I'll always be alone.

601
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,140
That's not true.

602
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,070
You talking truth? That's good.

603
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,370
You actually had me believing
I could have a friend,

604
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,400
'cause I swallowed your bullshit.

605
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,500
It wasn't bullshit!

606
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,340
I tried. I tried...

607
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,840
to crack that damn armor of yours.

608
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,780
Because I saw the possibility.

609
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,240
I still see the possibilities.

610
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,450
So this is my fault for being a shutdown?

611
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,190
No, I just want you to let me in.

612
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,660
Why the fuck would I do that now?

613
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,210
Because I know you.

614
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,290
Dexter, I know you better than anyone else.

615
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:17,080
No, there've been quite a few
who've seen the real me as they...

616
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,300
laid on that table.

617
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,390
You're all just unchecked versions of myself.

618
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,540
What I would have become without my father's code.

619
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,820
They deserved it!

620
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,840
I'm not like them!

621
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,000
You are. Admit it.

622
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:39,060
- I'm like you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

623
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,410
I know I'm a monster.

624
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,710
I accept you.

625
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,290
I accept you, dexter, like a brother.

626
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,440
I killed my brother.

627
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,330
I killed yours too.

628
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,000
Oscar?

629
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,060
You?

630
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,930
I didn't plan to, but it was kill or be killed.

631
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,830
You!

632
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,490
You killed oscar!

633
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:26,170
What did you say in your bachelor party speech?

634
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,470
"Friends are always honest."

635
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,070
Friends forgive.

636
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,770
Friends forgive.

637
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,460
But I don't forgive you.

638
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:55,550
And I don't get to have friends.

639
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,720
You little freak!

640
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,330
You think I'm done with you?

641
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,270
You think this ends here?

642
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,850
It doesn't!

643
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,360
It does for you.

644
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,040
Adios, amigo.
