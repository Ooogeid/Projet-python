3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,180
Previously on "Dexter"...

4
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,310
I got here as fast as I could.
What are we looking at?

5
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:53,198
Female victim cut
up into pieces.

6
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:54,900
The ice-truck killer? So soon?

7
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,600
This is what he wanted
me to find all along.

8
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:01,607
Dexter...

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,500
Laura Moser...

10
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,995
My mother.

11
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,805
Laura Moser and 3 others found
chopped up with a chain saw.

12
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,340
Your father was a decent
man and an honest cop,

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,200
but what he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,930
Angel was stabbed from behind,
you think it's the attacker's blood?

15
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,200
We know Batista fought back.

16
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,750
The samples you gave me were a match.
They're from the same person.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,500
So if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,535
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,350
Let's face it, Paul.
You've been a problem.

20
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,200
But I need you to explain to
them why you're in this place.

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,940
I have no fucking idea
why I'm in this place.

22
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:45,719
You really don't
want to do this.

23
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,593
Effective immediately, you will
no longer serve as my lieutenant.

24
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:50,633
This isn't fucking over, Tom!

25
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,870
Debra Morgan...

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
- Will you marry me?
- Yes, yes, yes.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Where's my sister?

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,257
Took her code 12.
Left about an hour ago.

29
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,700
She went to dinner?
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

30
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,700
You made it easy.
So desperate to fall in love.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Where the fuck are you?
I'm here at work, and you're not.

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,800
I need to talk to you.
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

33
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,100
I've lived in
darkness a long time.

34
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Over the years,
my eyes adjusted

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,650
until the dark became my
world and I could see.

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,200
But then Rudy turned
on the light.

37
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,550
He flooded my memory,
and now I'm blind.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,350
I don't have much time --

39
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,500
or, to be more accurate,
my sister doesn't have much time.

40
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,750
He wants me to find him,
but where do I look?

41
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,010
I can't think. It's too bright.

42
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,450
Let me know if the
tape's too tight.

43
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,150
There's no need for you
to be uncomfortable.

44
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,800
Why are you doing this?

45
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,360
Wouldn't want to
spoil the surprise.

46
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

47
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,500
Shh, I'm just checking
the supplies, okay?

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Things are moving a little
faster than I had planned.

49
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,050
This isn't you.

50
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,250
- Pretty sure it is.
- No.

51
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,300
I know there's more --
I've seen it.

52
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,200
I never wanted to hurt you.

53
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,050
I know. I know.

54
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,600
Does this make it easier for you?
Because I can keep going.

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

56
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,120
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, Jesus Christ!

57
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,180
There's nothing to
be ashamed of, Deb.

58
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,680
I mean, you're not the only
one who bought it, okay?

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,860
Your name isn't even
fucking Rudy Cooper, is it?

60
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,800
Nope...

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,400
- but he died for a good cause.
- Yeah, well, so will you.

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,750
You kidnapped a cop this time,
you know?

63
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,900
Not some invisible hooker --
you kidnapped a cop.

64
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
It's all part of the plan.

65
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,250
Oh, Jesus.

66
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,250
It's hard to believe it's
almost come to fruition.

67
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,450
I mean,
this is a lot of years in the making.

68
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,850
We're only hours away.

69
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:44,477
He wouldn't have taken
Deb unless he left me

70
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:47,365
everything a clever monster
would need in order to find them.

71
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,420
* born free *

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,100
as free as the wind blows

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
* as free as the grass grows *

74
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,500
* born free to
follow your heart *

75
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,800
Seems I have a
new screen saver.

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,500
I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded,
but "born free"?

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,650
Of course.

78
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,800
Thanks to Rudy, now I know where
dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

79
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,910
Born free of all
that's human --

80
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,700
that's where I'll find him.

81
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,623
She knows.

82
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,150
She knows.

83
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
She knows.

84
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,470
She knows.

85
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,350
She knows.
She knows.

86
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,780
She knows.

87
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,516
All fucking night with that.

88
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:55,823
She knows.

89
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:59,890
Hey! Listen, Angel,
we need your help.

90
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,686
Masuka says you were
following up a lead

91
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,000
on the ice-truck killer
when you were attacked.

92
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,980
A hooker with a
prosthetic hand.

93
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,000
John painted her nails different colors,
but it didn't go nowhere.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,310
Except she was just cut up
by the ice-truck killer.

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,830
Holy shit.
Monique was a victim?

96
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:16,725
Now, we're operating
on the theory

97
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,450
that he found out you
were on his trail.

98
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,400
And if we're right,
that means you got stabbed for a reason.

99
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,700
- It wasn't no carjacking.
- How did he know it was me?

100
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,220
No one knew what I was
doing except Masuka.

101
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,620
Someone else had
to know. Think.

102
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,650
I consulted with Rudy,
Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

103
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,700
But that's crazy, right?

104
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,060
No, she's been AWOL since going
out last night to meet him.

105
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,850
She was supposed to come
back and help me canvass,

106
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,000
- but she never made it.
- That's not like her.

107
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,300
- Angel, we got to go.
- Just go.

108
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,100
There are roughly 5,000 cargo
containers in the port of Miami.

109
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,350
Finding the one where my mother
was butchered took a bit of magic.

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,600
Busted.

111
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,700
Busted.

112
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,100
Shit.

113
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Just a second!

114
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,000
I told you he was here.

115
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,900
There some reason you're not
answering your damn phone?

116
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,150
Ambien.

117
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,600
What happened here, Dexter?

118
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,100
I couldn't find the remote.

119
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Where's your sister?

120
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,650
She didn't come back to work,
and she's not at her apartment.

121
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,550
I honestly don't
know, sergeant.

122
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,460
Dexter, we think her boyfriend Rudy's
connected to the ice-truck killer.

123
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:00,932
We're working on getting a search
warrant right now to search his home.

124
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,400
Oh, my. Oh, wow.

125
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,600
Cut the crap.
You know something. What?

126
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,250
James.

127
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I saw him last night,
skulking in the lab,

128
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
ordering secret blood tests.

129
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,753
What kind of tests?

130
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,513
I was looking for a type match on
the blood on Batista's collar.

131
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,750
And whose was it?

132
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,400
Rudy's.

133
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,250
- Motherfucker.
- Knock it off!

134
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,705
- He knew all along!
- Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

135
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,952
Angel headbutted his
attacker in the face.

136
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,170
- It was just a wild hunch.
- Why didn't you tell us?

137
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,779
I couldn't destroy Deb's
love life on a hunch.

138
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,475
- I had to get the facts.
- Here are the facts --

139
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,800
if he kills her, it's your fault.
Now, what else do you know?

140
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:46,000
- That's it.
- He's lying.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
Give him a break, James.
It's his sister, all right?

142
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,222
Well, if he knows what's good for her,
he'll sit his ass at home

143
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:53,870
and answer the fucking
phone when it rings.

144
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
Call if you hear anything.

145
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,750
Hello?

146
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,100
- Please don't hang up.
- Paul?

147
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,600
The kids don't want to talk to you,
all right?

148
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,711
You got to give them more time.

149
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,100
This isn't about them.
It's about how I was arrested.

150
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,950
Yeah, with a needle in your arm --
I know all about it.

151
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, I don't.

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,009
Listen, I take responsibility
for all the shit I pulled,

153
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,160
but, Rita,
I was in the program.

154
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,150
- I kicked the hard stuff.
- Well, apparently not.

155
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,110
I was clean.
I swear on my kids' lives.

156
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,750
It's been driving
me nuts how I got

157
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,209
from your house one minute
to the motel room the next,

158
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,220
completely out of
my mind on junk.

159
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,234
Yeah, it's called
a blackout, Paul.

160
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,491
It's called a setup.

161
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:55,391
The last thing I remember was standing
in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

162
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,544
Now, he could have smacked
me over the head and

163
00:11:57,544 --> 00:11:59,720
dragged me out of the house
probably through the backyard.

164
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,320
You really are a piece of work.

165
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm telling you --
Dexter is not who you think he is.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,900
Hello?

167
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:11,050
This one, I've got to make sure we
got about seven copies of these.

168
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,233
I want to make sure it's
distributed to everyone, okay?

169
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:15,893
Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

170
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,150
Some of you may have met him.
He was dating officer Morgan.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,050
Now, she was last
seen 16 hours ago,

172
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,398
driving to meet him at
the Miami Beach marina.

173
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,596
So we need to canvass
the entire area.

174
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:28,751
Check boat rentals.
You guys know the drill.

175
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:31,989
I've already sent a team over to
his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

176
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,485
The judge just signed off on the
warrant for Cooper's apartment.

177
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,251
Well, let's tear
that place apart.

178
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,990
Jake, Sergio, Kim,
you guys are with me.

179
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,094
Your attention, please.

180
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,852
I want to introduce you to our
new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

181
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,650
She agreed to put
her vacation on hold,

182
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,730
come in early,
to provide us with

183
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,800
some much-needed leadership
at this critical time.

184
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,100
Lieutenant, you're on.

185
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:58,000
I understand we have a new suspect
in the ice-truck killer case.

186
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,210
We're on our way over
now to search his place.

187
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,420
And you are...

188
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,000
Maria Laguerta.

189
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,900
And we have an officer missing,
so we need to move fast.

190
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,750
I thought that sergeant Doakes
was running that investigation.

191
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,850
- He's out following a lead.
- What lead?

192
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,500
He said he'd let me know
if it came to anything.

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,710
I'll take it over from here.
Thank you, Maria.

194
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Who here can get me up to
speed on the way over?

195
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:20,500
I can, I guess.

196
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,750
You're driving.

197
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,200
And feel free to join us when
you locate your partner.

198
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Would you like to come
with us, captain?

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,750
You seem to have
everything under control.

200
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,750
Let's go, people.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,850
It's in there somewhere --
my birthplace.

202
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,300
Now what?

203
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,020
No cameras,
no patrols, no dogs.

204
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,340
With billions spent
on homeland security,

205
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,700
it can't be as easy
as a couple of snips.

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,720
So much for the war on terror.

207
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,050
Finding a needle in a haystack

208
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,600
isn't hard when every
straw is computerized.

209
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

210
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,500
I don't like this place.

211
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Something nameless
was born here...

212
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,820
Something that lives
in the deepest,

213
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,100
darkest hole of the
thing called "Dexter."

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
Get in there!

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,450
Somebody else --
get in there now!

216
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,850
It's all right, little guy.
You're safe now.

217
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,450
Nothing will hurt you --
I promise.

218
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Okay, Deb...

219
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,600
don't be dead.

220
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,500
Shit.

221
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,210
Surprise, motherfucker.

222
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:29,445
Are you following me now?

223
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,000
You better have a hell of
a reason for being here.

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,350
- I'm looking for my sister.
- In a cargo box?

225
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:35,431
Yeah, I'm kind of
working on a theory.

226
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,750
You forget you work
for the fucking cops?

227
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,000
We love theories.
Spin me a story, asshole.

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,880
What I do on my time is
my business, sergeant.

229
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,770
Yeah, me too,
and I'm on my time now.

230
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,970
There's no lieutenant
here to save your ass,

231
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,570
- so don't fuck with me, Morgan!
- All right, you got me.

232
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,000
I ordered some
furniture from Thailand.

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,450
I was waiting for
it to be delivered.

234
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,333
Lab geek -- my ass.

235
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:06,006
Hey, what the hell's
going on over here?!

236
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:08,082
Security, I need to get
somebody down here right now.

237
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,785
- Miami metro P.D.
- Is this guy under arrest?

238
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:14,570
- That's a good question.
- You're connected to this.

239
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,900
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna find out,

240
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
and some of what I find is
gonna stick to your ass.

241
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,432
Let me out of
here, motherfucker!

242
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,257
Let me out of here!

243
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,080
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out, you piece of shit!

244
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,667
Let me out of here,
you fucking piece -- Aah!

245
00:17:52,836 --> 00:17:56,032
Fuck! Let me out! Aah!

246
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,021
Sorry, but you were
drowning out Fred's radio,

247
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:01,415
and he was kind enough
to lend us his wheels.

248
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:05,563
Bye!

249
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,290
His happy place,
where he kills more than time --

250
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
This is where he'd
leave me a clue.

251
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
- Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.
- I like the cold.

252
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
You know,
hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

253
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

254
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,500
And a home setup like this would
take years to put together.

255
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,270
He must have hated
leaving it behind.

256
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,900
- What are you looking for?
- A clue --

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,606
signature or calling card --

258
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:29,220
anything that might give us
a sense of where he went.

259
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,641
Well, I don't think he was
exactly thinking about us

260
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,100
when he did this.
I mean, look at this place.

261
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,250
Hey, you were right about the
victim at Santa's cottage.

262
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,400
He rushed his work.

263
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,544
He killed that girl to keep
us busy so he could escape,

264
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,164
but he wouldn't go without
leaving us a message.

265
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,360
We just need to find it.

266
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,200
Check this out.
This is where he played with his meat.

267
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,300
Pretty whacked out, huh?

268
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,770
I can think of 101 uses for this table.
Know what I mean?

269
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
He has my sister, Vince.

270
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,200
Right. I mean --
I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

271
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,300
Shit.

272
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,770
You're Karen, right?

273
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,130
Mm-hmm. That's right.

274
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:12,241
You're in charge of evidence --
this entire room -- evidence.

275
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,720
Take photos of every item
in its original position.

276
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
?????????

277
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,250
Show me the inventory
list when you're done.

278
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,300
Is he in charge?

279
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Guess he is now.

280
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,210
Rita? Rita? Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

281
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,500
Can I help you?

282
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,250
I guess Paul never
mentioned me.

283
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm his narcotics
anonymous sponsor.

284
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,850
Right. So, having your
sponsor do your dirty work --

285
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,300
Which step is that?

286
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,699
See, he's --
he's just concerned for the kids.

287
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,933
No, he's concerned for himself.
If you'll excuse me...

288
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,850
I thought he was lying,
too, until I saw the proof.

289
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:57,845
What proof?

290
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,700
Well, the X-rays the prison
doctor took of Paul's head --

291
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:05,270
- they showed a skull fracture.
- Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

292
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,556
No. You didn't.
See, after you struck him,

293
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:11,850
the hospital took x-rays --
no fracture.

294
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:16,413
- But in prison, a fracture.
- If you know Paul, you'd know

295
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,035
he'd bash his own head against
the wall to get what he wants.

296
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,225
Well, I do know Paul.
I think I know him pretty well.

297
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,522
Listen, if Paul was attacked,

298
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,700
the way that it happened --
that takes expertise, skill.

299
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
No first-timer is gonna
be able to pull that off.

300
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,900
Yeah, which is why his
accusations are ludicrous.

301
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,260
Dexter spends all his time in
a laboratory, for God's sake.

302
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,100
So you've been there?

303
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,966
Bob...

304
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
You seem like a nice man,

305
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,500
but this is none of
your goddamn business.

306
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,105
Okay. Got it.

307
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,050
We traced the name and
social of Rudy Cooper

308
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,225
to a New Jersey plumber who
mysteriously died in '98.

309
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,230
You got to be kidding me.
After all this,

310
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,735
we still don't have an I.D.
on this guy?

311
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:59,125
Rudy isn't his real name?

312
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,725
- You trying to be smart?
- Not trying, no.

313
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,375
If you fucking know his name,
you better --

314
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,700
Whatever it is going on between you two,
it ends now.

315
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,270
What did you find in there?

316
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,445
Other than the obvious,
a lot of trace bloodstains.

317
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,325
It's probably where
he killed them all,

318
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:20,815
but I'd like to look at the rest
of the apartment before I go.

319
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,900
Yeah, okay.

320
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,630
- You mind if I...
- Be my guest.

321
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,600
It's perfect --
right out in the open.

322
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,210
At least he's consistent.

323
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,280
Was there anything else
near this record player?

324
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,930
Yeah, a fucking doll
sitting on top.

325
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,400
"Home sweet home."

326
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Is he taking me back
before the blood,

327
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,100
to a place where
a boy was born?

328
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,110
Home sweet home,
but which home?

329
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,260
Down on the floor, please.

330
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,600
It's kind of foolish, Deb.

331
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,850
I don't usually work this way.

332
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,850
Call it

333
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,300
an homage to a fellow
traveler I greatly admire.

334
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,350
Laura Moser --
addict, dealer --

335
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,350
my mother.

336
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,813
Arrested in '69, again in '71.
Same address listed both times.

337
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,200
1235 Mangrove Drive.

338
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:10,650
They say home is
where the heart is.

339
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,360
Maybe this is
where I left mine.

340
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,050
Surprise.

341
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,600
What are you doing here?

342
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,800
Uh, white-chocolate mocha --
your favorite.

343
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,950
I'm gonna have to
drink it on the road.

344
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,200
You know,
I've never even been here before.

345
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,560
- I'd love a tour sometime.
- Yeah, sometime that's not now.

346
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,600
- Dexter, what's going on?
- It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

347
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,500
- Oh, God. Is it serious?
- Yeah, actually, it's very serious,

348
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,700
but I just can't worry about you,
too, right now.

349
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:51,530
She knows. She knows.
She knows.

350
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,016
...been leaving a
trail of dead bodies.

351
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,077
Authorities say
their big break came

352
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,374
when they found a video
of his latest victim.

353
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:01,343
If she knows, you yapping about it
ain't gonna change it. Shut the fuck up!

354
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:04,710
The suspect is operating under
an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

355
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:07,268
We didn't have his fingerprints
in our criminal database,

356
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,348
so his identity is
still unclear to us.

357
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:13,057
- She knows. She knows.
- So sorry, Mr. Batista.

358
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,493
We had to take the psych
overflow from County,

359
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,991
- but this one's harmless.
- Yeah, don't be so sure.

360
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:21,003
Oh, we never take
the violent ones.

361
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,716
They have the arsonists, the rapists,

362
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:25,516
the psycho killers over there.

363
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,470
I tell you --
those people belong in prison.

364
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,700
Do they fingerprint
psych patients at County?

365
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,780
Yes, of course.
Half of them don't know their own names.

366
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
Got to I.D. them somehow.

367
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,500
That should take care of him.
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

368
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,220
I.D. tech.

369
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,928
Hey, it's, uh, Batista.
Can you do me a favor?

370
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,372
I need you to run
Rudy Cooper's prints

371
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:03,000
against psych, mental,
and institution records.

372
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:49,528
Dexter! Dexter!

373
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,954
Where are you,
you silly little bear?

374
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:56,540
I'm gonna find you!

375
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,283
Where can you be?

376
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:03,660
You silly little goose.
I'm gonna find you!

377
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,547
You silly bear.
Where is my baby?

378
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:11,726
Where is my Dexter?
Where are you?

379
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:16,051
- Here!
- Oh, my goodness, yes!

380
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:18,818
You surprised me,
you stinky little bear.

381
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:22,100
Hey, where could your
brother be hiding?

382
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,146
Bynie's right there.

383
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,500
- Hey, Bynie.
- You weren't supposed to tell her.

384
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:36,529
You remember now?

385
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:42,110
Bynie.

386
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,000
You always had trouble
saying "Brian."

387
00:27:48,194 --> 00:27:51,000
- I have a brother.
- A real brother --

388
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,012
none of this foster bullshit.

389
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:58,368
We're blood brothers,
through birth and death.

390
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:00,555
Watching mom die --

391
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,480
it's amazing that we survived that,
isn't it?

392
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:08,728
The chain saw,
the flying body parts, 

393
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
the blood.

394
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You were there, too.

395
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,800
Two days sitting in blood
before they found us,

396
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,050
but you were young
enough to block it out.

397
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,350
I've never forgotten
the day that we were...

398
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,400
- Born.
- Exactly.

399
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,600
Where's Deb?

400
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I waited for you
before we got started.

401
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
- Debra!
- She's not in here.

402
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
Deb!

403
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Debra!

404
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,400
This is not the way I
envisioned our family reunion.

405
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,000
Come on,
let's just sit down and have a beer.

406
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:05,981
Deb?

407
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
That was the best wipeout.
You didn't even cry.

408
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,000
Next time you try my skateboard,
bend your knees, okay?

409
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,125
Hi.
Hi.

410
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:24,752
Look out!

411
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,893
I didn't want to
do it this way.

412
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,291
Okay, let's run his description
against Interpol's fugitive list,

413
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,785
in case he isn't american.

414
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:47,119
Rudy Cooper?
His real name is Brian Moser.

415
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:48,989
Angel, what the hell
are you doing here?

416
00:29:49,172 --> 00:29:50,578
I got a hit on his prints

417
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,988
from a Tampa mental
hospital where he grew up.

418
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:58,440
He was institutionalized for
antisocial personality disorder.

419
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,460
At 21, they said he was cured.
They released him.

420
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,791
Run the name "Brian
Moser" for credit cards,

421
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,275
bank accounts,
real-estate holdings --

422
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:08,000
anything that might tell
us where he's got Morgan.

423
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,250
Listen up. We've triangulated
officer Morgan's cellphone.

424
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,700
Last known location --
20 miles off the coast,

425
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,600
which means he's
got her on a boat.

426
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,250
We have his real name.
We're digging into his records.

427
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,600
His name's not gonna help
us find him in open water.

428
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,200
I want a coordinated search
with the coast guard.

429
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,700
- Waste of time.
- Chain of command.

430
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,790
Flyovers, helicopters --
whatever it takes.

431
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,211
Lieutenant, that signal
died last night.

432
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,412
By now, he has most likely
taken her to his final location.

433
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,000
Noted.

434
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
Let's get busy, people.

435
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,969
Flyovers look good to the press,
but they won't find Morgan.

436
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,420
You think the press
matters to me?

437
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,675
It matters to captain Matthews,
and he calls the shots.

438
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,837
Look, I know you need
to define yourself here

439
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,500
and putting me in my place
is one way to do that,

440
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,220
but one of our own is missing,

441
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and we shouldn't waste
our time pissing on trees.

442
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I agree.

443
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:05,634
I can also see why
you were reassigned,

444
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:07,930
and it has nothing to
do with incompetence

445
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:11,100
and everything to do with the
captain trying to save his job.

446
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,500
Okay.

447
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,320
Now, I was hired with the directive
to not make your life easy.

448
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,125
So you're gonna
ignore the lead?

449
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:26,200
You don't know me very well,

450
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:29,000
but luckily for officer Morgan,

451
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,300
neither does the captain.

452
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:44,458
Nothing personal.

453
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
I swore that I'd have a

454
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,450
beer with you before
we got started.

455
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,800
You made that kind
of difficult.

456
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Sorry.

457
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:57,890
You don't ever have to apologize to me,
Dexter --

458
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,220
not for who you are
or anything you do.

459
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,250
Looks just like it used to,
doesn't it?

460
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:11,200
Who does it belong to?

461
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,150
Me.

462
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,451
I got it for you, actually.

463
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:25,725
I'm really more an
apartment person.

464
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,100
You're trapped in a lie,
little brother,

465
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:34,800
the same lie they
tried forcing me into.

466
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:37,900
- "They"?
- You know...

467
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:42,050
Doctors, therapists,
group leaders --

468
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,900
what a family they were.

469
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:46,704
You were never put
up for adoption.

470
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:48,762
Afraid not. You were 3,

471
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,175
a little bird with
a broken wing.

472
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,760
First cop on the scene --
Harry Morgan.

473
00:32:58,236 --> 00:33:00,000
He wanted to make
you all better.

474
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,850
But me --
I could see it in his eyes.

475
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:07,500
All he saw was a
fucked-up kid --

476
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:09,500
they all did,

477
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,750
so they locked me up.

478
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,900
- I didn't even know you existed.
- Of course you didn't.

479
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,225
Harry wanted to keep
you all to himself.

480
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,125
And while you were being
raised by the Morgan family,

481
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,450
I only had the
memory of a family.

482
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:33,443
Me.

483
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:36,900
Mom always told me
to look after you.

484
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,000
Imagine how I felt

485
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,800
when I tracked you down and found
out you were exactly like me.

486
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't have to imagine.

487
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,470
I know what you've been going
through all these years --

488
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,250
the isolation, the otherness,

489
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,110
a hunger that's
never satisfied.

490
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:10,410
Well, you're not
alone anymore, Dexter.

491
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,622
You can be yourself with me --

492
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:19,000
your real, genuine self.

493
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:25,425
Takes the breath away,
doesn't it?

494
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:52,320
I think we're ready for Debra.

495
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,470
I've prepared her just
the way you like.

496
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:25,850
This time,
we'll do it together.

497
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:32,000
Does it have to be Deb?

498
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,500
It's the only way.

499
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:39,360
- But she's my...
- Fake sister -- I know.

500
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,000
Tell me something...

501
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:49,225
Your victims --
are they all killers?

502
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,135
Yes.

503
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,120
Harry teach you that?

504
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,520
He taught me a code...

505
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,100
To survive.

506
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:07,230
- Like an absurd avenger?

507
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,880
- That's not why I kill.

508
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,183
You can be yourself around me.

509
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,908
Who am I?

510
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:19,800
A killer...

511
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:27,000
..without reason or regret.

512
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:29,520
You're free.

513
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,173
You can be that way, too.

514
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:36,800
What about the code?

515
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,030
Damn it, Dex,
you don't have a code.

516
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:46,200
Harry did.
And he's been dead 10 years.

517
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:51,110
You can't keep him sitting on your
shoulder like Jiminy fucking Cricket.

518
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
You need to embrace
who you are now.

519
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,400
- I don't know who I am.

520
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:09,246
- Of course you don't.

521
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:12,050
You've been away from your
family since you were 3,

522
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,050
but I'm here now.
I can help you.

523
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,400
We can take this
journey together.

524
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,000
I can't.

525
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:32,000
Not Deb.

526
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, no. Don't --
don't say that.

527
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:35,570
I'm very...

528
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,400
fond of her.

529
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,040
You can't be a
killer and a hero.

530
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
It doesn't work that way!

531
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:01,100
Morgan!

532
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,600
Cover the yard!
We're going into the house!

533
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,216
Fuck.

534
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:07,000
In the garage!

535
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,000
Through that door!

536
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,640
Cover this door!
Cover the door!

537
00:38:16,954 --> 00:38:20,528
Come on. Stay with me. Shit.

538
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:24,600
Maria, stay on the door.
He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

539
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,845
Cover me, man.

540
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:35,603
Get in.

541
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:44,335
Shit.

542
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:57,273
Chopper 1 to command --

543
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:59,662
we're broadening the
search to a 5-mile radius.

544
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,535
Any headache, dizziness?

545
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:05,442
I'm fine.
I just want to go home.

546
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm afraid we have to transport
you to the hospital --

547
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,200
standard procedure.

548
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,900
You're saying Rudy called you?

549
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,030
Why would he do that?

550
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,300
I think he wanted me to
try to talk him down.

551
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,889
He said he was having second
thoughts about killing Deb.

552
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:21,021
He seemed to feel like we
have some kind of connection.

553
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,150
He's not the only one.

554
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,641
He said he'd kill Deb if
I didn't show up alone.

555
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:27,465
Well, you almost
fucking got her killed.

556
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,843
I'm gonna request an immediate
suspension when we get back.

557
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:31,828
You're gonna what?

558
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:35,186
Morgan, you shouldn't
be out here.

559
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:36,866
Are you questioning Dexter?

560
00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:38,600
Morgan.

561
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:40,736
Back the fuck off my brother!

562
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:43,881
He just saved my life!
He's a fucking hero!

563
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:46,712
Want each of you to treat him that way,
god damn it!

564
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,500
Way to go, Deb.

565
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:05,750
I thought you were gonna burst
a frontal lobe out there.

566
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,557
Assholes.

567
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:24,300
Stop. You're gonna
dislocate it.

568
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,400
Oh, God, get it off me.
I'm gonna be sick.

569
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,600
Relax. Here.

570
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,400
Get off.

571
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,715
He's still out there.

572
00:40:39,205 --> 00:40:40,040
Yeah.

573
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,100
And he didn't get
what he wanted.

574
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:47,200
No.

575
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,420
Think he'll try it again?

576
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:54,300
Maybe.

577
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,450
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to captain
Matthews about getting us

578
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,450
an officer stationed outside
your hospital room tonight.

579
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,400
No, I'm not staying in
a fucking hospital.

580
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,500
There's nothing
fucking wrong with me.

581
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,220
- Well, you're not staying at home.

582
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,500
- Well, I'll just crash with you.

583
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:14,350
Let's just wait and see what
the doctor says, all right?

584
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:15,934
Yeah.

585
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:19,532
Yeah.

586
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:27,250
Why me, Dex?

587
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:30,300
Why'd he choose me?

588
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,400
You're just lucky, I guess.

589
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,050
I was so scared.
I was so scared.

590
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,400
I know.

591
00:41:59,738 --> 00:42:02,500
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

592
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,500
Dad would be so proud.

593
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:18,412
- Dexter?
- It's me.

594
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,600
Paul, this is harassment.

595
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,345
Just tell me if
he's acting weird.

596
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:26,500
- Who?
- Dexter --

597
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,584
he hasn't been himself lately,
has he?

598
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:30,361
How could he be,
after what he did to me?

599
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:31,850
All right, that's it. I'm done.

600
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,000
Call again, and you can forget

601
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,150
about seeing the kids
this weekend or ever.

602
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,255
I am not gonna subject
them to your insanity.

603
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,126
Fine, if that's what it takes
for you to listen to me.

604
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:41,809
I just want to know
that they're safe.

605
00:42:41,948 --> 00:42:43,100
Why are you doing this, Paul?

606
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,220
What -- you want me to be
miserable and alone like you?

607
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:49,850
All I want is for you
to look for a shoe.

608
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,181
A shoe?

609
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,375
Could be in the kitchen.
Could be in the backyard.

610
00:42:53,564 --> 00:42:56,102
It's missing.
I checked, and it wasn't in the items

611
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,409
that they got from the motel
room when I was arrested.

612
00:42:58,439 --> 00:42:59,700
And why would it be here?

613
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
I was trying to figure out
why my ankle was so bruised.

614
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,700
Now I'm thinking it got banged
when Dexter dragged me out,

615
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,100
- when my shoe was knocked off.
- Good night, Paul.

616
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,228
Night.

617
00:43:21,885 --> 00:43:22,723
Screw you.

618
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,830
What did I just do?

619
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:30,300
I drove away a brother who accepts me,
sees me,

620
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:34,100
for an adopted sister
who'd reject me if she knew

621
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,550
and a foster father
who betrayed me.

622
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,600
That's what it was --
a betrayal.

623
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:43,750
The most important
single fact about me --

624
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,150
I'm not alone --
and Harry kept it from me.

625
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:48,760
What do I really
owe him after that?

626
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:55,350
Mr. Morgan?

627
00:43:58,762 --> 00:43:59,600
Mr. Morgan?

628
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,050
That's me.

629
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,590
Your sister has a few bruises,
but no major injuries.

630
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,604
Still, you should
keep an eye on her.

631
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:08,805
I'll write a prescription
for a mild sedative.

632
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:10,075
But she's okay, right?

633
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,447
She can go home with you tonight,
far as I'm concerned,

634
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:15,300
or we can keep her here at the
hospital -- it's your choice.

635
00:44:22,515 --> 00:44:24,250
Don't worry.
The sheets are clean.

636
00:44:25,185 --> 00:44:27,820
We aim to please
here at chez Dex.

637
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:33,800
I'll be sleeping on the couch
with a spring in my side

638
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,000
just to make sure you're
safe tonight, but...

639
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:40,710
We're gonna have to talk
tomorrow about a long-term plan,

640
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,000
after you get a
good night's sleep.

641
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:46,456
Deb?

642
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:01,695
Good night, sister.

643
00:46:31,515 --> 00:46:33,500
I stopped by your
prosthetics lab

644
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:35,500
after I left Deb
at the hospital.

645
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:41,400
Your work's so good,
you even fooled yourself.

646
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:45,700
Sweet dreams, Bynie.

647
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:13,998
Hey.

648
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:21,150
You weren't supposed
to wake up.

649
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,750
I guess not.

650
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:24,333
Sorry.

651
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:28,126
Police recorded all your
knives as evidence.

652
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:33,111
Took a while to find
your dinner flatware.

653
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:34,133
Sterling.

654
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:39,573
I keep it for
special occasions.

655
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:41,993
Which you are.

656
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:48,000
I can give you more
tranquilizer if you want.

657
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,730
It's a service I
don't usually offer.

658
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,750
What am I --
one of your victims now?

659
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,800
You going to collect
a little sample

660
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
of Bynie's blood for
your slide collection?

661
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,620
No, you're not a trophy...

662
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,700
..but you need to be put down.

663
00:48:08,732 --> 00:48:11,900
Why? Because of your code?

664
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:23,000
- And the safety of my sister.
- She's not your real sister.

665
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:27,820
She's a stranger to you,
and she'll always be one.

666
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:30,900
- I tried to help you by killing her.
- I know that!

667
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:41,706
You should know this
isn't easy for me.

668
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:54,000
You've done more to deserve
my knife than anyone.

669
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:07,175
You're the only one I
ever wanted to set free.

670
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:12,100
You're the one that needs setting free,
little brother.

671
00:49:14,363 --> 00:49:16,000
Your life is a lie.

672
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,940
You'll never be what you --

673
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:30,400
Sorry. I can't hear any more...

674
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,600
'Cause you're right.

675
00:50:19,265 --> 00:50:20,700
How did you know he was here?

676
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,380
A neighbor saw the door open.

677
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,101
We got his fingerprints on the knife,
a note on the fridge,

678
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:27,443
and a single incised
wound to the neck.

679
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,294
Slight upward angle.

680
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,100
Even a stigmata of
hesitation in the stroke.

681
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:36,250
Looks like a clear suicide.

682
00:50:37,732 --> 00:50:40,950
He does himself the same way
he did the hookers -- poetic.

683
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,850
Retarded. Look at him --
he's dead.

684
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,555
The ice-truck killer
always flaunted his kills

685
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:48,225
like he was untouchable.

686
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,050
By taking his own life,

687
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:52,099
he's preventing us from
ever catching him.

688
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,705
I don't care why he did it.

689
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,400
I'm just glad he did.

690
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:16,315
Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip --
your favorite.

691
00:51:17,053 --> 00:51:20,579
I got your message.
How's Debra?

692
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:24,000
- Oh, she has all her limbs.

693
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,100
- Thank God she's alive.

694
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,398
That poor thing
must be a mess --

695
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,302
- falling for a serial killer.
- What are the odds?

696
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,875
- What about you?
- What about me?

697
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,700
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

698
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,600
No.

699
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:57,000
I've been through a lot lately.

700
00:51:57,879 --> 00:51:58,800
Hmm.

701
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:02,350
I could use a little
more time with you

702
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,800
and the kids.

703
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:08,576
We could, too.

704
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,355
- I'm sorry I've been so --
- Shh.

705
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,611
Next time, could you just

706
00:52:28,468 --> 00:52:30,146
let me know what's going on?

707
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,763
I mean,
when you didn't return my calls,

708
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,700
I started to get
a little paranoid.

709
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:38,310
I can be better about that.

710
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,800
Good.

711
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:46,007
Who knows?

712
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:48,844
You might even find I
can handle the truth.

713
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:53,639
I wish that was the case.

714
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,950
The reality is, there's nobody left alive 

715
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,400
who can handle my truth.

716
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:12,000
Doakes always sensed I was
hiding something. 

717
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,922
Now he knows.

718
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,643
My devil danced with his demon,

719
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,750
and the fiddler's tune
is far from over.

720
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,028
Sometimes, I wonder
what it would be like

721
00:53:34,028 --> 00:53:35,750
for everything inside me 

722
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,200
that'sdenied and 
unknown to be revealed.

723
00:53:45,784 --> 00:53:47,004
But I'll never know.

724
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,150
I live my life in hiding.

725
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,700
My survival depends on it.

726
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:56,000
Dearly damaged Debra --

727
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,550
she's here to face what's
left of the monster,

728
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,250
spit on his carcass, mourn him.

729
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,060
She's in hiding now, too.

730
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,288
Harry's daughter will be damned

731
00:54:07,564 --> 00:54:10,007
if she lets anyone see what
she's suffering inside.

732
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:11,780
That's her tragedy.

733
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:15,900
My tragedy is that I killed the one person 

734
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,350
I didn't have to hide from.

735
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,350
And I'm the only
one who mourns him.

736
00:54:28,887 --> 00:54:30,762
Everyone else would
probably thank me

737
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:33,369
if they knew I was the one
who drained him of his life.

738
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:36,179
Good job in there, Dex.
You sliced him up good.

739
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,419
In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd
appreciate a lot of my work.

740
00:54:47,145 --> 00:54:50,201
Way to take out the trash.
Thanks, buddy.

741
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:53,298
All right, Dexter,
protecting our children!

742
00:55:09,365 --> 00:55:13,078
This is what it must feel like
to walk in full sunlight,

743
00:55:13,586 --> 00:55:15,200
my darkness revealed,

744
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,000
my shadow self embraced.

745
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:28,220
Yeah, they see me.

746
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,200
I'm one of them...

747
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:36,000
In their darkest dreams.

748
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,250
