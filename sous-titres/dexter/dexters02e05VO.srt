<i>dexter:

5
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:49,541
dexter: what's this big break
in the bay harbor butcher case

6
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:50,608
i keep hearing about?

7
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,209
debra: masuka found
microscopic algae

8
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,075
inside the garbage bags
with the body.

9
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:55,708
it's all about
the rocks, baby.

10
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,690
the rocks?

11
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,214
yeah, the algae we found
on the rocks.

12
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:00,915
the bay harbor butcher used them
to weigh his bags down.

13
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,179
we're assuming he picked them up
where he docks his boat.

14
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,054
dexter:
october 3, 1973 --

15
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,211
laura moser
and three others found

16
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,694
chopped up
with a chain saw.

17
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,182
apparently a drug dealer
didn't appreciate

18
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,036
laura and her friends
stealing his cocaine.

19
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:13,773
what is in that report that
harry didn't want me to see?!

20
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:15,147
you were left there
for days,

21
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,875
starving,
in blood two inches thick.

22
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,664
dexter,
this is my mother.
gail.

23
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:25,746
he's hiding something.
i'm sure of it.

24
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,042
did you kill your wife?

25
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:29,933
yeah.

26
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,545
don't make me do it,
curtis!

27
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,152
debra, actually.

28
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:40,839
i'm gabriel.

29
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:43,678
oh, you're into the kinky stuff,
huh?

30
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,949
no, the last guy i had sex with
tried to kill me.

31
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,957
oh, there's my sponsor.

32
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,086
really? where?

33
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,868
dexter, meet dexter.

34
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:00,456
i'm gonna help the two of you
get to know each other.

35
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:04,743
you're going to tell me all
your deepest, darkest secrets.

36
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,390
but the person
who did this...

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,323
is a person just like me...

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,307
like you.

39
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:14,723
we're all good, dexter,
and we're all evil.

40
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:16,662
<i>this woman sees me.</i>

41
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,021

52
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:53,254
oh.

53
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,571

56
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,000

these guys had it coming.

59
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,272
so what,
just chop them all up?

60
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,732
as far as i'm concerned,

61
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,127
whoever's doing this shit
deserves a goddamn medal.

62
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,563
man:
that'll be $4.20, ma'am.

63
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:17,953
sorry, my wallet's
in here somewhere.

64
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:19,839
oh, i got it.

65
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:21,621
are you sure?

66
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:22,598
yeah, i insist.

67
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,989
thank you so much.
you're a godsend.

68
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:41,301
oh, sweet mary,
mother of fuck, that's good!

69
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,854
i think you might have
broken a commandment
somewhere in there.

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,969
burning the late-night oil
with the task force?

71
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,083
hardly -- till we get the report
back on the algae,

72
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,497
it's just one big
reach-around.

73
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,738
<i>the rocks i used
to submerge my victims</i>

74
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,542
<i>may eventually sink me, too,</i>

75
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,484
<i>but if i'm learning anything
in recovery,</i>

76
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:01,784
<i>it's "one day at a time."</i>

77
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:04,535
bay harbor butcher.

78
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,474
give me one shot --

79
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,940
i'd put a bullet
in the fucker's head.

80
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:11,026
you really feel that way?

81
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,524
he's killing people, dex.

82
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,936
if dad taught us one thing,
it's the value of human life.

83
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,820
<i>yeah, but i think we had
different homework assignments.</i>

84
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,277
dispatch.

85
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:28,611
see you tonight?

86
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,774
mm, i think i'm staying
at gabriel's.

87
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,934
i thought you were
taking it slow.

88
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,869
we are.

89
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,331
no sex, just cuddling.

90
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:39,713
my little sister,
the cuddler.

91
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,433
i got a scalding-hot beverage
here, dex.

92
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:44,341
don't make me use it.
love you, too.

93
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,162
<i>i never really got
the whole superhero thing.</i>

94
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,528
<i>but lately, it does seem
we have a lot in common --</i>

95
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,468
<i>tragic beginnings...
secret identities...</i>

96
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:07,923
<i>part human, part mutant...</i>

97
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,098
<i>archenemies.</i>

98
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:12,891
great way to start
the day, huh?

99
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:16,072
<i>shouldn't you be moving back
into your office, boss?</i>

100
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,899
i'd rather be here.

101
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,822
what can you tell me?

102
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,774
blunt force trauma.

103
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:23,855
the blood spatter here
on the counter

104
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:26,707
suggests that this is where
the initial blow occurred.

105
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,496
impact spatter
is consistent

106
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,556
with repeated blows
to the skull.

107
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,564
the victim tried to flee
to the back door

108
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,427
but didn't get far.

109
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,403
who is he?

110
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,244
denny foster --
worked here.

111
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,958
owner said
he closed up nights.

112
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:41,435
robbery?

113
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,162
there's no money missing
from the register.

114
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:46,615
something this brutal
is personal.

115
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,751
want to meet
your prime suspect?

116
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:54,107
he has fins.

117
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,137
should we call
the super friends for help?

118
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,748
no, i got it covered.

119
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,544
i found traces of blood
here on the base.

120
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:03,987
i'll bring it back
to my lab,

121
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,668
confirm
it's the murder weapon.

122
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:06,746
okay.

123
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:26,590
doakes: got a next of kin
we can notify?

124
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,857
uh, denny was,
like, a loner --

125
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:29,615
who's that?

126
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:32,235
the dark defender.

127
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,840
denny had this great idea
to put a spin

128
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:37,699
on that vigilante serial killer
we got running around.

129
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,525
definitely has a nicer ring
to it

130
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,911
than
the bay harbor butcher.

131
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:43,143
i'm conducting
an interview here, morgan.

132
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,705
denny was trying to set up
the dark defender

133
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,131
as a graphic novel.

134
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,544
"stalker of the night,

135
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:51,354
his blade of vengeance
turns wrong into right."

136
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:55,943
i need some air.

137
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,816
thanks a lot.

138
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,301
<i>"the dark defender."</i>

139
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,548
<i>no, miami's too hot
for all that leather.</i>

140
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:22,333
the first time i got high,
i was 15.

141
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,395
no, that's not right.
i was 14.

142
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:28,367
no, wait.

143
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,060
i was definitely 15 because
it was my freshman year.

144
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,626
i remember now because i was
dating susie mitchell.

145
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:40,115
we broke up 'cause i called her

146
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:42,213
by her sister, sharon's,
name once.

147
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,558
she hated when people did that.

148
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:49,105
what she didn't know was
that i had a thing for sharon.

149
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,044
sharon didn't want anything
to do with me, so...

150
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,205
laura:
don't you hurt my baby!

151
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,339
[ echoing ]
don't you dare!

152
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:02,084
don't look.
close your eyes.

153
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:03,701
mommy loves you.

154
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,245
don't you hurt my baby!

155
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:47,601
it's okay, mom.

156
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,455
you're safe.

157
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:00,577
mmm. that's hot.

158
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,607
where did you drift off to,
anyway?

159
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,618
i was having
this bizarre dream

160
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:10,967
about my mother.

161
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:13,260
say no more.

162
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,860
oedipus complex --
explains a lot.

163
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:24,467
so, what were you doing
to your mother in this dream?

164
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,107
saving her life.

165
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:28,855
she was murdered...

166
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,801
when i was a boy.

167
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:36,025
i was there.
i saw it happen.

168
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,768
i've never told
anyone that before.

169
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,327
come on.

170
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:55,599
have you thought maybe you
weren't saving your mother

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,705
in this dream?

172
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,711
maybe you were
saving yourself.

173
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,464
that's not what happened.

174
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,449
don't be so sure.

175
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:04,966
when i got clean,

176
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,881
all the seriously
fucked-up reasons i used

177
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,752
in the first place
began to surface.

178
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,719
this could be where
your addiction started.

179
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,810
i hope whoever did it
got the bloody chair.

180
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,656
there were three men.

181
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:28,434
i don't know what happened
to them.

182
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:33,197
dexter, if these guys
are behind bars,

183
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:34,650
you need to confront them.

184
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,292
if they're dead, hell,
go piss on their graves,

185
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:39,191
but you need to do
whatever it takes

186
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,690
so you can get closure.

187
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,456
how else do you expect
to get better?

188
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,685
i never expected
to get better.

189
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,160
my meth lab's
in the sock drawer.

190
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:18,381
this looks bad,
doesn't it?

191
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,594
yeah.

192
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:20,904
the cute panties help.

193
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,910
would you believe i'm trying
to get to know you better?

194
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:25,984
by rifling
through my stuff?

195
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,491
i'm retarded.

196
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,812
and you've been so great.

197
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,678
you know how i told you
the last guy i had sex with

198
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,958
tried to kill me?

199
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,823
well, that was
kind of true.

200
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,419
he was
the ice-truck killer.

201
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,040
who is he?

202
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,151
not fucking funny.

203
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,420
come on, deb.
i never heard of him before.

204
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,635
stop it.
don't screw with me.

205
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:11,714
deb, i've been
in el salvador

206
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:13,402
visiting family
for six months.

207
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,686
i just got back.

208
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:22,663
you sound like every other
jackass out there who thinks...

209
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:24,955
i'm a trophy fuck.

210
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,393
you had no idea who i was
when you hit on me at the gym?

211
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,685
when i hit on you
at the gym,

212
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,011
it was because i thought
you were hot.

213
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:46,368
good answer.

214
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:06,084
so, what's hot about me?

215
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,979
it's in the corner!
don't hurt it!

216
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,133
oh, god, dexter,
be careful.

217
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,442
use a broom.
it might have rabies.

218
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:16,611
oh, it's right there!
get it!

219
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:17,768
watch it!

220
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,047
careful.

221
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,241
yay! all right!
he got it!

222
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,231
yay!

223
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:27,921
my hero.

224
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,056
all right, kids.
show's over.

225
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,786
come on.
let's get dressed for school.

226
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:44,882
so, any armadillos
in michigan?

227
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,103
no.

228
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,430
we didn't used to have any
in florida.

229
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,936
now it's like an invasion.
"armadillos attack!"

230
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,506
you think you're charming,
don't you?

231
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,910
i'm sure that probably works
for you most of the time.

232
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:00,934
it did for paul.

233
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,514
i know what you are.

234
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:07,469
confused?

235
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,189
i found these
in a drawer.

236
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:12,927
tell me, dexter,

237
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,860
why would rita print out
narcotics anonymous literature

238
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,853
if paul's dead?

239
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,102
because recently
i entered the program.

240
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,496
i knew it.

241
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:26,713
i would never hurt rita
like paul did.

242
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,673
because i'm not gonna give you
that chance.

243
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,201
it's just a matter of time

244
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:32,430
before you pull her under
just like he did.

245
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,956
have you discussed any of this
with rita?

246
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,952
no, but i will if you don't
do the right thing here.

247
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:42,357
if you truly care about this
family like you say you do,

248
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,693
you will let my daughter
and those sweet children go.

249
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:52,519
the algae on the rocks was
exposed to both zinc and lead.

250
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,992
there are only three marinas
near bay harbor

251
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,750
which have restricted
water flow

252
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,708
that would account
for such high levels

253
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,295
of these specific
pollutants --

254
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:04,726
turkey creek, sunset keys,
and coral cove.

255
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:06,338
anyone familiar
with these marinas?

256
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,937
coral cove is where my dad
kept our family boat.

257
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,380
my brother uses the slip now.

258
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,253
i'll bet half the force
has boats out there.

259
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:15,396
it's one of the few
marinas left

260
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,491
that's affordable
on a cop's salary.

261
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:20,059
morgan and i will
take that one.

262
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,451
sodoquist and lee,
turkey creek is yours.

263
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,886
and, hill and ramos,
you've got sunset keys.

264
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:27,065
the rest of you will stay here
with detective batista.

265
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,797
when the team reports in,

266
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:30,236
relay the information
back to me.

267
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,187
if our killer's boat is out
there, let's find it.

268
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:39,424
sorry it took so long.

269
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,493
couldn't seem to find
any other crime scene files.

270
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:42,998
probably lost in storage
somewhere.

271
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,216
anyway, that's what i was able
to dig up.

272
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,489
just one file?

273
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,774
there were three men arrested
for those murders.

274
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:49,760
well, one's deceased,

275
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,438
one's doing life
without possibility,

276
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,484
and that's the only one
that's still an open case --

277
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,244
santos jiminez.

278
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:57,339
why's it an open case?

279
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,921
jiminez turned
state's evidence,

280
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,309
went into witness
protection.

281
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,438
there's a business address
in there for him.

282
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:04,740
i guess after 34 years,

283
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:06,945
he figures all the people
who want him dead are long gone.

284
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,663
<i>he figured wrong.</i>

285
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,224
if you can't find
what you need,

286
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,368
there's audio tapes
cross-referenced with this file.

287
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,713
tapes?
yeah, see that notation?

288
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,412
there was a criminal informant
working a cocaine bust

289
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,408
from the inside.

290
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:21,796
i'll take this, too.

291
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,747
okay.

292
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,814
<i>harry always said,
"never make things personal --</i>

293
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,706
<i>clouds your judgement."</i>

294
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:30,055
<i>but i've been living in a fog
way too long.</i>

295
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,158
<i>harry: today is friday,
september 28, 1973.</i>

296
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,020
<i>this is detective
harry morgan.</i>

297
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:37,629
dad.

298
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,665
<i>case file --</i>

299
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,299
<i>laura: i can't fucking
do this anymore!</i>

300
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:43,879
<i>i have to know when the next
shipment's coming in, laura.</i>

301
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:47,042
<i>laura moser -- my mother.</i>

302
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,267
<i>i can't take this anymore.</i>

303
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,997
harry, i'm so scared.

304
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,109
everything's going to be okay.
you just need to calm down.

305
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,078
i already took the cocaine
as evidence,

306
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,484
just like you asked --
why isn't that enough?

307
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,974
if we want estrada and his men
behind bars,

308
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,178
we have to catch them in the act
at the shipyard.

309
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,567
he's gonna find out,
and then he's gonna kill me.

310
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,516
harry, listen to me.

311
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,777
i think someone may have
followed us to the park.

312
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,413
if we were followed,
i would have noticed.

313
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,266
i just need you to hold out
a little longer.

314
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,116
this will all be over soon.

315
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,548
i need to pick up brian
at school.

316
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,687
i won't let anything happen
to you...

317
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:31,619
or your boys.

318
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,583
you have my word.

319
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,861
<i>harry broke his word.</i>

320
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,683
<i>he wasn't called to
that crime scene by chance.</i>

321
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,455
<i>it was his case.</i>

322
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,427
<i>laura moser was his informant.</i>

323
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,332
harry knew my mother.

324
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:58,667
our suspect is 6'2",
380 pounds, hispanic,

325
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,509
drives a 1971 ford pickup.

326
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,541
circulate his dmv photo.

327
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,184
hey.
hey.

328
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:09,850
i've got good news.
me too.

329
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,109
turns out our vic, foster --
he had a blog.

330
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:15,173
he was in some
online geek flame war

331
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,038
with a guy calling himself
"corndude."

332
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,553
the d.a. finally signed off
on your review.

333
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,641
there won't be any charges.

334
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:24,353
this corndude's real name
is benjamin alvaro.

335
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:29,957
anyone from the shoot
roll-out team

336
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,302
talk to you
about counseling?

337
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,838
why the fuck would
i need counseling?

338
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,826
'cause you shot a man
last week, james.

339
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,341
that's two shootings
in less than six months.

340
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:40,388
come on,
it's got to take its toll.

341
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,790
i'm fine,
but thanks anyway.

342
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,210
the sushi place next door
has a security camera

343
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,765
that covers the parking lot.

344
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:51,286
you know, department's
chaplain's got a good ear.

345
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,898
maria, can we stay
on the goddamn point?

346
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,317
the camera caught
the license plate

347
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,439
of a
green-and-white pickup.

348
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,077
it belongs to alvaro.

349
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,544
timecode puts him here
after the shop closed.

350
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,406
so send some unis to stake out
alvaro's house,

351
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,393
and you and i will take
where he works.

352
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,210
no, it's okay.
i've got simms and giles on it.

353
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,901
i got backup.
come on!

354
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:10,949
it will be like old times.

355
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,120
nina, i just got a call
from my attorney.

356
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,781
we need to talk about
this visitation bullshit.

357
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,368
can you just try dexter's
office again?

358
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,564
miss,
he's not picking up.

359
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,138
call me when you get this.

360
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:28,998
excuse me.
are you a friend of dexter's?

361
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:32,095
i'm, uh, his decorator.

362
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,738
love the hat.

363
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,878
terrence, uh, give her
a visitor's badge.

364
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,958
i'll --
i'll take her up.

365
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,360
angel batista.
i'm dexter's best friend.

366
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,264
nice to meet you...
angel batista.

367
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:55,343
<i>my work requires me
to be an expert</i>

368
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,087
<i>in analyzing patterns.</i>

369
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,029
<i>now a pattern keeps emerging
from my past</i>

370
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,451
<i>that's all too familiar --</i>

371
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:04,784
<i>harry lying to me.</i>

372
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:07,659
<i>no wonder he destroyed the file
on my mother's death.</i>

373
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,047
<i>it wasn't to protect me.
it was to bury his own guilt.</i>

374
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:14,226
batista:
look who i found.

375
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,502
listen, when you're done
with him,

376
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,495
maybe you can come over
to my place.

377
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:25,357
it's a mess.
needs a woman's touch.

378
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:26,277
yeah?

379
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,984
what did you say to angel?

380
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:37,665
dexter,
these are amazing!

381
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:39,368
lila,
you can't be in here.

382
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,534
did you find out what happened
to the men responsible

383
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,931
for your mother's murder?

384
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,588
dead or in prison --
except for one.

385
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,324
he cut a deal.
now he lives in naples, florida.

386
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:54,608
he runs a tavern.

387
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,742
and what are you gonna do
about it?

388
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:05,107
not sure yet.

389
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,991
and you're not
the least bit pissed off

390
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:10,669
that this man got away
with murder?

391
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,603
no.

392
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,182
you sure?

393
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,195
maybe a little.

394
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,701
then go and tell him.

395
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:24,852
healing is all about
focusing your rage

396
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,464
on the person
that's hurt you.

397
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:29,876
naples is, what...

398
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,496
two hours away?

399
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:32,679
we could go tonight.

400
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:35,815
okay.

401
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:37,577
pick me up after work?

402
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:38,555
all right.

403
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,583
can i have one of these?

404
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,637
sure.

405
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,925
what is this stuff?

406
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,346
it's corn syrup and dye.

407
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:56,526
it's my own recipe.

408
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:02,451
mmm. not bad.

409
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,640
thank you.

410
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,293
oh, god!

411
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,346
who doesn't fix
something like that?

412
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:18,754
you all right?
yeah.

413
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,585
so, i'm thinking we're assuming
our killer owns a boat,

414
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:23,461
but what if he --

415
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,579
how do you stand
this miami heat?

416
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,511
makes my toes swell up.

417
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:39,175
oh, so, anyway,

418
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,244
i was thinking, what if the
killer's been renting a boat?

419
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:42,714
i can cross-reference
some names of --

420
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,712
you like cucumber sandwiches,
officer morgan?

421
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,071
i-i don't know.

422
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:49,964
anyway, uh, we have
some of the dates

423
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:51,505
of when the victims
went missing.

424
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:54,684
it's all about
the cream cheese.

425
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,880
so we could cross-reference
those dates

426
00:23:57,881 --> 00:23:59,012
against the rental logs,

427
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,507
and maybe the same names
will pop up.

428
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,012
did you hear anything
i just said?

429
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,435
not one word.

430
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:12,589
it's 1:00.

431
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:15,446
i always stop and eat lunch
at 1:00.

432
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,229
you'll learn that about me.

433
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,738
why don't you sit down?

434
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,934
you're welcome to consider it
an order if that helps.

435
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:35,934
the shoes, too.

436
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,934
shouldn't we be --

437
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,845
i don't know --
investigating the area?

438
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,810
you're very fidgety.

439
00:24:45,524 --> 00:24:46,884
anyone ever tell you that?

440
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:49,698
yes. my father.

441
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,198
you applying for the job?

442
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,505
just an observation.

443
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,047
i'm sorry.
i'm confused.

444
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:58,366
are you criticizing me
for wanting to do my job?

445
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,369
yes.

446
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:01,640
it's 1:00.

447
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,273
look, the last time
i was around boats,

448
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,999
a killer
was kidnapping me,

449
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,056
which might explain why
i'm living with my brother

450
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,019
and snooping
on my new boyfriend.

451
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,458
so forgive me for being
a little fidgety,

452
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,452
but if it's lunch
we're talking,

453
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:19,909
i'm gonna eat
a fat pork sandwich,

454
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,591
and i'm sure as shit
not gonna eat it here.

455
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,038
debra.

456
00:25:24,078 --> 00:25:25,237
what?!

457
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,939
this isn't
a commercial marina.

458
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:29,892
i haven't seen
a single rental i.d.

459
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:31,050
on any of these hulls.

460
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:34,132
<i>but i can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.</i>

461
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,078
unsecure perimeter,
poor lighting.

462
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:39,343
come out here at night,

463
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,074
no one would know
what the hell you're doing.

464
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,584
that's why i'm going to order
24-hour surveillance

465
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:45,631
on this marina
and the two others.

466
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,832
as soon as i finish
my lunch.

467
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,398
ahh.

468
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,383
<i>i finished my spatter report,
put in for a personal day,</i>

469
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:28,710
<i>left word with rita.</i>

470
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,166
<i>naples, here i come.</i>

471
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,192
<i>i can't really focus my rage</i>

472
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,771
<i>on the man
who killed my mother,</i>

473
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,687
<i>not with lila along
for the ride.</i>

474
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:40,836
<i>but i can prepare for the day
when i do.</i>

475
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,739
where are you off to
so early?

476
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,388
um, getting out of town
for the night.

477
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,214
don't wait up for me.

478
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:48,117
in the middle of the week?

479
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,105
thought i'd, you know,
take the minivan out

480
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,420
on the open road.

481
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:53,236
who are you?

482
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,919
good news is you got the place
to yourself

483
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,761
if you want to tie up
gabriel again.

484
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,037
yeah, that one never
fucking gets old.

485
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,030
call me when you get back.

486
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,345
i want to talk to you
about coral cove.

487
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,304
what about coral cove?

488
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,633
the algae on the rocks
sent us there.

489
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:09,227
if i were you, i would seriously
consider moving your boat.

490
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,893
security out there
sucks ass.

491
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:13,245
<i>that's kind of the point.</i>

492
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,364
<i>this little green algae
may as well be kryptonite.</i>

493
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,826
<i>if it's ever traced back to me,
i'll be helpless.</i>

494
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,174
is this a rental?

495
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:30,079
nope, she's all mine.

496
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:36,349
so your minivan's a she,
is she?

497
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,000
your girlfriend
must be jealous.

498
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:41,691
is she cool
with you doing this?

499
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:42,828
i didn't tell her.

500
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,992
rita's mom found out
i'm in recovery.

501
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:51,145
she wants me to leave rita
and the kids.

502
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:00,037
she could be right.

503
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:03,380
i can't abandon them.

504
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:05,672
so, what about what
you're gonna say to this guy

505
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:06,907
when you get there?

506
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,450
i'm sure i'll think
of something.

507
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:18,548
why don't you practice
on me?

508
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:22,582
i'd...rather not.

509
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:25,867
just try.

510
00:28:28,212 --> 00:28:29,665
out loud.

511
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:38,425
i feel like...

512
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:44,650
...you stole my life.

513
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,715
and?

514
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,830
i'm not the person
i'm supposed to be.

515
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:02,993
it's like i'm hollow.

516
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:06,932
that's good.

517
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:09,643
go on.

518
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,249
i hide in plain sight...

519
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:21,573
...unable to reach out
to people...

520
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,891
close to me.

521
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,776
i'm afraid...

522
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:30,899
...i'll hurt them.

523
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:36,689
like i've hurt
so many others.

524
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:48,871

00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,379
you remember now?
you remember now?

702
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:22,543
<i>puta madre.</i>

703
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:35,868
you got me confused
with someone else!

704
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:37,903
aah!

705
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:41,870
i know exactly who you are!
you made me into what i am!

706
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:44,310
okay! i-i killed her.

707
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,622
i had to!

708
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:51,222
did you?
did you have to?

709
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:53,417
did you have to saw her
into little pieces?!

710
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:55,254
did you have to leave
two little boys

711
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:57,268
soaking in a pool
of their mother's blood?

712
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:00,551
estrada would have killed me
if i didn't.

713
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:03,622
you slaughtered her
like an animal

714
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:07,050
because she stole
his precious cocaine.

715
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:10,931
no. we found out she was
a snitch for a cop.

716
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:12,649
she was fucking him.

717
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:16,113
which cop?

718
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:17,276
i didn't know his name.

719
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,395
i followed them to --
to a park.

720
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:24,925
<i>my mother and harry --
that's what got her killed?</i>

721
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:27,935
i'm not done with you yet.

722
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,969
<i>isn't this what heroes do --
avenge lost loved ones?</i>

723
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:42,437
what?

724
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:44,763
everything okay?

725
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,414
dexter, what's wrong?

726
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:51,276
i thought i could resist.

727
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:54,148
jesus...are you using?

728
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,347
no, but i'm about to.

729
00:42:58,552 --> 00:42:59,603
tell me where you are

730
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:03,180
and i'll get in a taxi
and i'll come get you.

731
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:05,513
i have to do this.

732
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:09,542
no, you don't!
just tell me where you are.

733
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:15,404
you'll be too late.

734
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:19,085
don't you bloody do this.
you are stronger than that.

735
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,174
i'm not!

736
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:22,845
yes, you fucking are.

737
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:24,859
you've come this far.

738
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:27,833
if you turn back now,

739
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,788
you'll go right back
to the way you were --

740
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:34,288
hollow, angry,

741
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,369
alone.

742
00:43:36,876 --> 00:43:40,180
i will get you through this.
i swear.

743
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,201
just come back to me.
okay?

744
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,328
dexter?
are you all right?

745
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,393
it's okay.

746
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,128
i didn't...

747
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:23,712
shh. it's okay.

748
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:25,867
i don't care
what you did.

749
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:28,247
it's okay.

750
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,169
it's okay.

751
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:39,314
baby.

752
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:41,762
it's okay.

753
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:45,504
what are you still
doing here?

754
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:49,555
making sure our marina
surveillance is in place.

755
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,087
you forget something?

756
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,857
i'm working up
rental logs...

757
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,865
...on the other
two marinas.

758
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,255
you don't give up,
do you?

759
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,518
<i>do you?</i>

760
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,416
i'm wide awake anyway.
dexter's out of town.

761
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,285
i don't really sleep
when i'm there by myself.

762
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:06,723
what about
the new boyfriend?

763
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,433
we sort of broke up.

764
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,746
well,
i broke up with him.

765
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:19,950
<i>guess you won't be needing
this, then.</i>

766
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,151
what's that?

767
00:45:23,794 --> 00:45:25,034
background check.

768
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:28,331
you said you sere snooping.
just thought i'd help.

769
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:31,550
you ran a background check
on my boyfriend?

770
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,225
what's it say?

771
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:37,744
gabriel's clean --

772
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,227
well, except for those
parking tickets.

773
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:43,466
just because he's not
a criminal

774
00:45:43,564 --> 00:45:44,812
doesn't mean he's not
an asshole.

775
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:47,973
i went through his e-mail.

776
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,697
i know,
but it was worth it.

777
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:54,400
i mean...he was using me
to shop around a book

778
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,748
about the ice-truck killer.

779
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:01,585
do you know what kind of writer
gabriel is?

780
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:10,769
children's books?

781
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:18,337
"the ice princess"
is a children's book.

782
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,354
how could i be
so fucking stupid?

783
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:30,995
when my wife met me,
she was convinced i was a spy.

784
00:46:31,852 --> 00:46:34,718
connie didn't know it,
but she was actually right.

785
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:36,971
you ran a background check
on her?

786
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,085
[ chuckles ]
no need.

787
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:43,674
must be nice...
to just know like that.

788
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,104
she died...two years ago.

789
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:51,255
cancer.

790
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:54,046
i'm sorry.

791
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,453
that's how i lost my mom.

792
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,577
i should go.

793
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,381
let me ask you something.

794
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:11,863
that boyfriend of yours --

795
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,726
did he ever give you a reason
not to trust him?

796
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:16,348
no.

797
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:21,059
but i don't think
it matters.

798
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,887
i mean,
i went insane on him.

799
00:47:25,332 --> 00:47:26,667
he'll never forgive me.

800
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:29,142
any broken bones involved?

801
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:30,747
facial contusions?

802
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:32,431
no.

803
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:35,522
you'll be fine.

804
00:48:14,337 --> 00:48:16,880
do you want to know
how i got into the program?

805
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:27,445
i'd used for years --

806
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,396
binge, crash.

807
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:33,263
thought i had it
under control.

808
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,073
then i met marco.

809
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:40,153
what a shit.

810
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:45,298
thought he was my boyfriend,

811
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,635
but he turned out
to be my dealer.

812
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:56,241
bastard had me so strung out
by the time he left,

813
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,725
nothing mattered.

814
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:02,697
nothing was left...

815
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,633
...but rage.

816
00:49:12,943 --> 00:49:14,158
one night...

817
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,281
i was so fucked up --
god.

818
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:25,418
i went to his house,
and i burned it to the ground.

819
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,377
what i didn't know was that
marco was passed out inside.

820
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:43,607
they blamed the fire
on his drugs.

821
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:49,206
but it was me.

822
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:54,882
he died because of me.

823
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,528
that night,
i went to my first meeting.

824
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:11,206
seeing that side of myself
was terrifying.

825
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,491
that i could possibly do that
to another person.

826
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:23,408
did he deserve it?

827
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,703
yes.

828
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:50,068
then you didn't do
anything wrong.

829
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:18,145
hey, you.

830
00:51:18,146 --> 00:51:20,385
i wasn't expecting you
this early.

831
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:22,075
i didn't hit any traffic.

832
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,682
you're just in time
for breakfast.

833
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:30,363
where's your mom?

834
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:33,444
oh, i doubt she'll be
joining us.

835
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:35,692
she's been in her room
all morning.

836
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:38,844
my guess is she's packing.

837
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:43,574
maybe i should go.

838
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:46,209
no.

839
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:48,486
no, you're staying
right here

840
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,230
because you're a part
of this family.

841
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:53,679
are you sure?

842
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,469
i've put you through
so much lately.

843
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:02,507
i'm here for you, dexter...
no matter what.

844
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:07,518
what's this?

845
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,560
the patch.

846
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:15,506
i have some quitting
of my own to do.

847
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:17,757
sit.

848
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:23,902
is that anything
important?

849
00:52:28,352 --> 00:52:29,565
nope.

850
00:52:32,614 --> 00:52:33,530
morning.

851
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:36,635
morning, dexter.

852
00:52:37,151 --> 00:52:38,785
hi...gail.

853
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,366
so, rita assures me that you are
committed to getting better.

854
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:51,003
i am.

855
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,279
then i want to be here
to help.

856
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:57,618
in fact, i've decided
to stay in miami.

857
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:59,907
i e-mailed the school board

858
00:52:59,908 --> 00:53:01,600
my letter of resignation
this morning.

859
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:04,766
what about your house?

860
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,373
i'll put it on the market.

861
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,313
sweetie, i thought about
what you said last night.

862
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:12,778
<i>i haven't been here for you,
and i want to change that.</i>

863
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:18,212
you know, my sister's looking
for a new apartment.

864
00:53:18,213 --> 00:53:19,974
i'm sure we can help you
find one, too.

865
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:21,908
well, don't be silly.
i'll be living here.

866
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,876
dexter, be a dear and pass me
the cream, please.

867
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:28,354
thank you.

868
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:33,403
<i>harry taught me to lie</i>

869
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:36,287
<i>and keep my darkest secrets
from those around me...</i>

870
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,835
<i>which is why i need
to make sure</i>

871
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:41,152
<i>there's not a trace
of blood left on my boat.</i>

872
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,119
<i>he also taught me
not to rush to judgment.</i>

873
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,355
<i>things aren't always
what they appear to be...</i>

874
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,155
<i>...including harry.</i>

875
00:53:52,818 --> 00:53:54,219
<i>and what about me?</i>

876
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,063
<i>am i the twisted
bay harbor butcher...</i>

877
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:59,986
<i>or the valiant dark defender?</i>

878
00:54:01,009 --> 00:54:02,379
<i>only time will tell.</i>
