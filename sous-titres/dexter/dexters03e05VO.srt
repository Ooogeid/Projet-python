00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:48,168
- <i>Previously on</i> Dexter...
- I'm pregnant.

3
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,851
I think I'm gonna be a lousy father.
I don't wanna screw the kid up.

4
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:53,240
Who are we kidding?
You're gonna be a great father.

5
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,285
What do you have on Freebo?

6
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,724
Well, we're working
on some new angles.

7
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:00,295
- Which means you've got shit.
- He's obsessed.

8
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:03,666
He's drinking more than usual. He's not
going to stop looking for Oscar's killer

9
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:05,732
until it takes him
all the way down.

10
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:07,963
I only have one person
I can trust anymore.

11
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:09,173
Yourself.

12
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:10,632
I was thinking of you.

13
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,967
What you need?

14
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:13,303
I need Freebo.

15
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:15,429
Come on,
you google him or something?

16
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:19,141
Well, why wouldn't they want to support
a colleague during his shining moment?

17
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:21,643
You're, like, the foulest
person I've ever met.

18
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,272
I'm gonna do you a favor.
Call this guy.

19
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,437
Tell him you want to cash in
one of my coupons.

20
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,568
He's an informant
from my days in narcotics.

21
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,026
You, uh, you looking
for anything special tonight?

22
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,365
Might be more than an hour.

23
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:41,330
Take a pass, sergeant.

24
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,373
I hate anyone
who disgraces the badge.

25
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,439
Are we good?

26
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:48,128
You keep your dick in your pants,
and then we're good.

27
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,078
Rita, we're connected.
I feel you.

28
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,509
You're what makes me real.

29
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,469
I know I want to marry you.

30
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:56,667
Yes.

31
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,722
Yes, we will marry you.

32
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:14,201
<i>There are many ways
to stop the heart.</i>

33
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,569
<i>Electric shock.</i>

34
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,037
<i>Bad diet.</i>

35
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,605
<i>Sever the aorta...</i>

36
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,359
<i>My personal favorite.</i>

37
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,261
<i>But to start one beating,</i>

38
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:24,561
<i>this is a first.</i>

39
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,506
There.
That's the heart.

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,504
Oh, Dex, that's our baby.

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,046
Our baby. It's incredible.

42
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,802
<i>Rita, gushing
with the runaway emotion</i>

43
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:40,013
<i>any parent would feel seeing
their unborn child for the first time.</i>

44
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:42,687
<i>Any parent except me.</i>

45
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,768
I'd say you're
at nine to ten weeks.

46
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,689
<i>All I feel is her hand
clenching mine.</i>

47
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,836
<i>She's stronger than she looks.</i>

48
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,613
Can we get a picture
to show the kids?

49
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:00,786
<i>I can no longer deny
that I'm going to be a father.</i>

50
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:04,077
<i>Up until now, I've been
avoiding its inevitability.</i>

51
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,999
<i>It's like a lamp in a room
that's always been there.</i>

52
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,693
<i>And now it's suddenly turned on.</i>

53
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,003
Don't worry.

54
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,463
Everything looks perfectly normal.

55
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,138
Yes.

56
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,891
Front or back pocket?

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,226
You lost me.

58
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:29,271
The picture of the baby.
Front or back pocket?

59
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:33,275
- How'd you know I'd have it with me?
- You're a first time dad, aren't you?

60
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,406
This is amazing.

61
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,651
This is a human life.

62
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,535
It is overwhelming.

63
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,874
This picture right here
makes it real.

64
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,251
Your life is gonna change
forever, man.

65
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,635
We're playing here!
You could kill somebody!

66
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:03,160
Sorry.

67
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,933
I got half my mind
still in the office, you know?

68
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,351
There's your ball.

69
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,552
So I got this case, you know?

70
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,488
South beach guy

71
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,693
kills his wife on a cruise ship.

72
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,822
And I got no jurisdiction because she
goes missing in international waters.

73
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,616
My only hope is the feds.

74
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,077
- How do you know he's guilty?
- He is.

75
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,811
Five years ago,
he kills his first wife.

76
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,081
Drug overdose.

77
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,293
His pills. No alibi.

78
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,253
Then he uses her money
to go and hire this legal dream team

79
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,966
- to confuse the jury and...
- They had to let him go.

80
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,044
My hands are tied by the law,

81
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,551
and the defense attorneys
get to wipe their asses with it.

82
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,765
And everything that I believe in
is compromised.

83
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,385
That's you.

84
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:54,661
<i>Seems Miguel and I understand each other
better than either one of us knows.</i>

85
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:58,231
<i>I could do us both a favor
and look into this wife killer.</i>

86
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,752
<i>When it comes
to my brand of justice,</i>

87
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,091
<i>I don't have to compromise.</i>

88
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,105
Sliced it.

89
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,752
Thank you again for inviting us.

90
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:17,409
That massage was amazing.

91
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,892
We spend enough money
to be members here.

92
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,128
At least now I have somebody
to go to the spa with.

93
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,178
All of that stuff,
that's not for men, right, Dex?

94
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:29,019
Lying naked on a table, helpless,
no thanks.

95
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,183
So,

96
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,979
why don't you tell Dexter
my great idea?

97
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:35,522
Great idea?

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,273
Syl has offered to list

99
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:42,259
my house with her agency
so we can buy something bigger

100
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,714
together.

101
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,824
You're throwing money away
on that apartment.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,536
And that way
you can move in sooner.

103
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,497
I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

104
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:54,541
You were?

105
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,528
Well, I could always sublet it.

106
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:02,007
At some point we're gonna need
a bigger home.

107
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,469
You definitely need something
that you can grow into.

108
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,557
<i>This is how Custer must have felt,
surrounded on all sides,</i>

109
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:10,748
<i>doomed.</i>

110
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:14,561
So why don't we talk about all this
after we eat?

111
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,855
The line's thinning.

112
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,970
Come on, Rita.
You have got to try these crepes.

113
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,366
It's going to be okay.

114
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,612
Trust me.

115
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,127
I'm so sorry, man.

116
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,667
Syl, she gets these ideas in her head,
and it's like you can't stop her.

117
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,691
I guess I always knew at some point
I'd have to give up my place.

118
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,715
I just didn't think
it'd be so soon.

119
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,926
Every man needs his privacy.

120
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,651
Some more than others.

121
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:51,473
But that's why god created golf.

122
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:00,553
<i>How many times have I walked
down this sidewalk?</i>

123
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,289
<i>Sun in my face.</i>

124
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,820
<i>Cool ocean breeze on my skin.</i>

125
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,794
<i>Taken a dip in the pool to relax,</i>

126
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:11,298
<i>appreciating the wisdom
of those three little words:</i>

127
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:12,911
<i>no children allowed.</i>

128
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:17,289
<i>Are those times gone forever?</i>

129
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,411
<i>Before I even think about following up
on Miguel's lead,</i>

130
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,509
<i>I need to make sure
Ethan Turner meets my code.</i>

131
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:39,166
<i>How can Rita expect me
to just pick up and move?</i>

132
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,815
<i>This is my home.</i>

133
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,312
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

134
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:56,246
Careful.

135
00:08:58,388 --> 00:08:59,291
Leave it.

136
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:05,005
Not really Rita's style.

137
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:08,133
- But it's mine.
- Not anymore, son.

138
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:11,052
In marriage, everything's 50/50.

139
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:12,959
What's yours...

140
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,308
is Rita's.

141
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,577
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

142
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,076
<i>Rita and Syl may be busy
planning my life and where I'll live.</i>

143
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,845
<i>But there are some things
I still control.</i>

144
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,805
Right on time.

145
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,144
You're getting pretty good
at this secret meeting stuff.

146
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,112
Yeah, well, we've done it enough.

147
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:04,981
With bumpkus to show for it.

148
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,069
It's "bupkus."
Not "bumpkus." It's yiddish.

149
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:10,695
No, it's not.

150
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,135
- You wanna bet?
- <i>How much?</i>

151
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:15,355
Make it a million.

152
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,494
I'll take a check.

153
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:21,498
Where's your guy?

154
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,471
In the alley behind you.

155
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,206
Wonderful.

156
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,945
I love the smell of ass
in the morning.

157
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,069
You're the one who's been
all over mine for leads.

158
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:36,513
- Don't be hating where I find them.
- I know, I know.

159
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,590
Well, you better split
before we get made.

160
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,604
Well, that's cute.

161
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,907
- What?
- You.

162
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,150
Trying to protect me like that,
it's cute.

163
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:52,975
I'm trying to protect
my investigation.

164
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,075
And fuck you.

165
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,917
What the hell?

166
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,808
He wasn't like this earlier.

167
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:11,774
I'm trying to find who's skinning
people, not to stage an intervention.

168
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,914
You think your murders
are connected to Freebo?

169
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:17,387
He used to score from Freebo.
It's worth a shot, right?

170
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,770
Excuse me.

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,584
Anyone in there?

172
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,234
Anyone fucking in there at all?

173
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,946
I'll bet you're real good
with kids too.

174
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:40,108
Hey, Tilly.

175
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,544
Hey, I got that "h" for you, man.

176
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,334
- Where?
- It's right here.

177
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,753
But listen, I need you to think
real hard for me first, Tilly.

178
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:53,381
Now when was the last time
you saw Freebo?

179
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:57,886
Fucker's gone, man.

180
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,598
Wendell said
he's not coming back.

181
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:05,685
Who the fuck is Wendell?

182
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,732
You wanna see Freebo,
you gotta go through Wendell.

183
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,154
<i>Sheriff 21, this is dispatch.</i>

184
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,656
<i>Wagon is on the way.</i>

185
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,675
Metro homicide.

186
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,619
What are we doing
at a sheriff's crime scene?

187
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:28,376
Sheriff, you're blocking my light.
Excuse me.

188
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,049
Sheriffs are responding
to a bulletin I issued

189
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:33,215
regarding any victims
with missing skin.

190
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,255
Excuse me.

191
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:40,011
- Same M.O. as our torture murder?
- You two are just here to observe.

192
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,524
This is the sheriff's turf.

193
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:45,552
They're gonna investigate the scene,
see what they can come up with.

194
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,308
What's up with him?

195
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:51,689
He doesn't joke around anymore.
He dresses better. He's polite.

196
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:54,474
Maybe someone pointed out
the error in his ways.

197
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:56,361
- Who called this in?
- Neighbors.

198
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:04,869
I just got off the phone
with the sheriff.

199
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:07,789
They've confirmed their skinning victim
is related to ours.

200
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:09,416
That gives us three victims.

201
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,781
They're sending someone over
to look at our case files.

202
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:14,212
And we'll be establishing
a joint investigation.

203
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:15,937
This is our investigation.

204
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:18,425
You can't expect us
to just give over our files.

205
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:22,005
No one is giving over anything.
It's a matter of professional courtesy.

206
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,678
We're still in charge.

207
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:26,379
Now, I've had the sheriff's lab
send over all forensics.

208
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:29,050
- I want both your input.
- My slate's clear.

209
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,354
I'll talk
with the medical examiner.

210
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:33,690
Another four-hour erection?

211
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,027
Anything else?

212
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,823
I've got unis bringing in
a 15-year-old kid named Wendell Owens.

213
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,159
He was Freebo's doorman,
he might be able

214
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,620
to connect the dots between his boss
and why people who knew him die.

215
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,903
<i>I may be one of those dots.</i>

216
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:53,084
He's a minor. Get consent
from a parent to question him.

217
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,681
I'll make sure everything's
done by the book.

218
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,285
All right, I want
updates on the hour.

219
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,718
- Good work, partner.
- Yeah, right.

220
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:12,889
<i>Wendell.</i>

221
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:19,461
<i>I doubt this boy would recognize me
from the day I met his dead boss.</i>

222
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,535
<i>But why take the chance?</i>

223
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:22,805
Dexter Morgan.

224
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:27,410
Listen, I'm gonna have
to cancel our lunch.

225
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:30,877
- Everything all right?
- <i>Rough morning, man.</i>

226
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:35,084
<i>Feds informed me that they're not gonna
move forward on this cruise ship case.</i>

227
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:36,851
Lack of evidence.

228
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,405
Got a witness puts this son of a bitch
on the deck

229
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:43,384
with his wife just before she went
missing, and he's still gonna walk.

230
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,158
<i>Again!</i>

231
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,598
Did I mention he left his first wife's
teenage daughters penniless?

232
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:50,024
<i>No need.</i>

233
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,227
A whole family destroyed.

234
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:56,144
- We could meet later if you want.
- <i>No, I'm gonna be in court, man.</i>

235
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,942
- <i>How'bout tomorrow?</i>
- I may have plans. I'll let you know.

236
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,660
<i>There's due diligence to be done.</i>

237
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:10,344
How long is this gonna take?

238
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:14,953
The sooner you tell me where we can find
your mom, the sooner you're outta here.

239
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,630
She wasn't at your house.
We can't reach her by phone.

240
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,292
Does she have a job?

241
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,511
She does what she has to do.
Same as me.

242
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,913
I was about your age
when my mom died.

243
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:41,401
Suddenly, my father's raising
two teenagers by himself,

244
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,196
so I get how hard it is
for a single parent to always be there.

245
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:47,575
Yeah, I bet you had it real bad.

246
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,058
No, I didn't.

247
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:56,089
My dad worked really hard to get me and
my brother the things he didn't have.

248
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,166
So I got why he wasn't always home.

249
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,006
But after awhile, I even stopped
looking for him at my softball games.

250
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,457
Didn't mean he didn't love me,

251
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,383
but didn't mean it didn't hurt.

252
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,098
You played softball for real?

253
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:14,358
First base.

254
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,145
But you don't look gay.

255
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,900
You hungry?

256
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,364
Yeah, but not for any
of that vending machine shit.

257
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,960
Well, I'll tell you what,

258
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,885
if you're brave enough,
there's a roach coach outside.

259
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:34,996
I'm buying.

260
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,628
I'll take some burgers, fries,

261
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:43,263
and onion rings.

262
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Deal.

263
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,009
Partner,

264
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,011
would you keep an eye on our guest?

265
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,446
- Getting anywhere with the kid?
- Sorta.

266
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:11,905
- You and Rita set a date yet?
- Not yet.

267
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:15,453
- Are you gonna move in with her first?
- Where's this going?

268
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:18,540
I need to know so I can break the lease
on my place and move into yours.

269
00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:22,082
What makes everybody think
I'm just gonna give up my apartment?

270
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,505
Maybe 'cause you're getting married.

271
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,607
Like there's room for Rita
and the kids at your place.

272
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,249
No offense, but you're the last person
who needs a fuck pad.

273
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,849
Dexter. Officer Morgan.

274
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,442
Can you tell me where I might find
Lieutenant LaGuerta?

275
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,302
Thank you so much.

276
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:45,372
Guess we know who the sheriff's
department sent to look into our files.

277
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:47,902
Big fucking mistake.
That guy's wound way too tight.

278
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:50,239
And coming from me,
that's saying something.

279
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,551
You gonna take the fridge?

280
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,149
Thank you.

281
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:58,204
They keep getting
younger and younger.

282
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,566
- Who'd this one kill?
- The boy's not a suspect.

283
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:02,830
We think he was working for Freebo.

284
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:06,493
I have to say, I'm a little surprised
you're who the Sheriff's department

285
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:07,904
chose as their liaison.

286
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,551
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to do my job.

287
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,430
I've known you
your entire adult life, Ramon,

288
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:20,225
so let's cut the bullshit. You're using
this case to insert yourself

289
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,187
into Miami Metro's investigation
of your brother's death.

290
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:25,189
If our victim can help track down

291
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,526
my brother's killer in the process,

292
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,142
so be it.

293
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:32,197
As one lieutenant to another,
you know I could go over your head

294
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,657
and get you pulled off
this assignment.

295
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,829
But I'm not gonna do that.

296
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:41,582
I know you and Oscar were close.
And he meant a great deal to me as well.

297
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:46,700
So you will have
this department's full cooperation

298
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:47,928
to a point.

299
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,373
If it turns out that these cases
are not connected,

300
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,635
the cooperation ends.

302
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,334
<i>I need to thank Miguel
for introducing me to a new hobby.</i>

303
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,777
<i>And for supporting an old one.</i>

304
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,788
<i>After the first wife's money
ran out, Ethan didn't take long</i>

305
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,669
<i>to find the next wealthy woman
to woo, marry,</i>

306
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,549
<i>and throw overboard.</i>

307
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,284
<i>Maybe I can return the favor
on that last part.</i>

308
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,185
Have both tanks
delivered to the ship.

309
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,101
I'll need a dive skin too.

310
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:36,430
You got it.

311
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,901
Heading out to sea?

312
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:43,435
Caribbean cruise.
Leaving tomorrow.

313
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,771
Do you know any good
dive schools around here?

314
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:50,273
But they all require hours
for certification.

315
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:53,402
If I were you, I'd cut
a few corners, head over to Bimini.

316
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:55,770
They'll have you under the water
in less than a day.

317
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,325
Bimini. That's close.
I could be there and back in my boat.

318
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,829
The water's beautiful there.
It's my first port of call.

319
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,706
Maybe I could take the wife,
finally get her

320
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,334
off my back
for never doing anything with her.

321
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,297
You'll have more fun if you don't.

322
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:19,743
I'm sure I will.

323
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:23,225
There you are.
Good news.

324
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,102
Wendell's mother
finally answered her phone.

325
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:30,274
- Patrol's bringing her upstairs now.
- Yes. Thank the baby fucking Jesus.

326
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:34,041
- You do know I'm Catholic, right?
- I'm sorry, but I've had that kid

327
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:37,816
at my desk all afternoon.
You ever hear the word "bumpkus"?

328
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,921
- I think it's "bupkus."
- Shit.

329
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,041
Hold on.

330
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,455
There's this cold case I'm looking at,
a dead John.

331
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:47,795
Now when you were working vice,

332
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,896
did you bust the same places
over and over again?

333
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,829
Not really.
Most guys are regulars,

334
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,963
so word gets out quick
if a place is hot.

335
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,981
So we'd move the decoys around.

336
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:01,617
But if you really want to know
about paying for sex,

337
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:03,576
you should talk to Masuka.

338
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,013
Vince, hold up.

339
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,240
Did you get a chance to look at

340
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,650
the sheriff's department forensics
regarding their vic?

341
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,765
I fucking would
if they'd fucking send them.

342
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,330
- I've called four fucking times.
- Man!

343
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,780
Somebody needs a hug. I'd offer,
but I don't know what I'd catch.

344
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,667
Can I go now?

345
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,403
You know,
I can take inappropriate Masuka.

346
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:27,915
I can take porn-loving Masuka.
I can even take flatulent Masuka.

347
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,570
But this dress shoe-wearing,

348
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,669
"please and thank you" zombie Masuka
is fucking creeping me out.

349
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:34,597
What's going on?

350
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,758
Maybe I'm realizing no one
around here is my friend.

351
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,968
The only time you people
even acknowledge me

352
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,850
- is when you want something.
- That's not so.

353
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,805
We put you on our bowling team.

354
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,155
Only because you wanted to keep
everyone's handicap higher

355
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:49,108
to sandbag the other teams.

356
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:53,046
- Okay, that's true, but...
- Not one person read my paper.

357
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:56,860
Not one fucking person showed up
at the conference I spoke at.

358
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,899
This is about your stupid paper?

359
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,699
You guys just don't get it.

360
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:08,117
You hurt my feelings.

361
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,751
What the fuck?

362
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:28,686
Where's the kid?

363
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,541
The mother wouldn't give consent.
I had to cut him loose.

364
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:36,232
Did you explain to her how important
it was that we talk to him?

365
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:38,971
When I brought up Freebo's name,
she clammed up. Word on the street

366
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,930
is the last person who talked
to the cops about Freebo wound up dead.

367
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,842
I spent all day
getting through to that kid.

368
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:48,209
He would have talked, or he would have
convinced his mother to let him talk.

369
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:50,362
She was never gonna cooperate.

370
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:52,249
You coulda waited until I got back.

371
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,002
Look, this is no reflection
on the work you did here.

372
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,797
No, it's a reflection on how little
you think of me and my work.

373
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,508
You think I cut this kid loose
to make you look bad?

374
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,230
I'm not sure anymore.

375
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:07,196
Partner.

376
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,565
Hey, baby.

377
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,087
You want a date?

378
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:23,053
Hey, sugar. What you look...

379
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,540
You have got to be kidding me.

380
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:35,995
I'm not here for that, honest.

381
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:39,180
Your... You know, your...

382
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,321
- You're blushing.
- I'm not.

383
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:47,000
So what are you doing down here,
Sergeant?

384
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,240
'Cause I gotta get back to work.

385
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,053
I came here because I...

386
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,810
I wanted to know if...

387
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:58,523
If you'd like to grab
something to eat sometime.

388
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:00,953
You know, to talk.

389
00:24:02,123 --> 00:24:03,260
And to eat.

390
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,047
I'm not interested.

391
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,084
I rarely date cops.

392
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:14,191
"Rarely," does that mean "never"?

393
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,044
If I meant "never,"
I would have said "never."

394
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:26,173
Dex, is that you?

395
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,076
I'm in the kitchen.

396
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:30,092
What smells so good?

397
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,552
It's a surprise.

398
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:36,686
Look,

399
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:39,309
brochures of houses.

400
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,323
I know it's fast.

401
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:45,759
But Syl and I spent
the whole day doing drive-bys,

402
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,361
and these are the ones
I fell in love with.

403
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:52,109
- All of them?
- They're in great school districts,

404
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,871
big yards, plenty of bedrooms,
central air.

405
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,658
I thought we could go through these
after dinner

406
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,210
and have Syl schedule some showings
for tomorrow.

407
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:03,076
<i>I understand that as man and wife</i>

408
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:06,230
<i>Rita and I will have to live
under the same roof.</i>

409
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:09,554
<i>So why is it the only word
echoing in my head is...</i>

410
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,674
No.

411
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,665
Okay, I guess we don't
have to look at all of them.

412
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:23,044
No.

413
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:29,089
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

414
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:32,075
"Can we talk about it?"
is a little more productive.

415
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,043
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to look at houses.

416
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:37,458
Not now anyway.

417
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:45,378
Fine, that's all you had to say.

418
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,122
If Syl and I go out to look
tomorrow in the morning,

419
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:53,889
- can you watch Astor and Cody?
- No, I'm going fishing tomorrow.

420
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:57,726
I'm gonna be gone all day.

421
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,770
And you were gonna
tell me this when?

422
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,775
It's the 1st I'm hearing
about house hunting.

423
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,894
I can't just drop everything at the last
minute because you want me to.

424
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,763
Dinner will be ready
in five minutes.

425
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,067
It's a roast.

426
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:13,538
Your favorite.

427
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:22,456
<i>I double-checked
Ethan's ship itinerary.</i>

428
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:24,491
<i>He's in Bimini today only.</i>

429
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:27,661
<i>Gives me one shot
to head him off at the pass.</i>

430
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,484
<i>Sorry, Rita, but right now
I need this more than a big yard</i>

431
00:26:30,604 --> 00:26:32,010
<i>and a two-car garage.</i>

432
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,810
<i>Ahoy!</i>

433
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,336
Let me guess, Syl?

434
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,043
She might have mentioned that Rita
and she were going house hunting

435
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:46,977
because a certain <i>gilipollas</i>
decided that he'd rather go fishing.

436
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:48,945
"<i>Gilipollas</i>"?

437
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,862
You don't wanna know.

438
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:54,519
So this is the boat you keep
talking about? She's a beauty.

439
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:57,619
- You gonna take me out on her sometime?
- Sure thing.

440
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,949
- So what brings you out here?
- Thought maybe we could grab some food

441
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,224
before you go out.

442
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:06,419
You know, kind of like
a rain check for yesterday.

443
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,818
Can't leave the boat.
Everything's onboard.

444
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:11,090
<i>Olvidete.</i> Okay.

445
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,594
Don't worry about it.
So where are they biting?

446
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,377
Heading up north, Mercy reef.

447
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:19,266
Always had good luck there.

448
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:23,645
You know, I got half a mind to postpone
the arraignment that I have and just

449
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:25,355
go with you.

450
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:26,898
<i>Please don't.</i>

451
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,254
Nah.

452
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:33,109
I gotta be in court.

453
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:40,052
I'm gonna try to put out some fire
that your Lieutenant started.

454
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,917
But I'm glad I caught you,
you know?

455
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,709
How about whatever you catch,

456
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,587
we put on the grill tonight?

457
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,299
Wish me luck.

458
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:09,260
Thanks for coming in early.

459
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,665
Lieutenant Prado
wanted to get us all up to speed

460
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,294
on the skinner case.

461
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,983
Thank you.

462
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:17,471
This is our vic's boyfriend.

463
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:20,309
Now, no one's seen him
since the night in question.

464
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,843
We could use your help
tracking him down.

465
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:25,805
- Soderquist, Ramos, you're on it.
- I was also hoping

466
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,532
I could speak with a couple
of your previous witnesses.

467
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:31,129
"Speak with" as in we didn't
do it right the first time?

468
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:32,881
Cases evolve.

469
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,289
Witnesses change their story.
Junior personnel, they make mistakes.

470
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:39,346
- No disrespect.
- Actually, it's a lot of disrespect.

471
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:42,929
You've come into our house twice.
You not only insult our police work,

472
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,643
now you're insulting one
of the most dedicated officers

473
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:48,074
I've ever partnered with.
Yes, you.

474
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,397
It's bullshit, my man.

475
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:55,987
Let's not lose sight of the fact
that we want the same thing here:

476
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:59,108
to find whoever is responsible
for these murders.

477
00:28:59,568 --> 00:29:01,782
There is one slight problem.

478
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,204
Your case has nothing to do
with our case.

479
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:08,789
- The vic wasn't skinned?
- Not like our previous victims.

480
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:12,873
There were minute traces of ink
in the papillary and reticular...

481
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:14,331
English.

482
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:18,465
Someone dug out a tattoo from the back
of her neck. Post-mortem.

483
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:20,511
Which's another reason

484
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:23,565
why I don't think we're looking
at the same killer. It's all right here,

485
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,442
- in the county ME's report.
- That's your opinion.

486
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:28,520
- My lab thinks differently.
- Let me see that.

487
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:32,107
- You're taking this seriously?
- In a fucking heartbeat.

488
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:34,317
Do you know how many times
he's been published?

489
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:36,778
He's our lead
forensic investigator.

490
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:38,703
And there's no one better.

491
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:41,908
Our victim was strangled,
the same as yours.

492
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:46,921
Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes
and bruising would lead one to conclude

493
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,195
strangulation.

494
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:49,967
Unless you're me.

495
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:54,067
You were so busy playing
hide the sausage with the ME's report,

496
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:58,091
you were hoping I'd miss the cotton
fibers in the nose and airways.

497
00:29:58,251 --> 00:29:59,539
Your victim was smothered.

498
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:02,897
That's not opinion, that's science.

499
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,719
And science
is one cold-hearted bitch

500
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,684
with a 14-inch strap-on.

501
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,436
And he's back.

502
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,496
Well, I think we're through here.

503
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,819
I'm not so sure your Lieutenant
would agree, Sergeant.

504
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,239
Then you don't know her as well
as you thought, Lieutenant.

505
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:48,608
Ethan.

506
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,797
<i>Apparently Ethan is looking for more
than adventure on the high seas.</i>

507
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:56,231
<i>Both of his deceased wives
had prenups.</i>

508
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,940
<i>In a divorce, he would have
been lucky to keep the Rolex.</i>

509
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,318
<i>But he wanted it all.</i>

510
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:03,720
Ethan made a choice.

511
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:08,289
And pretty soon, you're gonna
have to make one too, Dex.

512
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,625
Ethan chose to be rich

513
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,217
rather than married.

514
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,647
I, on the other hand,
chose to stay with Doris,

515
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:17,878
- even after--
- You cheated on her?

516
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:22,547
You think you and I
are so different, don't you?

517
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:25,162
I'm nothing like you.

518
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:26,651
Really?

519
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:28,938
You're here

520
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:30,982
and Rita's back home.

521
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:34,308
You're cheating on her,
and you don't even realize it.

522
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:37,241
I'll make time
for my dark passenger

523
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:38,847
and for Rita.

524
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:41,845
It's about priorities, Dexter.

525
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,691
You're gonna have to choose
which one is your mistress

526
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:47,704
and which one is your wife.

527
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,576
And more importantly,

528
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,328
which one comes first.

529
00:31:56,944 --> 00:31:58,313
You missed a spot.

530
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:04,192
Hi, baby.

531
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,164
Hi, mom.

532
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,193
<i>Attention all Atlantic Sun
cruise passengers,</i>

533
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,519
<i>this is Bebay,
your cruise director.</i>

534
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,419
<i>The next sea taxi is leaving Bimini
for our ship in 20 minutes.</i>

535
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,029
It looked much bigger
from out here.

536
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:32,160
You could always knock out
a wall or 2. Easier than you think.

537
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:34,197
How'bout the kitchen?

538
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,395
The bay window was nice.

539
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,164
But those cabinets...

540
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:40,989
Don't get bogged down
in the cosmetic stuff.

541
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,044
How did it feel
when you were inside?

542
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:45,966
Like a home.

543
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,053
God, you're good.

544
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,272
You're my friend. I wouldn't put you
in something I didn't believe in.

545
00:32:53,392 --> 00:32:55,649
And I believe that this home
can work for you.

546
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,210
For your family.

547
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,816
Are there rules about using
the bathroom in a house you're showing?

548
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:04,900
You gotta go, you gotta go.

549
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,743
Can I see your venture
passport, sir? Thank you.

550
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:14,578
Keep coming.

551
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:17,578
Excuse me, sir, can I take a look
at your venture passport?

552
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:20,375
Ma'am, could I see your pass?

553
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,586
<i>Attention all Atlantic Sun
cruise passengers,</i>

554
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,754
<i>this is Bebay,
your cruise director.</i>

555
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:29,715
<i>The sea taxi is departing Bimini
for our ship</i>

556
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:31,082
<i>in five minutes.</i>

557
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,220
<i>Also please remember
that the last sea taxi</i>

558
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,390
<i>of the evening leaves
the ship at 10:45 tonight.</i>

559
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,351
<i>All visitors, guests, anyone
who doesn't belong on board</i>

560
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:41,194
<i>must disembark at that time.</i>

561
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:42,478
<i>It'll be tight.</i>

562
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:45,880
<i>But I think both Ethan Turner and I
will be off the ship by that time.</i>

563
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,694
<i>Only one of us
will be doing so</i>

564
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,237
<i>because he wants to.</i>

565
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,309
I'm bleeding.

566
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:02,891
There's a hospital 5 blocks away.

567
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,366
Waiting for an ambulance
is only gonna take time.

568
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:07,881
- What about Dexter?
- We'll call from the car.

569
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:14,304
Those things will kill you,
you know?

570
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,992
I'll talk to you later.

571
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,269
Been by here 4 times
looking for you.

572
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:24,270
What for? The other cop said
you couldn't talk to me.

573
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:27,703
Well, he's right.
I can't. Officially.

574
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,080
But unofficially,

575
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:32,400
there's no reason
you can't call me

576
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,866
if you want to tell me something
about your ex-boss.

577
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:41,287
Burgers, fries, and onion rings.

578
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,635
I know the situation with your mom
not being around sucks.

579
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:01,435
But if things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, okay?

580
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:05,856
I kept my nose
outta Freebo's business.

581
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,983
It was safer that way.

582
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:10,819
Any idea where he is?

583
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:15,788
I know he was into someone
for some major cash.

584
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,114
He was pretty scared.

585
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,828
That's probably why
he's hiding out somewhere.

586
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:23,275
That's why someone's
trying so hard to find him.

587
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:24,839
They want their money back.

588
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,332
- So are we done?
- We're done.

589
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:29,361
One other thing.

590
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:32,257
When you find that jerk-off,

591
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,941
tell him he still owes me
three weeks' pay.

592
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:37,635
Thanks.

593
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,015
Watch yourself.

594
00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:47,873
Miguel, thank god you're here.

595
00:36:47,993 --> 00:36:49,041
How is she?

596
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,754
Rushed her up to prenatal I.C.U., but
won't tell me a thing. I'm not family.

597
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,126
Miguel Prado.
I'm an assistant district attorney.

598
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:01,944
Find your chief of staff,
Dr. Reynolds, and have him call--

599
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,847
I'm just an admit nurse.
You'll have...

600
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:04,805
Call him.

601
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,367
Right now.

602
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:12,598
I feel so bad for Rita.
All alone.

603
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:15,819
Baby, Reynolds is gonna make sure
she gets the best care in Miami.

604
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:18,193
Why isn't Dexter back?
I've been calling all day.

605
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:20,779
Goddamn it,
the father should be here.

606
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,619
I shuffled through your iPod
to make sure no one hears us.

607
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:30,292
Of course, most of your shipmates
are up on the blue deck.

608
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,207
It's happy hour.
Just the 2 of us.

609
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:42,870
Oh, it's too bad
I have to make this quick.

610
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:47,264
I'm usually all for a stimulating
conversation at times like this.

611
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:49,058
But the last taxi
leaves in an hour.

612
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:57,736
I've been going through
some changes myself lately.

613
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:02,738
I'm getting married.
I've got a baby on the way. Me.

614
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,570
Even though my life may never
be the same, thank you

615
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,329
for reminding me how important
it is to take time for oneself.

616
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,169
Savor these moments alone.

617
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:23,803
<i>And here I am.</i>

618
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:26,900
<i>Paradox personified.</i>

619
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:29,141
<i>Taking life.</i>

620
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:31,617
<i>Creating life.</i>

621
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:47,007
<i>With the ship anchored
away from shore, the Gulf Stream </i>

622
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,285
<i>will be Ethan's last cruise.</i>

623
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,465
This isn't like Dexter.

624
00:39:04,715 --> 00:39:06,802
- Something's wrong.
- Sweetie,

625
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:09,433
I know this is difficult,
but you need to stay calm.

626
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:13,437
I sent the coast guard to look for him.
He wasn't at his fishing spot.

627
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,185
Maybe he's back at the marina.

628
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,263
Why hasn't he called?

629
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:25,919
Anton, open up. It's me.

630
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:31,048
I tried calling. I got a lead.

631
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,332
I know why someone's looking
for you-know-who.

632
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,286
Hurry up if you want your money.

633
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,104
Yes, I was wrong about--

634
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:50,805
Bupkus.

635
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,895
Is Anton here?

636
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:57,686
In the shower.

637
00:39:58,484 --> 00:39:59,733
He'll be out soon,

638
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:01,985
'cause I think we used up
all the hot water.

639
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:05,644
I can get him.

640
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,770
That's all right. Just--

641
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,869
Have him call Debra Morgan.
It's important.

642
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:16,311
- Are you sure you don't want me to--
- Thanks.

643
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:23,672
What?

644
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:26,593
Hello, Debra. This is Miguel Prado.

645
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:29,484
<i>Have you heard from Dexter?</i>

646
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:31,637
No. Why?

647
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:34,517
We're at the hospital
with Rita right now.

648
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,090
Everything all right?

649
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,688
<i>Debra, we need to find
your brother.</i>

650
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:51,135
<i>Ethan Turner was incapable
of compromise.</i>

651
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:56,417
<i>He loved his wives' money
more than he loved them.</i>

652
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:59,143
<i>And in the end,
it cost him dearly.</i>

653
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,864
<i>I don't wanna be like Ethan.</i>

654
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:09,324
<i>Maybe my days of coming
and going as I please are over.</i>

655
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:11,721
<i>But that doesn't mean
my life is over.</i>

656
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,520
<i>Not as long as I have my boat</i>

657
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:23,567
<i>and the open water.</i>

658
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,783
<i>There are some things
I can keep to myself.</i>

659
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:33,458
<i>You have 12 unheard messages.</i>

660
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,103
<i>Dex, it's me.
I'm on my way to the hospital.</i>

661
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:42,203
<i>I think there's something wrong
with the baby.</i>

662
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:53,844
The baby?

663
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,855
The baby's fine.

664
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,424
They said if I stay on

665
00:42:02,674 --> 00:42:04,649
bed rest the next few days
that I can...

666
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:07,163
We...

667
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,857
can go home tomorrow.

668
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,992
I don't know what
I would have done

669
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:19,289
if I'd lost the baby
and you weren't here.

670
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:24,543
And nobody could find you.

671
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,961
I'm here now.

672
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:32,424
And I'm not going anywhere.

673
00:42:37,696 --> 00:42:40,889
I think maybe we should wait

674
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,491
to find a house
until after we're married.

675
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,309
Just name the date.

676
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:51,060
I'm ready.

677
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:00,620
I'd like to walk down the aisle

678
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,836
before I start to show.

679
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:05,999
Whatever you want.

680
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:25,660
<i>I may never be able to feel
our baby's heartbeat</i>

681
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,929
<i>emotionally.</i>

682
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,503
<i>But I know now
I can't ignore it either.</i>

683
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:33,390
<i>And for some reason
I can't explain,</i>

684
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:36,645
<i>I'm relieved to know
it's still here.</i>

685
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:40,634
Fishing?

686
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:46,707
All night?

687
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:50,795
You can't make me feel

688
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:52,738
any worse than I already do.

689
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,884
I hope this was
a big wake-up call for you.

690
00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:01,057
'cause you're gonna be
a father before you know it.

691
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:04,210
I see that now.

692
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:07,894
My life is changing.

693
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:11,317
And if it'll make you happy,
my place is yours.

694
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,403
What'll make me happy
is you being there for that kid.

695
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:20,768
For homework and plays.

696
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:24,341
And softball games.

697
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:28,561
Don't you dare be like dad.

698
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:32,567
That's never gonna happen.

699
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,251
Quite a night, huh?

700
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:51,438
I should have been here.

701
00:44:52,828 --> 00:44:54,179
Syl and I were.

702
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:56,404
That's what friends are for.

703
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:02,895
I owe you.

704
00:45:03,043 --> 00:45:05,493
I just may take you up
on that someday.

705
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:09,942
You know, my office got
the strangest fax tonight

706
00:45:10,062 --> 00:45:11,823
from Atlantic Sun Cruises.

707
00:45:12,438 --> 00:45:14,481
Remember that guy
I told you about whose wife

708
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:16,112
disappeared on some cruise?

709
00:45:16,232 --> 00:45:17,403
Get this,

710
00:45:17,653 --> 00:45:20,318
he was reported missing
about an hour ago.

711
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:26,184
Where was it that you say
you went fishing?

712
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:30,519
Mercy Reef.

713
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,064
Yeah, Mercy Reef.

714
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,231
That's what I thought you said.

715
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:39,052
'cause when I sent
the coast guard over there,

716
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:40,615
they couldn't find you.

717
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,116
The ocean's a big place.

718
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:48,397
Or maybe you weren't at Mercy Reef.

719
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:52,668
Where else would I have been?

720
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:56,907
Bimini's...

721
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,007
what, 40 miles away?

722
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,719
I went fishing.
You saw me.

723
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:03,554
You were on that cruise ship.

724
00:46:05,448 --> 00:46:07,225
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

725
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,426
You were on that cruise ship
finishing what I couldn't.

726
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:15,000
Wasn't me.

727
00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:18,664
You were making sure
that Ethan Turner

728
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:21,197
could never hurt
another innocent soul again.

729
00:46:22,076 --> 00:46:24,617
- It's getting late. You should go.
- It's okay.

730
00:46:25,221 --> 00:46:27,368
You and I, we're the same.

731
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:29,702
No one is like me.

732
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,416
You're wrong.

733
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:35,504
You're wrong.

734
00:46:36,903 --> 00:46:39,172
Don't you see what happened today?

735
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:41,925
I gave you the chance
to avenge two women

736
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,177
whom the system failed,
and just like I hoped, you--

737
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:47,889
You seized that opportunity.

738
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:50,686
It's not like that.

739
00:46:54,224 --> 00:46:56,004
You don't have to lie to me.

740
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:58,733
Don't you understand?

741
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:00,610
I see who you are.

742
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:03,570
No, you can't.

743
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:07,682
- No one can.
- You have nothing to explain to me.

744
00:47:07,802 --> 00:47:09,629
Nothing to apologize for.

745
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:11,495
Ever.

746
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:14,918
I'm with you.

747
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,509
I'm behind you.

748
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:20,913
And I respect you.

749
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:29,294
I better get home.
Syl will be waiting up.

750
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,489
Good night, Dexter.

751
00:47:33,098 --> 00:47:35,012
<i>When Harry saw what I truly was,</i>

752
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:36,604
<i>he was repulsed.</i>

753
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:38,861
<i>It destroyed my brother,</i>

754
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:40,686
<i>consumed Lila.</i>

755
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:43,273
<i>But not Miguel Prado.</i>

756
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:46,595
<i>Somehow he looks at me and he's...</i>

757
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:48,889
<i>proud.</i>
