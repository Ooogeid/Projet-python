00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,954
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter...

3
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:50,290
I was working on my piece
with the blowtorch

4
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:52,408
and it caught fire. I was so scared.

5
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:56,545
We could always get in the car
and pass the time like we used to.

6
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:00,500
You're giving Doakes to the press?
He is not your man!

7
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:03,492
Your credibility was compromised
when you failed to report a call

8
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:06,166
from the subject
of a goddamn FBI manhunt.

9
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,298
Who joined who in the shower earlier?

10
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,821
What if I set the alarm 10 min earlier
in the future?

11
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,691
"Future", I like the sound of that.

12
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,487
A woman named Lila Tournay
has filled sexual assault charges

13
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,705
- against him.
- The fucking bitch!

14
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,019
I could lose everything over this.

15
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,855
Why can't you just let me go?

16
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,839
Because I'm your real soulmate.

17
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:29,603
Not Rita.

18
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:36,053
Jesus Christ,
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

19
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:38,269
I really hate that name.

20
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:44,485
What's it gonna be, Morgan?
Kill me now or set me free.

21
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,777
Don't worry,
I'll send the FBI soon enough.

22
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,572
- You're still gonna try to frame me?
<i>- Mission accomplished.</i>

23
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:51,508
<i>One more nail in Doakes' coffin.</i>

24
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,103
- We got him.
- So you have a tip, not Doakes.

25
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:57,700
Parc manager said our target was heading
into the Everglades. We will have

26
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:00,349
the son of a bitch
in the handcuffs in 24 hours.

27
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:03,672
Do not ever go to Rita's house again.

28
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,503
Stay away from Rita.

29
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,526
Stay away from me.

30
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,996
Whether you leave on your own or
Immigration hauls your sorry ass away,

31
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,348
I don't give a shit.

32
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:16,734
But I don't want you to fuck
with the people I care about 1 more day.

33
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,148
<i>Previous destinations.</i>

34
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,723
- They found Doakes' rental car.
- Did they find him?

35
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,977
Not yet, but the search grid
is closing in.

36
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:33,011
Who's out there? Anybody out there?

37
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,781
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

38
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,204
Somebody in there?

39
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,393
Hello, who's out there?

40
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,258
I need some help!

41
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,826
Get me out of here!

42
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,335
Who are you?

43
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,025
Just open the door!

44
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:14,822
I'm being held captive.

45
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,618
Leave the mess for once.
Walk away from the mess.

46
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,769
- I can't do that.
- We need you.

47
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,837
Lundy's mobilizing every agency
in 5 counties. We're closing in.

48
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,875
You've a rental car, not Doakes.

49
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:37,384
God, come on!

50
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,742
- I'm only helpful if there's blood.
- Maybe we'll shoot him.

51
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,803
You'll need a paramedic, not me.

52
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:46,989
- Are you afraid to face Doakes?
- Yes. Of course I'm afraid to face him.

53
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:51,396
- And I have dishes to do.
- OK. I'll let you know when it's over.

54
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,532
It's Doakes. You hate the guy.

55
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:00,147
I used to. I can't even afford
to think of him as a person anymore.

56
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:03,887
Would you get going?

57
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:05,272
I tried.

58
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:09,950
<i>If they find Doakes
locked inside a cage,</i>

59
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,101
<i>it'll seriously undermine
my frame job.</i>

60
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,040
<i>I need to beat them to that cabin.</i>

61
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,859
<i>Waiting in the Everglades are hordes</i>

62
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:32,367
<i>of county sheriffs, search parties
and ravenous reptiles.</i>

63
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:36,916
<i>And at this corner wearing dark trunks,
the mighty Dexter.</i>

64
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,815
Drive much?

65
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,927
<i>I need a miracle.</i>

66
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,434
There's a switch...
right behind you on the wall.

67
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,052
Damn, it's good to see another face.

68
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:12,783
I never thought I would.

69
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,892
I'm sergeant James Doakes,

70
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,622
Miami Metro Homicide.

71
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,474
- Who put you in there?
- A fucking psycho.

72
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,821
He could be back any minute.

73
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,723
Grab that key right behind you
on the wall.

74
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:31,039
Who is he?

75
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,481
His name is Dexter Morgan.

76
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,733
I need you to open this gate.

77
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,528
Why would he put you in there?

78
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:42,247
Because I find out
he's the Bay Harbord Butcher!

79
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:44,621
Please, just open this fucking gate!

80
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,178
He's the Butcher?

81
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,881
That's I'm trying to tell you.

82
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:52,165
What's in there?

83
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:54,771
Exactly what you think it is.

84
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,960
It's evidence.

85
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,730
And I saw what happened.

86
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,008
I really need
to get out of this cage, lady.

87
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:05,187
Poor thing, all alone.

88
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,044
I'm okay. Just open the gate.

89
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:10,537
Not you.

90
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,827
Hiding such an enormous secret.

91
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,660
What a burden that's got to be.
No wonder he is so shut down.

92
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,283
What are you, his accomplice?

93
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:31,213
I'm his soulmate.

94
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:52,067
You can't leave me in here like this.
You'll be an accessory.

95
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,975
I'm not gonna leave you.

96
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:57,262
Not like that.

97
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:01,739
What the fuck are you doing?

98
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,522
What the fuck are you doing?

99
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,008
No! Do you understand this is murder?

100
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:11,159
Open this sucking door!
This is a fucking murder!

101
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:21,036
Hey. Dexter Morgan,
Miami Metro P.D. Forensics.

102
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm here to join the search
for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

103
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,818
The search is on hold right now
until they sort out the confusion.

104
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,474
- Confusion, huh?
- Yeah, it's a real mess.

105
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:34,694
Take right at the fork.
Park outside the line of fire trucks.

106
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,137
Confusion requires fire trucks?

107
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,626
<i>When something beyond reason happens,
it turns skeptics into believers.</i>

108
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,630
<i>Believers in a higher power.</i>

109
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:10,616
<i>But what kind of power did this?</i>

110
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,873
You were fucking fast!
I just got here

111
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:23,967
- and took a helicopter with Lundy.
- I broke a lot of speed limits.

112
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,041
After you left,
I realized you were right.

113
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,134
I didn't want to miss the action.

114
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,713
What happened?

115
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:33,521
They think a propane tank exploded.

116
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:35,966
How?

117
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,045
Do I look like a fucking fire chief?

118
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,910
Did they find a body?

119
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,098
Just bits and pieces so far.

120
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,585
<i>Was it spontaneous combustion?</i>

121
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:57,015
<i>Divine intervention?</i>

122
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,791
<i>If you believe that God makes miracle,</i>

123
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:03,221
<i>you have to wonder
if Satan has a few up his sleeve.</i>

124
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,880
<i>But when you don't believe in anything,
who do you thank at a time like this?</i>

125
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:28,858
<i>We got a floater.</i>

126
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,490
He got left off.

127
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:08,398
Separation.

128
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,443
Gaping areas of...

129
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,465
putrefied tissue.

130
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,150
Extensive fourth degree burns.

131
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,068
Big ass fucking explosion.

132
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:24,273
What else can you give us?

133
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,903
These linear lines around his eyes
are unburned.

134
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,424
He was squinting.

135
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,548
Alive when it happened.

136
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:34,492
What else?

137
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,102
Teeth are intact. Dental records
should give us a positive ID.

138
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,495
Goddammit, Masuka. Is it Doakes?

139
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:45,982
Male.

140
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,653
African-American.
About the right length of torso.

141
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,730
Heavily muscled.

142
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,607
I think it's him.

143
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:05,312
These are the same kind of tools
that scuba diving class found.

144
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,035
He'd need them to make cuts
that clean.

145
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:10,482
Those come from the suspect?

146
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,848
No, they belong to a second body.

147
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,575
And whoever he was, he was dead
and dismembered before the explosion.

148
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,867
This is where the Butcher
did his dirty work.

149
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,344
It's a perfect location
for a kill room.

150
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,969
- Doesn't get anymore remote than this.
- No, it couldn't.

151
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,375
- This is good news, gentlemen.
- And lady.

152
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:32,389
Right. All right, we keep the search on

153
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:35,627
until we get a firm ID
on that body in the water.

154
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,181
You agree?

155
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,994
The evidence is compelling.

156
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,358
Overwhelming, actually.

157
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:50,231
I guess we got our man.

158
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,940
Shit, LaGuerta's here.

159
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,885
- I woudn't if I were you.
- Is it James?

160
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,140
They don't know yet.

161
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>Apparently, miracles are subjective.</i>

162
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:13,640
<i>I can't exactly feel LaGuerta's pain,
but I can appreciate it.</i>

163
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,100
<i>Doakes wasn't so bad in the end.</i>

164
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,229
<i>But the truly tragic thing would be
to let his sacrifice go to waste.</i>

165
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:23,959
<i>There's only one way I can think of
to honor him.</i>

166
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,113
<i>I have to embrace my freedom.</i>

167
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:39,507
<i>Sleep.</i>

168
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,224
<i>What a concept.</i>

169
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,965
<i>I can't believe I actually contemplated
turning myself in.</i>

170
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,233
<i>This is so much better
than a prison cell.</i>

171
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,256
<i>I can squeeze fresh orange juice.</i>

172
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,640
<i>Savour a fine French roast.</i>

173
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:10,137
<i>Grab a morning work out.</i>

174
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,304
<i>OK, working out,
I could have done in prison, but still.</i>

175
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:17,608
<i>I'm free.</i>

176
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:34,901
Sorry.

177
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:38,788
- Hope I didn't scare you.
- What are you doing out there?

178
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,788
I figured the kids were still sleeping,
I didn't want to ring the bell.

179
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,519
Why are you here?

180
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:50,679
I figured the kids
were still asleep...

181
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,556
I like when you sneak unexpected.

182
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,949
Yeah, I wound up with some
unexpected time on my hands.

183
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,405
<i>Like twenty years to life.</i>

184
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,404
I don't know if this is a good idea.

185
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:38,735
I was just getting used to you
from a distance.

186
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,249
I don't know,
you've been like a mirage.

187
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:46,542
I've been right here.

188
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:49,576
You're the one that run away.

189
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:52,570
Yeah, I did.

190
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,256
I kinda forgot who I was.

191
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,024
I got it straight now.

192
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,116
Keep it straight.

193
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,764
Or I won't be here next time.

194
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:08,560
I know that.

195
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,564
Mom?

196
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,162
It's the sex police.

197
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:21,840
- How come you're still in bed?
- I overslept.

198
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,827
Will you make us pancakes, please?

199
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,318
What's under here?

200
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,875
Are you guys back together?

201
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,668
I guess we are.

202
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:12,834
Over.

203
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:15,423
Under. Over.

204
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,928
Under.

205
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:19,749
- Maybe I should do it myself.
- No, I wanna do it.

206
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:23,052
- We're gonna be late.
- So what? Case is closing.

207
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,013
We still need confirmation
on Doakes's body.

208
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:27,562
And if it's him?

209
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:30,721
- Then, it's over.
- The case, not us, right?

210
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,965
We still have the wrap-up to do:
cataloguing, confirming,

211
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,772
- filing, more filing...
- So we've got time?

212
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:40,794
Plenty.

213
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,081
- Time enough for a vacation?
- Now you're talking.

214
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,196
Toes in the sand, tequila.

215
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,500
Little tiny bikini.

216
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:00,411
How about a parka?

217
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,279
- A what?
- I've had my feel of heat.

218
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:07,718
No more heat.
You'd look great in a parka.

219
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:10,767
Ever heard of Lake Ipperwash?

220
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:17,170
- Can't say that I have.
- Wonderful ice fishing. Very romantic.

221
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:19,318
Fine. OK.

222
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,856
Let's just go.

223
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,234
- Morning, Dex.
- Donut?

224
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,083
I'm not really feeling like donuts
today. Know what I mean?

225
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,249
<i>Oh, right.</i>

226
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:42,633
Donuts.

227
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:46,462
- Hey, are you free?
- Vince, you have no idea.

228
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:49,157
Good. I got a dozen boxes
of burned up shit from the cabin

229
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,876
that need cataloguing.

230
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,630
I was looking more closely at the date
of James' Special Forces missions,

231
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,720
- and...
- We have a positive ID on the body.

232
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:10,463
There may be an additional date
which puts him out of the country...

233
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,781
The burned victim is Sgt Doakes.

234
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:15,885
Dental records confirmed it.

235
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,163
And the other body?

236
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:29,565
Jose Garza, a murder fugitive who's been
living under the alias Chris Harlow.

237
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,243
The body was dismembered.

238
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,639
Consistant with our other victims.

239
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:37,835
Deputy director Adams
is closing the case.

240
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:40,146
I see.

241
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:47,202
All the evidence points to James Doakes
as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

242
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,418
Conclusively.

243
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,145
- I wanted you to hear it from me 1st.
- Thank you.

244
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,073
I am truly sorry.

245
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:24,718
Don't know why they keep hauling crap
from the cabin in here.

246
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:27,348
We already know
what we need to know.

247
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:31,947
- Doakes was a suicidal maniac.
- The term is homicidal maniac.

248
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:33,670
Not that I'm judging.

249
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,966
Whatever. He blew himself up.
That's what I'm saying.

250
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,511
I heard somebody saying
it was a propane accident.

251
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:41,728
Right.

252
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:44,518
Doakes accidentally turned on
the propane valve,

253
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,601
and then the stove.

254
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:48,233
The stove was on?

255
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,052
It was in the official fire
investigators' report this morning.

256
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:54,556
I mean...

257
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:58,154
I guess it could be that Doakes didn't
realize fire and gas are a bad combo.

258
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:01,199
But my money's on suicide.

259
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:04,927
A bad ass like Doakes
would rather burn than get burned.

260
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:08,510
It's a good line for my movie.

261
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,876
- I better write it down.
- You're writing a movie about Doakes?

262
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,317
Maybe or not.

263
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:16,000
He'd rather burn than get burned...

264
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,313
I checked and didn't see any GPS
device in the minivan, Dexter.

265
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,580
<i>Did you check the glove box?
It's grey, rectangular,</i>

266
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,829
the size of a paperback book.

267
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,542
<i>It wasn't there.</i>

268
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:56,342
I even looked under the seats.
You think it was stolen?

269
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,502
<i>Maybe.</i>

270
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,183
Thanks, Rita. I'll see you tonight.

271
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:04,190
<i>If someone stole my GPS,
it would've lead 'em straight to Doakes.</i>

272
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:07,558
<i>Who do I know with a nasty habit
of stealing?</i>

273
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:12,048
<i>My miracle worker.</i>

274
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:21,604
It looks peaceful in there.

275
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:24,740
Doesn't it?

276
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:29,108
I'm glad you called.

277
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,653
I was afraid maybe you'd left town.

278
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:37,724
- Seems I found a good reason to stay.
- Like what?

279
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:40,695
A new victim?

280
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,362
You mean you?

281
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,609
That's why you asked me
to the aquarium?

282
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:59,525
A public place.
You thought I was gonna...

283
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:02,945
That I would slit my needle
into your neck?

284
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,947
Is that how you do it?

285
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,160
It's one of the ways.

286
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:25,954
You're afraid of me now,
aren't you?

287
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,618
Always been afraid of you, Dexter.

288
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:33,100
Why?

289
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,453
From the 1st time I saw you,
I could see how hopelessly consumed

290
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:39,607
you were by your need.

291
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:45,654
You lied to me.

292
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,731
All that time as my sponsor.

293
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:55,456
You said all you wanted was
to help me control my addiction.

294
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:59,344
- Would you control it?
- That's not what you really wanted.

295
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:01,056
Was it?

296
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,355
What do you think I wanted?

297
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:09,318
To know what it's like

298
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:11,432
to feel something...

299
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,731
that deeply.

300
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:18,659
Anything. That's why you hang up
in recovery groups.

301
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,507
You're emotionally color-blind.

302
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:25,447
You use the right words,
you pantomime the right behavior,

303
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,438
but feelings never come to pass.

304
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,021
- It's not true.
- It is, Lila.

305
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,562
You know the dictionary definition
of emotions,

306
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:39,751
Longing, joy, sorrow...

307
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:44,396
You have no idea of what any
of those things actually feel like.

308
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,863
You're wrong, I have feelings for you.

309
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,794
You wanna have feelings for me,

310
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:50,943
- they're just impulses.
- Enough.

311
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:53,618
They're primitive responses
to immediat needs

312
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:56,526
You know all the words
but you can't hear the music.

313
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,079
Don't do this here.

314
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:03,339
I'm just like you.

315
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:27,913
I was down to my last hope.

316
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,609
So was I.

317
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:33,942
When he told me who you are,

318
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,322
I thought that was a secret
worth protecting.

319
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:40,120
Most stuff in my mind.

320
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:42,406
I wish you could have seen it.

321
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:44,967
The explosion was...

322
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:47,572
brilliant.

323
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,575
I'm more like my father
than I've ever imagined.

324
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,169
I created a monster of my own.

325
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:55,977
Told you.

326
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,197
We're meant to be together.

327
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:06,333
Lila, I'm sorry I pushed you away.

328
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:14,003
I know how frightening
it must have been for you.

329
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:16,122
Me scratching to get in.

330
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,326
But it's okay.

331
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:19,779
I'm in now.

332
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:22,518
And I'm not going anywhere.

333
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:24,510
I am.

334
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:29,750
And with Doakes gone, I'm starting
to think it's too dangerous for me here.

335
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:32,125
I need to move on, to disappear,

336
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:35,533
- I've already said my goodbyes.
- Let me come with you.

337
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,261
I was hoping you'd say that.

338
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,004
How long would it take you
to get ready?

339
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,027
To close my accounts...

340
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,144
Shut up my business...

341
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:54,254
Tomorrow afternoon.

342
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,559
Go home and pack.
I'll call you tomorrow.

343
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:08,627
I can't wait to go away with you.

344
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,188
I can't wait.

345
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,425
<i>You're going away with me all right.</i>

346
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,053
<i>In a garbage bag.</i>

347
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:30,953
But it went all right?

348
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,817
Sure, for an internal affairs
investigation.

349
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:35,890
I spent 2 hours saying "No!"

350
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,139
"I did not rape Lila Tournay.

351
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:41,547
"She's bad shit, nuts, wacko".
I started to run out of adjectives.

352
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,630
I've got a few you can use.

353
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:46,668
The good news is the department
is dying to drop the charge.

354
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,511
They're dodging enough bullets
with this whole Doakes thing.

355
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:50,538
Good.

356
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:54,391
When they find out your so-called victim
fled Miami, you'll be reinstated.

357
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:57,390
- Lila went away?
- She fucking better.

358
00:28:57,648 --> 00:29:01,668
Last night, I told her to haul her ass
out of town before she's deported.

359
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:05,801
- You did that for me?
- Of course. For you and for Dex.

360
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,972
You 2 window lickers needed somebody
to snap you out of it.

361
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,769
It's good to know somebody's pulling
for you when you're down.

362
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,348
Okay, I get the point.

363
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:23,763
- Are you sure Lila got the message?
- Yeah, totally.

364
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:27,677
I made it pretty clear.

365
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:32,562
Excuse me.
Donations can be made directly to me.

366
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:36,364
- Donations?
- For sergeant Doakes' memorial service.

367
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,338
You got to be kidding.

368
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:41,997
That's what we do for a fellow officer.

369
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,814
- Thanks again, Morgan.
- Yeah.

370
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:51,977
Excuse me, lieutenant. I...

371
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:56,645
- was wondering...
- Checks payable to cash.

372
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,300
Actually, I wanted to offer
my support.

373
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:01,960
some sympathy or...

374
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,431
whatever.
If you wanna talk...

375
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:07,851
Thank you, Morgan. I can manage.

376
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:09,478
I'm not so sure...

377
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,648
You're collecting money
to honor a killer.

378
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,652
I'm not honoring the Butcher.
I'm honoring James Doakes.

379
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:21,198
Respectfully, Maria, that's denial.

380
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,205
- So it is.
- You're choosing to be in denial?

381
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,911
Conscious denial.

382
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,790
But the case is closed.
I won't pursue it.

383
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:32,867
But I knew James.

384
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:34,653
I knew him.

385
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:37,423
As a partner and as a friend.

386
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:41,982
And I have to keep on believing
that is who he was, because...

387
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:44,982
If he could hide
all that over fucked up shit,

388
00:30:45,154 --> 00:30:48,559
- then I don't think I could ever...
- Trust anyone again.

389
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:51,231
That's right.

390
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:54,943
Or yourself?

391
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:02,232
I'll leave a check in your office.

392
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,503
<i>It's strange to have a creation
out there.</i>

393
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,134
<i>A deeply mutated version
of yourself,</i>

394
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,808
<i>running loose
and screwing everything up.</i>

395
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:20,257
<i>I wonder if this is
how parents feel.</i>

396
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:19,067
What the fuck?

397
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:25,280
- What're you doing here?
- I came to make sure Lila left town.

398
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:27,282
Me too.

399
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,151
And if she was still here
you're gonna what? Wrestle her? Jesus!

400
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:33,622
What have we here?

401
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:38,369
The door was open.

402
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:42,881
I just stepped out to buy
some snacks for the road trip.

403
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,454
Come to say goodbye.

404
00:32:50,422 --> 00:32:52,474
We came to see that you cleared out.

405
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,248
Now we see you're on your way,

406
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,453
we're good to go.

407
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,503
Have a nice fucking life.

408
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,909
- You're not coming with me, then.
- My God!

409
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:15,706
What did you do to make her
so pathetically crazy for you?

410
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,586
Does your dick dance?

411
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:30,300
I better be on my way, then.

412
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:34,224
I think that's my bag.
I left it last time I was here.

413
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:36,542
I'm pretty sure it's mine.

414
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:39,813
I can open it up,
so you can check for yourself.

415
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:42,582
No, it's my mistake.

416
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:55,753
- Goodbye, then.
- Have a nice flight.

417
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,268
Don't forget your broom.

418
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:08,115
<i>Hello, this is Lila. Leave your name
and number. I'll ring you back asap.</i>

419
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,238
Lila, where are you?
I'm ready to hit the road.

420
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,920
Hope you're not mad about that thing
with Deb. Had to lie.

421
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:16,920
I don't want her to know
we're running off together.

422
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:19,375
Call me right away. I miss you.

423
00:35:13,538 --> 00:35:14,538
Bedroom!

424
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:19,681
What're we doing home in the middle
of the day? She asked, hoping for sex.

425
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,571
You're packing already!

426
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,842
Good thing I got my touque.

427
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,136
- Lake Ipperwash or bust.
- Slow down.

428
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,824
Wait! I got a parka.

429
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:38,609
Do you know how hard it is
to find a parka in Miami?

430
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,435
When do we leave?

431
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:42,297
Not "we". Me.

432
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,921
I just got a call from D.C.

433
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:49,151
A pattern of bodies was identified
in Oregon.

434
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:51,911
My flight leaves tonight, at 7:00.

435
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:54,364
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

436
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:55,829
I wish I were.

437
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:00,378
But it's too soon. I mean...

438
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:04,087
If you're leaving,
we gotta work out logistics.

439
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:05,344
Logistics?

440
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,170
Yeah. We got a lot a shit
to figure out.

441
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:12,348
Weekend visits and red eye flights
and frequent flyer plans.

442
00:36:13,148 --> 00:36:14,870
Let me get my calendar.

443
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:20,390
Do you honestly want
to go down this path?

444
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:25,103
You're right. I don't. Long distance
relationships never work out.

445
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:27,088
Not even in the movies.

446
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,264
Fuck it!

447
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:33,911
What're you doing?

448
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,218
Logistics.

449
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:39,367
Taking in a leave of absence.

450
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,571
You're not thinking this through.

451
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,439
What's to think about?
I'm going with you.

452
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,997
It's just a job.

453
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,295
It's more than that to you.

454
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,583
Okay, I love my job.

455
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:54,549
But not as much as I love...

456
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:58,992
being kin with you.

457
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:01,352
Just...

458
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:03,473
do me a favor.

459
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:06,058
Take the afternoon

460
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,212
and think about this.

461
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,639
Fine.

462
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,322
You do <i>me</i> a favor and buy me
a goddam ticket on your flight.

463
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:20,450
I'm going home to pack
and I'll see you at the airport.

464
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:36,776
That was delicious.

465
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,845
What did you like better, the nature
stew or the mud pudding?

466
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:43,745
I want worms on toast.
Can we have worms on toast for a snack?

467
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,731
Go wash up asap.

468
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,372
No running in the house, please!

469
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:01,986
Yeah, real mature!

470
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:11,290
Captain, you called for me?

471
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,577
Hey, Dexter.

472
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:16,386
I received a phone call from a woman
saying she's a friend of yours.

473
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:18,988
- Who?
- She wouldn't give her name,

474
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,970
but claims to have vital information
on the Butcher.

475
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:24,890
- Any idea who she might be?
- English accent?

476
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,948
- That's her.
- I think...

477
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:30,812
she might have
a personal issue with me.

478
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:34,858
It's the same woman that tried
to railroad Batista. Avoid her.

479
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:37,116
Not a chance.

480
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,946
Now this case is closing,
I can't afford any loose ends.

481
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,158
- She said she was coming in?
- Within the hour.

482
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,036
- And she mentionned my name?
- Specifically.

483
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,498
Stick around.
We'll sort this thing out together.

484
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,461
<i>If Lila plans to turn me in,</i>

485
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,925
<i>why drop my name to the captain
and give me a chance to intercept her?</i>

486
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,699
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

487
00:39:01,144 --> 00:39:04,598
<i>Unless she wants me here
so she can hurt me some other way.</i>

488
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:23,354
Guys?

489
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,575
Lexi.

490
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:30,622
- Where're the kids?
- I can't remember.

491
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:35,418
I got your message. What's going on?

492
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,090
- The kids are missing.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep.

493
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,222
We have to call the police.

494
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:45,096
Call Deb. She'll have the entire force
looking for them.

495
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,973
See if any neighbor saw anything.
I'll drive around the area.

496
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:50,027
I promise we'll find them.

497
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,347
We're going to terminal 7,
Miami International.

498
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,901
- Morgan.
- It's Rita.

499
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:03,530
- I'm getting in a cab.
- Cody and Astor are missing.

500
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:06,074
- You called the police?
- Dex said to call you.

501
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:10,398
Sit by the phone,
I'll take it from here.

502
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:11,746
All right.

503
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:15,834
- Could you wait?
- You don't wanna go to the airport?

504
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:18,461
Of course I do.

505
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:20,588
I just said "wait".

506
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,425
For Christ sake, make up you mind.

507
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:25,415
Why?

508
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:29,351
Why do I have to make up my mind?

509
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:34,352
Goddammit!

510
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,375
Here.

511
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:43,796
Hi, Dexter.

512
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,161
- Hi, Dexter.
- Hey, Dex.

513
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:54,748
- Hey, guys. Having fun?
- Super fun. Lila's so nice.

514
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,441
- Where is Lila?
- I'm over here.

515
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,964
Could've had it all, Dexter.

516
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,148
Stay on the bed. Don't move!

517
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,123
Look away, both of you.

518
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:48,051
Astor, you first.
You're gonna help your brother.

519
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:04,095
Go! Run! Find help!

520
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,902
- Come on!
- I can't fit.

521
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:09,938
Shit.

522
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,701
What do you remember from before?

523
00:42:54,997 --> 00:42:56,609
Before we took you in.

524
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:02,267
<i>Nothing.</i>

525
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,248
Good.

526
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:07,403
Because what happened
was too strong.

527
00:43:08,326 --> 00:43:10,421
Son, it got into you too early.

528
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:15,063
<i>And it's gonna stay there.
It's gonna make you wanna kill.</i>

529
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,599
And you won't be able to stop it.

530
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:22,798
<i>So I'm gonna be like this forever.</i>

531
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:19,494
You gonna be okay. I got you.

532
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,926
I'm so sorry about all of this.

533
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:55,607
It's over now.

534
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,081
They're safe. You're safe.

535
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:00,285
It's all that matters.

536
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:10,795
You two.

537
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:14,299
Secure a perimeter and have
the fire chief come to see me.

538
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,885
Put out an APB on Lila West,

539
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,096
aka Lila Tournay, suspected arsonist.

540
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:23,099
5'7", black hair,
pale like a fucking corpse.

541
00:45:23,425 --> 00:45:24,934
Fucking corpse, got it.

542
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:29,002
You're wasting your time.
She's not coming back. Not after this.

543
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:31,850
- Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.
- She won't.

544
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,985
She's a survivalist.

545
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,944
How'd you know the kids were here?

546
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:40,953
A neighbor saw them walking with
a strange woman. Wasn't much of a leap.

547
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,494
Lila's gone after everyone
that's close to you.

548
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:46,706
What?

549
00:45:47,473 --> 00:45:51,336
Pretty impressive. Not too long ago,
I was taking care of you.

550
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:55,590
- I like it better this way.
- I can see that.

551
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:58,468
Why's this man not on the way
to the hospital?

552
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:00,053
I'm fine.

553
00:46:00,295 --> 00:46:02,388
No, your eyebrows are singed.

554
00:46:04,826 --> 00:46:06,517
How can you be so relaxed?

555
00:46:09,196 --> 00:46:11,434
I'm good at compartmentalization.

556
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:14,936
You're a little weird, Dex.

557
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:18,988
That's not gonna change.
I'm gonna be this way forever.

558
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:22,830
I can live with that.

559
00:46:25,456 --> 00:46:26,913
Just smarten up, OK?

560
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:32,582
<i>I passed through the flames
and rose from the ashes.</i>

561
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:34,176
<i>Again.</i>

562
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,798
<i>I've never put much weight
onto the idea of a higher power.</i>

563
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,134
<i>But if I didn't know better,
I'd have to believe</i>

564
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:43,824
<i>that some force out there wants me
to keep doing what I'm doing.</i>

565
00:47:50,186 --> 00:47:53,833
You wanted to be close to me.
This is the most I have to offer.

566
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:55,835
I cannot feel my...

567
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,920
My legs and my body.

568
00:47:58,162 --> 00:48:01,476
Good. I chose a spinal epidural
instead of a tranquilizer.

569
00:48:01,636 --> 00:48:05,146
I've got a plane to catch.
And you don't need to feel this.

570
00:48:08,911 --> 00:48:10,816
You killed an innocent man.

571
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,644
I did it for you.

572
00:48:14,863 --> 00:48:16,856
You tried to kill the kids for me, too?

573
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:21,319
Don't do this.

574
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:24,780
You told me to accept what I am.

575
00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:30,953
And to trust in the one thing
I know with absolute clarity.

576
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:42,368
Thank you.

577
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:05,386
<i>Not long ago I had a dream that
people could see me for what I am.</i>

578
00:49:05,546 --> 00:49:10,063
<i>For a brief instant in time, the world
actually saw my bodies of work.</i>

579
00:49:10,223 --> 00:49:11,669
<i>Some even cheered.</i>

580
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:15,052
<i>But as it turns out,
nobody mourns the wicked.</i>

581
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:17,016
<i>Sorry, James.</i>

582
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:24,215
<i>I think Harry knew that from the start.
That's why he gave me a code.</i>

583
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:28,492
<i>It cost him his life, but it kept me
alive through incredible trials.</i>

584
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:31,226
<i>The code is mine now,
and mine alone.</i>

585
00:49:31,623 --> 00:49:34,211
<i>So too are the relationships
I cultivate.</i>

586
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:43,267
<i>They're not just disguises anymore.</i>

587
00:49:43,703 --> 00:49:44,837
<i>I need them.</i>

588
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:48,268
<i>Even if they make me vulnerable.</i>

589
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:52,774
<i>My father might not approve,
but I'm no longer his disciple.</i>

590
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:54,900
<i>I'm a master now.</i>

591
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:58,279
<i>An idea transcended into life.</i>

592
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:05,637
<i>And so this is my new path.</i>

593
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:08,011
<i>Which is a lot like the old one.</i>

594
00:50:08,435 --> 00:50:09,630
<i>Only mine.</i>

595
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:14,094
<i>To stay on that path,
I need to work harder.</i>

596
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:16,759
<i>Explore new rituals, evolve.</i>

597
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:20,705
<i>Am I evil?</i>

598
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:22,739
<i>Am I good?</i>

599
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:25,154
<i>I'm done asking those questions.</i>

600
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:27,227
<i>I don't have the answers.</i>

601
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:29,978
<i>Does anyone?</i>
