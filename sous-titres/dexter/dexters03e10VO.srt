1
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,000
Previously on dexter...

2
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,823
Oh   that's pretty. gift from my first husband.

3
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:45,000
What'll it be, ladies?

4
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,590
How 'bout a foot massage with those big,

5
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,056
Gorgeous hands of yours?

6
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,490
-they're kinda cold from scooping ice.  - but you're hot.

7
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,589
Miguel went missing last night. ellen's missing this morning.

8
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,524
I hope she didn't get in an accident or something.

9
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:59,157
He did it. miguel really did it.

10
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,590
Ellen.

11
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:02,090
You don't wanna have to think about what she went through

12
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:03,590
To realize that she's really gone.

13
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,423
Don't. don't. she's gone.

14
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:07,890
You got me. I'm right here for you.

15
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:09,423
To get you through.

16
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:10,790
He's having an affair.

17
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,256
No. you don't know that.

18
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,090
When you've been married as long as we have,

19
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,490
You know when your husband's lying.

20
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:17,523
Anton is not officially a c.i.

21
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,190
We used him as bait.

22
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,690
The skinner has anton.

23
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,323
Freebo owes you money? I can get you money.

24
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,690
I loaned freebo that money.

25
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,757
This is about respect.

26
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,990
Anton!

27
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:33,323
Morgan, get out of the way!

28
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,990
You found me.

29
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:38,256
You can't get away from me that easily.

30
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,623
Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit

31
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:43,791
Against the police department once he finds out how you fucked him over!

32
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:46,023
You don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about!

33
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,990
You're the one I wanna spend time with.

34
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:52,390
My god...it's perfect.

35
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:54,824
You should just... get out while you can.

36
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,990
I won't. I promise.

37
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:01,190
I gave you my shirt, linking me to freebo's death.

38
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,290
I wish I had another one to prove to you

39
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,457
How important this partnership is to me.

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,891
The link between freebo's murder and miguel--

41
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,357
It's not even human.

42
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,657
It's cow's blood. he's been using me.

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,090
I didn't create a monster. I was used by one.

44
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,657
He...used...me.

45
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,724
How many was it seven or eight balls?

46
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:27,223
I lost count.

47
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,323
Putting the 18th tee in front of a body of water

48
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:30,524
Is criminal.

49
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,390
I kept on telling him "take the mulligan!

50
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,056
Please take the mullig--"

51
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,090
This one right here-- no.

52
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,457
I finally got one over didn't i? yeah.

53
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,557
Just what I ordered--

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,956
Feigned civility with a heaping side of betrayal.

55
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,424
It's becoming more and more clear

56
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,190
That I'm going to have to deal with miguel.

57
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,857
Thank you, chef.

58
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:54,557
Ah, chef babia.

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,190
Option one--i kill him.

60
00:03:57,223 --> 00:03:59,657
But he's too high profile.

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,724
A popular ada disappears. the manhunt would be endless.

62
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:04,424
Everyone he knew would be scrutinized,

63
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,724
And that includes me.

64
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,457
He's also my best man.

65
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,357
I'd be expected to grieve.

66
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,223
How about this pumpkin and sage ravioli here?

67
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:13,524
Oh, no, that's--

68
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:14,956
There you go.

69
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,990
Option two--get him the hell out of my life.

70
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:20,157
But it's not that simple.

71
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,524
He taught me how to golf. I taught him how to kill.

72
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:27,323
I'm responsible if miguel takes another innocent life.

73
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:30,123
Tell them   miguel. I can't wait.

74
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:31,257
Tell us?

75
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,090
We got a wedding present for you.

76
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,457
Chef babia and his staff,

77
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,056
They're gonna cater your wedding.

78
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,490
We wanted you to have the very best.

79
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:43,857
It's too much. really.

80
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,323
I won't take no for an answer.

81
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:46,791
You might have to.

82
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,791
We're doing this for you. I insist.

83
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:51,290
So much for option two.

84
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,557
He won't just let our partnership dissolve.

85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,524
He's trying to get me under his thumb,

86
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:57,390
And he's using rita to do it.

87
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:58,857
No...

88
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,791
You are the very best man.

89
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:04,590
It's working.

90
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,023
Okay, two, a toast.

91
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,323
To dexter and rita.

92
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:14,290
May your marriage be as blessed

93
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,557
As we are to have you to call friends.

94
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:22,157
Which leaves option three.

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,390
Get him under my thumb...

96
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,857
And keep him there.

97
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:30,290
God, wre barely moving.

98
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:34,624
So much for getting astor home in time r bath.

99
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,757
At least the meal was worth it.

100
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,791
And it was great to see sylvia and miguel getting along again.

101
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:43,824
Do we...have to serve food at the wedding?

102
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:47,791
Yes.

103
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,990
We have to serve food at the wedding.

104
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:51,457
It's just-- if we can't afford

105
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,557
Chef...what's-his-name on our own,

106
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,357
Maybe we shouldn't accept.

107
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,457
We can't say no now.

108
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,990
I mean it would be insulting.

109
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:02,557
Believe me   miguel's ego can handle it.

110
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:06,424
What's going on dexter?

111
00:06:06,457 --> 00:06:08,757
It's just...

112
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,490
Miguel isn't exactly who I thought he was.

113
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:14,323
You two seemed to be getting along fine at dinner.

114
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:15,657
Yeah...

115
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,290
Wait a minute.

116
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:19,424
Is this about sylvia?

117
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:21,557
I mean   did you find something out?

118
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,857
More than I wanted to.

119
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,724
Oh   my god. he's cheating on her.

120
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,123
No   that's not what i--

121
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:28,424
Oh, that bastard!

122
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,023
He looked me right in the eye

123
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,157
And he said he wasn't having an affair.

124
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,490
Oh, god...poor syl.

125
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:37,857
How long has it been going on?

126
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,690
Should I tell her? what would I say?

127
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,557
I think we should just...stay out of it.

128
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:47,490
Is it his secretary?

129
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,090
It's not his secretary!

130
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:50,524
Could we please just drop this?

131
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,657
- But there is someone.- I never said that.

132
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,490
All right   syl said that miguel's been

133
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,157
Spending a lot of time with maria laguerta,

134
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,490
Which makes syl uncomfortable

135
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,056
Because they have this big history.

136
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,056
- Is that true?- yes.

137
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,357
Then that's who it is.

138
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,090
I meant that they're spending time together

139
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,257
Because of a case.

140
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,590
Miguel's brother did die.

141
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:08,257
Which rekindled the relationship.

142
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,457
That's why you won't say anything.

143
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,624
You're protecting your boss.

144
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,757
Deb. glad to see ya.

145
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,290
Fight?

146
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,857
Eh. his best friend his cheating on my best friend,

147
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:22,023
And he won't tell me with who.

148
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,090
You have a best friend?

149
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,557
What'd you use on her chloroform?

150
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,757
Oh...i hope she was good.

151
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,023
Aw, she was a champ.

152
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:32,123
She almost made it through saw I and ii.

153
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:33,824
I'm kidding.

154
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:35,891
She was great. we bonded.

155
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,323
Hey.

156
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,390
Oh. oh, you...

157
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,323
You have company.

158
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,923
Yeah. um... this is anton.

159
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:46,524
Anton briggs the skinner victim?

160
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,223
Just anton.

161
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:49,857
And yes the skinner victim.

162
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,190
Uh   you know your sister...

163
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,424
She saved my life.

164
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:58,857
Does this mean you're plus one for the wedding?

165
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,223
Uh   we haven't really--

166
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:04,590
Talked about--

167
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:06,190
Uh   so   you're getting married.

168
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,590
- Oh   kudos. - thanks.

169
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,123
And a baby on the way.

170
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,757
I was hoping to walk down the aisle skinny,

171
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,791
Or at least skinnier.

172
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,056
Asshole.

173
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,290
Cocksuck!

174
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:38,757
Motherfuck!

175
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,791
Anton   wake up. you gotta go.

176
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,490
Fuckin' penguins!

177
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:45,257
It's just 7:30--i thought you didn't have to be at work--

178
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,523
Your protective detail's gonna think

179
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,757
that you spent the night!

180
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,290
I did. they're gonna think that we slept together!

181
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,557
We have   deb. oh, god, oh, god!

182
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,157
Oh   god   I know but if they tell my bosses,

183
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,923
I'm gonna get in a shit load of shit!

184
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,891
Really? from sleeping with your boyfriend?

185
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,457
You are a key witness in a case I'm investigating.

186
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,090
So if that comes out in trial,

187
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,923
King's lawyers are gonna have a fucking field day

188
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,757
When we catch him.

189
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,724
So   um   are you sure that's what this is really about?

190
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,923
Uh-huh.

191
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:12,757
Um...i gotta get in the shower,

192
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,857
So I'll call you later okay?

193
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:17,457
Yeah. okay.

194
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,723
Revisiting option three,

195
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:23,590
getting miguel under my thumb.

196
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:24,990
I need leverage.

197
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,090
Exposing ellen's body was supposed to achieve that.

198
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:29,323
But miguel wrestled it away.

199
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:31,690
We have a suspect for ellen wolf's murder.

200
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:35,791
Is she onto miguel and do I smell leverage?

201
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,857
Toby edwards, 32.

202
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,457
Oh, well.

203
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,190
Ellen's incoming phone records show

204
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,524
That he called her house three times

205
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:45,424
On the night of her murder-- once at 11:10 p.m.

206
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:46,791
From the bar where he works,

207
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:50,557
And then twice more at 3:01 and 3:08 a.m.

208
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,891
From right outside her house.

209
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,257
She hasn't found the killer,

210
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,557
But she might have found a witness.

211
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,657
And I found my leverage.

212
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,090
Soderquist, vamos.

213
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:00,257
Get an address on this guy. haul his ass in.

214
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,857
We're also getting a search warrant.

215
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:03,724
We're looking for a platinum wedding ring.

216
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:06,090
I've already catalogued one wedding ring into evidence.

217
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,891
Well, she wore two.

218
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,390
One for each ex-husband.

219
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,857
Well   why would the killer only take one ring?

220
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,757
Maybe he got interrupted.

221
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,090
Or he wanted a trophy.

222
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:19,223
Whatever it is we're gonna find out.

223
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:21,424
A potential witness, a missing ring.

224
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:24,190
Now miguel and I have something to talk about.

225
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,123
Hey   not so fast. not so fast.

226
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:30,757
I am taking donations for dexter morgan's

227
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,923
Bachelor party.

228
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:34,290
Produced and directed by vince masuka,

229
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:35,891
A vince masuka production.

230
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,457
Dig deep now. it's gonna be off the charts.

231
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,056
I'm gonna have sergeant cop-a-feel,

232
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,190
Jo-jo the lezbo go-go maureen the limber mermaid,

233
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:43,524
And her even more limber friend

234
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:45,724
Nadia the russian gymnast.

235
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,123
What?

236
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:51,857
Vince   we're in the middle of two big investigations.

237
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,290
Yeah, tell me about it.

238
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:54,757
It's hard to get people focused on this shindig.

239
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,124
What I mean is that .

240
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:57,457
maybe you should keep the party low-key.

241
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,590
Are you kidding?

242
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,323
I've got a reputation to live up to.

243
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,323
I mean   if my show does not make people vomit

244
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,290
And have an erection at the same time,

245
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,757
Then I've let my audience down.

246
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,990
Strippers   yes. hookers, no.

247
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:09,657
And none of that weird shit that you're into.

248
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,624
Wow. okay sergeant buzzkill.

249
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:12,923
I mean it.

250
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,123
Anything illegal I will arrest you.

251
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,157
Come on. I was just joking.

252
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,390
The party's for opie out there.

253
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,757
A hooker is a terrible thing to waste.

254
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,590
Damn it.

255
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:29,257
I'm never gonna get my deposit back.

256
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,123
Yes, ma'am, your landscaper.

257
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,257
When was the last time you saw him?

258
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:38,023
Okay. do you have any empty structures on your property

259
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,791
Or unoccupied vacation homes in the area?

260
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,557
Right   ma'am   we'll be sure to clear 'em

261
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,973
Just as fast as we can

262
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,357
so you don't have to re-sod your lawn,

263
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,956
You fuckhead.

264
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,357
What's this?

265
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,490
Surveillance report from anton's protective detail.

266
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:57,023
Pretty thorough.

267
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,923
He came over on official business.

268
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,357
Which took all night.

269
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,791
Sarge is gonna see that.

270
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:05,857
I'll tell him the truth that nothing happened.

271
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,956
So you're no longer sleeping with the...

272
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,123
Key witness in this investigation?

273
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:12,123
What's it to you?

274
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:14,624
You're right. it's your shield.

275
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:16,990
If you want people talkin' be my guest.

276
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,524
You've run out of people to transfer me to?

277
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:25,390
Your embassy isn't that big. oyeme...

278
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:28,390
George washington king.

279
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:29,791
No   no   no do not transfer me back--

280
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:30,956
Escucheme--

281
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,123
Homicide.

282
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:35,824
Sarge   line two. says it's urgent.

283
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,290
Sergeant batista.

284
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,524
I'll be right there.

285
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:50,690
Cover for me.

286
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,357
- Is everything okay? - no.

287
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,524
It's all about strategy outmaneuvering the opposition,

288
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:58,923
Bending into your will.

289
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,624
What are you doing in my office, dex?

290
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:09,390
Winning.

291
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,824
Hope you don't mind.

292
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,690
Just keeping my wits sharp while I waited for you.

293
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,390
You, uh, here to grab...

294
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:18,390
Lunch or something?

295
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:19,624
Can't.

296
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:22,956
Gotta get back to the station.

297
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,457
The ellen wolf case is breaking.

298
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,457
Breaking.

299
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,857
Which way?

300
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,390
It seems lieutenant laguerta has a suspect.

301
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:33,923
And who might that be?

302
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:36,457
Some guy who was...

303
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,624
Outside ellen's place round about the time

304
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:40,190
She was gettin' strangled.

305
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,323
Or was she stabbed first? I can't remember.

306
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,123
He couldn't have seen anything.

307
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,490
You sure?

308
00:13:58,023 --> 00:14:01,891
All right. so what do we do?

309
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:04,824
We? ha.

310
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:09,157
We are partners.

311
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,090
Yeah   but see here's the thing, miguel.

312
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:14,590
I don't really want a partner.

313
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:18,056
Hey   I'm not giving up on our friendship, dex.

314
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,956
Hell   i-i'm standing up at your wedding.

315
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,557
Yeah. but after that you go your own way.

316
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,724
And we both go back to who we were

317
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:27,123
Before all of this--

318
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,490
You an honorable ada

319
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:31,023
Dedicated to upholding the law of the land...

320
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:32,056
And you?

321
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,757
A trusty spatter analyst

322
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,590
Who always gets his killer.

323
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,791
In exchange for what?

324
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,190
I'm in a position

325
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,891
To protect the ada's interests in this case.

326
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,123
I'll do what it takes

327
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:51,490
To keep the innocent people of miami safe.

328
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:02,757
And that's what you want?

329
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:07,223
That's what I want.

330
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,857
Game over.

331
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,757
- Barbara gianna?  - in there.

332
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,724
-What do we know?  -not much.

333
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,524
The meds for the pain have her pretty blurry.

334
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,390
Hey   you that   uh   homicide guy she keeps talkin' about?

335
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,857
She talks about me?

336
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,056
She says you snore like a motherfucker.

337
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,223
Hey.

338
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:50,791
Hey, yourself.

339
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,123
How you doing?

340
00:15:56,157 --> 00:16:01,724
I feel like I got a buick parked on my head.

341
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,223
Wasn't raped...if that's what you were thinking.

342
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:05,857
I just got beat on a little.

343
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:08,857
By who? any ideas?

344
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,223
Best I can tell...

345
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:14,657
Some would-be john saw me on the stroll.

346
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,956
Asshole followed me home.

347
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,690
So you got a look at him.

348
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:19,956
Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,357
Tall   blond good looking.

350
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,323
Strong.

351
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,257
My weapon was in my purse.

352
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,956
All I had were my keys.

353
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,923
Got my licks in.

354
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:37,290
He'll be a little...

355
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:39,923
Less handsome tomorrow.

356
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,990
You did good.

357
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,323
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:51,824
Hell, yeah, I'm here.

359
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:55,023
You're not gonna go through this alone.

360
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,424
And   uh just for the record...

361
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,956
I don't snore like a motherfucker.

362
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,757
Excuse me...we need to get

363
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,457
Detective gianna upstairs for a cat scan,

364
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,023
See if we can release her.

365
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:10,190
Release her?

366
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,757
I'm not that bad angel.

367
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,457
Of course you're not.

368
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,824
I'll talk to you later, okay?

369
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:35,824
Detective gianna thinks she got

370
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,323
A piece of the assailant with these.

371
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,157
You're looking for a blonde guy, tall.

372
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,490
Could be a john.

373
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,624
Maybe one of your other decoys might have seen him.

374
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:48,323
We're all over this. thanks, sergeant.

375
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:50,956
Get this down to the lab fast.

376
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:01,223
Angel.

377
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,090
What can I do you for?

378
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,223
I   uh   need you to test this for blood.

379
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:07,524
If it comes back positive,

380
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,056
Run it through the criminal database.

381
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,857
No prob.

382
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,590
Might take a day or two for sequencing.

383
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,857
Uh, grease it.

384
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,323
I mean   it's... it's a priority.

385
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:17,323
Sure.

386
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,524
Thanks.

387
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,056
Is this ellen wolf or the skinner?

388
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,424
There's no case number. uh, it's...

389
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:25,724
It's more of... an internal thing.

390
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,090
You know? my eyes only.

391
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,090
Your eyes only.

392
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,420
Thanks.

393
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,150
I'm not hiding anything. I swear.

394
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,790
You were coming on to ellen.

395
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,090
I was there.

396
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,690
She came on to me.

397
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,290
I flirted back.

398
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,920
It's part of the job you know?

399
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,120
How you earn tips.

400
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,890
She left me 20 on a $30 tab.

401
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,850
You figured there was more where that came from.

402
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,290
You called her again

403
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,750
At 11:10 p.m. then at 3:01 and 3:08 a.m.

404
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,050
That's pretty late to be calling someone you just met.

405
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,920
I called on my break.

406
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,590
I told her I didn't get off work till after 2:00.

407
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,450
She said to come over anyway.

408
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,220
And then I called again

409
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,690
To tell her I wasn't going to make it.

410
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,890
She didn't answer.

411
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,950
I called one more time just in case.

412
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,750
No one picked up.

413
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,090
For someone so innocent he sure looks guilty.

414
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,650
Looks like a killer to me.

415
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,420
He's not.

416
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,090
Well, but he could be.

417
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,950
You wanna know what I think happened?

418
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,120
I think that you showed up at her house unannounced,

419
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,420
Looking for sex.

420
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,650
She wouldn't give it up and you lost your temper.

421
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,620
That's not what happened.

422
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,920
And then you called twice

423
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,690
To make it look like you thought she was still alive.

424
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,190
That's crazy. you're not listening to me.

425
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,790
Any priors?

426
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,820
You seem to have a problem with the word innocent.

427
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,820
No one's gettin' framed for this.

428
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,090
Hey, your ball game.

429
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,320
Why are you here?

430
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,920
Curiosity.

431
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,620
You can't blame me can you?

432
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,220
So you didn't go over to her house?

433
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,550
No.

434
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,820
I went home.

435
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,150
You're fucking lying, toby.

436
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,650
These two calls were routed through a cell phone tower

437
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,450
A block away from her house.

438
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,450
You were there--

439
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,490
All right!

440
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,920
I have a fiancee...

441
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,920
Who's not gonna like hearing about a booty call.

442
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,950
So you went there. she changed her mind.

443
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,120
You got angry-- no. no!

444
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,290
I mean   yes I went to her place,

445
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,620
But she didn't answer the door.

446
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,250
So I called--twice.

447
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,150
I figured she fell asleep.

448
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,590
I went home. I swear to god.

449
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,490
- Not much of a suspect. - not much of a witness.

450
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,650
Lieutenant do you have a second?

451
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,620
Hmm. new development.

452
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,120
Never know what'll pop up.

453
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,620
Well...i'll know.

454
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,790
I'll keep you posted as promised.

455
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,650
You're a good friend to have.

456
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,220
I'm just gonna stay here.

457
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,790
My curiosity's piqued.

458
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,020
He's lying through his teeth.

459
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,150
We can put him at the scene.

460
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,390
He's   uh not our guy.

461
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,850
The fuck he's not.

462
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,890
Four people put him at the bar all night long.

463
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,890
And there's security camera footage of him closing out

464
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,620
When the vic went down.

465
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,920
The vic's name is ellen and he was there.

466
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,120
He's our guy.

467
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,950
The time code on the tape checks out.

468
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm sorry, lieutenant.

469
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,190
You were there at 3:00 in the morning.

470
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,320
Did you see anyone else on the street?

471
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,520
No. it was dead.

472
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,190
No unusual activity?

473
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,120
There was some douche bag with his high beams on.

474
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,490
Blinding me.

475
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,990
So someone was on the street.

476
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,650
He was coming the other direction when I pulled up.

477
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,990
Actually it wasn't high beams.

478
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,790
It was those... big ass halogens.

479
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,190
What kinda car?

480
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,590
Suv.

481
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,550
Dark. blue.

482
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,550
Black-- i-i-i don't know!

483
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,220
Something like that.

484
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,150
I am indeed a good friend to have.

485
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,950
And one can never have too many friends, right?

486
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,290
My friend miguel isn't giving up without a fight.

487
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,750
He'll do whatever's necessary to regain the upper hand.

488
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,720
If he controls laguerta he controls the investigation,

489
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,890
And my leverage disappears.

490
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,890
But she's a tough sell. he won't get far.

491
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,650
I hope.

492
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,650
You...

493
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,250
Are so...

494
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,790
Beautiful!

495
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,950
All right.

496
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,320
Now   you come over here and admire yourself

497
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,620
While nina checks the fit.

498
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,590
I feel like cinderella.

499
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,650
Except for the whole disney virgin thing.

500
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,620
Oh, don't worry.

501
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,250
No one'll know prince charming knocked ya up before the ball.

502
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,020
Hey, syl, are you okay?

503
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,090
Yeah. I was just remembering my wedding day.

504
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,320
I was never happier.

505
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,190
It's supposed to get even better over time.

506
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,690
Sweetie   your marriage will, I'm sure of it.

507
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,620
Things still aren't great with miguel?

508
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,320
Well   we're working on it.

509
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,350
At least I am.

510
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,820
And what's he doing?

511
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,390
Wish I knew.

512
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,650
Do you...really?

513
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,890
What the hell are you doing in here?

514
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,750
Forensics?

515
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,050
On which case?

516
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,520
The new bean counter is questioning this lab request.

517
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,150
What is this key that you're testing?

518
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,650
It's, uh...

519
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,950
It's for an investigation.

520
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,690
Then put an active case number on it, okay?

521
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,120
With all these budget cuts,

522
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,590
They're flagging everything and coming straight to me

523
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,690
With all this bullshit

524
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,190
Which I really don't need right now, dexter.

525
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,390
I don't need it.

526
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,990
Okay. I'll straighten it out.

527
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,420
I'm sorry.

528
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,950
I just--

529
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,550
No. I'll take care of it.

530
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,520
She's ripe for the picking and miguel knows it.

531
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,390
He'll use her to protect himself.

532
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,120
And there goes my leverage.

533
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,790
Better keep an eye on her.

534
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,720
No   no   no   no. y-you can't cancel.

535
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,220
The party's in two days.

536
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,650
You're sorry?

537
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,590
Well   you can take your sorry and shove it up your ass!

538
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,290
Fuck!

539
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,320
The erotic clowns just cancelled.

540
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,920
Why is this wedding happening to me?

541
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,120
Bro   let me help ya out.

542
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,090
I've been the best man

543
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,850
At more weddings than I can count.

544
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,250
Never a groom thank christ,

545
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,950
But I've planned a ton of these.

546
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,250
"platinum enterprises"?

547
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,820
It's a full-service operation,

548
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,990
Party boat   food alcohol.

549
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,890
One phone call and you're done.

550
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,890
Ask for tammy.

551
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,650
God bless you joseph quinn.

552
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,390
Hey. he lives.

553
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,490
Hey, man.

554
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,150
Good to see you up and moving, man.

555
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,650
Thanks   thanks   um... morgan, she here?

556
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,820
Ah, no, she's out.

557
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,290
Running down a file

558
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,690
On the bastard who did this to you.

559
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,350
- We're gonna find him anton, I swear. - yeah, I know.

560
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,850
Hey, I just wanted to say

561
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,990
I never meant for any of this to go down

562
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,920
The way it did, you know?

563
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,320
You didn't sign up for this.

564
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,690
Hey   listen   I was the idiot who got busted

565
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
In the first place right? so...

566
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,990
It's kind of on me.

567
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Yeah   but it was me thinking I was doing you a favor

568
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,850
Keeping you off the books.

569
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,920
Should have told you you were free and clear.

570
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,420
I messed up.

571
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,520
I wanted to apologize to your face.

572
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,520
Deb told me that was a clerical error.

573
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,220
That was you?

574
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,220
Yeah. I assumed she told you.

575
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,250
You lying son of a bitch!

576
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,190
You almost got me killed!

577
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,190
Shit!

578
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,250
It's all right. let him go.

579
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,350
What the hell is this?

580
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,620
Ramos   let him go. let him go!

581
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,920
This shit ain't over, man.

582
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:43,457
Anton...

583
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:46,424
You okay?

584
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:47,457
Yeah.

585
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,690
Anton, stop.

586
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:54,223
Goddamn it will you just stop?

587
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:55,624
His punk ass deserved it!

588
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,223
You can't just walk into a police station and punch a cop!

589
00:26:58,257 --> 00:26:59,524
Here you are standin' up for him.

590
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:02,624
- I am not the enemy here. - debra, you lied to me!

591
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,457
Clerical error, my ass.

592
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,023
Quinn kept me As his c.i. bitch

593
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,923
When I could have walked away at any time.

594
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,390
You're right, I lied.

595
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:13,056
But telling you wasn't gonna change what he did.

596
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,223
I almost died because of that prick.

597
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:17,557
Without that prick we wouldn't have found you.

598
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,190
You're lucky if he doesn't press charges.

599
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,690
What? let him!

600
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,557
I'll sue this whole fucking department!

601
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,590
Don't talk like that.

602
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:27,557
I'll talk to quinn.

603
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:29,857
Really.

604
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:33,323
Are you sure you're not afraid

605
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,357
He might find out we're sleeping together

606
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,657
And tell everyone?

607
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,557
He already knows and he hasn't told anyone.

608
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,090
And where the hell did that come from?

609
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:44,424
From your brother's surprised face when he met me, debra.

610
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:46,424
From your boot on my butt

611
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,690
Kicking me out the door this morning.

612
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:49,490
Are you serious?

613
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:51,424
I am this close to getting my shield,

614
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,056
And I'm putting it all at risk to be with you!

615
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,357
Then debra, why are you?

616
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,157
You feel guilty?

617
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:01,690
You feel responsible for what happened to me?

618
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,090
Shit. you're bleeding.

619
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,223
You're gonna need new stitches.

620
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,457
Debra, I tell you what I'm gonna need.

621
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,590
I need for you to seriously...

622
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:24,056
Think about this.

623
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,090
Think about us.

624
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,257
No, no, para mi, no.

625
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,123
I think I've had enough.

626
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:47,424
Wine...invented for the sole purpose Of handling grief.

627
00:28:48,824 --> 00:28:51,724
Believe me, I know.

628
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:54,757
When oscar died I drowned my share of sorrow.

629
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,023
I know how you feel. you miss her.

630
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,690
Just...just...

631
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:07,257
Last thursday, I was having drinks with her.

632
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,824
And then the next day,

633
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:13,090
I'm staring down at her dead body.

634
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:17,123
If you're gonna end up in a grave,

635
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:18,690
It should at least be your own.

636
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,457
And so the only thing you got to go on right now

637
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,757
Is that suv, huh?

638
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,624
We're checking every Intersection surveillance camera

639
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:27,357
From ellen's place to the cemetery.

640
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,923
Good. good.

641
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,123
Thorough.

642
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:38,791
See, she's lucky to have you watchin' out for her.

643
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:43,157
It's just like you watched out for me with oscar's case.

644
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,457
Some good that did.

645
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,824
Hey, maria, come on.

646
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:50,390
You helped me.

647
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,023
You helped me.

648
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:56,990
You've always been important to me.

649
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:58,490
You know that.

650
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,490
You remember that weekend when we took oscar with us

651
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,490
To the keys?

652
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:07,990
I kept telling him "i am not sharing...

653
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:11,524
The hottest girl in florida with my baby brother."

654
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:14,223
And then you talked me into letting him come.

655
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:16,123
He was so cute.

656
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,157
Those skinny little legs. mm-hmm.

657
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,524
Up until that weekend,

658
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:23,690
He was always my annoying kid brother, you know?

659
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,857
Always in the way.

660
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,557
And then when he was taken from me,

661
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,357
I kept on thinking back to that weekend...you know?

662
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,190
'cause that's the way I wanna remember him,

663
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,956
Like you said.

664
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,657
You know before all the drugs

665
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,657
And all the run-ins with the cops and all that.

666
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:45,457
That little boy with the skinny legs,

667
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,757
My brother.

668
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:51,690
Sorry.

669
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:58,690
I wouldn't have had that memory if it wasn't for you.

670
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:01,891
Seriously.

671
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,524
Thank you.

672
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:06,791
Gracias.

673
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,157
I miss that.

674
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:45,791
Oh, man, I don't know what came over me.

675
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:48,190
It's okay. it's okay.

676
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,223
Hey, lieutenant,

677
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:58,157
I am sorry to show up unannounced.

678
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,457
I know it's late,

679
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,891
But I feel so bad about that case number screw up,

680
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:02,490
And I just wanted to--

681
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:03,724
Miguel.

682
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,090
- I'm interrupting  - no, we're just, um...

683
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,190
- Casework. - talking casework.

684
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,857
If this was so urgent, dexter you could have called me.

685
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,857
I know, I'm sorry. it's just...

686
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,824
I feel bad and this is too important.

687
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:21,490
The key I tested came from a colleague In monroe county.

688
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,157
His department doesn't have our resources,

689
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,690
And I did him a favor.

690
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:28,257
I'm sorry. I know how you value the truth.

691
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,824
Look, don't worry about it.

692
00:32:30,857 --> 00:32:32,190
Just let me know next time.

693
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,857
Okay.

694
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:35,323
And call first.

695
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:38,390
Again, I'm... sorry to interrupt.

696
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,056
I couldn't let laguerta become miguel's collateral damage.

697
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,290
I need to keep his focus on me.

698
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:57,657
After tonight I have his full attention.

699
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:04,457
Hey, there.

700
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,424
Please don't hate me,

701
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:09,390
But i-i may have done a bad thing.

702
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:10,990
Do I need to sit down?

703
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,824
I told sylvia about miguel and laguerta.

704
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:15,590
I'm gonna sit down.

705
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:17,090
I was trying on my dress.

706
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,590
We were talking about the wedding.

707
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:19,857
She seemed so sad.

708
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:21,223
I mean, I had to say something, didn't i?

709
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:23,290
I suppose you did.

710
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:25,323
So she called miguel's office and his assistant said

711
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:27,000
That he was meeting with lieutenant laguerta,

712
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:28,557
But then syl checked with your precinct,

713
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,757
And neither of them is there.

714
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,757
So...she thinks miguel is at laguerta's?

715
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,824
What do you think she's gonna do?

716
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:47,956
I'll call you tomorrow hmm?

717
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,424
About the case?

718
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:51,390
Sure. at the office.

719
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:52,923
Maria...

720
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:55,457
You fucker!

721
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,000
You are too good a liar, miguel.

722
00:33:58,023 --> 00:33:59,357
Syl, what are you doing here?

723
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,123
I don't know when you're telling the truth anymore.

724
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:02,824
You say you're at work. I believe you.

725
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:05,390
You say you're not having an affair. I believe you.

726
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,323
Syl, nothing happened here, okay?

727
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:09,557
I swear to you. you swore to me last thursday...

728
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,957
When you were out all night.

729
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,957
You swore to me you weren't with another woman.

730
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:16,257
But now I think you were here.

731
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,257
- Wait. last thursday he was not  - you...

732
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:23,924
You'll probably be a lot better

733
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:26,156
At seeing through his bullshit than I was,

734
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,357
Being a detective and all.

735
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,824
Good luck. syl, come on, ven.

736
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:31,524
Don't touch me. I'm done!

737
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:33,891
Syl.

738
00:34:33,924 --> 00:34:35,557
Get out of my life!

739
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,891
She--she's got it all wrong.

740
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:57,257
I'll straighten it out. all right?

741
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:25,990
Hey, francisco!

742
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,691
What'll it be today, mr. morgan?

743
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,157
I said you'd take the usual.

744
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:40,057
You're a creature... of habit.

745
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,057
Come on, take a seat. while you wait.

746
00:35:51,723 --> 00:35:55,224
Kind of a bitch move there, man.

747
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:57,090
Sending my wife over to maria's.

748
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:59,324
Surprisingly it wasn't me.

749
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,691
Sure.

750
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:03,390
You wouldn't play games with a man's family,

751
00:36:03,424 --> 00:36:05,524
Or, uh...

752
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,723
Cause pain to an innocent woman.

753
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:12,557
Neither would i.

754
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:14,591
That's why I wanted to give you a heads up

755
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:16,023
That my office is thinking about doing

756
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:18,490
A little ethics probe on your sister.

757
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:21,524
Cops don't come any cleaner than deb.

758
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:22,723
Yeah, huh?

759
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:24,756
Like, uh, sleeping with a c.i.?

760
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,424
'cause it's all here in this surveillance report

761
00:36:27,457 --> 00:36:29,157
For what's-his-name.

762
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,591
I got it right here.

763
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,424
"anton briggs."

764
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,591
Now, mi'jito this don't look so good.

765
00:36:37,624 --> 00:36:39,424
Pero...

766
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:42,123
I'm gonna keep a close eye on it...

767
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:43,823
Just like you're gonna keep a close eye

768
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:46,723
On ellen's case for me.

769
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:49,057
And any other favor I might have.

770
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,457
The usual, mr. morgan.

771
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:55,624
Here.

772
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,290
It's a copy.

773
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:01,090
'cause after all...

774
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:03,957
Familia is sacred.

775
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,090
Right?

776
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,123
He has no idea what door he just opened.

777
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,157
Mr. dexter.

778
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,557
Hey, norma.

779
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:17,790
The prados they're not home.

780
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,023
That's what I was hoping.

781
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:20,357
Did you know that miguel

782
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,090
Is gonna be best man for my wedding?

783
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,057
Yeah. I heard him talking about it with mrs. sylvia.

784
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,457
Well   the groom is supposed to buy his best man a gift.

785
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,224
And I know how much miguel loves garcia marquez,

786
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,424
So I thought I'd pick up

787
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,457
A limited edition of one of his books.

788
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,324
He would like that very much.

789
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:38,157
Do you think it'd be all right if I looked in miguel's den

790
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,324
Just to see what he already has?

791
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,691
Our secret?

792
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:43,990
Okay.

793
00:37:44,023 --> 00:37:45,490
Come in.

794
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,790
I'll be out in a jiffy.

795
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:51,957
Okay.

796
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:08,190
Miguel stepped over a line and he'll keep stepping

797
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:10,624
Until I have something he can't top,

798
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:12,357
Something that could put him in jail,

799
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,490
If and when I want him there.

800
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,324
That's the only way he'll back off.

801
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:26,856
I know miguel killed ellen wolf.

802
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,923
And I know he took one of her rings as a trophy.

803
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,390
The question is where did he hide it?

804
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:44,890
Somewhere no one else would ever look.

805
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,257
Unless...

806
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,257
Unless they're me.

807
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,557
No more games.

808
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:28,856
Hi. are you vince?

809
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,457
Yeah...

810
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,157
I'm tammy okama. platinum enterprises.

811
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,190
May I sit?

812
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:35,457
Yeah, sure.

813
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,890
You're tammy?

814
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,657
I was expecting someone...

815
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:45,324
- Trashy? - yeah.

816
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:47,290
That's sweet.

817
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:49,990
So! we are planning a bachelor party.

818
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:51,490
Yeah   but   uh keep it down,

819
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:53,424
Because party boy's in the next room.

820
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,324
We have any number of themes you can choose from.

821
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,823
What's your favorite?

822
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:05,591
Mm. I'd stick with a nautical theme.

823
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:07,923
Riverboat casino. pirates in petticoats.

824
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:09,557
Nautical's good.

825
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:13,257
Mm-hmm. you have such nice eyes, vince.

826
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,123
Hey   dex   I got your message.

827
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:25,823
Did you get a dna match on that key?

828
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,990
Uh, seems so.

829
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:29,823
Thank you.

830
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:31,490
I mean it.

831
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,823
So where's the report?

832
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:41,591
If angel wants to kill this guy that's his business.

833
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:42,923
I'm done getting involved with friends.

834
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:45,723
I heard   uh   laguerta gave you shit for this.

835
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:47,157
It's all right.

836
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,957
But i-i knew that I could trust you.

837
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,357
Don't get involved.

838
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:53,790
I heard about detective gianna.

839
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:54,990
How is she?

840
00:40:55,023 --> 00:40:57,023
What are you doing?

841
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:58,823
Okay. no concussion.

842
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,190
Dex, the--the file.

843
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:08,324
I know how hard it must have been

844
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:09,756
To see her like that.

845
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,624
I know what it is to...

846
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:15,624
Wanna rebalance an unbalanced world.

847
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:17,524
But it's just...

848
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,357
Unbalanced   angel and that's it.

849
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:25,823
Some doors should stay shut.

850
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:31,190
You open it   it's too easy to walk through it a second time.

851
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:33,957
I've seen it before. recently, even.

852
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,691
I'll keep it in mind.

853
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:46,190
Thanks, dex.

854
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:51,290
Well   at least I didn't teach him

855
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:52,557
How to get away with murder.

856
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:54,190
I'm learning.

857
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:05,657
Thought you said

858
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,923
You'd be gone by the time I got back.

859
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:11,524
I'm just getting some work stuff here.

860
00:42:11,557 --> 00:42:13,957
Just make sure you get everything.

861
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,591
I don't want you using it as an excuse to come back.

862
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:18,490
Syl, look, i--

863
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:21,691
Damn it!

864
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:01,190
Please, sir,

865
00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:03,624
This stain just wouldn't come out.

866
00:43:03,657 --> 00:43:06,723
You know   once blood sets it's really hard to get out,

867
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:07,890
So no charge.

868
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,557
Devon parks?

869
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:42,457
Hey, deb,

870
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,424
I wanted to talk to you about the thing you got going

871
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,424
With your c.i.

872
00:43:47,457 --> 00:43:49,023
Well, he's not a c.i.

873
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:51,290
And we don't have anything going, not anymore.

874
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:52,957
Well that settles that.

875
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,957
Only a retard would have gotten involved with anton

876
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,190
In the first place.

877
00:43:56,224 --> 00:43:57,190
I don't know.

878
00:43:57,224 --> 00:43:59,090
He seemed like a nice enough guy.

879
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:01,591
You seemed to like him.

880
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:05,157
When he went missing all I could think was,

881
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,624
"please   god don't let him be dead."

882
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:08,923
And then I get him back,

883
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:11,190
And all I can think is...

884
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:13,624
How wrong he is for me.

885
00:44:13,657 --> 00:44:17,357
You know   like... how bad it makes me look.

886
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,557
Doesn't matter that he makes me happy

887
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,856
Or he makes me feel how you're supposed to feel

888
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,023
When you're with the right person.

889
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:26,657
Is that crazy?

890
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:31,357
I got nothin'.

891
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,023
God.

892
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:38,856
You are useless.

893
00:44:40,357 --> 00:44:42,557
Love you anyway.

894
00:45:12,756 --> 00:45:14,324
Think this is funny?

895
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:15,357
Not at all.

896
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,923
They said that stain would come out!

897
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:18,691
Fuck you!

898
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:20,090
I didn't get to where I am,

899
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:22,524
Who I am by letting some little gusano like you

900
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,457
Walk all over me!

901
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,324
- Where's my ring? - it's not your ring. it's ellen's.

902
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,723
But you did leave a nice, clean print on it.

903
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:32,490
Oh   there's plenty of blood on your hands too!

904
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:34,823
Ethan turner clemson galt.

905
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:36,691
All deserving...

906
00:45:36,723 --> 00:45:38,457
With nothing to tie me to their deaths

907
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,123
And no bodies to prove that they're even dead.

908
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:42,657
Maybe in a court of law.

909
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:44,790
But how's that little bride of yours gonna feel

910
00:45:44,823 --> 00:45:46,756
When she has to start answering some questions?

911
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,157
'cause she's gotta wonder where you go,

912
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,324
What you do, who you really are.

913
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,823
She knows everything she needs to,

914
00:45:52,856 --> 00:45:54,557
And it's gonna stay that way

915
00:45:54,591 --> 00:45:57,324
Or that ring might show up someplace very inconvenient.

916
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:59,591
I am the last person you wanna fuck with,

917
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,823
Because I will fuck you back

918
00:46:01,856 --> 00:46:04,790
In ways you never even imagined!

919
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,023
An anonymous tip couple of search warrants.

920
00:46:10,057 --> 00:46:13,090
Hmm? who knows what the police might find in your apartment

921
00:46:13,123 --> 00:46:14,424
Or in that little boat of yours.

922
00:46:14,457 --> 00:46:15,756
You got the ring.

923
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,157
I got city fucking hall!

924
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,357
Wow. I didn't get it before, miguel,

925
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,790
But you can't be reasoned with guilted, controlled.

926
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,624
This whole back and forth game for leverage is pointless.

927
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:28,723
That's right!

928
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:31,023
I'll do what I want when I want

929
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:33,524
To whomever I want-- count on it!

930
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:36,357
I will.

931
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:45,057
Thank you.

932
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,624
Harry was right. he's always been right.

933
00:47:00,657 --> 00:47:03,890
There are the innocent and there are the deserving.

934
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:06,390
Have barbara gianna i.d. this guy.

935
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,323
Some doors should stay closed.

936
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:12,490
Some people can understand that.

937
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,490
Harry also said it's all about choices.

938
00:47:19,824 --> 00:47:21,824
Good and bad.

939
00:47:33,857 --> 00:47:37,290
My search for connection always ends in blood.

940
00:47:42,824 --> 00:47:45,091
You get a good look at him?

941
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:47,256
Yes.

942
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,857
How do I know this is not a trap?

943
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,190
Oye. if I wanted you in jail,

944
00:47:52,223 --> 00:47:54,824
I wouldn't have let you loose in the first place, okay?

945
00:47:54,857 --> 00:47:59,423
You believe this man knows where freebo is?

946
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,390
He's the only one who does

947
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:03,190
His name?

948
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:07,557
Dexter morgan.

949
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,390
You want freebo,

950
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:11,357
You want your money...

951
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,223
Then you need to have a long conversation

952
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:18,390
With him.

953
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,924
Even harry would agree miguel has left me no other choice.

954
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:28,457
As challenging as it will be it's back to option one.

955
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,256
I kill him.
