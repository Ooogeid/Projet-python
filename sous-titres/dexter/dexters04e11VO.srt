Sync by honeybunny

2
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:47,454
<i>- previously on dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,406
- lundy misread the pattern.

4
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,108
- it's not three victims
he leaves behind.

5
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:53,543
It's four.

6
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:54,878
Oh, my god.

7
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:57,380
The boys begin the cycle.

8
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:59,215
- we broke up.
officially.

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,800
- i find out this is bullshit,

10
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:01,918
There will be consequences.

11
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:06,756
Severe, career-ending
consequences.

12
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,924
- i'm married.

13
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:08,925
- we have this connection.

14
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,428
- i have dexter.

15
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:13,179
- hey!

16
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,264
Kyle butler.

17
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:15,265
- remembered my name.

18
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,733
- oh, i'm like an elephant.

19
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,351
I never forget.

20
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:20,403
- you sure got
to the crime scene fast.

21
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:22,522
- there's no traffic
at 5:00 a.m.

22
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:25,074
- but dispatch didn't
put out the call till 5:05.

23
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,977
You were the first reporter
on scene at 5:20.

24
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,980
I'm telling you she knows more
than she's letting on.

25
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:33,500
- suspicious,
but it doesn't prove a thing.

26
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:35,084
- how's this
for outside the box?

27
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,986
Christine's the same
height as the shooter.

28
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:39,122
- you out of your fuckin' mind?

29
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,007
No way christine
had anything to do

30
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,325
With shooting you or lundy!

31
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,327
- you've been dating her
for, what, two months?

32
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:45,712
How well do you even
fuckin' know her?

33
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:47,380
- the dna results
on christine hill are back.

34
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,682
- she's fucking related
to trinity.

35
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,667
- i went back and i looked
through all the postcards

36
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:53,269
You sent me over the years.

37
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:57,307
Every trip you took--
in every city you went,

38
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:58,691
A woman died in a bathtub.

39
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,310
- i don't know
what you're talking about.

40
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,677
- it's all right.

41
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,480
I protected you.

42
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,950
That fbi agent, lundy,
i shot him.

43
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,902
- you what?

44
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:15,625
- no!

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,275
- i'm gonna ask you again.

46
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:35,011
How are you related
to the trinity killer?

47
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,046
- and i'm gonna
tell you again.

48
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,147
I don't know.

49
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:40,550
- your dna matches his.

50
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,769
- i don't know
anything about that.

51
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,055
- which raises
one huge question--

52
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,525
Who are you?

53
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,610
- who are any of us,
really?

54
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:52,695
We all have our public life,

55
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:55,248
Our private life...

56
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,399
- and your secret life.

57
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,202
The one that defines you.

58
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,837
- your mother

59
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,339
Is listed as lorraine hill.

60
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:04,924
Where is she?

61
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,209
- dead.

62
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:07,510
Five years now.

63
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:10,713
- your father seems to be...

64
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:15,218
Unknown.

65
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:16,636
Why is that?

66
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,221
- i told you,

67
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,723
My mother got pregnant.

68
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,108
It happens.

69
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:25,094
I never met my father.

70
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,653
- i think you're lying.

71
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:35,572
- so do i.

72
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,708
I think christine
has her own secret life.

73
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,461
She's got to be
arthur's daughter.

74
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:46,282
- because of your relationship
with our department,

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,617
We've been treating you

76
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,552
With the greatest of civility.

77
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:50,920
Please...

78
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,955
Don't let that
hide the fact

79
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:56,559
That you could be
in real trouble here.

80
00:04:56,594 --> 00:05:00,129
Give us a name.

81
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:02,465
- if she says the name
arthur mitchell, then...

82
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,850
- nationwide manhunt.

83
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,235
He's lost to you forever.

84
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,608
- give us a name.

85
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:16,312
- so what will you do?

86
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,698
- he wants a name.

87
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,583
I'll give him a name.

88
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:21,701
- a decoy.

89
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:22,702
- exactly.

90
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:23,836
If i can make the police

91
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:26,589
Think the trinity killer
is someone else,

92
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:29,425
Arthur's all mine.

93
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,432
- you've reached
christine hill.

94
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,334
Please leave a message.

95
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:40,803
- which brings us
to our next story.

96
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,438
In a very happy turn
of events,

97
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,839
Ten-year-old scott smith

98
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,008
Was reunited with his parents
earlier today.

99
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,778
Although police have no leads
as to who abducted the boy

100
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,813
Or how he came to be returned,

101
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,616
His family is simply
happy he's home.

102
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,785
- interesting.

103
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:01,124
- authorities say they will
continue their investigation.

104
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,743
- with all the dna samples
from my sister's sweep,

105
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,194
There should be one bad guy

106
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:09,415
I can cast
in the role of trinity.

107
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,334
But i'm striking out.

108
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,260
- hello.

109
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:23,045
- let me ask you a question.

110
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,847
What kind of a man

111
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:26,933
Witnesses a child abduction

112
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:28,818
And doesn't call the police?

113
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,386
Who are you, kyle?

114
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:33,239
What is it you want?

115
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,613
- money.

116
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:41,864
- money?

117
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,616
Is that
what all this is about?

118
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,368
- i want $50,000,

119
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,902
Or i'll tell the whole world

120
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,071
That arthur mitchell,
family man,

121
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,708
Schoolteacher,
church deacon,

122
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:53,209
Is a pedophile.

123
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:55,178
- i am most certainly not
a pedophile.

124
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,879
- 50,000.
right now.

125
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:57,930
- i'm a schoolteacher.

126
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,348
I don't have
that kind of money.

127
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:00,466
- take a loan
out on your house.

128
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,084
Sell your car.
i really don't care.

129
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,020
I want the money today.

130
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,805
- that's not possible.

131
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,524
I'm not even in miami.

132
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,309
- where are you?

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,114
- well, i'm not gonna
tell you that, am i, kyle?

134
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,199
- it doesn't matter.

135
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,202
You have 24 hours
to get me the money.

136
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:23,372
- i'll, uh--
i'll be in touch.

137
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,446
- but i don't know anything.

138
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:33,949
- you know about
morgan and lundy's shooting.

139
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,336
More than you should.

140
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:42,625
And you share trinity's dna.

141
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:44,560
I can play this game

142
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,013
All day long.

143
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:48,564
But you're in here

144
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,602
Until you tell us
what we need to know.

145
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,438
- you can't do that.

146
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:59,075
You can only hold me
for 48 hours.

147
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:01,611
- if you were under arrest.

148
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:05,147
But we're holding you
as a material witness.

149
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,034
- so you can keep me
as long as you want.

150
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,085
- that's right,

151
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:12,121
So you better start talking,
bitch.

152
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:15,508
- she says
she doesn't know anything.

153
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:16,759
- and, what,
you believe her?

154
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:18,294
I know this sucks for you,

155
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:19,995
But she's in there
because she's involved,

156
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,714
So get your fuckin' head
on straight.

157
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,882
- we don't have any proof.

158
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,350
- come on, quinn.
you're a detective.

159
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:28,020
What does your gut say?

160
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:31,307
- i don't know.

161
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:33,008
- you're too close to this.

162
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,311
- i'm not the only one
too close.

163
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,149
- she say anything yet?

164
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:42,618
- nope.
she won't.

165
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:45,288
- let's hope not.

166
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:46,906
For quinn's sake.

167
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:47,874
- fuck you.

168
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,492
- huh.

169
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,460
And you.

170
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:52,695
Keep me posted.

171
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:54,997
- whoa, where you going,
half day?

172
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,415
- to find a trinity decoy

173
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,801
Before christine
says the magic words.

174
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,504
Lunch with rita, my wife.

175
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:03,973
- sure you are.
- i'm sorry?

176
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:07,476
- where is it
you really go every day?

177
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:08,544
- cut him some slack.

178
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:09,762
His girlfriend's a psycho.

179
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,014
Say hi to rita
and harrison for me.

180
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,684
- will do.

181
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:17,052
- warrant came through
on christine hill's apartment.

182
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,187
Let's get a team over there.

183
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,188
- shit.

184
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:20,489
- great. i'll drive.

185
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:22,191
If she won't talk,
maybe her apartment will.

186
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,110
- i'll ride with you.
- no, absolutely not.

187
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:26,112
You're not searching
your own girlfriend's apartment.

188
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,446
Take batista.

189
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:28,664
- send him my way first.

190
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,782
I want both of you.

191
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,235
In your office. now.

192
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,709
This is security footage

193
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,577
Of a robbery
in coconut grove last night.

194
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,245
Fortunately,
our detectives

195
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:44,680
Were able to i.d.
the suspect

196
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,132
And make an arrest.

197
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,934
But they sent this up to me

198
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:49,752
For a whole other reason.

199
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,187
A half hour before,

200
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:54,557
The security cameras
recorded this.

201
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,732
- chief,
we were off duty, and...

202
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,266
- two of my senior people

203
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,152
Who had signed sworn affidavits
with the department

204
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:07,236
Stating that there was

205
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,821
No romantic involvement
between them.

206
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:10,206
- if you'd just let me
explain--

207
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,374
- there's nothing to explain.

208
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,992
You both lied under oath.

209
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:15,044
You committed perjury,
and that's a felony.

210
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,112
- look, i understand
that we made a mistake,

211
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,382
And if necessary, we're willing
to accept the consequences,

212
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,050
But this is--
- you went back on your word,

213
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:23,786
And then you rubbed
my face in it.

214
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,788
Your board of review hearing
is the day after tomorrow.

215
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:27,673
I suggest
you call your union reps

216
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,893
And start looking
into career alternatives.

217
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:32,895
- wait a se--
hang on.

218
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,931
This isn't the first time

219
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,899
That you and i
have squared off,

220
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,268
So what exactly
is your beef with me?

221
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,270
My gender? my race?

222
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:42,939
What?

223
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,657
- your arrogance.

224
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:00,873
- lundy's trinity books.

225
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,709
- lundy ran down lots
of suspects over the years

226
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,597
Who looked like
they might be trinity.

227
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:10,182
Here.

228
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:13,302
Stan beaudry.

229
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:14,303
- a long-haul trucker

230
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:15,888
Based right here in miami.

231
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:19,675
- travels
all over the country.

232
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:23,312
Arrested for killing
a prostitute with a crowbar,

233
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:25,014
Left her
on the side of the highway.

234
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,516
The chain of custody on
the crowbar was contaminated.

235
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:28,684
They dropped the case.

236
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:32,288
- so he's ours.

237
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,325
- rita.

238
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,005
- hey!

239
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,756
What the fuck?

240
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:52,591
- oh.

241
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,428
I'm sorry, is, uh,
is this your house?

242
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,729
- fuck yeah,
this is my house.

243
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:57,880
- i made a mistake.

244
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:59,265
I thought
it was my friend's place.

245
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,050
- so you're breaking
into your friend's place?

246
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:03,552
- no.
- you were gonna steal my shit.

247
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,941
- i assure you, i was not
going to steal your shit.

248
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:10,493
- uh-uh.

249
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,061
No, you ain't
going anywhere, old man.

250
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,746
All right? i got
your license plate number.

251
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,415
I'm gonna call the cops.

252
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:26,375
- sorry i'm late.
it's just one of those days.

253
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:27,376
- oh, it's okay.

254
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,377
You're here now, so...

255
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,797
- uh, sorry.

256
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,299
It's work. one sec.

257
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,683
- all right.

258
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:37,186
- morgan.

259
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,138
Uh, can it wait?

260
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:40,773
I'm kind of in--

261
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,308
Okay.

262
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:45,594
Yeah, no, i'll be there.

263
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:47,930
- let me guess.
crime scene?

264
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,532
Dexter,
we have an appointment.

265
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,150
- i know, but it's--
it's an emergency.

266
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:54,603
- so is this.
- why?

267
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:55,571
We're doing better.

268
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:57,073
I'm...

269
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:59,875
Being all open, and...

270
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,279
- i kissed elliot.

271
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,498
- what?

272
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:11,003
- well, actually, uh,
he kissed me, mostly.

273
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:13,589
Look,
i was waiting to tell you.

274
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:15,007
In therapy.

275
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:17,059
So let's just go
to our session, so that we--

276
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,260
- no, i told you, i can't.

277
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,845
- dexter, please.

278
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:24,934
- i got to get to work.

279
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:28,971
- 10-4.
this has been reconfirmed.

280
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:30,406
- i came over
to borrow his lawnmower.

281
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,974
I--i saw him
through the window.

282
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,742
The door was unlocked.

283
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:37,029
- bruising around the neck.
our guy was choked.

284
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,448
Hey, uh, how was, uh,

285
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:42,918
Lunch/therapy
with rita?

286
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,370
- fine.

287
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:47,006
Vince, stop reading
my desktop calendar.

288
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,925
Impact marks
here on the floor.

289
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,427
- you can talk to me,
you know.

290
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:55,831
- actually,
multiple impact marks.

291
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,884
Somebody smashed his head
against the floor.

292
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:02,354
- i saw rita kissing another
dude at thanksgiving, okay?

293
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,223
- i know.
she told me.

294
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,641
- oh, thank christ.

295
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:08,144
- we've lived next door
five, six years.

296
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,678
- and what's his name?

297
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:13,899
- kyle.
uh, kyle butler.

298
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,902
- arthur mitchell's in miami,

299
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,737
And he's looking for me.

300
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,043
Another death
of an innocent man

301
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:26,662
That i'm responsible for.

302
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:36,255
- shoes.
and more shoes.

303
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,557
- man,
christine has a lot of shoes.

304
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:42,061
- shoes. shoes.

305
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,212
Shoes.

306
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,481
- not shoes.

307
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:53,272
Des moines,
denver, san francisco.

308
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:56,225
- let me see.

309
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,444
These are all cities
in lundy's books--

310
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:04,416
Where trinity killed.

311
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:05,951
Look how it's signed.

312
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,586
- "love, daddy."

313
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:08,587
Trinity is--

314
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:10,589
- christine's fucking father.

315
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,741
She's been in contact
with him the whole time.

316
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,094
I knew it. i fuckin' knew
something was off with her.

317
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,745
- it still doesn't
give us trinity.

318
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:18,013
- no.

319
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:22,084
But it gives us something
to make the bitch talk.

320
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:56,802
- arthur will come here next,

321
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,138
And i'll be waiting.

322
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,094
Soon as that door closes,
it's over.

323
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,849
What the fuck?

324
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,019
- good night.

325
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,888
- see you later.

326
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,190
- shit.

327
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,979
Fuck.

328
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,619
- not much of a resemblance.

329
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,071
- at least he's not looking
for kyle butler anymore.

330
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:08,824
- san francisco, 1996.

331
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,909
Same cycle.

332
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,045
Girl dies in a bathtub.

333
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,547
A woman jumps off a building.

334
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:19,551
A man gets bludgeoned
outside of a bar.

335
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,220
There were trinity killings

336
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:24,089
In every single one
of these cities.

337
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,645
"wish you were here.

338
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,014
Love, daddy."

339
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:43,442
- i've never
seen those before.

340
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:45,394
You planted them.

341
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:49,081
- are you trying
to piss me off more?

342
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,116
'cause i'm sure
that detective quinn

343
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,420
Will be displeased

344
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:56,622
When he finds out
this is why

345
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:58,841
You cozied up to him,

346
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,759
To keep tabs on daddy.

347
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:02,961
- i didn't.

348
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:04,680
I don't know who my father is.

349
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:08,183
- he is the trinity killer.

350
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:13,105
And he's been sending you
postcards from hell.

351
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,924
You've been drafting on us,

352
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:19,027
And when you heard lundy
was on to your father,

353
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:22,364
You shot him.

354
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,790
I want to talk to my lawyer.

355
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:35,577
- first smart thing
you've said all day.

356
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,578
- she lied.

357
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,414
- fuck yeah, she lied.

358
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,948
Just fucking admit it.

359
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,917
You shot me
and you killed lundy.

360
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,886
- she fucking used me.

361
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,888
And i fell for it.

362
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:48,307
For her.

363
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:50,058
I'm a fuckin' asshole.

364
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,977
- don't--don't do that.

365
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,096
- what?
- beat yourself up like that.

366
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,066
- why the fuck not?

367
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,185
- because i know
where it gets you.

368
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:02,137
I was engaged
to the ice truck killer.

369
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:04,440
Hello.

370
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,640
He cut people up,

371
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:07,025
Drained their blood,

372
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:10,496
Wrapped 'em up like
bloody fuckin' christmas.

373
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,314
Engaged.

374
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:16,368
As in ready to spend
the rest of my life.

375
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,453
- yeah.

376
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,155
- so we can play
who's a bigger asshole,

377
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:23,258
But i guarantee you
i'll win.

378
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:25,127
- we're keeping christine
overnight again.

379
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:27,346
- good.
let her fuckin' rot.

380
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:39,674
- stan beaudry
lives off the grid.

381
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:45,113
A shack
in the middle of nowhere.

382
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:47,649
Lone wolf personified.

383
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:50,285
He's not home.

384
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:54,856
Or is he?

385
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:02,831
- look out for an 18-wheeler

386
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,967
With a tackle box on
the driver's side door--

387
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,813
- where are you,
mr. beaudry?

388
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,439
Making a delivery
in jacksonville,

389
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,907
Due back late tomorrow.

390
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,492
Or if i leave now,

391
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,110
I can be in jacksonville
by midnight,

392
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,830
And cut the time...
and him...in half.

393
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:37,499
- you can't just disappear
all night, dexter.

394
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:41,036
Got to get home
to your family.

395
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,242
- hey.

396
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,378
It's late.

397
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,413
You can't sleep?

398
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:54,416
- i stayed up,
so we could finish our talk.

399
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:56,468
- can it wait?

400
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,587
I have a huge day tomorrow.

401
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:01,356
- no, it can't.

402
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:02,891
- are the two of you--?

403
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:03,976
- no.

404
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,527
No, of course not.

405
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,980
It's just a huge mistake,

406
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,265
And i am so--so sorry.

407
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:11,933
- well, okay then.

408
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:15,787
Apology accepted.

409
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:17,823
- shouldn't we
talk about this?

410
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:21,627
- i thought we just did.

411
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:24,546
- you didn't say anything.

412
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,915
- i'm putting it behind me.

413
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,450
Isn't that
what i'm supposed to do?

414
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:30,168
- i mean, i'm glad,

415
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:32,120
But if i were you,

416
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:36,675
I would be hurt, angry,
disgusted even.

417
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,897
- is that how
you want me to feel?

418
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,650
- no.

419
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:47,636
- well, good.
see?

420
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:51,306
Everything is okay.

421
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:08,457
- you've reached
christine hill.

422
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,376
Please leave a message.

423
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,059
- mom's at work,

424
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,727
Kids are at school,

425
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:29,895
And for all i know,

426
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,113
Trinity's out there doing

427
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:33,281
Exactly what i'm doing
at his house--

428
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:34,516
Prepping for a kill.

429
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,451
- arthur's dna.

430
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:38,987
- if the police search
stan beaudry's house

431
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,238
And find those,

432
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,457
They'll think
he's the trinity killer.

433
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:45,160
- for a while, anyway.

434
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:48,497
- long enough for me
to kill the real trinity.

435
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,918
Morgan.

436
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,537
- dexter,
i need you at the station.

437
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:57,172
- wow. i, um...

438
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,141
Kind of right in the middle
of doing some stuff.

439
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,709
Any chance
masuka can cover for me?

440
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,544
- no chance at all.
be here.

441
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:06,898
Shit.

442
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,184
- you're juggling
too many people, dexter.

443
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:13,355
- i know--arthur, beaudry,

444
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:16,274
Rita, now batista...

445
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,226
- i'm not talking about them.

446
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,028
I mean dexter morgan--

447
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:23,331
Blood tech, husband, father,

448
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:26,334
Serial killer, and now
kyle butler, extortionist?

449
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,503
Which one are you?

450
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:31,906
- all of them.

451
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:38,213
- you still playing "who's
your daddy?" with christine?

452
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:39,264
- i thought she'd come clean

453
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:40,682
After spending
a night in a cell.

454
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:41,683
No such luck.

455
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:42,684
- tell you what.

456
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,918
Before her lawyer gets here,

457
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:46,188
Let me take a shot at her.

458
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:53,278
I thought you might
want to refuel.

459
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:54,362
Breakfast burrito.

460
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,698
- no, i don't eat that shit.

461
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,901
- i figured.
that's for me.

462
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,604
- you put some kind of drug
in there to make me talk?

463
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:06,958
- you watch way too much tv.

464
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:09,995
I get it,
why you did what you did.

465
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:15,917
To protect your dad.

466
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:18,754
I would have done
the same thing.

467
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:21,339
My dad and i were close too.

468
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:28,980
Actually, we weren't.

469
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:30,182
I wanted us to be,

470
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:31,850
But he never noticed.

471
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,736
He was always too busy
with my brother and work.

472
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:35,821
- is that why
you became a cop?

473
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,022
- yes, actually.

474
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:39,441
- hmm.

475
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:41,076
You thought that maybe,

476
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,162
Just maybe, if you became
a cop like him,

477
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:45,814
He'd give you that approval

478
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,415
You'd been so hungry for?

479
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,151
- well,
when you say it like that,

480
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:51,820
It sounds like
a giant cliche.

481
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,489
- that's because it is.

482
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:58,159
I don't want to talk about
your daddy issues, okay?

483
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:00,178
- fine.

484
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:02,163
Let's talk about yours.

485
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,499
- hmm.

486
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,551
Oh, you don't know
anything about me.

487
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,603
- i know you can still do
the right thing.

488
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:15,343
One day, i grew up.

489
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:18,680
And i realized my father
wasn't the end-all,

490
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,899
And it didn't matter
what he thought of me,

491
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,651
Because i realized
i didn't think that much

492
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,953
Of him anymore either.

493
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:33,211
- you think
just because you shared,

494
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:36,665
I'm gonna open up?

495
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:39,701
You watch too much tv.

496
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,041
- how'd it go?

497
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,043
- it didn't.

498
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,512
Now what?

499
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,380
- well, her lawyer's insisting
that we let her go.

500
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,049
- let who go?

501
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,718
- christine.

502
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,687
- well, if she cares enough
about her father

503
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:00,054
To lie for him...

504
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:01,723
- he could be her first stop
if we cut her loose.

505
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:03,024
- lead us right to him.

506
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:04,693
- you take care of this?
i got a meeting.

507
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:10,832
- i'm here.

508
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:13,001
- this is our witness?

509
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,903
- uh, dexter morgan,
say hello to judge belford.

510
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:20,542
- i need you
to sign here and here.

511
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:22,260
And can i see some i.d.?

512
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,800
Well, these are the kind
of life sentences

513
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,302
I like to hand out.

514
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,587
Angel,
you may kiss the bride.

515
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:35,256
- excuse me, dex.

516
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:42,981
- and i'm late
for my tee time.

517
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:44,449
Enjoy your life together.

518
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:46,902
- thank you.
- thank you. thanks.

519
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:49,988
- thank you.

520
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,210
- did you two
just get married?

521
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:58,046
- according to that
piece of paper, we did.

522
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,581
You can be the first
to congratulate us.

523
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,082
<i>- mazel tov.</i>

524
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,951
That's what
i got called in for?

525
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,386
- you're the only one
that knows about us.

526
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,338
- yeah,
so keep it to yourself.

527
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:09,391
- come here.

528
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,263
- patrol just called in.

529
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:16,464
Surveillance

530
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:17,682
On christine hill's apartment.

531
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:22,070
- good. okay. thanks.

532
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:23,405
- shit.

533
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,941
I've got work to do.

534
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:28,193
Beaudry.

535
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:29,361
- breaker 1-9,

536
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:30,829
This is little chopper

537
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:32,914
Heading north
on the 95 big road

538
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:34,315
Just north of miami.

539
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,334
Looking for the 10-20

540
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:39,037
On one stan "the man" beaudry,

541
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:45,593
Driving a black peter car
out of j-town.

542
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:46,878
- uh, copy, little chopper.

543
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,663
Just saw him pulling into
freddy's truck stop

544
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:50,215
Off the 91 exit.

545
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,667
- thank you, driver.

546
00:27:57,523 --> 00:27:58,840
Arthur.

547
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:03,061
- i'm standing in front
of your house, kyle.

548
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:04,279
- what?

549
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:05,680
- i called
the four walls office

550
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,065
For your home address.

551
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:10,618
Seems to be
johnny's jet skis.

552
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:12,704
- they're fun.
you should try one.

553
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,873
- what this tells me
is you've been lying to me

554
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:16,524
From the very beginning.

555
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,376
- well, in the big
scheme of things,

556
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:21,579
Being a liar isn't nearly
as bad as being a pedophile.

557
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,164
- do not call me that!

558
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:25,166
- i want my $50,000.

559
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:27,969
Why should i trust you
to be silent

560
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:29,170
After i've given you
the money?

561
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:30,255
- here's what you can trust.

562
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,723
If you don't meet me
with the money,

563
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,308
I'll call your family,
your school,

564
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:34,759
And then the police.

565
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,594
- give me until tomorrow.

566
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:39,347
<i>- how do i know
i can trust you?</i>

567
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:42,233
- i guess that's just
the world we live in, kyle.

568
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:58,232
? ?

569
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,924
- you don't
let me out of here,

570
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:26,694
I'm gonna
kick your fuckin' ass!

571
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:31,733
Aah! you fuck!

572
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,401
What the fuck are you doing?

573
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:34,953
- normally,
we'd have a little chat.

574
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:37,872
I'd show you
the error of your ways.

575
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,707
But i'm kind of
in a hurry here.

576
00:29:39,742 --> 00:29:42,744
- oh,
i am gonna fuck you up!

577
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,712
- uh-huh.

578
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:46,047
- i'm gonna
rip your heart out!

579
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,883
- yeah, i heard.

580
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,169
- i'm gonna gut you
like a fuckin' pig!

581
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,588
You'll be sorry
that you ever crossed me!

582
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,724
Aah!

583
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:08,236
- i just need to make sure

584
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,905
The police
find arthur's dna.

585
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,028
When they see
this picture of christine,

586
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,531
They'll think
she's beaudry's daughter.

587
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:28,456
Lundy's trinity books.

588
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:41,719
- thanks.

589
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,171
Only be a minute.

590
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:44,172
Mine's dead.

591
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,557
Don't have a land line.

592
00:30:57,703 --> 00:30:58,686
- hello.

593
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:00,455
- daddy.

594
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:01,956
It's me.

595
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,491
I'm sorry i haven't
returned your calls.

596
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:04,492
I've been...

597
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:05,577
- i know where you've been.

598
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:06,961
Don't call me anymore.
you understand?

599
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:08,246
- d-daddy, i just--

600
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:33,554
- it's slightly unbelievable
that beaudry

601
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,323
Would even own a toothbrush,

602
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:37,825
But i'm gonna go for it.

603
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,288
And now, the final
piece of the puzzle.

604
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:56,044
I think i'm done.

605
00:31:56,078 --> 00:32:00,515
Stan beaudry
is now the trinity killer.

606
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,757
Love thy neighbor.

607
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,310
Bullshit.

608
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:19,701
I should leave it alone.

609
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,119
Go inside.

610
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:23,705
Watch the history channel.

611
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:34,448
Hey, elliot.

612
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,885
- dex.

613
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:43,057
- stay the hell away
from my wife.

614
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:45,176
- jesus.
dex...

615
00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:48,462
Aah. wow. okay.

616
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,098
Uh,
i guess i deserved that.

617
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:51,132
Now, now wait.

618
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,300
I know i'm an asshole,

619
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,068
But just wait a minute.

620
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:56,020
I got caught up in a moment.

621
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:57,689
Rita's amazing.

622
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,773
- you think i don't know that?

623
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,158
- and i'm an idiot.

624
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:01,159
And if i were you,

625
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:02,643
I would want
to kill me too.

626
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,446
- don't ever touch her again.

627
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:15,089
- your hand.

628
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:18,092
- you...saw?

629
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:19,594
- i saw.

630
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,551
You're not mad?

631
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:28,436
- no.

632
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,271
I'm not mad.

633
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:34,892
- what are you?

634
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:36,644
- glad.

635
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:39,364
That you cared that much.

636
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,741
Can't believe
you hit him, though.

637
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,326
- i know.
- i didn't see that coming.

638
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,411
- i didn't either.

639
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:10,511
- professional courtesy
dictates

640
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:11,512
We give you a heads up.

641
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:13,547
- mm-hmm.
we're married.

642
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:17,685
- as in man and wife.

643
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,771
- well, i don't see how that
changes the facts of the matter.

644
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,440
- it's certainly gonna change
the context of your accusation.

645
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:24,692
- do you really want to go
in front of the board of review

646
00:34:24,726 --> 00:34:26,778
And attack the sacrament
of holy matrimony?

647
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,663
- the issue here is perjury.

648
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:30,498
- alleging an affair
is one thing,

649
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:31,833
But now
you'd be going after us

650
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:33,451
For embracing the bedrock
of family values.

651
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:35,453
- in heavily catholic,

652
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,405
And heavily latino miami.

653
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,841
- you'll come across
as a soulless,

654
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,043
Anti-family schmuck.

655
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:43,461
- but if that's
what you want to do,

656
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:45,413
We'll take the fight.

657
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:46,514
- it's also worth noting

658
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:47,715
That the chief of police

659
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:48,716
Met his now wife

660
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,717
On the job as well.

661
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:50,751
- you can lecture him

662
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,753
On how he is in violation

663
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:56,307
Of department protocol.

664
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:00,778
- i can only marvel
at the level of cynicism.

665
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:02,864
Using the institution
of marriage

666
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:04,866
As a cheap political ploy.

667
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,567
You must be very
proud of yourselves

668
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:08,569
For being so clever.

669
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:11,572
- you didn't give us
a lot of options.

670
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:12,790
- i hope that
your life together

671
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:15,493
Will not be as empty
and as amoral

672
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:18,413
As your decision
to get married was.

673
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,888
- we did the right thing.

674
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:31,559
- of course we did.

675
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,131
- batista.

676
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:39,434
Okay.

677
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,987
We just got a lead
on the trinity killer.

678
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,022
- according to this,

679
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:47,141
He had a delivery two days ago
in jacksonville,

680
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,077
And due back here last night.

681
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:52,146
- yeah, well,
i'm guessing christine

682
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:53,581
Found a way to warn him off.

683
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:05,543
- well, hello,
mr. toothbrush.

684
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:10,298
- don't forget mr. comb.

685
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:11,716
- oh, yeah.

686
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,268
We've got some dna
going on in here.

687
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,220
- great.

688
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:27,732
- dex,

689
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:29,683
That guy
that was bludgeoned,

690
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,285
You remember
the kind of hammer?

691
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,321
- uh, it was a grant--

692
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:36,290
- 24-ounce framing hammer?

693
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:38,692
- we got him.

694
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,328
- it's a little hard to believe
this is the same guy

695
00:36:40,362 --> 00:36:43,297
That never made a mistake
in 30 years.

696
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:45,383
- ah, i'm sure
he made mistakes.

697
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:49,837
We just weren't looking.

698
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,639
- a truck stop employee

699
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:53,591
Noticed stan beaudry's truck
during the night.

700
00:36:53,642 --> 00:36:55,426
Preliminary investigations

701
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:57,878
Reveals evidence pertinent
to the trinity killings.

702
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,146
At this point,

703
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,932
We're trying to locate
mr. stan beaudry.

704
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:02,767
He's become
our number one suspect.

705
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:04,602
- stan beaudry?

706
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,529
- kyle?
- daddy.

707
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:15,530
- i told you not to call me.

708
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:16,864
- i'm in trouble, daddy.

709
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:18,416
The police are...

710
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,733
- you're putting us
both at risk.

711
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,118
- it isn't safe
for us to talk.

712
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:22,203
- i'm on a neighbor's phone.

713
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:23,204
I would never do anything

714
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:24,205
To put you in danger.

715
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,339
- you already have.

716
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:26,674
You're a stupid girl!

717
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,426
Always getting in the way.

718
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,627
- i was protecting you.

719
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:31,128
- you've ruined everything.

720
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:34,215
- i--i did it
because i love you.

721
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,557
Just, uh...

722
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:44,692
Just, um...

723
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,143
Meet me.

724
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,695
Please.

725
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:48,929
I can get past the cops.

726
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,698
- i don't care.
it's not my problem.

727
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:52,984
- but i need your help.

728
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,268
- you did this to yourself.

729
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:56,070
You're on your own.

730
00:37:56,104 --> 00:38:00,741
- how could you say that?

731
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:01,909
I'm your daughter.

732
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:03,210
- i'm sorry, christine.

733
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:06,447
- i'm sorry too.

734
00:38:06,465 --> 00:38:08,416
- i'm sorry
you were ever born.

735
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,337
- dad...

736
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:17,391
- do not call me again ever.

737
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,266
- no electric, no water.

738
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,635
Can't track him
through his utilities.

739
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:30,304
- well, someone needs
to take a look in here for--

740
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:31,305
- detective morgan?

741
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:32,740
We just got word
that christine hill

742
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:34,475
Would like
to speak with you.

743
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:35,860
Only you.

744
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:37,745
- fuckin' a.
she wants to confess.

745
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,080
- i'm coming with you.
- joey, come on.

746
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:40,081
- i'll stay outside.

747
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:41,248
She won't even know i'm there.

748
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,651
- let's go.

749
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:53,260
- it hasn't been easy,

750
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:54,629
But i was able
to pull together

751
00:38:54,663 --> 00:38:56,297
The funds you are demanding,
kyle.

752
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:58,049
- well, that's good news.

753
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,301
That'll make both our lives
a lot easier.

754
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:03,604
- i'll have the money
at 7:00.

755
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,507
I'll drop it
in the trash container

756
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:08,776
Nearest the lighthouse
at cape florida.

757
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,978
- that location
doesn't work for me, arthur.

758
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:14,014
The palmetto marina
on the miami river.

759
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,350
Leave it at the entrance
to dock c,

760
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:21,656
- you're the boss, kyle.

761
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,074
- glad you understand.

762
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,713
- i'll see you
in 15 minutes,

763
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:31,549
Because i know exactly where
that music is coming from,

764
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,917
And why you're there--

765
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,252
Unfinished business.

766
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,556
- christine,
it's detective morgan.

767
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,708
Open up.

768
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:50,351
- over there.

769
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,900
- is there something
you want to tell me?

770
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,286
- that motherfucker.

771
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:10,921
- who?

772
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:12,373
Quinn? because he had
nothing to do--

773
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:18,129
- no, not quinn.
my dad.

774
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,082
- christine,
you can stop protecting him.

775
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,969
We have his name.

776
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,054
- that's bullshit.

777
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:28,639
- we know he's stan beaudry.

778
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:37,982
- wow.

779
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:41,402
- just tell me where he is.

780
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:45,239
- i tried
to be a good daughter.

781
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,242
You know...

782
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:52,546
Make him love me.

783
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:56,450
But he hates me.

784
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:58,169
- you don't need him
to love you.

785
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,971
- mm-hmm.

786
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:01,972
- he's a killer.

787
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:03,957
- he is. he is.

788
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,926
He's a killer.

789
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,394
- he made his own choices.

790
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:10,147
- and i'm just like him.

791
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:11,148
- you're not.

792
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,184
- i am.

793
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:20,691
- your dad was a cop, right?

794
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:22,810
- mm-hmm.

795
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:26,497
- so you said,
"hey, i'll be a cop too.

796
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,199
Maybe then he'll love me."

797
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:36,624
You know what i did?

798
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:38,659
I shot you.

799
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:44,765
I killed lundy.

800
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,942
- okay.

801
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:57,478
- i'm so sorry.

802
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:07,454
- let's just get you
to the station.

803
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:10,040
- can you forgive me?

804
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,048
- are you kidding me?

805
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:25,706
I came here to do a job.

806
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,207
I came here to take you in

807
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,093
And to get justice for lundy,

808
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:30,761
But forgive you?

809
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:33,597
Fuck you.

810
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:39,103
Let's just get
to the station.

811
00:42:39,154 --> 00:42:40,905
Wait.
no, don't! don't!

812
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:44,692
- what happened?

813
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:46,327
- quinn, don't.

814
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:10,351
- i've searched
the entire fucking arcade.

815
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,436
Where are you, arthur?

816
00:43:15,757 --> 00:43:16,724
Hey, deb.

817
00:43:16,758 --> 00:43:18,025
- where are you?

818
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:19,927
- just taking care
of business.

819
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,362
What's up?

820
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:25,816
- trinity's daughter
just confessed to everything.

821
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:28,569
And then killed herself.

822
00:43:28,603 --> 00:43:31,288
In front of me.

823
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:32,606
- are you okay?

824
00:43:32,624 --> 00:43:35,125
- i'm in one piece.

825
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,461
Could really use
some family right about now,

826
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:38,462
And you're it.

827
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:39,914
- who am i right now?

828
00:43:39,948 --> 00:43:41,548
Dexter morgan, serial killer,

829
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:45,336
Or dexter morgan, brother?

830
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:48,138
I'm on my way.

831
00:44:20,038 --> 00:44:21,755
I need to be
a good brother now

832
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,258
So that i can be
a good serial killer later.

833
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:49,233
- excuse me.

834
00:44:49,284 --> 00:44:52,119
Could you tell me if there's
a kyle butler working here?

835
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:54,021
- sure.

836
00:44:58,693 --> 00:44:59,860
Mm, sorry.

837
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:00,961
There's no one by that name.

838
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:03,864
- my mistake.

839
00:45:09,037 --> 00:45:17,044
? ?

840
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,432
- excuse me, sir.

841
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:24,051
You're good.

842
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:34,061
- hey.

843
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:49,126
- i'm afraid
to erase his name.

844
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:57,768
- why?

845
00:45:57,802 --> 00:46:01,772
- 'cause then
this is all over.

846
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:06,527
- i guess it is.

847
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:08,896
- and frank's still dead.

848
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,398
- yeah. he is.

849
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:20,791
- i mean, i'm not stupid.

850
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:24,912
I knew finding his killer

851
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:27,247
Wouldn't bring him back,
but...

852
00:46:32,954 --> 00:46:36,623
I thought
it would bring something.

853
00:46:45,984 --> 00:46:47,434
- you want me to do it?

854
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:51,905
- yeah.

855
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:59,446
No.

856
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:07,538
I've got it.

857
00:47:54,052 --> 00:47:58,005
<i>- hey, hang tough, hermano.</i>

858
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:54,478
- my, my.

859
00:49:11,212 --> 00:49:14,248
Why, mr. beaudry,

860
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:16,967
You've done me a kindness.

861
00:49:33,985 --> 00:49:37,154
- no.

862
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:04,497
- hello...

863
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:07,050
Dexter morgan.
