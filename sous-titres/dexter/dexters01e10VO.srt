previously on "dexter"...

5
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,130
you still don't remember 
anything from before?

6
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,050
You know,before we took you in?

7
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,410
No.

8
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,020
What are you doing?

9
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,880
I'd like to talk you througha 
deep relaxation technique.

10
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,800
It might bring some things
to the surface.

11
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,840
Mama!

12
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,020
It was a match.

13
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,760
Joe driscollwas your bio-dad.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,420
And this is rudy.

15
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,200
- Dexter.  
- Hey.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,040
I have waited a long time to meet you.

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,780
Why the different nail polishes?

18
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,040
What the hell'sthis guy thinking?

19
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,750
And the real kingis still out there.

20
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,750
Hungry.Ready.

21
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,880
He'll kill again.

22
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,670
It's just a matter of time.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Dex,rudy's different.I feel safe with him.

24
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,490
I think I'm falling for him.

25
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,730
Divorce papers.

26
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,920
Sign them now and I'll agree 
tosupervised visits twice a week.

27
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,080
You think you can really
make me back down?

28
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,040
Are you fucking my wife?

29
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,840
The kids are already 
settled at colleen'S.

30
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,870
You can have your visit
when we get back.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,300
I just wish he'd go away.

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,320
I mean,why can't he just go 
away and disappear forever?

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,060
No.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,600
<i>Seeing Red</i>

35
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,010
Come on,buckaroos. It's monday.

36
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,220
Can't be late monday. 
Throws the whole week off.

37
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,310
What about breakfast?

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,650
Made and eaten.

39
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,700
And the kids' lunches.

40
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,870
Packed and ready to go.

41
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,920
Did you tell the locksmith?

42
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,420
Yeah,new locks on every door,

43
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,060
reinforced strike plates,

44
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,820
seven-pin keyways.

45
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,710
Here you go,buddy.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,140
Why don't you kids go wait in my car?

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

48
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,160
Are you gonna make out?

49
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,420
None of your business.

50
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,370
- Are you?  
- Astor.

51
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,730
Rita,you don't have to do this.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,210
Getting attacked by your 
ex-husband merits a day off.

53
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,380
I'm fine.

54
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,310
I'm not gonna let paul 
control my life anymore.

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,650
Those days are over.

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,100
It's gonna be okay.The 
police have been notified.

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,210
They'll find him.

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,060
What if they don't?

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,440
Oh! I got yousome pepper spray.

60
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,780
Just aim for the eyes.

61
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,480
Hey,you want some? It's 
kirk bliloc's cake.

62
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,480
I had some at kirk's 
birthday,10 days ago.

63
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,530
See,you have lunch every day
with your boyfriend,

64
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,360
you miss a thing or twoaround here.

65
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,780
Cake's still good.It's mocha,I think.

66
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,870
It started out vanilla.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,860
Guys,you shouldlook at this.

68
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,650
Put that thing down,for god's sake.

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,090
It was addressedto homicide.

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
Put it down!

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,360
Jesus,is that blood?

72
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,030
Morgan,get your ass over here.

73
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,870
Ass en route.

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,910
You're the blood expert.
What is this shit?

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,090
It's a little wateryfor jam.

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,750
Maybe you should open it.

77
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,310
What if there'san airborne toxin 
in here waiting to be released?

78
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,200
I got to wash my hands.

79
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,860
So gullible.

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,550
What is it?

81
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,370
Well,it's definitely blood.

82
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,660
Wait,there's somethingin here.

83
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,670
Marina view hotel.

84
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,280
It's a key.

85
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,210
May be some sortof promotional gag.

86
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,540
You know,stay the weekend,
you get a jar of blood.

87
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,220
Show-and-tell's over.

88
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,160
Let's try and find outwho sent this.

89
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,000
Grab batista and get overto that hotel.

90
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,990
Batista's still working on the 
explosion at the smack lab.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,080
Morgan,put the cake down.You're with me.

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,250
A jar of blood -- 
dramatic,cryptic,playful.

93
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,080
Could it be him?

94
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,140
Got an extra keyfrom the manager.

95
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,080
Said the same thingas the front-desk clerk.

96
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,030
The guy who checked into 103
was white and normal-looking.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,410
I haven't seen a single security
camera since we've been here.

98
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,340
It's likely this guyscouted hotels 
and chose onewith lax security.

99
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,420
Better be readyto cancel your lunch.

100
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,780
Police. Open up.

101
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,070
Oh,my god. Jesus.

102
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,820
Get back in your room.

103
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,780
Metro dispatch,this is 3-henry-8-8 
out at the marina view hotel.

104
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,470
I need uniformed backup,forensics.

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,460
Fuck it.Just send everybody out.

106
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,210
It's been a whilesince 
we went prophylactic.

107
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,760
Not me.Last night,I met this chick

108
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,840
I'll stop you right there,vince.

109
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,640
So,they tell you anything
about what's inside?

110
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,500
No one's been inside.Too much blood.

111
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,890
Dexter.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,730
Just a heads-up 
it's bad in there.

113
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,770
- Okay.  
- I'm serious.

114
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,810
She's not kidding.It's 
your wet dream in there.

115
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,150
Okay.

116
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,930
You're going in firstalone.

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,980
Get a sense of what
we're dealing with

118
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,440
and give me a report.

119
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,910
Don't fuck up.

120
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
Now I'm really curious.

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,360
He's been gone so long,

122
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,620
he had to be planning 
a splashy return,

123
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,250
but a crime scene just for me?

124
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,800
Mommy!

125
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,930
Tell me youfound something,morgan.

126
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,620
I talked to the guestsin room 105.

127
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,030
They didn't see anyonego in or out.

128
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,020
What about across the hall?

129
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,320
German tourists. They got 
their headup their lederhosen.

130
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,440
They said they hearda whirring sound

131
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,400
but thought someone was mixing
margaritas or vacuuming.

132
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,450
Oh,my god.

133
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,210
Hey.Hey,you okay?

134
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,010
I'm just a little queasy.
I fell down in there.

135
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,320
Never should haveskipped breakfast.

136
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,460
Bullshit. You're shaking.
What the hell happened up there?

137
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,660
No,I'm okay.I just need a little air.

138
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,190
Something finally got to you.

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
I guess you're human after all.

140
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,460
Cut him some slack,all right?

141
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,650
I hate to disappoint you,but i 
think it's just low blood sugar.

142
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,330
Tell us what you saw,dex.

143
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,150
How many dead?

144
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,230
A lot.

145
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,590
But no bodies,just blood --50,60 liters.

146
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,020
Maybe half a dozen dead.I don't know.

147
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,380
You're saying there wasa mass murder 
in there,but they took the bodies?

148
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,650
How is that possible? There's one 
elevator,emergency stairs with alarms.

149
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,900
Someone would have seen 
corpsescoming out.

150
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,400
I don't fucking know.

151
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,400
Hey,dexter,you all right?

152
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,620
I can't go back in there.

153
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,990
You don't have to.

154
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,070
Fine,just get yourself cleaned up and

155
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,850
I don't know work from 
the hallway or something.

156
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,950
You're in room 422.

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,890
Elevators are to your right,
and bobby will see to your bags.

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,170
Dade countysheriff's department.

159
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm lookingfor rita bennett.

160
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,610
That's me.Did you find paul?

161
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,100
I'm sorry?

162
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,510
Paul bennett.

163
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,850
My ex-husband attacked melast night.

164
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,450
My boyfriendfiled a police report.

165
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,270
The only report we have isthe 
one that mr. Bennett filed.

166
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,440
What? Wait.

167
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,270
Paul filed a police report?For what?

168
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,210
Assault.

169
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,780
Your ex-husbandwas just released 
from baptistmemorial hospital.

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
He's pressing chargesagainst you.

171
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,040
He attacked me!

172
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,720
Not according to him.

173
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,760
All right.Can we talk about this later?

174
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,100
We needa formal statement.

175
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,540
You're gonna have to come with
us right now to the station.

176
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,590
Fine.

177
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,390
Hey,make sure you labelthe section of 
the grid each blood sample came from.

178
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,630
All right?

179
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,280
Sweet.

180
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,180
You should really get in here,dex.

181
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,760
I never seen anythinglike this.

182
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,680
Wait till you've seen a few 
morecolumbian drug busts.

183
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,430
Dude,I got mistingup the walls,

184
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,770
across the ceiling,

185
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,090
but no tissue.Come see.

186
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,920
Photos,vince.

187
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,440
Hey,and how come the blood'snot clotting?

188
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,210
The blood's not clotting?

189
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
Genuine medical mystery.

190
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,160
Just keep getting samples.
I'll test it at the lab.

191
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,040
Hello?Don't hang up.

192
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,410
Dexter,I'm atthe sheriff's station.

193
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,350
Paul's pressing assault charges against me.

194
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,070
I mean,how's it even possible?
I was defending myself.

195
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,220
Just stay calm.I know a lawyer.

196
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,590
I'll straighten it out.

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,570
I am calm.They're the hysterical ones.

198
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,150
They're charging mewith a class-2 felony.

199
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,510
Hello,dexter?Are you there?

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
Yeah,I'm right here.

201
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,890
This is ridiculous.

202
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,490
I could lose my job.
I could lose my kids.

203
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,080
I won't let that happen.

204
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,050
Well,I'm gladyou're so confident.

205
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,630
Rita,just trust me.I 
know how the system works.

206
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,500
Look,I'm at a crime scene
right now,and I have to go,

207
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,850
but I'll talk tomy 
lawyer friend right away.

208
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,090
You okay?

209
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,600
Yeah.Yeah,I'm okay.

210
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,330
Thank you.

211
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,060
Yeah,bye.

212
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,960
Is there a wall socket 
in there? Check it out.

213
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,370
- What? A wall socket?   
- Yeah.

214
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,890
Of course there's a wall 
socket.There's lots of wall

215
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,510
hey,you're right.

216
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,220
There was somethingplugged in here

217
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,500
probably a power toolto cut them up.

218
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,990
Come take a look.

219
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,250
Photos,vince.

220
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,110
Lots and lots of photos.

221
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,680
Open sesame.

222
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,630
Blood samplesfor the fridge.

223
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,750
And you better make room.
There's a lot more coming.

224
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,710
Shooters at the bel 
can to tonight. You in?

225
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,010
I'm not in the mood.

226
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,500
Angel,you're on the market,

227
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,350
and the bel cantois hottie central.

228
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,540
Look at this.

229
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,490
They werefor nina's birthday

230
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
backstage passesto neil diamond.

231
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,410
You're in worse shapethan I thought.

232
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh,masukawas looking for you.

233
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,400
Something about drinksat the bel canto.

234
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,210
Yeah,I told himI had a yeast infection.

235
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,730
A bit of an overshare.

236
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
You want to talk aboutwhat happened today?

237
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,270
Already did.

238
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,310
Dexter,the last time I saw you
like that was when dad died.

239
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,550
You can talk to me,you know?

240
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,790
Just got to open your mouthand move it.

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,910
I'll call rudy.I'll tell 
him I'll be late.

242
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,930
Deb,seriously.

243
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,830
I puked. I'm fine.

244
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,080
I know you want to help,

245
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,880
but unless you have breathmints,
there's nothing to do.

246
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,660
Why do you always do this?

247
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,940
- Do what?    
- You shut me out.

248
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,930
Like your birth fatherthat lived up the highway 
your whole lifeand never tried to contact you.

249
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,180
I still don't know how that makes you feel.

250
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,600
I'll tell what,if somerandom emotion 
strikes me in the middle of the night

251
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,500
you'll be the first one I call.

252
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,150
Fine.

253
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,580
Whatever.

254
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,460
Did paul force his wayinto the house?

255
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,640
No.

256
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,040
Did you ask him to leave?

257
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,430
Yes,and he refused.

258
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,130
But in your statement,

259
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,430
it says you invited your
ex-husband into your bedroom.

260
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,920
He was drunk,and the kids were asleep,

261
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,240
and I knew exactly 
where this was heading

262
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,130
cracked ribsand a broken jaw.

263
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,730
ok,And you didn't want itto 
escalate.I understand that,

264
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,060
but we can't prove intent.

265
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,730
Your ex-husband has the 
in juries here,not you.

266
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,880
Paul has a recordof spousal abuse.

267
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,890
Spousal abusecan be mutual.

268
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,730
It was never mutual.

269
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,490
Okay.

270
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,480
But the manis a model parolee.

271
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,890
I mean,his drug tests are clean.

272
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,210
He's got glowing reports from
the court-appointed supervisor.

273
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,730
Corrections will want to 
see this guy transition.

274
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,060
I don't care.

275
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,160
He's not going near my 
children.Do you understand?

276
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,270
Rita,if you deny himvisitation,

277
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,230
you could loseyour children.

278
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,720
Now,you have depositionin two days.

279
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,300
Do not give this man any more
ammunition than he already has.

280
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,740
Okay.

281
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,270
Damn. Just blood?

282
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,750
What happenedto the bodies?

283
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,070
Hell if I know.

284
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,270
I don't want to know.

285
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,260
Blood was bad enough.

286
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,750
No wonder you seem so amped.

287
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,970
Your brothermust have loved it.

288
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,550
Fuck no.He freaked.

289
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,690
Really?

290
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,570
I thought,you know,blood 
was his thing.What happened?

291
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,850
It was like usual.He shut me out.

292
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,060
Did he say anything?

293
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,400
Let's not talk about dexright now.

294
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Was it likea panic attack?

295
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,300
I don't know.He's not really 
bigin to sharing his feelings,

296
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,750
in case you hadn't noticed.

297
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,210
Kiss me.

298
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,460
What's the matter?You 
don't even have wood.

299
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,810
Well,you're the onethat 
said you wanted to talk.

300
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,270
Yeah,but not now.I'm horny.

301
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,470
Maybe I should call him.

302
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,660
Are you fucking kidding me?

303
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,210
What?We bonded last weekend.

304
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,770
Isn't that what boyfriends
are supposed to do,

305
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,430
show some interestin the family?

306
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,790
Yeah,but notwhen his girlfriend's 
trying to get into his pants.

307
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,290
Deb,that's not fair.

308
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,170
You take me outon a couples' 
weekend to get to know your brother,

309
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,430
and then you punish me
for giving a damn?

310
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,290
I mean,your issues
don't have to be mine.

311
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,610
You know what?

312
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,460
Forget it.Let's just go to sleep.

313
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,930
Okay.I'm gonna go watch tv.

314
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,300
***********

315
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,690
***********

316
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,140
***********

317
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,890
***********

318
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,380
Nina loved neil diamond.

319
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,400
"Song sung blue."

320
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,940
"September morn."

321
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,130
Oh,my god --"kentucky woman."

322
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,160
You got to love that shit.

323
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,300
That's like the fourth chick
you've driven off.

324
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,660
Waitress!Is there a waitress?

325
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,590
I need a drink.Waitress!

326
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,480
Bro,you're a train wreck.

327
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,700
Look,you got to stoptalking 
about the divorce.

328
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,980
I ain't ashamed.

329
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,220
Yeah,I think that's clear,
but it's pathetic.

330
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,050
Look,don't talk aboutthe 
divorce unless they ask.

331
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,370
Comprendo?

332
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,260
Oh,and eighty-sixthe ring.

333
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,970
I have to take a squirt.

334
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,220
She's gonnafuck me silly.

335
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,580
My sister's right.I don't 
share my problems with her...

336
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,210
or with anybody.

337
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,980
Harry taught me that 
secrecy,self-reliance,

338
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,600
and a well-stocked cup
board of hefty bags.

339
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,670
Fortunately,I've never met 
a problem I can't manage...

340
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,500
until that boy in the blood.

341
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,580
He scares me.I want him to go away.

342
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,300
You awake?

343
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,550
What?

344
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,270
Are you sureyou locked the door?

345
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,870
Yeah,I'm positive --bolt and chain.

346
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,870
What am I gonna do?

347
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,610
Don't worry.I'll figure it out.

348
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,010
And I will.

349
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,640
I can always see other people's 
problems more clearly than my own.

350
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,250
And fortunately,rita's has a name.

351
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,860
Everyone who set foot onthe bloody 
carpet in room 103 left a footprint,

352
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,870
and since we do shoe molds
of everyone on personnel,

353
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,690
that leaves only one set of
footprints unaccounted for

354
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,620
the killer'S.

355
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,580
This shows everywhere he went
in the room.The question is why.

356
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,290
all right,hold on,Aren't 
we missing something?

357
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,730
Where are the victims'footprints?

358
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,260
Give that lady a lollipop.

359
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,000
Are you suggesting there were
never any bodies in room 103?

360
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,120
Why would a guy stage a massacre
and not have any bodies?

361
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,200
And where'd he getthe blood?

362
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,130
I've just gota preliminary blood report.

363
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,670
The blood in that room came from
at least five different bodies,

364
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,710
possibly more.

365
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
My fellow traveler had five victims.

366
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,540
Ice-truck killerhad five victims.

367
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,010
Five bloodless victims.

368
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,890
I always wondered what 
he did with the blood.

369
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,510
Wait. The ice-truck killerdid 
not horde his victims' blood

370
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,970
just to have a party at the
motherfucking marina view hotel.

371
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,820
Why would he do that?

372
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,670
To chase me down the rabbit hole.

373
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,260
What was that,morgan?

374
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,580
I didn't say anything.

375
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,210
I'll remind you people,wearrested 
the ice-truck killer.

376
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,770
His name is neil perry,and 
he'sawaiting trial in county.

377
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,370
Bullshit.

378
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,830
Neil perry recantedhis 
confession. He's a fraud.

379
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,500
- Try telling thatto the capital.   
- I did.

380
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,520
Do we have any more evidence
to support this theory?

381
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,740
Well,when masuka noticedthe 
blood wasn't clotting,I ran some tests,

382
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,970
and it was loaded with 
coumadinand heparin.

383
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,490
One's an anticoagulant.
The other's a preservative.

384
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,820
It means the blood's old.

385
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,200
Plus the blood spatters'all 
impact and castoff.

386
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,940
There are no hand transfersor 
swipe patterns

387
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,960
to indicate the presenceof 
any actual victims.

388
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,430
Masuka,run the dna on all five vics

389
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,640
and see if it matchesthe 
ice-truck killer's victims.

390
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,600
You two get outto the 
marina view hotel.

391
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,000
Retrace his steps.Maybe 
it'll tell us something.

392
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,810
And not a word to anyoneabout 
the ice-truck killer.

393
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,700
All right,astor,just 
stand up straight.

394
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,320
Now,do you havethe emergency 
phone number list?

395
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,960
It's in my backpack.

396
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,270
Do I have toshow 
it to you again?

397
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,960
Just promise me you won't let
your brother out of your sight.

398
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,410
Rita?

399
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,380
You're scaring them.

400
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,740
Yeah,well,they should be.

401
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,380
I didn't tell them what 
paul did the other night.

402
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,250
What'd you say when you
dragged them to the neighbors'?

403
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,080
I smelled gas.

404
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,950
I should have just 
thrown them in the car

405
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,580
and headed out of state,
gone back to michigan.

406
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,770
Rememberwhat the lawyer said.
You don't want todo anything rash.

407
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,100
Just relax. The court supervis 
or will be there the whole time.

408
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,710
Hey,buddy. Come on.Where's the love?

409
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,840
Daddy,what happened?

410
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh,nothing,buddy.Just a little 
bump on the head.that's it

411
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,480
Hey,we're goingto the circus.
We're going to the circus,

412
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,130
'cause daddy always keep 
shis promises,remember?

413
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,460
Good. All right.Ready?

414
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,200
Got your stuff?

415
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,510
Let's go.

416
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,670
You okay?

417
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,330
I prefer the enchanting rita 
over the worried one.

418
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,740
If I can figure out a way to 
make her ex-husband my problem,

419
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,430
I can help her sleep 
much easier tonight.

420
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,430
All I need is a little proof 
of his inner monster.

421
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,870
Harry would have insisted on that.

422
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,920
Harry didn't believe in 
preemptive killing,

423
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,430
but maybe I can bend the 
rules just this once.

424
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,110
After all,harry wasn't perfect.

425
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,460
He lied about my birth father.

426
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,870
The trifecta -- weapon,ammo,
and impaired judgment.

427
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,400
Throw in a little domestic violence,

428
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,700
and you have the perfect 
recipe for a family slaughter.

429
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,560
Mommy!

430
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,800
Hide your head,dexter.

431
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,500
Close your eyes.

432
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,390
No!

433
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,540
So,after he soaked 
the roomin blood,

434
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,130
he crossed to the desk...

435
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,670
and then overto the bedside table.

436
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,280
There's a clock radioand 
some smeared blood.

437
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,720
Maybe he turned it on.

438
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,120
No,we're missing something.
Let's go over it again.

439
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,740
We've been over itthree times.

440
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,550
Well,maybe the map's wrong.

441
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,670
Call your brother.

442
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,590
What?

443
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,510
Why is everybody's first 
move to call dexter?

444
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,200
You don't even like him.

445
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,940
What'd the freak do this 
time,boil your goldfish?

446
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,740
No,it's just...

447
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,310
it's rudy.

448
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,980
We had our first fight.

449
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,790
Tiff. I don't know.Whatever 
you want to call it.

450
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,410
I thought we were talking 
about your brother.

451
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,160
We were.

452
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,540
Turn that off.

453
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,530
No,wait.I want to hear it.

454
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,710
It's devo.Turn that shit off.

455
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,830
He said 103 fm.This is room 103.

456
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,800
Leviticus 10:3.

457
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,460
10:3 -- 103.

458
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,580
Son of a bitch.

459
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,460
You think he's trying to 
tell us something?

460
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,820
I will be sanctified in 
them that come nigh me,

461
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,640
and before all people,

462
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,890
I will be glorified.

463
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,810
Deb's pissed at me.I need advice.

464
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,730
So you came here?

465
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,070
You know herbetter than anyone.

466
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,630
Come on.I got two porterhouses
and a sixer of microbrew.

467
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,590
Well,one minute we're 
talking about her day,

468
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,120
you know,the whole bloodbath thing.

469
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,370
Right.

470
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,840
And the next,she wants to jump my bones.

471
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,660
I mean,deb's hot and all,

472
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,540
but sprinkle ina little conversation 
once in a while,you know?

473
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,560
No,she's my sister.I don't know.

474
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,270
Can I help youfind something?

475
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,180
You wouldn't happen to have
a good meat knife.

476
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,860
Thanks.

477
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,210
Anyway,the other halfof the argument

478
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,850
was about you.

479
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,020
Me?

480
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,280
Yeah.It was already tense enough,

481
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,830
but when I brought your 
name,she lost it.

482
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,300
So,what do I do?

483
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,310
Tell her it's all your fault.

484
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,360
- Seriously?  
- You will eventually.

485
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,170
Deb has a way of wearing you down.

486
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,630
Just start from there.It's easier.

487
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,510
Oh.I got to take this.

488
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,140
You mind if I...?

489
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,840
Where are you?

490
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,050
Still at work,chasing a lead.

491
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,850
Let me guess --the bloodbath case.

492
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,380
I don't want to talk shopright now.

493
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,950
Baby,I am so sorry.
You were totally right.

494
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,420
I was mad at dexter,
and I took it out on you.

495
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,010
My shift's almost done.
You want to come over and talk?

496
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,940
I'd love to,babe,but I'm about
to eat dinner with dexter.

497
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,420
Well,after.

498
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,440
Yeah,but here's the thing.

499
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,780
I think I'm gonna sleepat 
my place tonight.

500
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,680
I mean,it's closer,and 
I'm drinking,you know.

501
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,140
You understand,right?

502
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,960
Yeah.

503
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,690
I'll call you tomorrow.

504
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,850
Care to dance?

505
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,960
You dance to this?

506
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,260
A bit.

507
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,130
What about your wife?

508
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,330
Tan lineon your ring finger.

509
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,620
I'm not gonnatalk about that tonight.

510
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,220
Divorced?I get it.

511
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,940
Mine was just finalized.

512
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,470
Let's go.

513
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,950
Will you excuse me?Excuse me.

514
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,120
Police.I need to talk to you.

515
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,130
I'm not a hooker anymore.

516
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,070
I work for a legitimateescort service now.

517
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,230
I'm not hereto bust anyone.

518
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,820
I just need to know why you
paint your nails the way you do.

519
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,840
He was a real good client.

520
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,890
You want to spend the nightin a cell?

521
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,210
All right. About a year ago,
there was this guy.

522
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,550
Guy or client?

523
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,130
A john,okay? That's 
when I worked calle ocho.

524
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,490
Anyway,he started getting all
rough with me until he saw this.

525
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,290
Then what?

526
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,820
Then he changed his tune,
got all turned on.

527
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,090
Told meto take my fake hand off.

528
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,760
He started doing some 
kinky,weird stuff,

529
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,720
like he was worshipping it.

530
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,890
To cap it off,he takes 
all my nail polish

531
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,390
and paints each naila different color.

532
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,560
I liked it,so I kept doing it.

533
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,210
You know that guy they arrested
for the ice-truck killings?

534
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,930
Yeah,the onewho stuffs roadkill?

535
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,770
- Is that the guy?  
- No way.

536
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,980
My trick,he's sexy.A freak,but sexy.

537
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,260
Okay.

538
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,090
From the beginningand with more detail.

539
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,250
Well,thanksfor the hospitality.

540
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,650
Hey,thanks for the steaks.

541
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,250
You know,I didn't get a chance to ask.

542
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,280
Deb mentioned that you hada 
little incident at the crime scene.

543
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,350
Did she?

544
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,180
Well,most of my prostheticclients are pretty 
traumatized by the time they get to me.

545
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,220
Anyway,I'm a good listenerif 
you ever want to talk.

546
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,440
Thanks,but unless you know 
anexpert in repressed memories...

547
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
for real?

548
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,040
You know somethingabout it?

549
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,100
More than I ever wanted to.

550
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,090
When I was in high school,

551
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,260
I started having these dreams
of a woman hit by a truck.

552
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,830
Who was she?

553
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,830
I didn't know.

554
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,810
Then one day I stoppedby a mailbox,

555
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,760
and it allcame crashing back...

556
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,460
my mom getting outto mail a letter,

557
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,780
me still in the car.

558
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,720
I watched her die.

559
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,840
How old were you?

560
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,940
4.

561
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,320
I didn't remember anything
till I went and mailed a letter.

562
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:15,440
Walked right into the bellyof 
the beast without knowing it.

563
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,660
What kind of memories
are you having?

564
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,050
They're stilla little vague.

565
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,690
Right.

566
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,610
Well,you're gonna have to
face it eventually.

567
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,800
Maybe next time.

568
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,590
When you see deb,go with white 
roses.They're her favorite.

569
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,540
That's a good tip.

570
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,920
It's funny how lifebrings 
people together,huh?

571
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,100
Rudy misunderstands my problem.

572
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I want the boy and blood to go 
away,not come crashing back.

573
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,580
Fortunately,I have other people's 
problems to focus on right now...

574
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,540
like forgotten cellphones.

575
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,610
What do you got?

576
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,950
Well,so farwe're chasing a ghost.

577
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,570
Couple of employees 
helped with the sketch,

578
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,010
but it's pretty generic.

579
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,520
Only real lead we have is a couple 
of numbersat the crime scene.

580
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,280
Screw the numbers.Who was killed?

581
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,460
Where are the bodies?

582
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,700
I heard some pretty wild 
theories out there.

583
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,740
Just theories. We're still
waiting for full blood results.

584
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,910
Damn it,maria,you're stalling.

585
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,770
I'm just tryingto avoid speculation.

586
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,340
Well,you got to give me 
something and soon.

587
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,960
This department can't afford 
another public relations disaster.

588
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,410
Well,

589
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,590
maybe you should tellthe D.A. 
To let neil perry go.

590
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,300
He's notthe ice-truck killer.

591
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,840
Are you still hung up 
I can't believe this.

592
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,620
Jesus,maria,that's not gonna happen.

593
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,280
The D.A.Takes his cues from us.

594
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
If you just tell himyou made a mistake

595
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,610
not going to happen.

596
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,240
Now let it go.

597
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,410
First break in this case,
you come straight to me.

598
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,550
This may bea shot in the dark,

599
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,020
but I met this hookerlast night.

600
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,040
Going with a pro -- now,that's 
how you get over the ex.

601
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,290
No,that's notwhat I mean.

602
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,350
So you didn't fuck her.
But she blew you,right?

603
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,350
Would you shut up?

604
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,310
- It was a lead.   
- On what?

605
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,800
I'll let you knowif it pans out,but

606
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,630
what do you knowabout amputee fetishes?

607
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,690
Oh,yeah.

608
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,270
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.It's 
called acrotomophilia.

609
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,340
But don't let themhear 
you call it that.

610
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,020
It sounds like a disease.

611
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,460
No,they preferto be
known as "devotees."

612
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,700
I knew you were the manto ask.

613
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,170
Not really.

614
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,900
I prefer a girlwith a kung fu grip.

615
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
You know whoyou should talk to?

616
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,630
What's his face --deb's boyfriend.

617
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,330
Prosthetics guys deal with
devotees all the time.

618
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,620
Thanks.

619
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,610
No memory flashes here.

620
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,050
No little lost boy in blood.

621
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,440
Maybe he went back to hiding in the 
dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

622
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,930
Here's to hoping.

623
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,060
Yo,dex.

624
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,730
So,this is what you dofor a living?

625
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,750
I'm trying to match castoffpatterns 
from a crime scene.

626
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,680
A power tool was used.

627
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,800
Here you go.

628
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,420
Oh,thanks.

629
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,110
Circular saw.

630
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,890
Seems like there'd be an easier 
way to make a mess like this.

631
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,470
Yeah,trust me. I know.I've 
been in here for hours.

632
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,360
You know,in my line of work,

633
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,060
you hear all sortsof horror stories

634
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,870
boat propellers,garbage disposals.

635
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,550
It seems like somethingyou'd 
see with a chainsaw.

636
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,390
Yeah,I hear that.But this power 
tool was plugged into a socket.

637
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,300
Guess you haven't heardof 
an electric chainsaw.

638
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,140
Come on,people.We're coming up empty.

639
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,750
Those numbers mean something.1-0-3.

640
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,210
We need to find the connection,
and until we do,

641
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,830
you need to go over every pageof every 
police report you wrote in the last six months.

642
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,070
Think.1-0-3.103.

643
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,470
Bus station locker,piece 
of a bank account,

644
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,810
area code,partial license plate.

645
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,890
What is it?I want answers.

646
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,710
What are you doing here?

647
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,020
How do you always do it?

648
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,870
Do what?

649
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,360
Make me feel likeI'm 6 
years old all the time.

650
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,220
If this is about rudy,he was 
just picking up his cellphone.

651
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,590
Where'd he leave it.

652
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,250
Uh,my apartment.

653
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,630
What was he doing there?

654
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,090
Uh...eating steaks.

655
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,260
And?

656
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,900
I don't know.Drinking beer.

657
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,380
And?

658
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,190
- Debra?  
- And?

659
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,750
- Talking?    
- Talking.

660
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,100
You talked.

661
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,050
You opened your mouth,and sounds came out.

662
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,130
On the same nightthat I wanted 
to talk to you,but you shut me out.

663
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,660
Oh.

664
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,590
Yeah,"oh."

665
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,530
You don't talk to me,dex.

666
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,730
You've spent our entire lives
keeping me at a distance.

667
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,400
But my boyfriend shows upon your 
doorstep with a couple of t-bones

668
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,470
they were porterhouses.

669
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,000
Porterhouses,

670
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,890
and you end uptossing beers 
back into the middleof the night.

671
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,510
Dex,you are all the family thatI 
have,and I barely know you.

672
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,260
So,if you're gonna eat steakswith 
somebody after a rough day,

673
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,370
if somebody's gonna break
through your fucking walls,

674
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,770
I think it should be me.

675
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,960
I think I have earned it.

676
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,490
I'm latefor rita's deposition.

677
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,360
Deb,it's hard for me.You know that.

678
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,840
You rudy cooper?

679
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,330
Angel batista.

680
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,940
I work with your girlfriend,debra.

681
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,550
Oh,hi.Nice to meet you.

682
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,880
I'd like to ask you a few
questions,if you don't mind.

683
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,510
Sure.

684
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,390
Let me justgrab the door.

685
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,640
So,does thishave to do with a case?

686
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,080
You could say that.

687
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,780
Well,fire away.

688
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,570
Well,I ran into this lady
with a prosthetic hand

689
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,890
call girl,actually.

690
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,750
Said she hada very unique client,

691
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,520
an amputee devotee.

692
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,070
You have a leadon this client?

693
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,200
That's the bitch of it.

694
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,090
I don't have a goddamned clue,

695
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,040
except for the freaky sex stuff.

696
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,510
I was hopingthat you could steer 
me toward someof those weirdos.

697
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,680
I'm afraid I got into this 
business to help people get better,

698
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,740
not help people get off.

699
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,130
I'm sure debra will 
be happy to hear that.

700
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,890
But I can talk to some
of my colleagues,

701
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,130
see if I can draw up a 
list of contacts for you.

702
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,370
That'd be great.

703
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,530
Hey,how often does someoneget a 
chance to help catcha bad guy,huh?

704
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,490
You in a rushfor this information?

705
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,980
No,no,I'm good.

706
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,200
I'm chasing a long shot,really.

707
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,960
Well,just 

708
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,890
give me a callat the station
 when you got something.

709
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,440
Will do.

710
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,680
Good to meet you.

711
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,480
Good to meet you.

712
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,000
Last question.

713
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,700
According to your ex-husband,

714
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,450
you left town withyour boyfriend last weekend.

715
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,930
That's right.His father died.

716
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,570
Did your ex-husbandhave a scheduled 
visitation with his children during that time?

717
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,930
I told paulI'd make it up to him.

718
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,080
So,then he gave youpermission?

719
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,340
No.

720
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,110
I'm the one that gave him
visitation in the first place.

721
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,630
I'm the custodial parent.
I didn't have to do that.

722
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,690
Could you give us a second?

723
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,330
Yes,of course.

724
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,730
Why didn't you tell me you broke
your visitation agreement?

725
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,560
I didn't knowit was a big deal.

726
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,350
I think she's answered
that last question,

727
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
so unless there'ssomething else...

728
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,970
No,that's fine.

729
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,540
If I missed anything,we'll get to it

730
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,450
at the psychiatric evaluation
next wednesday.

731
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,530
Nobody told me aboutany 
psychiatric evaluation.

732
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,680
It's mandatoryin these cases.

733
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,580
The psych test determines if
there's a competency hearing.

734
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,820
For me?But he's the ex-con.

735
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,200
It's standard.Rita,you should be fine.

736
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,790
Should be?

737
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,250
You mean she could actuallylose this?

738
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,570
Guys...

739
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,960
I'm handcuffed here.

740
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,790
You violateda custody agreement.

741
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,380
You struck your ex-husband
in your bedroom.

742
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,800
He has a case.

743
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,420
Mama,look atmy henna tattoo.

744
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,700
- So,how much sugarhave you had?  
- Lots.

745
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,560
Thanks,now she'll neverget to sleep.

746
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,100
She'll calm down soon.

747
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,350
This one's already crashed.

748
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,990
Mom,can my dadread me a story?

749
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,890
I don't think so,honey.

750
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,040
Please?

751
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,050
Okay. But just one.

752
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,410
Put your duds on,buddy

753
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,650
spider-man ones I bought you.

754
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,760
I'll get him ready.You've 
got 20 minutes left.

755
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,190
Thanks,betty.Thank you.

756
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,340
Hey,rita.

757
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,050
It doesn'thave to be this way.

758
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,300
I mean,we can make this 
easieron each other,right?

759
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,870
I could drop the charges if you 
agree to unsupervised visitation.

760
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,590
Fuck you.

761
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,710
Hey,dexy.

762
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,450
You know,I don't thinkyour girlfriend 
appreciates the gravityof the situation.

763
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,760
If she loses that case,she 
could lose the kids.

764
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,160
- That won't happen.    
- Never say "won'T."

765
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,550
We live in a world of wills 
wills and wonders.

766
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,530
That's what I'm tryingto 
teach my children.

767
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,040
And they are my children,too,

768
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,070
something she seems to forget.

769
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,420
Okay,so I made some mistakes,

770
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,450
but I learned from it,right?

771
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,230
Hey,I'm sober.

772
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,970
Look,no needle marks.

773
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,750
I got the alaskan pipelinerunning 
through these veins,

774
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:14,100
and all because of those two little 
glows ticks of love in the next room.

775
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,450
My heart beats for those two kids,

776
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,210
so if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

777
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,630
I swear to god,I don't 
care who I have to hurt

778
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,070
harry's first rule was don't 
get emotionally involved.

779
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,800
I think this is why.

780
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,750
Astor,go brush your teeth now.

781
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,820
Someone once said it's easier dealing 
with other people's problems than your own.

782
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,850
They were wrong.

783
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,020
Paul?

784
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,520
Dexter?

785
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,740
Where were you?

786
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,290
Taking out the trash.

787
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,930
Did you see paul?

788
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,920
when I was in the side yard,
I heard the front door open.

789
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,700
Hey,my dad's car is gone.

790
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,050
Let's face it,paul.

791
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,800
You've been a problem.

792
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,170
It's time for you to go away.

793
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,860
The ice-truck killer case 
has been reopened officially.

794
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,990
We have new forensic evidence 
that shows that the dna

795
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,150
from the blood at the 
marina view hotel

796
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,580
matches the dna from his victims.

797
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,050
What about neil perry?

798
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,610
Isn't he supposed to be 
the ice-truck killer?

799
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,840
All those questions should be 
directed to captain matthews.

800
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,510
He's been personally 
handling the perry case.

801
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,140
shit.I hope she told the captain.

802
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,240
Who knew?

803
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,770
Who knew about this?

804
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,180
This is the firstwe're 
hearing about it,captain.

805
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,030
The ice-truck killer is still at large.

806
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,930
I'll call you back.

807
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,500
You overplayed your hand,maria.

808
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,770
I gave you a chanceto 
make it right.I told you..

809
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,980
you don't tell me shit!

810
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,190
This is my department.I 
made you lieutenant. Me.

811
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,450
You were just another 
spik detective.

812
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,840
Nice,tom. Real nice.

813
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,780
Your true colorsfinally come out.

814
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,380
Oh,no.

815
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,160
No,you haven't seenmy 
true colors,maria.

816
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,780
But you're about to.

817
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,800
Enjoy this office 
while it's still yours.

818
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,140
Dexter.

819
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,250
What happened?What's wrong?

820
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,640
It's paul. I don't 
know all the details,

821
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,860
but he violated florida's 
three strikes law.

822
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,540
He's back in jail.

823
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,290
It is truly amazing the things you 
can do when you put your mind to it.

824
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,860
What's so funny,mom?

825
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,370
Yeah,why are you laughing?

826
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,610
No problem is insurmountable when you have 
the most accessible evidence locker in miami.

827
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,230
Paul did need to go away.

828
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,390
This is the police.

829
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,510
But death wasn't the answer.

830
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,040
Police. Open up.

831
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,300
Life in prison will do just fine.

832
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,410
For now,at least,the code of 
harry remains unbroken.

833
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,030
Hey,get over here.

834
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,670
You're part of this family,too.

835
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,360
I need an ambulanceat 1228 caldon street.

836
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,840
A guy's been stabbed.

837
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,680
Stay with us.

838
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,280
Heard they're dropping ice-truck
murder charges on neil perry.

839
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:41,550
Yeah,I'm sure he'll be filinga 
lawsuit any minute now.

840
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,240
More shitfor us to deal with.

841
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,250
Speaking of which,watch out
for reporters out there.

842
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,510
They're still waiting ona 
comment from the captain.

843
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,050
So,things still rockyat home?

844
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,000
Oh,with rudy?

845
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,410
Yeah. I'm not calling
until he apologizes.

846
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,320
I'm donebeing second choice.

847
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,820
Good for you,morgan.

848
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,000
Um,if you're notdoing 
anything tonight,

849
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,640
masuka's invited us
to the bel canto.

850
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,340
For you.

851
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,770
It's too late.You blew it.

852
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,950
This is the first chanceI've had to talk.

853
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,830
I'm too tired to talk.

854
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,430
Well,let's go home,

855
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,900
fall into bed.

856
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,690
Why,rudy?

857
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:41,770
I mean,fucking why? You didn't 
want to fall into bedthe other night

858
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,000
when I laid my heart outon the phone.

859
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,120
You wanted to talkto my brother.

860
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,290
I was confused.

861
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,550
Well,I'm not confused.
I know what I want.

862
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,740
I was confusedbecause I love you.

863
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,650
What I want is very simple
and uncomplicated.

864
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,070
What did you say?

865
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,990
I love you.

866
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,910
Don't try to...

867
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,540
- fuck.  
- What?

868
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,470
I love you,too.

869
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,850
What happenedto your lip?

870
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,260
Just,uh...incidentwith a 
tool at the workshop.

871
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,360
Well,let's get you home
and take care of it.

872
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,420
So,this is doom.

873
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,880
I've been the architect of so much of it.

874
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,080
It's only fair I should know 
what all the fuss is about.

875
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,260
He left me this room for a reason.

876
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:16,900
Five women gave their blood,
their lives for this moment.

877
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,550
There's only one way to find out why.

878
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,470
Close your eyes,dexter.

879
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,200
I want mama.

880
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,150
Oh,god.

881
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,190
Not in front of my baby!

882
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:58,660
Don't you dare!Not in front of my baby!

883
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,390
Close your eyes,dexter.

884
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,420
Don't look.

885
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,170
Close your eyes.

886
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,050
Mommy loves you,dexter.
