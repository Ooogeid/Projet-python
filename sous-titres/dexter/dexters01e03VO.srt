Season 1 Episode 3</font>

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,480
Previouslyn "Dexter"... 

5
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,250
what happened changed something inside you, Dex. 

6
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,310
It got into you too early. 

7
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm afraid your urge to kill 
is already that strong. 

8
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,840
I want to catch this guy before 
he kills another one of my girls. 

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,930
What can I do to help ? 

10
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,650
No blood. 

11
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,290
What a beautiful idea. 

12
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,920
Refrigerated truck. 

13
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,630
He wants a cold environment 
to slow the flow of blood. 

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,120
I su ppose I should be upset, 
even feel violated, but I'm not. 

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,240
In fact, I think this is a friendly message. 

16
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,940
Kind of like, "hey, want to play ? 

17
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,830
" Finding that truck is your 
golden ticket into homicide. 

18
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,100
So miami's the haystack, and the 
ice truck's the needle, right ? 

19
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,860
I just found the fucking needle. 

20
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,390
Oh, this is seriously fucked up. 

21
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,970
I think he's trying to impress me... 

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,160
and it's working. 

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,230
That captain believes you should be 
reassigned from vice to homicide. 

24
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,120
Thank you, sir. 

25
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,890
Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me. 

26
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,290
Arrr ! 

27
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,370
Are you gonna kiss him ? 

28
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,440
Actually, yes. 

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,070
We just got an I. D.  
On the body from under the causeway. 

30
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,570
His name is Ricky Simmons. 

31
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,150
He was a cop. 

32
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,870
Matthews: Ricky simmons was under deep 
cover in carlos guerrero's family ? 

33
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,050
Guerrero's crossing a whole new line. 

34
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,590
Now he's gone and pissed off 
the entire miami police department. 

35
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,130
It's me. 

36
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,670
It's james, okay ? 

37
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,570
It's okay. 

38
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,570
Was kara sleeping with someone 
other than Ricky ? 

39
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,420
Was it you ? 

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,140
James, she died. 

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
'Popping Cherry'

42
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,190
Miami's full of good cops, 
a lot of them here today. 

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,490
But no offense... I wouldn't want any 
of you hitting on my sister. 

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,190
Ricky was different. 

45
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,200
He was the kind of guy you hoped 
your sister would fall for. 

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,050
Most people have a hard time dealing 
with death, but I'm not most people. 

47
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,910
It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable. 

48
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,290
Not because I'm a killer... really. 

49
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,340
I just don't understand all that emotion, 
which makes it tough to fake. 

50
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,740
In those cases, shades come in handy. 

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,360
Doakes: Mac. 

52
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,190
I'm sorry, man. 

53
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,580
Thanks, man. 

54
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,220
It's a fucking travesty. 

55
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,980
You going after guerrero ? 

56
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,970
Guerrero ordered these hits. 

57
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm gonna make something stick 
to that cartel cocksucker. 

58
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,580
I didn't know you and ricky were so tight. 

59
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,870
Ain't about that. 

60
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,380
Fuck with a cop, you lose the 
privilege to walk the streets. 

61
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,860
- You're right.  - You're right. 

62
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,330
Tragic loss of our fellow officer. 

63
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,760
But we praise his courage. 

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Ricky knew no fear. 

65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,570
Can you believe Laguerta ? 

66
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,970
She didn't even know Simmons. 

67
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,720
She knew he was a cop. 

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Er, wait. Did you tell her ? 

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,920
Proud of you for coming, bro. 

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,420
I know you hate funerals. 

71
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,890
How you holding up ? 

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm managing. 

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,910
No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched 
in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore. 

74
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,280
A whole life reduced to ashes. 

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,880
For ricky simmons, it's over. 

76
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,910
But sometimes, you get a second chance. 

77
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,710
Florida prisons kick free 25,000 inmates a year. 

78
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,700
They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it. 

79
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,600
I search for the ones who think 
they've beat the system. 

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,830
They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs. 

81
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,610
Jeremy got off easy... four years 
in a juvenile facility for manslaughter. 

82
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,490
To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, 
impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso. 

83
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,670
impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso. 

84
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,290
Too many major arteries were severed... 
femoral, brachial, carotid. 

85
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,090
Today Jeremy is just another 
piece of trash on the street, 

86
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,560
but four years ago, he was the toast of miami. 

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
It was a gruesome scene today

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,140
the bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed 
to death inside this south miami park. 

89
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,790
Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, 

90
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,230
but our sources are telling us that investigators 
are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody. 

91
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,490
We're hearing that the suspect lured the older 
boy to the pond to spot alligators, 

92
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,880
but once they were alone, the victim 
was robbed and repeatedly stabbed. 

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,410
But I knew what he was and 
what he'd do again. 

94
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,490
All I had to do was circle 
my calendar and wait. 

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,030
Lemonade for my sweaty workers ? 

96
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,030
What do you say, crew ? Anybody parched ? 

97
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,790
What's parched ? 

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,330
When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be 
able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade. 

99
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,570
Can we have a lemonade stand ? 

100
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,660
I'll apply for a business license 
first thing in the morning. 

101
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,670
Thank you for doing this, Dexter. 

102
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,130
You know, I moved here from michigan 
with dreams of fruit trees in my yard. 

103
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,680
But they keep dying. 

104
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,920
I can't help it. 

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,350
I kill things. 

106
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,020
That must be awful. 

107
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,840
Fortunately, I have a green thumb. 

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,890
The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer. 

109
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,330
Bone meal works the best. 

110
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,300
Hey, Rita. 

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,930
Paul doesn't live here anymore. 

112
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,460
No shit. 

113
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,460
He's in jail. 

114
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,430
But, uh, see, he still owes me for two 
ounces of blow, which means you owe me. 

115
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,330
Don't get involved. 

116
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,980
I never know in these situations. 

117
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,820
I don't have money. 

118
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,550
You got a car. 

119
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,200
You want my car ? 

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,100
Yeah. The keys in it ? 

121
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,150
You know my dad ? 

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,350
I sure do, little man. 

123
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,740
And you want to know something ? 

124
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,790
You look just like him. 

125
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay ? 

126
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,450
Look, if you want, I could go in the house, 
throw your furniture around, make a real mess, 

127
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,550
but what kind of message would 
that send to the little ones ? 

128
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,050
Just give me the fucking car. 

129
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,380
Why don't you go inside and get the keys ? 

130
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,200
I'll wait with our friend here. 

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,570
What ? 

132
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,150
You think you can take me with your little red shovel ? 

133
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,430
Everything okay in there ? 

134
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah. 

135
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,730
You need toilet paper ? 

136
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,290
No. 

137
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,220
The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with. 

138
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,240
I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back. 

139
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,340
No, uh, n-no reports, Dexter. 

140
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,950
Thank you, but, uh, paul's out of my life. 

141
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,880
I filed for divorce. 

142
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,490
I just want my past to go away. 

143
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,450
Well, it went away in your rav 4. 

144
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,670
Whatever it takes. 

145
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,850
I can give you a ride to work 
until you get another car. 

146
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,270
Or I could take the bus like 
millions of other people. 

147
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,400
Come on, let's go outside and 
enjoy this beautiful day. 

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,180
Come on, kids. 

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,170
Angel: What did they use, an ax ? 

150
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,950
It's blunt force. 

151
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,460
See the way the head's caved in ? 

152
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,740
Hmm. 

153
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,720
You guys check out the new hottie 
mcgotass in dispatch yet ? 

154
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,200
She's a butter face. 

155
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
What's a butter face ? 

156
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,600
You know, compadre... 
she's got a hot body, but her face... 

157
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,280
how great would it be to 
pull a bronco on her ? 

158
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,780
Yeah. 

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,130
Yeah ? 

160
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,310
Mira a qu ? 

161
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,460
You do it doggy-style, right ? 

162
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,580
And just when she's getting into it, you grab her 
by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam 

163
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,710
you're riding her like a bronco 
'cause she's trying to buck you off. 

164
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,970
Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing 
some essential piece of the human puzzle. 

165
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,390
This is one of them. 

166
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,460
What are you doing ? 

167
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, the bronco. 

168
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,190
See, socia ? She knows. 

169
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,200
I just got my first official homicide call. 

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,520
He's back. 

171
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,820
Who's back ? The ice-truck killer ? 

172
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,130
That's right. 

173
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,350
You won't believe where he left the body. 

174
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,770
I knew we'd be back. 

175
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,890
Feels like christmas morning. 

176
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,480
Look at that... a miracle on ice. 

177
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,190
Stunning. 

178
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,150
You all right, Dexter ? 

179
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,300
This is like a dream. 

180
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,480
Standing on the home ice of the miami blades. 

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,680
I never pegged you for a hockey fan. 

182
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,060
Yeah, there's something about standing 
in a big, cool hole I find very relaxing. 

183
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,010
So, what do we know ? 

184
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,940
Same as the others. 

185
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
No blood. 

186
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,840
So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts. 

187
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,490
No bones flayed. 

188
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,940
I think our boy's got his confidence back. 

189
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,480
He never lost it. 

190
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,980
He was just getting bored. 

191
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
What do you think he's trying to tell us ? 

192
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,250
That hockey's a violent sport. 

193
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,570
What else ? 

194
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,200
He's escalating the thrill. 

195
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,110
Posing his victim in the middle of a 
20,000-seat arena for all miami to see, to show them 

196
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,740
to show us...what he's capable of doing. 

197
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
What did I miss ? 

198
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,230
Relax. You didn't miss anything. 

199
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,880
Yeah, but she is... fingertips. 

200
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,640
This body belongs to the frozen 
fingertips we found in the truck. 

201
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,940
Sherry Taylor. 

202
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,520
It's another prostitute. 

203
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,520
No blood...no need for me. 

204
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,650
Morgan, come up to the command center. 

205
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,350
We may have a suspect. 

206
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,330
Is there really a suspect ? 

207
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,420
I'll let you know, bro, when I get back 
from my first official homicide investiga

208
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,760
I know her. 

209
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,940
Sherry ? 

210
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,080
Yeah, she called herself cherry. 

211
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,110
Um, we worked the same corner when I was undercover. 

212
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,990
You were, like, friends ? 

213
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,650
Yes. 

214
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,360
Do you want a hug ? 

215
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,030
Fuck off. 

216
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,690
I tore apart the security office. 

217
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,960
A surveillance tape is missing. 

218
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,500
Let me guess... the one covering the ice. 

219
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,860
They said you were good. 

220
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,080
I've got the press knocking on the door outside. 

221
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:24,190
Somebody who was here last night saw something... 
rent-a-badge, uh, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room ? 

222
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,130
Come on, work with me. 

223
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,220
They got a night watchman, but we can't find him. 

224
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,450
Well, then, he's a suspect. 

225
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,300
Unless the ice-truck killer abducted 
him to gain entry into the arena. 

226
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,930
Did your brother help you out with that logic ? 

227
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,720
The night watchman could've just been 
at the wrong place at the wrong time. 

228
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,840
We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find. 

229
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,930
I was hoping I could hit kiocho, talk to my old contacts. 

230
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,230
I thought you wanted to get out of vice. 

231
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,180
Isn't that what you cried to the captain last week ? 

232
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,470
Yeah, I mean... 

233
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,890
I didn't cry. 

234
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,870
Listen, my girls know this victim, okay ? 

235
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,610
They may have information that could help us. 

236
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,340
No, I want you to work with doakes. 

237
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,910
Maria, she has contacts. 

238
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,900
You still got your tube top ? 

239
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,590
And my nipple clamps. 

240
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,880
Don't come back without any information. 

241
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,580
Everyone moves to miami to die, which means 
we have more junk than any city in america. 

242
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,120
A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure 
here, but that's not my idea of hunting. 

243
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,460
I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach. 

244
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,140
My instincts are impeccable, 
but I have to be sure of my prey. 

245
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,190
We're all adrenaline rats, you know ? 

246
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,210
Kill it till it dies. *************

247
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,400
We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner. 

248
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,210
What you looking for ? 

249
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,550
Can I see that one ? 

250
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,870
Eh, good eye. 

251
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,520
It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. 

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
Full tang, stainless steel. 

253
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,270
Real time-saver for the hunter who likes 
to do his own butchering in the field. 

254
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,910
See the way that blade curves like that ? 

255
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,800
It's like the talon of an eagle. 

256
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,160
15 bucks and she's yours. 

257
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,710
I'll take it. 

258
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,010
Hell, yeah, you'll take it. 

259
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,220
Why would you not ? 

260
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,970
I'll get your change. 

261
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,040
Easy, kid. 

262
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,980
What the fuck are you doing, boy ? 

263
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,540
I didn't see him. 

264
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,730
You all right, mister ? 

265
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,080
Yeah, I'm fine. 

266
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,340
Honest mistake. 

267
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,360
No harm. 

268
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,600
Hey. 

269
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,090
You be careful with that thing, huh ? 

270
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,360
Sorry about that, boss. 

271
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,900
I only sell them. 

272
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,920
So, what you hunt... trophies or meat ? 

273
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,540
What do you think toda dex ? 

274
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,360
The winchester ? 

275
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,230
What about the 9mm ? 

276
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,900
A handgun ? 

277
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,340
Not exactly the weapon of choice for pheasants. 

278
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,770
You need a wide spread to bring them down. 

279
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,010
Did you ever shoot anybody, dad ? 

280
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,530
Afraid so. 

281
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,630
Any of them die ? 

282
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,110
Just one. 

283
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,710
How'd it feel... 

284
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,520
to kill a guy ? 

285
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,230
Not so great, Dex. 

286
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,610
When you take a man's life, 
you're not just killing them. 

287
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,730
You're snuffing out all 
the things he'll ever become. 

288
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,250
As a cop, I only fire 
my weapon to save a life. 

289
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,980
That's a code I live by. 

290
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,200
Killing must serve a purpose. 

291
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,150
Otherwise, it's just plain murder. 

292
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,970
You understand ? 

293
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Yeah. 

294
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,990
Changed my mind. 

295
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,410
I think we'll take the ruger. 

296
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,220
Rifle ? 

297
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,070
I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants. 

298
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,220
We're not gonna hunt pheasants. 

299
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,720
It's a big one. 

300
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,950
Yeah. 

301
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,420
This deer will put meat on our table tonight. 

302
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,020
It's still alive. 

303
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,880
For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel. 

304
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,460
Channel them. 

305
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,400
Why don't you go ahead, son ? 

306
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,050
Really ? 

307
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,970
Put the poor animal out of its misery. 

308
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,320
"Community Mourns loss of Kara Simmons"

309
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,010
Vodka, please. 

310
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,390
Hi, Rose. 

311
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,230
Hi. 

312
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,900
Congratulations on your confirmation. 

313
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,890
Thank you. 

314
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,140
Do I know you ? 

315
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,680
My name's James Doakes. 

316
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,570
Miami metro P. D. 

317
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,650
I'm investigating the murder of 
an undercover cop and his wife. 

318
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,530
Oh, that's terrible. 

319
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,650
Were they members of the church ? 

320
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,580
No, rose, they weren't. 

321
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,820
Oh, I don't understand. 

322
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,850
Rose, have you ever seen this man before ? 

323
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,980
I don't know. 

324
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
Why are you asking me ? 

325
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,630
Get away from my daughter. 

326
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,070
It's okay. 

327
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,910
At my church ? 

328
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,960
In front of my family ? 

329
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,150
Ricky and kara had a family, too. 

330
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,660
You just opened a dangerous door. 

331
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,780
No, man, you did... 

332
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,750
when you murdered a cop and an innocent lady. 

333
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,810
What is he talking about, daddy ? 

334
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,920
Come on, honey. Let's go. 

335
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,340
Let's go ! 

336
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,910
You don't play by the rules, guerrero. 

337
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,600
Why should I ? 

338
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,340
You've got five minutes, bizach, okay ? 

339
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,810
Yo, look who's back. 

340
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,900
Pero Mirela, como est* caliente ! 

341
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,750
Who'd you fuck...dolce or gabbana ? 

342
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,030
I let them both pull a train, okay ? 

343
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,570
Listen, I, uh, I got a confession to make. 

344
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,060
I'm, uh... 

345
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm not who you think I am. 

346
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm a cop. 

347
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,600
Bridgett, get back... Bridgett ! 

348
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,140
I'm not gonna bust... you're not a cop. 

349
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,270
You're a whore. 

350
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,230
I'm not a fucking whore. 

351
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,460
What's wrong with being a fucking whore, huh ? 

352
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,470
We trusted you, brandy. 

353
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,260
My name's Debra, okay ? 

354
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,540
And I'm not here to bust you. 

355
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,530
He hit again... the ice-truck killer. 

356
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,820
He got cherry. 

357
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,410
Cherry ? 

358
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,490
This shit's crazy. 

359
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,390
I'm out. 

360
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,210
I got a sister who lives in ohio, 
runs a fashion-boutique store. 

361
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm on the bus tomorrow. 

362
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,930
I ain't closing my shop for no sick, 
psycho bitch. 

363
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,560
Fucking woman-hater. 

364
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,060
I was on the street before him. 

365
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,260
Fuck it. 

366
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,170
I can get him, you guys. 

367
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,020
You just got to give me something. 

368
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,870
Did any of you all see cherry with 
anyone the night before last ? 

369
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,120
Well, I saw her last night, and then 
she got into a car and never came back. 

370
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,390
But I was working all night, so... 

371
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,470
you know the driver ? 

372
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,890
No, but the car was, like, one of those old 
station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side. 

373
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,830
This is good. 

374
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,090
This is a lead. 

375
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,630
I should go get Laguerta to listen. 

376
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,970
Who's Laguerta ? 

377
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,290
Uh, she's my lieutenant. She hates me. 

378
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,330
But I'm close with the captain. I'll talk to him. 

379
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,900
What ? 

380
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,720
Never piss off your pimp. 

381
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,210
Laguerta's not my pimp. 

382
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,620
Is that right ? 

383
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,720
Bitch tell you what to do ? 

384
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,560
Is your pussy taking all the grief ? 

385
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,450
Does she steal everything you earn ? 

386
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,710
Yeah, she definitely does that. 

387
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,700
Then she's your pimp, baby, and she 
will mess you up if you play her. 

388
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,460
I told you...I'm not a fucking whore. 

389
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,490
What's wrong with being a fucking whore ? 

390
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,250
Hey. 

391
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,570
Bought you a present to celebrate 
your first official homicide case. 

392
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,180
Seriously ? 

393
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,090
It's a cactus. 

394
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,650
You only have to water it three times a year. 

395
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,830
Gee, dex, you didn't have to go out of your way. 

396
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,680
I didn't. I was at the swap meet. 

397
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,760
So, any news on our frosty friend ? 

398
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,260
One of my contacts said she saw cherry getting 
in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died. 

399
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,990
Did you check the dmv database ? 

400
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,340
As we speak. 

401
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,370
There are thousands of registered 
station-wagon owners in miami-dade 
county, but guess who's not on the list ? 

402
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,460
The night watchman. 

403
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,900
I knew Laguerta had her head up 
her ass on that one. 

404
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,050
She doesn't have shit 
on the real ice-truck killer. 

405
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,350
Good. 

406
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,670
Why good ? 

407
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,620
It's good for you. 

408
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,480
You're gonna be the one to apprehend 
that heinous murderer, not her. 

409
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
Thanks. 

410
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,810
All right. 

411
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,190
Good night, sister. 

412
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,050
Don't stay up too late. 

413
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,790
Okay. 

414
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,010
Thanks for stopping by. 

415
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,570
Hello ? 

416
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,850
Hi. 

417
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,890
Are you... is this a bad time ? 

418
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,640
It's rita. 

419
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,950
No, it's fine. Hi. 

420
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,220
I was just, uh, reading a sad story. 

421
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,630
Is everything okay ? 

422
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,800
Yes, I'm... look, the thing is... 

423
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,490
you need me to pick up cody after school ? 

424
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,520
No. 

425
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,200
Colleen's gonna take him 
to karate with hudson. 

426
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,580
What about astor's piano ? 

427
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,360
Jen's got that covered. 

428
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,860
Look,it's social services. 

429
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,420
There's a caseworker coming 
by the house this afternoon. 

430
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,130
I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses... 

431
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,400
I'll be there. 

432
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,820
Don't worry about a thing. 

433
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,250
Thank you, Dexter. 

434
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,980
As you all know, a night watchman 
from the hockey arena is missing. 

435
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,060
Till now, we presumed he was abducted 
or murdered by the ice-truck killer. 

436
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,170
However, we searched his apartment and found 
a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the murder. 

437
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,660
Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it. 

438
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,490
The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, 
the missing night watchman. 

439
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,510
And here's the best part... Tucci has a record. 

440
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,150
He pulled a ife at a party in '97. 

441
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,800
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you 
Tony Tucci, the ice-truck killer. 

442
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,510
Bullshit. 

443
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,020
Captain matthews is coordinating with the fdle to 
launch a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances. 

444
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,940
Does he drive a station wagon ? 

445
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
Excuse me ? 

446
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,820
Tucci...what kind of car does he drive ? 

447
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,870
The last-known victim was seen 
getting in a station wagon. 

448
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,750
I don't recall asking for any 
questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you ! 

449
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,600
Now, from this moment on, all 
our resources go to finding this man. 

450
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,210
Your individual assignments 
will be coming shortly. 

451
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,230
That's all for now. 

452
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,330
Doesn't make sense. 

453
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,570
After being so careful for so long, 
why would he leave recorded evidence ? 

454
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,810
Of course I agree with my sister, 
but unlike her, I'm not upset. 

455
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,120
He's still out there, and I'm waiting... 

456
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
breathless. 

457
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,450
You sure we can't get you anything ? 

458
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,460
I'm fine. 

459
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,390
Rita's usually home in time for the kids. 

460
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,570
I'm just backup. 

461
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,070
Her bus must be late. 

462
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,230
My files say ms. Bennett's supposed 
to have personal transportation. 

463
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,620
Oh, yeah, well, she did and will again very soon. 

464
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,330
Probably next week. 

465
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,900
***************I just have to make a note of it. 

466
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,270
She's doing an exemplary job. 

467
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,640
I wish all my home visits were this lovely. 

468
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,280
So why do you keep coming around, then ? 

469
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,190
Routine follow-up for all domestic-violence cases. 

470
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,800
We need to ensure a stable home environment exists. 

471
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,780
It's a good thing. 

472
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,930
The system does work from time to time. 

473
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,520
I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. 

474
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,150
No abuse. 

475
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,390
In fact, my foster father 
understood I had special needs. 

476
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,130
Without him... 

477
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,630
you're lucky. 

478
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,370
Lucky. 

479
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,990
I'm here ! 

480
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,370
Hey, everyone, I'm here. 

481
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,180
Sorry. 

482
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,780
It's okay. 

483
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,690
I am lucky. 

484
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,880
What do I know about abuse ? 

485
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,580
Without the code of harry, I'm sure I would've committed 
a senseless murder in my youth just to watch the blood flow. 

486
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,550
Just try and keep him comfortable. 

487
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,060
It's about all we can do for him now. 

488
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,580
I don't understand. 

489
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,960
A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better. 

490
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,980
He is getting better, sweetie. 

491
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,520
A body cannot suffer in sweet repose. 

492
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,020
What does that mean ? 

493
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,180
What the hell does that mean ? 

494
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,260
She's weird. 

495
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,820
Listen, you two... 

496
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,620
I'm not going to be around much longer. 

497
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,370
Dad, don't say that. 

498
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,570
You can make it through this if you fight. 

499
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,920
When I'm gone, I won't be able 
to stop you from being who you are. 

500
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,370
Sooner or later, you'll need to do it. 

501
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,800
Do what ? 

502
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,020
Just remembeour lessons. 

503
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,460
What lessons ? 

504
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,230
What are you talking about ? 

505
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,230
I can't make it without you. 

506
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,390
Yes, you can. 

507
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,010
If you feel like you're slipping... 

508
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,600
lean on your sister. 

509
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,200
She'll keep you connected. 

510
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,960
Fucking forensics report. 

511
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,790
What'd they find ? 

512
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,940
Tucci's hair and fiber. 

513
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,200
Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body. 

514
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
He's hauling her around with 
his pork hands, isn't he ? 

515
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,260
Any word from the chem lab ? 

516
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,200
Same as the other murders. 

517
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,700
The killer used liquid nitrogen to preserve 
the tissue, give it that bleached look. 

518
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,810
You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is ? 

519
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,400
You'd have to be a lab rat just 
to mess around with that shit. 

520
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,120
Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry. 

521
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,340
Watch carefully. 

522
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,380
Right there... see ? 

523
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,420
Right before he repositioned the torso. 

524
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,400
He turned his head. 

525
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,560
Like someone's giving him directions. 

526
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Someone like the ice-truck killer 
holding a motherfucking gun to his back. 

527
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,210
The killer's framing Tucci. 

528
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,610
It looks that way. 

529
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,770
Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep 
shit when she finds out. 

530
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,600
She's gonna have to cancel 
her press conference. 

531
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
And you know how Laguerta 
loves her press conferences. 

532
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
Can I borrow this tape ? 

533
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,340
Bingo. 

534
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,100
I know what happens next in 
this gruesome little scenario. 

535
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,250
Jeremy is trying to re-create 
his first kill, ritualize it. 

536
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,690
You ready ? 

537
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,550
I don't know if I want to do this, man. 

538
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,520
What's wrong ? 

539
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,040
I thought you wanted to see an alligator. 

540
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,060
I do. 

541
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,160
It's in the marsh up here. 

542
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,480
Wait. 

543
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,700
Are you a pussy ? 

544
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,950
No. 

545
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,840
Okay. 

546
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,740
It's right up here. 

547
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,330
Come on, Jer. 

548
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,040
What are you talking about ? 

549
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,090
Don't be a bitch. 

550
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,420
Here we are. 

551
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,460
I don't see it. 

552
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,090
It's right there. 

553
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,010
See its eyes sticking out ? 

554
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,590
You have to get closer. 

555
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,180
I still don't see it. 

556
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,250
Really ? 

557
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,680
Maybe I was wrong. 

558
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,530
There's no gator here, is there ? 

559
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,330
I don't know, Lucas. 

560
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,380
Is there ? 

561
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,290
Anyone see a frisbee ? 

562
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,620
It flew in here somewhere. 

563
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,370
**************************

564
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,710
What am I doing out here ? 

565
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,130
Oh, fuck ! 

566
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,420
Fuck ! 

567
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,780
Fuck ! 

568
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,000
All I had to do was drive home, 
have a taco, plan my attack. 

569
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,920
Instead, dearly deluded Dexter tried 
to act human, like it's my job to save lives. 

570
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,890
Code of harry never covered this. 

571
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:58,150
At least I know where Jeremy 
is and what I need to do. 

572
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,380
Don't let her. 

573
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,430
Okay, my brave little soldier. 

574
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,220
Let's get this nasty shot out of the way. 

575
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,330
No ! 

576
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,520
Wait ! 

577
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,400
What is it, honey ? 

578
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,020
He doesn't want the shot. 

579
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,650
Your father's very sick. 

580
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,120
He's in a lot of pain. 

581
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,190
He needs a shot. 

582
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,490
I want pain. 

583
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,110
He wants pain. 

584
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,710
I'll have to tell the doctor. 

585
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,270
He's not going to be happy 
you're refusing your medication. 

586
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,150
 You can tell. 

587
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,350
About the nurse ? 

588
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,440
She's... 

589
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,060
like me. 

590
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,790
How could you tell ? 

591
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,160
She gives too much... 

592
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,560
morphine. 

593
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,400
It's something else. 

594
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,740
It's making me worse. 

595
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,660
She's drugging you. 

596
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,850
She's killing you by overdose. 

597
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,260
Not just me. 

598
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,710
Others, too. 

599
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,050
Stop her. 

600
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,690
What do you mean, stop her ? 

601
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,380
It's time. 

602
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,970
Before she hurts anyone else. 

603
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,280
See the look on his face, like he's scared ? 

604
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,470
Like he has a gun pointed at him ? 

605
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,800
Oh, I don't know, Debra. 

606
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,990
It's not much... a look off-camera. 

607
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,880
There's more. 

608
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,920
One of my vice contacts, Gabrielle... I trust 
her... she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled 
wagon the night of the victim's death. 

609
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,310
That was the last time anyone saw her. 

610
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,240
Did a background report on Tucci. 

611
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
He doesn't even own a car. 

612
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,190
***********There's no fucking way 
this guy can be the ice-truck killer. 

613
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,880
Sir. 

614
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,060
What does lieutenant Laguerta 
say about all this ? 

615
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,950
I came straight to you, captain. 

616
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,800
You went around the back of 
your commanding officer ? 

617
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,260
Laguerta doesn't listen to me. ***********

618
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,440
You don't violate the chain of command. 

619
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,080
You just don't. 

620
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,540
Now, listen, Debra. 

621
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,950
I gave you a shot in homicide because 
I think you can make a halfway-decent detective. 

622
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,030
But if I find you can't swim in these waters, 
I'll put you right back on the street. 

623
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,790
You got it ? 

624
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,620
Yes, sir. 

625
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,160
Your father never would've pulled 
the kind of shit you just did. 

626
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,110
Did you know that one of your officers has information 
that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours ? 

627
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,330
Who, Morgan ? 

628
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,170
I realize you're something of 
a folk hero around here, Maria, 

629
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,390
but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of 
a promising officer just to further your political career. 

630
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,070
Is that what you think I'm doing ? 

631
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,450
You were a middle-of-the-pack detective 
before the press got ahold of you. 

632
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,130
Thanks for the vote of confidence. 

633
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,570
It's a reality check, and you need it. 

634
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,580
And I got it. 

635
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,750
Let's cut to the chase. 

636
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,250
Are you telling me to call off my manhunt ? 

637
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,040
'Cause I will remind you that 
jeb bush himself signed off on it. 

638
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,420
No, uh, no. 

639
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,940
You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria. 

640
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,240
People of this city need to know 
we're doing something about this mess. 

641
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,730
But don't expect me to bail you out if that 
night watchman turns out to be a dead end. 

642
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,110
A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida. 

643
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:49,020
According to police, a night watchmans on the 
run after the dismembered body parts of a young 
south beach woman were found tuesday, 

644
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,070
stacked on the home ice of the miami blades. 

645
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,140
The woman is believed to be the latest 
victim of the notorious ice-truck killer, 

646
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,160
now responsible for five deaths 
in the greater miami area. 

647
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,150
These terrible attacks have to stop. 

648
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,610
And we have to stop them. 

649
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,890
With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, 
it's our mission to find him. 

650
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,380
Fucking joke. 

651
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,630
Hey, going out tonight with the guys, 
blow off a little steam... you in ? 

652
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,360
Hey, man, sounds good. 

653
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,830
Pick you up at 8:00. 

654
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,890
Elevator's around the corner 
and to your left. 

655
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,660
Enjoy your stay with us. 

656
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,770
Hello ? 

657
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,070
Rita, this is Mr. Curtis. 

658
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,570
Are you coming to pick up astor ? 

659
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,580
Oh, no, a friend of mine is... Denise. 

660
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,710
Is she not there ? 

661
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,200
I'm afraid not, but your daughter is. 

662
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,490
She's the last k left here at school. 

663
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,140
I don't have a car. 

664
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,470
Is she okay ? 

665
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,720
Yeah, she's just fine, but 
we can't keep her here much longer. 

666
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,250
Okay. 

667
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,720
Okay, I'll work something out. 

668
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,500
Do it again ! 

669
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,280
Let's not wake up cody. 

670
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,940
Now, let's see about that splinter. 

671
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,010
That's a deep one. 

672
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,710
This might sting a bit. 

673
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,330
But the magical splinter fairy 
will soon make you forget all about it. 

674
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,810
Who's the magical splinter fairy ? 

675
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,520
She's the second cousin to the tooth fairy. 

676
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,200
She brings candy if you put your 
splinter under your pillow at night. 

677
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,780
The tooth fairy is make-believe, 
just like the boogeyman. 

678
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,690
Hi, guys. 

679
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,290
You're right, astor. 

680
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,100
There's so such thing as the boogeyman. 

681
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,700
But the splinter fairy... she's the real deal. 

682
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,230
Will the splinter fairy come if I cry ? 

683
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,730
Thanks for picking her up. 

684
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,260
If I had a heart, 
it might be breaking right now. 

685
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,390
**************

686
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,120
Who we picking up now, man ? 

687
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,720
'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap. 

688
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
We're not picking up anybody, bro. 

689
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,870
Well, what we doing in the gables ? 

690
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,730
I told you. 

691
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,620
We're blowing off some steam. 

692
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,130
This is it. 

693
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,010
What the hell is this ? 

694
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,610
It's a disguise. 

695
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,120
One of guerrero's top lieutenants... 
he lives here, and we're gonna fuck him up. 

696
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,930
Hold up, mac. 

697
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,740
I thought you said you wanted 
to go out and get shit-faced, man. 

698
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,740
I am shit-faced. 

699
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,480
How do I look ? 

700
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,950
Man, I'm all for sending the message, 
but this... this ain't the way, man. 

701
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,590
Why the hell not ? 

702
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,370
The guy's scum. 

703
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,430
Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you. 

704
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,510
Mac, mac ! 

705
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,630
Hey, listen up, man. 

706
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,150
I showed my face to guerrero. 

707
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,860
They gonna think I'm behind this shit. 

708
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,320
That's part of the plan. 

709
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,060
What plan ? 

710
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,510
You fucked my sister. 

711
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,270
You fucked a cop's wife. 

712
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,140
Now you're just fucked, buddy. 

713
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
Shit. 

714
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,830
Motherfucker ! 

715
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,850
Hey, quit fucking around. 

716
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,470
Turn on the lights. 

717
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,200
Come on, man. 

718
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,530
Turn on the fucking lights ! 

719
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,660
You're mine now. 

720
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,550
What do you want ? 

721
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,460
Silence. 

722
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,660
You gonna fuck me, faggot ? 

723
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,710
'Cause I killed the last guy who raped me. 

724
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,490
What guy ? 

725
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,070
He raped you... 

726
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,520
the guy you killed when you were 15 ? 

727
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,890
Why didn't you tell anybody ? 

728
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,020
Would you ? 

729
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,970
He fucked me,and I killed him, 
and if you try, I'll kill you, too. 

730
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,400
I understand now. 

731
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,950
Why didn't I see it before ? 

732
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,260
Jeremy didn't murder that boy four years ago. 

733
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,620
He was taking out the garbage. 

734
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,750
Just like I do. 

735
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,580
Look, I really don't want to cancel all my 
credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the dmv, 

736
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,870
so give me back the wallet you stole 
from my car, or I'll break your fucking neck. 

737
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,450
It's in my backpack. 

738
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,930
Wait... is that all ? 

739
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,820
You want more ? 

740
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,160
That boy who raped you four years ago... 
did he deserve to die ? 

741
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,270
Yeah. He did. 

742
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,470
Well, the boy last night didn't. 

743
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,170
Remember that. 

744
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,810
It could save your life one day. 

745
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,460
Mr. Tinker ? 

746
00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:00,120
Mr. Tinker, Mr. Tinker,where are you ? 

747
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,850
Mr. Tinker ? 

748
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,880
Are you trapped behind the couch 
again, mr. Tinker-stinker ? 

749
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,840
The nurse was my first playmate. 

750
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:18,770
I'll always be grateful to her for opening up 
so many magnificent new doors for me. 

751
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,630
Things were a little messy in the beginning. 

752
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,810
Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time. 

753
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,280
But I was trained well. 

754
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,850
Those who witnessed my early 
stumbles never had a chance to tell. 

755
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,580
I've just been looking through your photo album. 

756
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,840
Hope you don't mind. 

757
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,460
Are all your victims in here ? 

758
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,370
I'm sorry. Let me help you with that. 

759
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,720
Scream and lose a tongue. 

760
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,270
I-I helped them... 

761
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,700
all of them. 

762
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,750
I took their pain away. 

763
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,510
I understand. 

764
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,590
Now it's time to take away your pain. 

765
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,170
It was messier than I anticipated, 
but it was still a special day. 

766
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:51,350
But, of course, it was really harry 
who paved the road to my salvation. 

767
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,690
With the nurse put down, harry lived another year before 
hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him,

768
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,020
 but his lessons have never failed me. 

769
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,230
Harry taught me that death isn't the end. 

770
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,130
It's the beginning of a chain reaction 
that will catch you if you're not careful. 

771
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,040
He taught me that none of us are 
who we appear to be on the outside... 

772
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,650
but we must maintain appearances to survive. 

773
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,800
But there was something harry didn't teach me, 
something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know. 

774
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,470
The willful taking of life represents 
the ultimate disconnect from humanity. 

775
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:03,090
It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, 
searching for company to keep. 

776
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,530
Sweet ride ! 

777
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,040
Is it yours ? 

778
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,170
It's yours, until your mom can get a new one. 

779
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,020
I borrowed it from impound right before auction. 

780
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,990
Dexter... 

781
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,060
can we get in ? 

782
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,500
You better. 

783
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,260
All you can do is play along at life 
and hope that sometimes you get it right. 

784
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,400
Thank you. 

785
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,110
Score one for the little wooden boy.
