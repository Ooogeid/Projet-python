he broke??

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
he's probably gonna start
tailing me again.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
sergeant doakes tailed you?

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
i followed him
to an n.a. meeting.

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
that asshole
lied about that, too.

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
you're obsessed.
i'm not.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
and i need you to see it!

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,900
dinner was fantastic,
rita. wow.

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,100
i kind of like her.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,300
lila: dex,
just calling to check in.

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,900
imagine rita's face
if i told her

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,200
that you and i had spent
the night together in a hotel.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,500
it's over, dexter.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,400
i guess i just hope with lundy
it will be different.

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,100
why?
i respect him.

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,700
<i>you love him.</i>

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,600
no. he's like my dad.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
you want to tell me
what's going on?

40
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,900
you're the one who said i'm
supposed to feel my feelings!

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,400
well, now i'm telling you
to get them under control!

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,000
which step was that?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
that night, forest grew

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,100
lila:
use the entire canvas.

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
start from the top.
work your way down.

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
light, feathery strokes.

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,900
perfect!

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,300
stunning.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,600
try longer strokes now.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
perfect.

51
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,400
you really know what you want,
don't you?

52
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,600
i hope you don't mind.

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,800
some men do.

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,300
no.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,700
i've always found
instruction manuals...

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
quite useful.

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
okay, your turn.

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>what do you want?</i>

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,700
i think that was it.

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,500
hmm, come on.

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,500
you must have
some dark fantasies...

62
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,300
...unfulfilled urges.

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,700
i'm pretty good
at acting on those.

64
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,600
really?

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,600
then fuck me like that.

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
your light's burned out.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
it's the wiring.

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,100
i've been asking my landlord
to fix it for weeks.

69
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,600
well, now i can see better.

70
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,200
that's where
my landlord lives.

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
now he'll have to fix it.

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,300
see you later.

73
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,500
<i>got to admire lila for taking
things into her own hands.</i>

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,700
<i>that includes me.</i>

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,700
ohh. mom. [ sighs ]

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,200
come on, let's go!
no more moping.

77
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
i'm not moping.
i'm sleeping.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
oversleeping --
third time this week.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
the only way you're gonna
get over dexter

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
is if you take charge
of your day.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
come on. you're not
in high school anymore.

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,600
go scrub your face,
and i'll heat up some oatmeal.

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
didn't hear you
come in last night.

84
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,700
well, it was late.
i was quiet.

85
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,500
yeah,
you're good at quiet.

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
guess you kind of have to be
with me crashing here

87
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,900
and rita's mom over there.

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,900
you and rita
fuck quiet, too?

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,300
and she's off,
right out of the gate.

90
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,200
because me --
i wake the goddamn dead.

91
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
it's a problem.

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
oh, i know,
only too well.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
scary, right?

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,100
sometimes i disturb myself.

95
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,800
so [chuckles] what kind
of noises does rita make?

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
could we not talk
about sex...

97
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
or rita?

98
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,800
why?

99
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
'cause we broke up...

100
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,400
for real.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,900
it's over.

102
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,200
you break up,
you get back together --

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
that's just what goes on.

104
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,400
i mean,
you and rita are forever.

105
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,100
just say you're sorry
and send some fucking flowers.

106
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,200
you're not hearing me.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,300
look,
when all this blows over,

108
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,500
i'll spend a few days
at gabriel's, and...

109
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,900
you can screw rita
as loud as you want.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,700
big news, dex.

111
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,500
whoa! feel like i got caught
in a wave.

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,200
<i>the miami tribune received
a 32-page manifesto in the mail.</i>

113
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,600
it's looking good
for the bay harbor butcher.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,100
well, i've heard
that one before.

115
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
look, this may be legit.

116
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,300
the manifesto includes the names
of three victims

117
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,900
we never released
to the press.

118
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,500
oh, that is big news.

119
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,600
<i>i'm heading over to the tribune
now for special agent lundy.</i>

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,100
he put me in charge
of the team.

121
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,500
go, angel.

122
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,800
yeah, i'm psyched.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,100
<i>yeah, me too.
i'm about to be published.</i>

124
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
<i>i sent that manifesto
to the tribune.</i>

125
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>guess i've been taking
some cues from lila lately,</i>

126
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,700
<i>and not just in bed.</i>

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
<i>i'm tired of reacting
to the moves of agent lundy</i>

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
<i>and his super posse.</i>

129
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,400
<i>time to control their actions
for a change.</i>

130
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,900
betsy court, 16.
blunt-force beating.

131
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
it looks like
she was sunning herself

132
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,000
and never saw it coming.

133
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
who called in the body?

134
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,900
craig wilson, the stepfather.
he's right over there.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
wilson told
the reporting officer

136
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
that he came home for lunch
and found her that way.

137
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,800
um, you and dexter
resolve your issues?

138
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,200
as far as i'm concerned.

139
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
why? the bitch come crying
to you again?

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
no.

141
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
there's blood work
to be done here,

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,300
and if you can't
control yourself,

143
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,400
i need to call in
another detective.

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,700
i won't say anything to hurt
the little girl's feelings.

145
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,400
god damn it, james,
i'm not joking.

146
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
do i look like
i'm laughing?

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,900
no. you don't. i wish you would.
you used to.

148
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,500
bullshit.
i never laughed.

149
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
[ scoffs ] yeah, you know what?
you're probably right.

150
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,200
now, look, i'm not gonna try
to scare you anymore.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,500
the reality is,
you're out of free passes.

152
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
now, i already stopped dexter
from filing a complaint

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
against you once.

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,290
i never asked you to do that, maria.
well, i did it,

155
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,300
out of my own concern
over your obsessive behavior.

156
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
now i'm on the line,

157
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
so if you bully dexter
in any way --

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
if you even
look at him wrong,

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,300
i will not be responsible
for the fallout.

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,500
you got it?

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
i got it.

162
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
you're backing
the fucking freaktard.

163
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,500
james.

164
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,600
where you been, dexter?

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,100
you don't bring me
doughnuts.

166
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,900
you don't sing me love songs.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
how are you, camilla?

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
i've been better.

169
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,400
well,
that doesn't sound good.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
sergeant doakes dropped by
my file room yesterday.

171
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,700
he requested the case files

172
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,100
for the 1973
shipping-yard murders.

173
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,200
i gave him the same line
i gave you

174
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,700
when you came
sniffing around,

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
said all that old stuff
was boxed up

176
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
in the basement
of city hall.

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
that made him real angry.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,500
he scared me, dexter.

179
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
that's not right.
he shouldn't do that.

180
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,800
look, dex, i always assumed
that your father asked me

181
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,100
to destroy those files
to protect you.

182
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,300
now i'm not sure
what's going on.

183
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,300
camilla...

184
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,700
now,
i don't want to know.

185
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,300
i just don't want
to get fired.

186
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
i'm retiring next year.
did i tell you?

187
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
i've been looking forward
to staying home with gene.

188
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,900
you won't lose your retirement.
i won't let that happen.

189
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,700
i can stall sergeant doakes
for a few days,

190
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
but eventually,
he'll figure out

191
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,200
that that case file's missing,
just like you did.

192
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,900
and he'll track it back to me,

193
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,100
you know, just like you did.

194
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,600
i'll take care of this.
you have my word.

195
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,400
<i>so much for threatening doakes.</i>

196
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,500
<i>he won't back off till
he exposes the twisted branches</i>

197
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,900
<i>of my family tree,</i>

198
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,200
<i>from my father's indiscretions
to my murderous brother</i>

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
<i>to the root of all evil -- me.</i>

200
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
hey.

201
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,800
<i>why aren't you
at the tribune?</i>

202
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,000
what for?

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,300
our guy's not gonna leave
dna evidence on a document.

204
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,100
oh, but the thrill
of the hunt.

205
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,800
i've had
that particular thrill.

206
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,900
i'll leave it
to younger men.

207
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,900
besides, it's easier for me
to do my part from here.

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
yeah?
what part is that?

209
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,300
operating on favors,
political leanings, posturing.

210
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
i've been trying to find
the right music.

211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,900
right.

212
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,900
so, i'm off duty today,

213
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
but here are those
marina reports.

214
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,500
and after my workout,

215
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,100
i'll swing by and pick up a copy
of the manifesto.

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,400
look at that board.

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
these kills are precise,

218
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
but there's also a fluidity,

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
even some improvisation.

220
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
if i could just find
the music...

221
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
want to borrow my ipod?

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
got any chopin?

223
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,900
no.
fresh out of chopin.

224
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,300
shit.
chopin's perfect.

225
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,400
did you just swear?

226
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,400
[ chuckles ]
what can i say?

227
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,900
you're rubbing off
on me, morgan.

228
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>but chopin is perfect.</i>

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
so this is how you do
what you do.

230
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,000
the truth speaks to me
from a peaceful place.

231
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
i got to set the stage
to hear it.

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
you know what i mean?

233
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,200
no.

234
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,600
i thrive on chaos.

235
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
but this is good, too.

236
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,400
i didn't kill her.

237
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,100
i was just trying
to stop the blood.

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
<i>no forceful impact spatter --</i>

239
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
<i>he's telling the truth.
i can tell.</i>

240
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,700
palms up, please.

241
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
when i found betsy,
she was still breathing.

242
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,900
i wanted to help her.

243
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,500
you believe me, right?

244
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,700
i'm just the lab guy,
mr. wilson. sorry.

245
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
arms down
at your sides, please.

246
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,500
<i>blood misting. huh.</i>

247
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,100
i need to collect his shirt
for evidence.

248
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,300
morgan!

249
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,100
the girl's mother
was at work,

250
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
but she isn't really defending
her husband.

251
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
wilson and his stepdaughter
fought all the time.

252
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
the neighbors heard him yelling
at her this morning.

253
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
then he comes home for lunch --
motive and opportunity.

254
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
what'd the blood say?

255
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,000
well, the blood on his hands
could have come

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,100
from trying to help her,
like he claims.

257
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,200
but i did detect, uh, blood mist
on his shirt.

258
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
a blood mist --

259
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
the kind that comes from beating
on a teenage girl?

260
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,000
<i>no.
yes.</i>

261
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,000
you're absolutely sure?

262
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
<i>it's too fine
for a bludgeoning.</i>

263
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,600
the mist is from
a bludgeoning.

264
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,000
medium-velocity impact
spatters -- no doubt about it.

265
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,400
okay, morgan.

266
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
just make sure you get me
your blood report

267
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
as soon as possible.

268
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,600
<i>this is my chance
to make doakes go away</i>

269
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,300
<i>without spilling a single drop
of his blood.</i>

270
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
<i>of course, i have to sell
an innocent man down the river.</i>

271
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,000
<i>sorry, mr. wilson, but i won't
let you float too far.</i>

272
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,400
i was just thinking
about you.

273
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
<i>hmm.
i like the sound of that.</i>

274
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,500
yeah, i had to do a little
creative problem-solving

275
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
at someone else's expense.

276
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,700
bravo.

277
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,500
yeah,
i figured you'd like that.

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
what's up?

279
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,900
well, you know
that art installation

280
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,200
that i've been working on?

281
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
the cannibals.

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,600
they're not cannibals.
how barbaric!

283
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,500
their eating is symbolic

284
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,800
of the way we consume others
to feed our needs.

285
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,900
that's what i meant.

286
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,000
well, it sold.

287
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
i-i didn't even create it
to sell, but one of my buyers

288
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
fell in love with it,
and i named an outrageous price,

289
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,800
and she paid me a deposit
on the spot.

290
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
so...

291
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,600
you in the mood
to celebrate?

292
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
definitely.

293
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,100
i'm afraid we just can't
seat you tonight

294
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,400
without a reservation.

295
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,900
as you can see, we are
completely at capacity.

296
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,100
oh, well --

297
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
no, i'm sorry.
you have to help us.

298
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,700
i made this reservation
two months ago.

299
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
this is our
10-year anniversary.

300
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,200
this is the place where dexter
proposed to me --

301
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,900
on the patio,
in front of the fountain.

302
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
he told me to make a wish,
and when i looked down,

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
there was my diamond ring,
sparkling under the water.

304
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,400
that is so romantic.

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
dexter:
in case you're wondering,

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
there's nothing sparkling
under that water tonight.

307
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,600
[ chuckles ] oh, i'm sure
you'll dazzle me somehow.

308
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,700
you're a creative problem-solver
now, right?

309
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
a changed man,
or at least "changing."

310
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,300
i suppose.

311
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
there's no supposing
about it, dexter.

312
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
you've taken control
of your addiction

313
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
in a way
that few people do.

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
it's been about a week

315
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
since we've even discussed
your recovery.

316
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,000
i think you're right.

317
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
and you haven't felt the need
to use?

318
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,300
incredibly, no.
i feel...

319
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,200
you know, like i'm finally
in control of things again.

320
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,200
we call that warm fuzzy feeling
the pink cloud.

321
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,400
it's when an addict experiences
acceptance for the first time.

322
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
you're saying
it won't last?

323
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,100
i'm saying that you have
to work it -- that's all.

324
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
but i know that you will,

325
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
because i believe that
we've found a true substitute

326
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,500
for your addiction.

327
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,400
what's that?

328
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
life.

329
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,200
you're making us all
look bad.

330
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
i'm the manager
of il bistro vino.

331
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
happy anniversary --
on the house.

332
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,900
thank you.
[ chuckles ]

333
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,100
oh, did you hear that,
darling?

334
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,900
oh, i heard it,
darling.

335
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,900
enjoy your evening.

336
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,300
thank you.

337
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,300
happy anniversary,
my love.

338
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
aren't we in recovery?

339
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
oh, this?
it's just bubbles.

340
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,300
we're not gonna shoot it up,
are we?

341
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,600
you really have a way.
you know that?

342
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
a way of what?

343
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
of whatever the hell
you want.

344
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,800
well, here's to 10 more
glorious years

345
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
of whatever the hell i want.

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,400
hi, i'm cody,
and i researched saudi arabia

347
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,100
for my cultural report.

348
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,300
gail:
that's good, sweetie.

349
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
now, look at me
when you talk, okay?

350
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
and try and stand up
straight.

351
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,000
my board is covered in sand

352
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,300
because saudi arabia
is one big desert.

353
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,600
<i>one great big desert.</i>

354
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
one great big desert.

355
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,900
it only rains in a tiny corner
of the country,

356
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,900
so they save rainwater --

357
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,400
okay, now, try and keep
your fingers off your face.

358
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,900
you don't want people to think
you're picking your nose.

359
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
you mean like this?

360
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
cody, you need
to take this seriously.

361
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
dexter said it should be fun.

362
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,900
dexter does drugs.
he's wrong.

363
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,900
i finished my homework.

364
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
for the week?

365
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
hey, guys. i'm home.

366
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
mom!
sorry i'm so late.

367
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,100
i'm so happy to see you!

368
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,000
mom!

369
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
oh, wow!
what a greeting.

370
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
okay, why don't you guys
go get ready for bed?

371
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,500
really, mom?
i just got home.

372
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,800
they need their rest.

373
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,800
i will be in in just a minute
to check on you.

374
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,400
those two are making
great progress.

375
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
progress -- towards what?

376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
their full potential!

377
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
mom, i know you're really good
at these things,

378
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
but now that you're here,

379
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
have you thought about applying
for a teaching job?

380
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,100
no, i'm through
with the schools.

381
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,500
well, i thought teaching
was your life.

382
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,700
and your children are going
to be the beneficiaries

383
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,600
of all that i have
to offer.

384
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,200
<i>our injunction
stopped the tribune</i>

385
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,900
from publishing
the manifesto -- for now.

386
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
at the very least,

387
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,200
we'll have time
to get a jump on things

388
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,900
before the news frenzy hits.

389
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,800
so, let's take advantage
of this window.

390
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
our goal for the next 48 hours
is to wade through

391
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,400
this shining piece
of social commentary.

392
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,100
i've never seen so many dense
and convoluted ideas in my life,

393
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,700
but we need to search them all
for clues to his identity.

394
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,100
so, first impressions?
i got something.

395
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
there are a lot of literary
references in this document.

396
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
how do you know?
i like to read books.

397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
what kind of books?

398
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
all kinds. who cares?

399
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,200
anyway...i see lots of
references, like this one.

400
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,200
"you can't depend
on your eyes

401
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
when your imagination
is out of focus."

402
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
[ chuckles ]
he's a trekker!

403
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
that shit's straight
from "deep space nine."

404
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,700
what?
mark twain said that.

405
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,800
it's one of
his most famous quotes.

406
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
twain was never
on "deep space nine."

407
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,500
he was on "next generation."

408
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
he didn't say it
on "star trek."

409
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,600
okay, so what's it from?

410
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,000
"a connecticut yankee
in king arthur's court."

411
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,700
angel, what other literary
quotes are in that manifesto?

412
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,300
this guy -- he's the best boxing
student i have ever had.

413
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,100
after four weeks, he's getting
in shots to my head.

414
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,800
and finally he says,
"i think i'm ready."

415
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,100
i'm like,
"you're ready for what?"

416
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,900
and he says,
"to kick my mom's ass."

417
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
i'm like,
"you're learning how to box

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
because you want to beat up
your mom?"

419
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
what the fuck?!

420
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
did -- did you hear
what i said?

421
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,300
i was gonna hit the showers.

422
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
i'll meet you back here
in 10 minutes.

423
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,700
okay, yeah, 10 minutes.

424
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,700
<i>who the fuck are you?</i>

425
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
oh, hi! i'm lila.

426
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
oh, pardon my tits.

427
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,600
um, we thought you were crashing
at your boyfriend's tonight.

428
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,600
we -- we who?

429
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
dexter and i.

430
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,400
could you just...wait here
a minute?

431
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,600
who's the skank?

432
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,900
deb, did knocking occur
to you?

433
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,800
who is she?

434
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,400
and are you trying to fuck her
or set her on fire?

435
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,600
i didn't do this to you when you
were riding square-jaw guy

436
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,000
with the handcuffs.

437
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
that's different. i wasn't cheating on anyone
with gabriel.

438
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,300
how could you do this to rita,
not to mention her kids?

439
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,700
you're like their father.

440
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
<i>hey, rita broke up
with me, okay?</i>

441
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,000
you fucked up, dex...

442
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,700
...big-time.

443
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,715
ew. excuse me.

444
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,940
don't worry.

445
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,105
she just needs some time
to adjust -- that's all.

446
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,100
i had officers tear apart
the stepfather's house --

447
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,350
no murder weapon, but he had
to hide it somewhere.

448
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,590
where is wilson now?
interview room 2.

449
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,315
we still have him?
why didn't his lawyer post bond?

450
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,504
well, he tried, but i pulled in
a favor at the courthouse

451
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:27,350
and got a bail enhancement,

452
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,455
so they had to start
the paperwork all over again.

453
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,345
i'm gonna break
that cocksucker today.

454
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,810
what evidence you say
we got on this guy?

455
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,380
he was dripping
in the victim's blood.

456
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:38,400
he was home alone with her.

457
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,275
they fought the morning of the murder.
all circumstantial.

458
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,975
yeah, but the blood spatter
on his shirt was a direct result

459
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,515
of a blunt-force
beating, maria.

460
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,215
i'd like to see
the blood report.

461
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,025
you'll get it
as soon as i do.

462
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,095
if you're looking for me,
i'll be questioning the suspect.

463
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,225
<i>they're still playing my tune.</i>

464
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,815
<i>it's like i'm conducting
a final symphony,</i>

465
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,260
<i>"requiem for demonic dexter."</i>

466
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,855
<i>and forming the entire
brass section,</i>

467
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,495
<i>sergeant james doakes.</i>

468
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,400
<i>when i reach the end,</i>

469
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,100
<i>maybe i can lay to rest
the monster</i>

470
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,805
<i>formerly known as dexter.</i>

471
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:41,255
<i>just hang in there, mr. wilson.</i>

472
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:58,100
i've asked a psycholinguist
at m.i.t.

473
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:00,025
to analyze our manifesto.

474
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:04,025
his computer tabulates
punctuation, misspellings,

475
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:06,675
and sentence structure
to identify a set of key words,

476
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:09,435
which he'll use to create
a profile of our killer.

477
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,715
sounds...complicated.
stay on it.

478
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,400
okay, we've been at this
too long.

479
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,300
it's, uh, 1:00.

480
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,575
let's break for lunch.

481
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,885
are you all right?

482
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,060
huh? yeah, i'm fine.

483
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,960
anything you want
to talk about?

484
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,205
no, not really.

485
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,455
well,if you change your mind --
it's my brother.

486
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,545
he was dating this chick --

487
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,530
supersweet,
a little doe-eyed.

488
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,470
but, god, for him,
fucking perfect,

489
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,985
and he just threw her away.

490
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:55,005
i'm just pissed at dexter,
not to mention my boyfriend,

491
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,535
who did absolutely
nothing wrong.

492
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,245
but every time he opened
his mouth last night,

493
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,520
i wanted to fucking
slap him.

494
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:01,815
you've been listening
to chopin.

495
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,605
yeah,
i downloaded a chopin --

496
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,215
um, "nocturne number 2
in e flat major."

497
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,830
one of my favorites.

498
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,190
it, uh, can have this effect
on people.

499
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,170
it can stir up some dust.

500
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,880
no shit.

501
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,030
<i>listen, you --
you can heal yourself, sir.</i>

502
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,550
<i>just -- you just need
to talk to me.</i>

503
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,980
<i>get it off you,</i>

504
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
<i>otherwise, it's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.</i>

505
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,245
<i>why don't you
just listen to me?</i>

506
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:38,440
<i>i didn't do this.</i>

507
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,199
<i>you -- you can't say it
and make it true.</i>

508
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,350
<i>you have a conscience,</i>

509
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,420
<i>and it's really fucking
with you right now.</i>

510
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,150
<i>i wish it were me.
i wish i were dead.</i>

511
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>yeah.</i>

512
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,215
why are we questioning
that guy?

513
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,175
he's a murder suspect.

514
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,930
no, he's not.
he's innocent.

515
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,010
what did you say?

516
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,650
my blood report
backed his story.

517
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:02,400
mr. wilson found
his stepdaughter dead,

518
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,300
just like i told sergeant doakes
at the crime scene.

519
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:07,045
you turned in the blood report?
when?

520
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:08,775
i don't know --

521
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,475
at some point
before i went home last night.

522
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,775
i put it right
on the sergeant's desk,

523
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,795
just like he asked.

524
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,460
the green folder.

525
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,710
yeah,
according to my findings,

526
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:23,114
the mist on the stepfather's
shirt was exhaled

527
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,900
from the victim when he tried
to revive her.

528
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:28,150
the autopsy confirmed she had
severe internal bleeding,

529
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,465
due to the bludgeoning.

530
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:31,835
yeah, but he could have
beaten her first.

531
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:33,775
that's impossible.

532
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:38,400
the crime-scene photos show
blood radiating outward

533
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,625
around the victim's body.

534
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,705
that kind of bludgeoning would
have covered the real killer

535
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,745
in blood from head to toe.

536
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,185
thanks.

537
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,930
mr. wilson,
you're free to go.

538
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,050
what the hell? lieutenant,
this man is a killer.

539
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,970
this man has been through enough
for one day.

540
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:00,465
there's an officer
in the hallway.

541
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,100
he'll see that you get
your personal belongings back

542
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:03,930
and take you home.

543
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,410
thank you, ma'am.
thank you so much.

544
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,800
what the hell
are you doing?

545
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,830
trying to save your career,
james, if it isn't too late.

546
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,705
did you even check
the blood report?

547
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,205
<i>i didn't get
the blood report.</i>

548
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,315
it's on your desk,
and it exonerates your suspect.

549
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,680
<i>we should be out there
looking for the real killer.</i>

550
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,520
maria, that is not
what he told me at --

551
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,875
that motherfucker.

552
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,555
he's good.

553
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,185
who?

554
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,595
morgan.

555
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,820
he planned this whole thing.

556
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,955
maria,
that psychopath set me up.

557
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,600
dexter again?
you're blaming dexter for this?

558
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,635
do you have any idea
how pathetic that sounds?

559
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,600
this is not about dexter!

560
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,200
this is about the poor judgment
you have been displaying

561
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,910
in this department
for months now!

562
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,190
you want to work out?

563
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,130
no.

564
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,060
i wasn't talking
about the gym.

565
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,580
you're sweet,
but i'm really not in the mood.

566
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,355
so, what do you want to do?

567
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,830
uh...

568
00:32:25,755 --> 00:32:27,195
i think i want to break up.

569
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,475
for real?

570
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,595
yeah.

571
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,635
is that okay?

572
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,160
no.

573
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,740
no, it's not okay.

574
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,650
fuck, what did i do, deb?

575
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,950
nothing.
i swear to god.

576
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:53,465
you're...smoking hot
and...fun

577
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,175
and...soulful and...

578
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,700
age-appropriate.

579
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,070
and but what?

580
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,080
but...

581
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,760
sometimes the truth speaks
from a peaceful place.

582
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,870
it's taken me a long time
to find that place,

583
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:10,820
but i think i have,

584
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:14,165
and it's telling me you're not
the right one for me.

585
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:24,145
i'm so sorry.

586
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:33,385
you live in a nice
neighborhood.

587
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,555
yeah, i had no idea.

588
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,900
i'm usually passing by
at 35 miles per hour.

589
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,770
i'm not a real big walker.

590
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,425
everybody walks in london.

591
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,035
of course, they're usually
walking to the pub.

592
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,035
<i>how far are we going?</i>

593
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,195
oh, you're a bit grumpy
tonight.

594
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,380
what's wrong?

595
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,310
come on.
don't close up on me now.

596
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
no,
i honestly don't know.

597
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,430
i mean, thanks to you,
things are...

598
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,910
actually looking up.

599
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,950
some people at work
have been...after me.

600
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,700
i think i have 'em
under control.

601
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:21,495
so, why the grouchiness?

602
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,805
is it because your sister thinks
i'm a trollop?

603
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,720
it's not just...deb.

604
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,595
it's the suddenness
of all of this --

605
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
losing rita, the kids.

606
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,585
they've been the only thing
keeping me human

607
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,755
for a long time.

608
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,605
<i>were they keeping you human,
though,</i>

609
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,180
or were they the ones making
you feel like the monster

610
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:56,245
that you were talking about?

611
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,855
keep going.

612
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,320
your friends and family
have to accept you

613
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:09,740
for who you're evolving into
now that you're clean.

614
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,765
is that what i am --

615
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,500
clean?

616
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,505
'cause i don't feel that way
at all.

617
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,830
no, you certainly don't.

618
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,770
mmm, god.

619
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,690
i wish i could fuck you
right now.

620
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,650
whose house is this?

621
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,760
couldn't tell you.

622
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,340
god.

623
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,960
he's a man of many talents.

624
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,230
ah!

625
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,915
look.
i'm some old bitch.

626
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,805
better not press our luck.
we should go.

627
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,180
hello?

628
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,520
hi, dexter.

629
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,405
cody?

630
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,720
can you come
to my school tomorrow?

631
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,420
what's at your school,
buddy?

632
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,965
i'm doing
my cultural report.

633
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,430
saudi arabia.

634
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,125
can you watch me?
i'm kind of scared.

635
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,205
cody,
what are you doing?

636
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,850
who is this?

637
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,595
dexter.

638
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,980
hello?

639
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,120
who was that?

640
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
rita's son.

641
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:20,225
he wants me to come see him
at school tomorrow.

642
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,465
oh, poor kid.

643
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,545
he doesn't understand
that you've gone.

644
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,420
i think i'll go.

645
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,740
whatever you think's best.

646
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,685
hey, guys!

647
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,265
i'm home!

648
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,360
hello?

649
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,930
they're in bed.

650
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,390
why so early?

651
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,450
cody is being punished
for sneaking away

652
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,090
to make a phone call
without permission.

653
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,585
astor joined him in a misguided
show of support.

654
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,110
well, who was cody calling?

655
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,325
dexter.

656
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,230
the boy was trying
to invite him to his school.

657
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,620
can you imagine?
oh.

658
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,045
mom, we need to have a talk.

659
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,275
i made a phone call
of my own today.

660
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,080
i spoke with aunt cecilia.

661
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,040
she told me the school district
fired you almost a year ago.

662
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,070
we had philosophical
differences.

663
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,419
the educational system
is falling apart.

664
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,355
school should be life itself,
not a preparation for living.

665
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,960
do you know that they give
trophies to every child now

666
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:47,610
whether they win or lose?

667
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:48,745
yeah, i finally get it.

668
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:51,715
it took me a few decades,
but it's not just me --

669
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,275
nobody can deal with you.

670
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,520
you don't leave room
for anybody else to exist.

671
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,500
it's not my fault that
so many people are willing

672
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,150
to settle for mediocrity.

673
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,370
just look at you --
first paul, then dexter.

674
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,050
rita, you lack
even common sense,

675
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,840
and now you're passing
that torch of ordinary character

676
00:39:11,845 --> 00:39:13,110
on to your children.

677
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,045
shut the fuck up.

678
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,345
nobody talks about my kids
that way.

679
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,990
thatagirl.

680
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
<i>that's what i've been waiting
to see.</i>

681
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,620
yeah!
i'm done with you.

682
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,065
no, you're not.

683
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,155
but you go --
you give me hell.

684
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,150
no.

685
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,120
<i>no, i won't do that.</i>

686
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,115
i won't let you turn me
into...you.

687
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,140
rita --
here's what's gonna happen --

688
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,849
first thing in the morning,

689
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,380
you're gonna pack up
and go home.

690
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,660
you'll come and visit us
for birthdays and holidays,

691
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,530
but you're not gonna live
with us anymore.

692
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,880
well...

693
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,895
...if that's what i have
to sacrifice

694
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,825
to get you on your feet...

695
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,680
"kill one man,
and you're a murderer.

696
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,200
"kill thousands,
a conqueror.

697
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:18,025
kill them all,
and you're a god."

698
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,700
does it sound to you
like our guy

699
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,715
has a narcissistic
personality disorder,

700
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,395
a classic god complex?

701
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,190
i think you're
onto something, angel.

702
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,404
<i>to tell you the truth,</i>

703
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:29,320
<i>i don't know what
my alter ego had in mind</i>

704
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,405
<i>when he wrote that crap.</i>

705
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,025
<i>i just pulled from various
blogs on the internet,</i>

706
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>mixed and matched --
presto manifesto.</i>

707
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,205
you finally decided
to fight back.

708
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,250
i been waiting.

709
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,850
hope you don't expect me
to comment on that

710
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,200
so you can record it
on your hidden tape recorder.

711
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,270
i wasn't born yesterday.

712
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,285
you might have been,
for all i know.

713
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,400
your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking jimmy hoffa.

714
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:05,669
i tried every avenue,
legal and otherwise,

715
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,275
but there ain't no
paper trail

716
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,130
on the early years
of dexter morgan.

717
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,250
i guess there's no recorder
running, after all.

718
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,415
no, man.

719
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,420
unlike you, i do everything
out in the open.

720
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,850
well, in that case,
sergeant,

721
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:26,245
let me put this in the open
for you.

722
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,855
no matter what you try,
no matter when,

723
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,405
no matter how hard you work,

724
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,545
i'll always be a step ahead
of you for one simple reason.

725
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,790
and what's that?

726
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,920
i own you.

727
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,400
aah!

728
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,350
aah! fuck!

729
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,910
get him off of me!
get off me!

730
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,880
why are you doing this?!

731
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,480
stop!

732
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,315
i want your gun, your badge,
and your police i.d.

733
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,510
i want your
access card, too --

734
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,310
now!

735
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,570
type a statement
that sergeant doakes

736
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,500
is on administrative leave,

737
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:29,520
pending an internal affairs
investigation.

738
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,215
you two,
get him out of here.

739
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,150
thanks.

740
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,480
what the hell happened?

741
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,485
i don't know.
he just...jumped me.

742
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,085
that guy's always
had it out for me.

743
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,430
thanks for meeting
with me, don.

744
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,565
well, i don't know
what the point is.

745
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,270
the district court injunction
hearing starts in three hours.

746
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,590
which everyone here knows
we're going to lose.

747
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,835
don't look so shocked.
we always lose these things.

748
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,625
you bastards
and your free speech.

749
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,370
my boss never
lets me say anything.

750
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,050
i'll tell you what --

751
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,350
i will agree to dropping
the injunction,

752
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,100
which will save us days
of courtroom arguments

753
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,570
and a boatload
of legal fees,

754
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,699
if we can agree
on some simple ground rules

755
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,600
on how you publish
that document.

756
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,800
"ground rules."

757
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,895
we're not gonna have
any ground rules.

758
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,360
my only goal here is to avoid
compromising an investigation

759
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:51,500
of a mass murderer...

760
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:53,915
who could hurt
a lot more people.

761
00:43:56,945 --> 00:43:58,545
give me just a second,
will you, frank?

762
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,645
i can't believe
you got those assholes

763
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,349
to publish the manifesto
without the victims' names

764
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,375
and as a page-3 story.

765
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,255
no sense hyping it.

766
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,390
it might just inspire the killer
to greater heights.

767
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,370
wait.

768
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,900
it's quiet here...

769
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,700
peaceful.

770
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,450
it's a good spot.

771
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,150
for what?

772
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,095
it's 1:00.

773
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,920
so it is.

774
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,855
i brought my own sandwich.

775
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,030
i thought you didn't like
the quiet, morgan.

776
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,240
i didn't.

777
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,130
i don't.

778
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,165
when i'm alone
and it's quiet, i get scared...

779
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,905
shitless,

780
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,815
like i start hearing
what's really going on inside.

781
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,740
i see.

782
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,500
so if it's all the same
to you,

783
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:07,605
maybe i can just practice
when you're around.

784
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:10,175
okay.

785
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:13,635
'cause when you're around,

786
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,345
i kind of feel like i can deal
with anything, you know?

787
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,345
like what happened to me --

788
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,780
i don't have to run from it.

789
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,555
i don't have to jump into bed
with some guy and hide there.

790
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,545
you give me strength.

791
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,415
i'm kind of
opening up here.

792
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,490
what do you want me to say?

793
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:50,930
i don't know.

794
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,060
you're the fucking zen master.
figure it out.

795
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,795
morgan...

796
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,760
i've got plaque
in my arteries.

797
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,060
i know the lyrics
to elevator music.

798
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,950
my hair isn't getting
any thicker.

799
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,450
you're gonna do great
up there.

800
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:48,640
you just have
to remember something --

801
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,495
they're more frightened
than you are.

802
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,960
no, they're not.

803
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,590
are so.

804
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,140
you're gonna be staring at them
the whole time.

805
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,944
if one of those unsuspecting
moms or dads

806
00:46:56,945 --> 00:46:59,345
does something embarrassing
while you're up on stage...

807
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:00,345
like pick their nose?

808
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:02,325
...you're gonna be the one
who sees it.

809
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:04,000
yeah.

810
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,175
now that's power.

811
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,920
now go have fun.

812
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,565
dexter, over here.
we saved you a seat.

813
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,555
thanks, guys.

814
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,860
there you go -- $18,000.

815
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,695
i'll send a truck
for the piece tomorrow.

816
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,900
i am telling you, lila,

817
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,320
this is going to create
a critical mass for you.

818
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,430
according to the
psycholinguistic analysis

819
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,380
of the manifesto,

820
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:40,205
our killer is a white male
in his 50s.

821
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,400
what else?

822
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:44,604
uh, the killer
has no girlfriends

823
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:47,385
and considers himself
a good catholic.

824
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,175
hold on.
hold on. hold on.

825
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,379
how can you tell all that
by putting words in a computer?

826
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,280
i don't know, dude.
it's science.

827
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,660
how 'bout common sense?

828
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,660
i think the guy that
we're looking for is
pissed off at god,

829
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,105
and that's why
he kills people.

830
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,030
really? i actually found him
very politically motivated.

831
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:02,900
yeah, like a modern-day
revolutionary.

832
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,275
which would suggest that
he's killing for social change.

833
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,495
this is what he wants.

834
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,315
what's that?

835
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,755
confusion, chaos --

836
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:20,325
it's what the killer wants.

837
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:24,215
he's always been an intensely
private figure,

838
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,985
dispatching victims silently.

839
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:29,365
now he's suddenly a media whore?
it doesn't make sense.

840
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:31,485
he's creating
a clusterfuck.

841
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:33,325
very good, officer morgan.

842
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:35,135
the killer's making us
chase our tails.

843
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,555
you know what that means?

844
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,800
he knows how we work.

845
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,565
look how he hits
every major theme --

846
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,770
political,
environmental, religious.

847
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,300
in one section, he manages to
weave together julius caesar,

848
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,080
berlin, germany, the pittsburgh
steelers, and gandhi.

849
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,100
it's scattershot.

850
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,950
he knew that this would
send us scurrying

851
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:13,250
like squirrels for nuts.

852
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,075
yeah, but to suggest that
he might be one of us --

853
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,115
how can you be sure?

854
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,320
hi, i'm cody,
and i researched saudi arabia

855
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:27,735
for my cultural report.

856
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:29,404
my board is covered in sand

857
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:33,115
because saudi arabia
is one big desert.

858
00:49:33,645 --> 00:49:37,625
as you can see, i used coffee
beans to write "saudi arabia."

859
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,415
arabic coffee is very famous.

860
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,305
<i>i'm a little confused.</i>

861
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:44,955
<i>lila is the one showing me
how to take control,</i>

862
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,185
<i>stop killing,
get my life clean.</i>

863
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,700
<i>but this is the first time
since i went into recovery</i>

864
00:49:51,705 --> 00:49:53,440
<i>that i actually feel clean.</i>

865
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,605
the children in saudi arabia
are just like us,

866
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,540
because they...

867
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,210
this is the saudi arabian flag.

868
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,110
the arabic letters mean
"there is no god except allah."

869
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,630
do you know how tough it is
for a woman in saudi arabia?

870
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,215
they can't drive or have
powerful jobs.

871
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,540
or get this -- they can't even
go to the movies

872
00:50:57,545 --> 00:50:59,250
without men's permission.

873
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,570
after they turn 12, they have
to wear long black sleeves,

874
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,790
and they can't hardly even talk
to men until they get married.

875
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,350
