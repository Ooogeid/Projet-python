第1季 第4集</font>

4
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,488
Previously on "dexter"...

5
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:49,840
dexter: No blood. 

6
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:51,802
What a beautiful idea. 

7
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:53,166
Refrigerated truck. 

8
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,411
He wants a cold environment...

9
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,819
to slow the flow of blood. 

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,043
I suppose I should be upset,

11
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:02,361
but I'm not. 

12
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:05,199
In fact, I think this is a friendly message,

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,049
kind of like,"hey, want to play ? "

14
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:11,116
Kara, it's me. It's james. 

15
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,638
You just opened a dangerous door. 

16
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,267
No, man. You did...

17
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,496
when you murdered a cop and an innocent lady. 

18
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:23,150
Was kara sleeping with someone other than ricky ? 

19
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,021
Was it you ? 

20
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:27,664
What the fuck were you thinking ? 

21
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:31,235
- Going out tonight with the guys,blow off steam. You in ? 
- Hey, man. Sounds good. 

22
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,437
I thought you said you wanted to go get shit-faced. 

23
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,287
I am shit-faced. 

24
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,639
I showed my face to guerrero,his whole church. 

25
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,109
They're gonna think I'm behind this shit. 

26
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,772
You fucked my sister. 

27
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:44,386
You fucked a cop's wife. 

28
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,709
Now you're just fucked,buddy. 

29
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,505
He's escalating the thrill,

30
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:54,650
posing his victim in the middle of 
a 20,000-seat arena for all miami to see,

31
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,983
to show us what he's capable of doing. 

32
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,512
What did I miss ? 

33
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,302
Fingertips. 

34
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,634
Fuckin'-a,that's my girl. 

35
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,401
This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck. 

36
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:05,843
Ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:08,206
I give you tony tucci,

38
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,870
the ice-truck killer. 

39
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:10,638
Bullshit. 

40
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,536
Of course I agree with my sister,

41
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,856
but unlike her, I'm not upset. 

42
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:18,342
He's still out there,and I'm waiting...

43
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,526
breathless. 

44
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:25,753
Let's give the boy a hand

45
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:39,909
I find people around me are always 
making some kind of connection,

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,039
like friendship or romance,

47
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,219
but human bonds always lead to 
messy complications...

48
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,626
commitment, sharing,

49
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:51,264
driving people to the airport. 

50
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,991
Besides, if I let someone get that close,
they'd see who I really am...

51
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:58,563
and I can't let that happen. 

52
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,997
So...time to put on my mask. 

53
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,460
I need your expertise. 

54
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,045
I live to serve. 

55
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:11,000
Excuse us, fellas. 

56
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:18,064
Interesting hand job. 

57
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:20,385
That's funny. 

58
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,948
It is ? 

59
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:26,222
So, how long you think it's been there ? 

60
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,993
This feels familiar. 

61
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,215
Okay. 

62
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,543
So, how long's it been there ? 

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,195
Blood stopped pooling,

64
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,488
still wet...couple hours at the most. 

65
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,780
What time was it found ? 

66
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:48,037
A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30. 

67
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,075
No prints. Wiped clean. 

68
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,454
Real creep show, huh ? 

69
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,287
Any sign of the rest of the body ? 

70
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:55,179
Just mr.  Hand. 

71
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,593
Do you think this is our guy's work ? 

72
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:59,463
The ice-truck killer ? 

73
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,451
It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different. 

74
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:06,990
Plus, it's a male victim --haven't seen that before. 

75
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:10,346
The cut appears to be almost delicate. 

76
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:13,135
You see between the first and 
second row of carpals...

77
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,892
very surgical. 

78
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,883
Check out what else he left behind. 

79
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,241
A little postcard

80
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,411
to remember him by. 

81
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,497
How far is rand beach from here ? 

82
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,223
This is rand beach. 

83
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,749
It was renamed petrie beach a few years ago. 

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,074
Okay, everybody. 

85
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:58,379
Everybody say "stinky feet. "

86
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,709
Stinky feet ! 

87
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,158
Wait.  Nobody move. 

88
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,354
Dexter, were you smiling ? 

89
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:04,332
No. 

90
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,288
Okay,we'll do another one. 

91
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,573
This time, everybody smiles. You, too, dex. 

92
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,144
Yeah, pretend you're burning ants. 

93
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,765
Shut your damn face,deb. 

94
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,299
Hey, language, please. 

95
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,788
What ? She always talks like that. 

96
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,326
Enough, you two. 

97
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:16,867
Dexter, come here. 

98
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:23,529
What's your problem ? 

99
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,208
I hate the beach. 
It's sandy and gross and nasty,and I want to go home. 

100
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:27,957
Too bad. 

101
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,389
You're part of a family. 

102
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,707
And being part of a family means smiling for photos. 

103
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,661
Why should I pretend I'm happy ? 

104
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:40,512
Because it'll make your mom happy,

105
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,072
and because it's how you fit in. 

106
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,832
Remember we talked about that ? 

107
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,109
Yeah. 

108
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,620
This is how you do it. 

109
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,369
When somebody takes your picture, you smile. 

110
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,945
It doesn't matter if you're happy or not. 

111
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,150
You just do it to fit in. 

112
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,074
- Okay ? 
- Okay. 

113
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,236
All right. 

114
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,964
Come here, handsome. 

115
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:03,247
Okay. 

116
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,618
Everybody ready ? 

117
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,081
One more time. 

118
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,839
Stinky feet ! 

119
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:19,611
Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment 
to pick up a few labs. 

120
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:22,553
Straight to the station after,yeah.  
Thanks, lieutenant. 

121
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,716
Dexter morgan,

122
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,631
this is your life. 

123
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,402
It is my new friend --the ice-truck killer. 

124
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,996
When he broke into my apartment,he took 
some time to get to know me...

125
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,601
my life. . 

126
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:54,239
my secrets. 

127
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:08,504
...Have even brought in manpower from other counties
in an effort to expedite the search. 

128
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:11,255
Officially, mr.  Tucci has not been 
charged with any crime...

129
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:14,283
then tell the fucking governor to 
free up funds for overtime. 

130
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:18,865
I mean The more guys I got out there,
the sooner we find tucci. 

131
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,123
Uh, kelly,I'll get back to you. 

132
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,431
...Is still the department's top priority. 

133
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:26,897
What's wrong ? 

134
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,610
Fingerprint I. D.  Came back on that 
hand from the beach. 

135
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,206
It belongs to tony tucci,

136
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,699
your ice-truck killer suspect. 

137
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:35,350
What ? 

138
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:40,085
Wait a minute. 

139
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,476
No.  No, no, no. No way. 

140
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,517
No way. 

141
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,651
I mean, this --

142
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,030
this has to be a mistake. 

143
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:54,878
The mistake was unleashing a high-profile 
manhunt before you had all the facts. 

144
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,303
Okay. 

145
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,564
This doesn't mean that tucci is not the killer. 

146
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,199
Don'T. 

147
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,602
Just...just don't. 

148
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,093
You wanted to be on tv --well, get ready...

149
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,809
'cause the press will annihilate us for this. 

150
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,499
We'll be lucky if tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit. 

151
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,213
All right. 

152
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,013
You go talk to that woman. 

153
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,630
Do your mea culpas. 

154
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,146
If we handle this right,

155
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:31,686
maybe we can mitigate the fallout. 

156
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,494
Tom...

157
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:36,655
I'm the last person she wants to see. 

158
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,680
I called her son a killer. 

159
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:41,665
And now's your chance to make it right. 

160
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,190
*************

161
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,424
I'm taking point. 

162
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:07,244
You can help by getting all nonessentials off the beach. 

163
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,082
Secure and separate any witnesses, all right ? 

164
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,273
Will do. 

165
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,231
What did the captain say ? 

166
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,010
Did he make her cry ? 

167
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,109
Just control the fucking beach, angel. 

168
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,978
I knew tucci wasn't the killer. I knew it. 

169
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,777
Laguerta whipped up a manhunt r a rent-a-cop. 

170
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, man, I wish I could have been there 
to see the captain rip her a new one. 

171
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,996
Morgan, calm down. 

172
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,253
Laguerta insulted the real killer's intelligence,

173
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:38,665
and now he's getting back at us 
for chasing after the wrong guy. 

174
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,026
You see all these people over here ? 

175
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:40,702
Yeah. 

176
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,463
What are they ? 

177
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:43,909
Uh, potential witnesses. 

178
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,873
And what do we do with potential witnesses, morgan ? 

179
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,676
We --we interview them. 

180
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,304
Got it. 

181
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,771
Where is he...

182
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:06,387
the rest of him ? 

183
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:11,178
We're --we're still looking. 

184
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,407
The entire force is looking. 

185
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:13,644
We're making every effort. 

186
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:14,915
Are you sure it's tony ? 

187
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,806
Because...

188
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,326
yes. 

189
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,842
I'm afraid so. 

190
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,080
Mrs.  Tucci...

191
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,469
I said some very harsh things about your son. 

192
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,544
Thank you. 

193
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:40,780
"Thank you" ? For what ? 

194
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,685
For coming to tell me in person. 

195
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,535
For god's sake,please. 

196
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,614
There's nothing more important than this. 

197
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:52,046
Can you find my son's body ? 

198
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:55,028
If it's the last thing I do. 

199
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:59,926
- I made a grave...
- bring him home, please. 

200
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,310
I just want to bury my son. 

201
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,393
I do love halloween. 

202
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,206
What's inside of a pumpkin ? 

203
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,716
See for yourself. 

204
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:25,849
You don't like this stuff ? I do. 

205
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,696
Come on. Get in there. 

206
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,093
I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow. 

207
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:37,522
There he is again,mom. 

208
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,686
My god. It's every night now. 

209
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:42,016
That dog ? Where's it coming from ? 

210
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,997
Next door --my neighbor'S. 

211
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,821
Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night. 

212
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:47,841
It's been getting worse. 

213
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:52,033
I mean,I would talk to her,
but I don't want to start something. 

214
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,753
Listen to him, mom. He's so sad. 

215
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:57,755
I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep. 

216
00:12:57,756 --> 00:12:59,982
Do you want me to talk to her ? 

217
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,672
No,you don't have to do that. 

218
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,563
I insist. 

219
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,534
Hello. 

220
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,314
I don't think we've meet

221
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,255
boyfriend of the blonde next door. 

222
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,257
I've seen you around. 

223
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,022
Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired. 

224
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,180
That's precisely why I'm here. 

225
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:42,960
We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries...

226
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:44,716
- a lot. 
- I know. 

227
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,663
My ex moved out and left his dog. 

228
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,113
Oh. 

229
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:50,373
Trust me, I wish there was something I could do. 

230
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:53,685
You could, uh,take him inside. 

231
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:55,480
Walter's an outside dog. 

232
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,550
You put walter inside,walter's an inside dog. 

233
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,346
He doesn't like being inside. 

234
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,870
Did he tell you that ? 

235
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:09,826
We'd appreciate it if you could find 
a way to keep him quiet. 

236
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:11,211
The kids are upset. 

237
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:16,326
Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead 
father is gonna come back and beat their asses again. 

238
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,086
You know what works for me ? 

239
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,042
Earplugs. 

240
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:33,573
I could make things so much easier for rita...

241
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,576
but that would be wrong. 

242
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,796
I love halloween --

243
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,229
the one time of year when everyone wears a mask...

244
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,076
not just me. 

245
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,678
People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster. 

246
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,975
Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not. 

247
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:05,720
Brother, friend, boyfriend...all part 
of my costume collection. 

248
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:11,457
Some people might call me a fraud. 

249
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,640
Let's see if it will fit. 

250
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,860
You stabbed me in the back ! 

251
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:23,830
I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise. 

252
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,311
They're so excited. 

253
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:30,365
Sure they are.  They get to binge 
on sugar for an entire day. 

254
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,894
Who wouldn't love that ? 

255
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,363
What about a costume for you ? 

256
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,838
Maybe this one ? 

257
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,561
no.  No.  I think I'll be snow white again. 

258
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:40,941
It's kind of tradition. 

259
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,155
Oh. 

260
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,910
Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too. 

261
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,307
Just like your mom --two perfect princesses. 

262
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,419
Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf. 

263
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,122
No way.  I want to be joe from "blue's clues. "

264
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:58,456
I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume. 

265
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,443
Another photo from my family album. 

266
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:12,912
He's re-creating my past with tony tucci's body parts. 

267
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:15,460
He's forcing me to see this. 

268
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:18,852
Nobody paying you to stand around and goddamn stare. 

269
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,705
I thought angel was working this case, sergeant. 

270
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,873
Sergeant ? 

271
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,915
Friends of yours ? 

272
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,020
Don't worry about it. 

273
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,980
Worry about this. 

274
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,116
The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus. 

275
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:39,340
The wound is circular --again, almost surgical. 

276
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:41,692
And there's blood. 

277
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,395
Guy gives us body after body with no blood. 

278
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,509
Why he's making a switch now ? 

279
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,121
He's trying to send a message...

280
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:53,008
one that's more important than his ritual 
need to drain the blood and wrap the parts. 

281
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,421
Okay,so what's the message ? 

282
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,793
I'm not sure. 

283
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:59,050
Well,who's he sending it to ? 

284
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:02,367
I can't tell you that,either. 

285
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:05,610
What fucking good are you ? 

286
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,738
No fucking good at all,apparently. 

287
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,000
You okay ? 

288
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,733
he's mocking me. 

289
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,319
Don't take it personal. 

290
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,265
Doakes hates all you lab geeks. 

291
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,827
Who ?  Oh. 

292
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,613
- Relax, bro. 
- Sorry. 

293
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,128
I need to bag this photo

294
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,006
under the ball.  Do you mind ? 

295
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,489
He knows. 

296
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,062
He's not corrupting the happy 
hallmark images of my youth. 

297
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:57,504
He's revealing the ugly truth behind them. 

298
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,019
Come on, simon. 

299
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,155
You want it ? 

300
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,485
It's right there. 

301
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:04,790
- Over there. 
- Oh, yeah. 

302
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,987
Guys, give it back ! Pass it over here. 

303
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,556
You guys,give it back. Come on, simon. 

304
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:10,455
What you gonna do ? 

305
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,074
All right. Enough. 

306
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,423
Get out of here. 

307
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:23,341
What the hell is going on ? 

308
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:24,415
We're just having fun. 

309
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,079
It didn't look like simon was having too much fun. 

310
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,518
You're always telling me to fit in,and 
I'm just trying to be part of the team. 

311
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,603
You can't be a bully,dexter. 

312
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:35,629
First of all it's wrong. 

313
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,068
Secondly,people remember bullies. 

314
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:40,375
People like me --cops. 

315
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,691
A bully is a felony waiting to happen. 

316
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,335
So...

317
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:48,196
blend in. 

318
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:50,948
Go on. 

319
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:03,348
Officer morgan,I have an assignment for you. 

320
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,034
I heard we found a foot this morning. 

321
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:06,820
You want me to head out to the crime scene ? 

322
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:08,576
No. 

323
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:11,837
Look, we pulled these from security 
cameras around the beach...

324
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:14,036
stores, hotels, atms. 

325
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,260
I want you to check every frame. 

326
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,719
Oh,you are shitting me. 

327
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,315
If we're lucky,we can see the 
ice-truck killer coming and going. 

328
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,276
We have techs who can do this. 

329
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:26,040
Not all techs have the skill to 
spot suspicious activity. 

330
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,726
I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do. 

331
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,852
Keep your eye out for another box 
of surveillance tapes. 

332
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,681
It's on its way from the new crime scene. 

333
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,698
Hey, doakes, what's up ? 

334
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,459
Fuck anyone's wife lately ? 

335
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,585
Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt,

336
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,551
guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. 

337
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,509
Did you know that ? 

338
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,089
That's not good,james. 

339
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,135
You should alert the police...

340
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,525
unless, of course,for some reason the officers 
of miami metro wouldn't want to help you...

341
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,307
like, you know,you fucked one of their wives. 

342
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,424
You think this is a joke. 

343
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:25,741
I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when. 

344
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:29,395
You should have thought of that before 
you stuck your dick in my sister. 

345
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,280
You're right. 

346
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,683
I should have waited until the divorce came through. 

347
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,331
Bullshit. 

348
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:41,027
What ? She didn't tell you ? 

349
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:44,062
She filed the papers,jackass. 

350
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,239
You don't believe me,ask the captain. 

351
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,734
He tried to pull ricky out of his assignment,
but ricky didn't want to come out. 

352
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,635
Of course not.  His job was to bring down guerrero. 

353
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:54,352
It was his job to protect his wife. 

354
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,958
Ricky's the motherfucker who got her killed. 

355
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,922
You backed the wrong cop,asshole. 

356
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:09,493
Let's go, guys. Time for school. 

357
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:13,297
Guys ?  Come on. 

358
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:16,060
You don't want to be in the halloween parade ? 

359
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,499
Shut up ! 

360
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:27,740
Shut up !  Just --

361
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,248
I need to talk to you about your dog. 

362
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,418
I talked to your boyfriend. 

363
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,078
My kids are exhausted. 

364
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,465
All right,when it comes to my kids,I stop being nice. 

365
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,375
So I need you to bring him in at night,
feed him on a schedule,

366
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:45,786
and take him for some exercise every now and...

367
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,075
I'm sorry. 

368
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:49,479
Is this funny ? 

369
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,399
No, no, no. 

370
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,868
It's...it's sad. 

371
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,248
But you're funny. 

372
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,598
Look at you, all tough. 

373
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,870
I-I'm gonna call the police. I can do that. 

374
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,499
There's nothing you can do. 

375
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,882
The cops will tell meto keep him quiet,

376
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:09,057
and I'll say I will,and then they'll leave,
and he'll go back to doing what he does. 

377
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,324
But you're funny. 

378
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:46,493
Unlike harry,my new friend doesn't 
place much value in blending in. 

379
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:50,108
He wants me to see who he is and what he does. 

380
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:55,104
Everything about him is brazen,authentic. 

381
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,562
What does that make me ? 

382
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:00,649
Crap. 

383
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:08,851
You okay, man ? 

384
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:09,795
No. 

385
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:12,127
Hey, don't let this bastard get to you. 

386
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,574
You're the best blood expert in the state,

387
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:16,419
and we need you to stay with this, my friend. 

388
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,517
I'll be all right. 

389
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,934
Wait. Before you get back to work,

390
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,869
check this out. 

391
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:27,988
What is that,a butterfly ? 

392
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,139
No, socio,

393
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,310
it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover. 

394
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,781
I'm, uh,

395
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,938
I'm giving it to nina for our anniversary tomorrow night. 

396
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:39,814
Oh, congratulations. 

397
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:40,955
How many years ? 

398
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,946
10 years she's been my lucky charm now. 

399
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:48,882
Tin is the traditional gift,but 
I didn't think she'd want a tin clover. 

400
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,162
No. It's probably a good plan. 

401
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,173
Are you sure that's not a butterfly ? 

402
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:59,428
Well, it does kind of look like a bug. 

403
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:04,221
This can't be right. 

404
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:05,631
What's up ? 

405
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:08,470
You see that ? You see it ? 

406
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,744
I don't know. What do I see ? 

407
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,591
The blood flow in the hand suggested the 
heart was still pumping when it was severed. 

408
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:15,789
Mean son of a bitch,no doubt. 

409
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,352
But look at the foot. It's the same 
blood flow,plus the lividity. 

410
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:23,846
Look, it's the same bruising,same 
ashen color,same level of decomposition

411
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,360
as the hand the day we found it. 

412
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,673
But...

413
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,170
we found them a day apart. 

414
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,927
I know. 

415
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:35,623
Los santos. 

416
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,583
Hollywood, fl...

417
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,150
L. T. ,You got to listen to him. 

418
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,320
It's the guard, tucci...

419
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,098
I think he's alive. 

420
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,034
What are you talking about ? 

421
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:50,970
The ice-truck killer is keeping him 
alive to perform amputations. 

422
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:52,308
Tucci's alive ? 

423
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,920
Both limbs were taken from a live body,

424
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,300
and we found them 24 hours apart. 

425
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:58,485
That's not all. 

426
00:24:58,486 --> 00:24:59,486
Tell them, dexter. 

427
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:03,210
If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A. M. 
And the foot this morning at 7:00...

428
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,600
we get another body part first thing tomorrow. 

429
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,672
But he's alive. 

430
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,881
Put together a task force. I want all 
available personnel on this,

431
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:14,594
and put a priority status on all 
forensics related to this case. 

432
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,343
Captain matthews, please. 

433
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,678
Have him call me back immediately. 

434
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:46,092
Mrs.  Tucci ? 

435
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,673
Maria laguerta. 

436
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:52,590
I have some amazing news for you. 

437
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:56,331
We believe your son is alive. 

438
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,540
No.  No.  We haven't,but I promise we will. 

439
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,015
No, thank you. 

440
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:07,532
Yes.  Yes. 

441
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,159
Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye. 

442
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,557
Doakes: We've got a live body now, people. 

443
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,735
We want to find tucci while he's still breathing. 

444
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:23,602
That means trying to figure out 
where tomorrow's drop is

445
00:26:23,603 --> 00:26:25,435
so we catch our man in the act. 

446
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:27,425
Any ideas ? 

447
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:30,905
Don't forget the photos. They're new. 

448
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:34,952
Thank you, officer morgan. We're doing just fine out here. 

449
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,910
Why do we think he's taking photos ? 

450
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:38,652
He wants to be remembered. 

451
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:41,561
You use photos to record memories. 

452
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,430
I almost feel sorry for them,

453
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:48,252
trying to put together a puzzle when they don't 
know pieces are missing from the box...

454
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,203
pieces he gave me. 

455
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:58,116
He wants me to play the game his way. 

456
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:01,440
Okay,what else could it be ? 

457
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:03,283
Change. 

458
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,341
You got something to say,speak up. 

459
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:12,322
The beach changed names. The office 
park used to be a soccer field. 

460
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:16,958
He's dumping the body parts in places 
that used to be something else. 

461
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,832
Okay. Places that have changed. 

462
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,059
Let's make a list,

463
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,573
assign surveillance to each 
location for the morning. 

464
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,409
South beach used to be a mangrove swamp. 

465
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,326
Homestead park was originally an air force base, right ? 

466
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:32,207
They turned versace's mansion into a hotel. 

467
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,566
Thank you,officer morgan. 

468
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,442
The whole city of miami reinvents itself every 5 years. 

469
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:39,899
Then we'll stay up all night 
until our list is complete. 

470
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:44,630
I once was lost

471
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:52,008
but now I'm found was blind

472
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:58,588
but now I see

473
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,815
lieutenant. 

474
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,879
Anything ? 

475
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:24,273
Well, I am so glad you could make it. 

476
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:27,470
Well, I just came by to show my support. 

477
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:32,247
It's been a long time since I've been to church. 

478
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:35,977
Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me. 

479
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:40,344
Um, I would like to introduce you 
to someone very special. 

480
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,768
This is maria laguerta. 

481
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,291
She's the policewoman looking for tony. 

482
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,204
Not just me. 

483
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:52,465
Actually,there's a lot of us looking. 

484
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:58,337
You brought us all here together by giving us hope. 

485
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:05,176
May the lord bless you

486
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:08,001
and guide you, maria. 

487
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,415
This is saint anthony,

488
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:14,238
- patron saint of
- the lost. 

489
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,044
Find him. 

490
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,041
Okay. 

491
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,964
I tried to apologize, but i couldn't get a word in edgewise. 

492
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,516
And you wanted to apologize why ? 

493
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,902
You don't think I should,the way I went after her son ? 

494
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,358
Yeah,you did fuck that up. 

495
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:37,209
Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts. 

496
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:41,670
I need to tell her that I'm sorry. 

497
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,761
I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her. 

498
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,687
Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her ? 

499
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:52,722
Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya. "

500
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,009
So, ere we at ? 

501
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:03,727
I added additional patrols at dolphin stadium,

502
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:06,225
bayside marketplace,and casa casuarina. 

503
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,446
That's everybody we have out in the field --

504
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,561
homicide, robbery,off-duty patrol. 

505
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,219
So what's next ? 

506
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,715
What's next is you should go home. 

507
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,829
You've had the shit kicked out of you all day. 

508
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,591
I like it here with you. You're the only 
person people hate more than me. 

509
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:25,397
Come on. Let's both get out of here. 

510
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:28,009
Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway. 

511
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,484
Officer morgan. 

512
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:47,125
Call me on my cellphone if you find anything. 

513
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,088
What ?  Huh ? 

514
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,293
Want a piece of me ? 

515
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,252
Fucking asshole ! 

516
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:27,913
Debra: I will pay you $1 million

517
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:31,716
if you help me figure out where the next piece of tucci's gonna show up. 

518
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:34,054
I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, deb. 

519
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:35,939
It's like it's staring me right in the face, but --

520
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,979
$1 million. 

521
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,904
You don't have $1 million. 

522
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:42,164
I'll steal it from evidence. 

523
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,671
I've been stuck in a goddamn fishbowl all day. 

524
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,286
I want to be part of the hunt. 

525
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,758
I'm almost off duty. 

526
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,680
Sorry, sister. 

527
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,641
$2 million. 

528
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:54,089
I know you made a list of locations. 

529
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,157
Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together. 

530
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:59,805
My favorite spot. 

531
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,288
Of course. 

532
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,195
Come on. I want to play. 

533
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:11,574
Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow,okay ? 

534
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:20,083
I used to love this place --

535
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:24,578
the bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after 
layer,right into the earth itself,

536
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:27,032
burying it,hiding it. 

537
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,490
I found it soothing. 

538
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:35,983
But it wasn't condos back then. 

539
00:32:37,953 --> 00:32:40,765
This has to be the right place. 

540
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,735
So what am I missing ? 

541
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,640
Sorry about that. 

542
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,460
Go back to sleep. 

543
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:30,168
Hello. 

544
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:33,904
Woman: Mr.  Morgan ? Dispatch. You've been 
called to the mccaffrey pumpkin patch. 

545
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,485
Do you need the address ? 

546
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:39,415
No,I know exactly where it is. 

547
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,089
- Are you okay ? 
- Are you kidding ? That was awesome. 

548
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:48,489
You've got some hay in your hair. 

549
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:49,590
Where ? 

550
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:51,161
Right there ! 

551
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:53,257
Okay, okay, okay, okay. 

552
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:55,545
Enough.  Enough, you two. Come on. 

553
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,278
Let me take a picture of you and the kids. 

554
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,056
You'll miss these moments when they're older. 

555
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:02,522
Thanks. 

556
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,827
It's great to see you having such a good time, dex. 

557
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:08,285
Are you kidding me ? This hay's giving me 
a total allergy attack,

558
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:10,781
and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. 
I don't get it. 

559
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,196
Ready ? 

560
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,404
Smile ! 

561
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:19,627
What do we have ? 

562
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,696
Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg. 

563
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,934
You think tucci's still alive ? 

564
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:31,710
If he is,he won't be for long. 

565
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,938
Unless you're toting a portable dvd player,

566
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,652
you better be finished watching that security footage. 

567
00:34:41,653 --> 00:34:45,088
I am on break. I'm on my own time. 

568
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,938
So you are, but your shift starts in two hours. 

569
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,592
So if I were you,I'd head back to the station

570
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:53,276
Traffic at this hour's a bitch. 

571
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,462
Speaking of bitch...

572
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,025
didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids ? 

573
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:01,605
I don't remember. 

574
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:04,275
Hey, dexter, come here. Take a look at this. 

575
00:35:04,284 --> 00:35:05,970
Excuse us. 

576
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,768
She's right, you know,about the traffic. 

577
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,424
It's interesting. There's no sign 
of infection where the foot was cut off,

578
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:20,872
like he gave tucci prophylactic 
antibiotics before amputating. 

579
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:23,833
At least he's looking after his patient. 

580
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,981
Hey, check this out. 

581
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:31,757
Is this appropriate ? 

582
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:36,433
It's our anniversary...and it's the big one. 

583
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:39,075
Nina deserves the best. 

584
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:41,896
"Ox" ? 

585
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:46,260
No.  Fuck ! 

586
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:48,822
What's the matter with you ? It's x's and o'S. 

587
00:35:49,204 --> 00:35:50,144
Like tic-tac-toe ? 

588
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,170
No,like hugs and kisses. 

589
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:57,972
Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting. 

590
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:03,573
Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to 
look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head. 

591
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:09,440
God da it. 

592
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,378
Where's mom ? 

593
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:20,155
She had to run a few errands before 
she takes you two trick-or-treating. 

594
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,754
But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating. 

595
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:25,161
I heard you two were up a lot last night. 

596
00:36:25,162 --> 00:36:27,275
It was that damn dog. 

597
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:30,305
Hey, code, grown-up language is for grown-ups. 

598
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:32,376
I don't think that dog will be 
bothering you anymore. 

599
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:33,928
How do you know ? 

600
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,660
My mystic powers told me. 

601
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:38,751
Heard lindsay lohan say "damn. "

602
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:40,742
All right, tell you what --I'll make you a deal. 

603
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:43,811
When you become a rock star,you can swear, too. 

604
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:46,812
Walter !  Walter ! 

605
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:50,089
You're right. He's gone. 

606
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,113
Where's my dog ?  ! What did you do with it ?  ! 

607
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,592
All right. Here he is. 

608
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:19,687
Just remember to walk him,feed him, and love him,okay ? 

609
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,744
My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to rita. 

610
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,519
Thank you. Thank you. 

611
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:30,462
They already made a doggy bed --sweaters, towels. 

612
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:33,452
It actually looks more comfortable than my bed. 

613
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,351
I knew this would be a perfect fit. 

614
00:37:36,352 --> 00:37:39,484
You did a good thing, rita. Thank you. 

615
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,859
Harry was the only one who saw me...

616
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,024
really saw me...

617
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,496
so he taught me to hide. 

618
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:54,055
That's what's kept me safe. 

619
00:37:54,987 --> 00:38:00,970
But sometimes, I'm not sure where harry's 
vision of me ends and the real me starts. 

620
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:05,196
If I'm just a collection of learned 
behaviors...bits and pieces of harry...

621
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:07,069
maybe my new friend is right. 

622
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,095
Maybe I am a fraud. 

623
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,435
Hi. 

624
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:27,746
Hey. 

625
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,707
Where's astor and cody ? 

626
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:38,064
They're passed out in a sugar coma at colleen'S. 

627
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:42,947
Um, can I come in ? 

628
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:46,860
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry. 

629
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:56,721
I should warn you,I haven't really been myself lately. 

630
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,561
maybe I can cheer you up. 

631
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,137
Trick or treat. 

632
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,914
You look great. 

633
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,460
Who are you ? 

634
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,429
Lara croft. 

635
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:26,509
"Tomb raider. "

636
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,227
Oh. 

637
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:31,799
You raid tombs dssed like that ? 

638
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,518
That's impressive. 

639
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:35,977
What happened to snow white ? 

640
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:39,870
Well, I'm --I'm sick of her. 

641
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:43,908
You know, I never did

642
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:47,726
get to thank you for picking the kids up for me. 

643
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:50,344
Uh, you took care of your "errand" ? 

644
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,519
Yes. 

645
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,045
The beagle has landed happily 
in the arms of two loving girls. 

646
00:39:55,946 --> 00:39:57,318
You are a superhero. 

647
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:08,665
It was such an incredible 
feeling rescuing that dog. 

648
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,617
You upset your neighbor. 

649
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,669
Fuck her. 

650
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:21,886
Well, I guess you're used to dealing 
with people like her, right ? 

651
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,360
Considerably worse. 

652
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:27,993
Is that why you haven't been yourself lately ? 

653
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:31,983
There's a case I just can't seem 
to get out of my mind. 

654
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:37,748
maybe I can help. 

655
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,723
No.  I'm afraid there's nothing you can do. 

656
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:44,497
Oh, I don't know. 

657
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:48,188
I'm a dognapper now...and a tomb raider. 

658
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:52,930
There's all sorts of things I can do. 

659
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,873
What --what are you doing ? 

660
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,303
Whatever I want. 

661
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:15,895
I've come to appreciate the 
comfortable moments with rita...

662
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:19,422
the easy, quiet moments--

663
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:23,605
This...

664
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:26,366
might be better. 

665
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:34,566
Look, there's mr.  Tub-of-lardi bringing mrs.  
Tub-of-lardi another bucket of fried chicken. 

666
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,447
Where's your brother ? 

667
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,320
I'm not his keeper. 

668
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:49,146
W-what do you think of this ? 

669
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,994
It's an anniversary present for nina. 

670
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,111
See, it's...it's a diamond key to my heart. 

671
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,389
It's...it's a key,but, you s,it's shaped like a heart. 

672
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:05,674
You can't tell me that it looks like anything 
else,'cause that's what it is. 

673
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:07,946
That's it. That's what I like. 

674
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,127
And I'm not gonna take it back. 

675
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,327
It's perfect, angel. 

676
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,883
She'll love it. 

677
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,301
Really ? 

678
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,519
I would. 

679
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,153
How...how do I look ? 

680
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:26,572
Like the tie ? 

681
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:38,043
Angel. 

682
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,735
Happy anniversary,baby. 

683
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:45,324
You know you can't just walk in here anymore. 

684
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:53,300
I just thought...

685
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:56,953
our anniversary...

686
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:02,634
maybe tonight we could put all that behind us. 

687
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:05,790
It doesn't matter what night it is. 

688
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,781
I told you I need time. 

689
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,793
It's been three months,baby. 

690
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,596
How much time do you need ? 

691
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:16,099
Don't turn this around on me, angel...

692
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,433
not after what you did. 

693
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:23,199
I need as much time as I need. 

694
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:33,449
Angel...

695
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:41,890
as long as you're here,you want to see aury ? 

696
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:58,470
Lo siento, princesa. 

697
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:02,986
Lo siento, lo siento,lo siento. 

698
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,519
Thank you. 

699
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,782
That was...

700
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:57,799
...unexpected. 

701
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,783
Yeah.  For me, too. 

702
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:07,446
I have no problem with...

703
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,851
unexpected. 

704
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:14,649
No, you...certainly don'T. 

705
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,233
I have to get back to the kids. 

706
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,985
what are these ? 

707
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:37,587
I've been, uh, reorganizing my photos a little. 

708
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:39,877
Oh. 

709
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,474
Look how cute you are. 

710
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:47,520
And your dad --such a nice face,just like you. 

711
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:49,990
I was adopted. 

712
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:51,895
I know. 

713
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:54,199
But you're both good men. 

714
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,950
I can tell. 

715
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,820
Very poetic. 

716
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:06,168
Poetic ? It's a water fountain. 

717
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:10,099
Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo. 

718
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,760
His shadow's on the wall right next to you. 

719
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,440
It's like he's always with you. 

720
00:46:15,726 --> 00:46:17,758
I'd frame this one. 

721
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:21,558
All this time the answer was right here. 

722
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,966
Harry...photographer and foster father extraordinaire. 

723
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:27,519
He is always with me,

724
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,443
and he's the common denominator. 

725
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:31,989
Rita...

726
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:34,362
you're a genius. 

727
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:38,973
All those years of smiling for the camera...

728
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:40,562
it was empty and fake,

729
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:45,443
the pictures meaningless,until now. 

730
00:46:45,444 --> 00:46:47,842
Pictures of harry. 

731
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:06,765
So this is it. 

732
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,678
It's cool. 

733
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,037
Cool. 

734
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:14,851
Dexter, this is the place where my father,

735
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:18,475
your grandfather,worked for 30 years. 

736
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:20,551
He started out as the janitor,

737
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:22,954
worked his way up to chief of maintenance. 

738
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:25,637
This place put food on our table. 

739
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,402
In two weeks,it'll all be shut down. 

740
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:28,838
I know. 

741
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,120
Excuse me, miss !  Miss ? 

742
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,617
- Would you mind ? 
- Oh, come on, dad. 

743
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,474
I don't want to...

744
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,649
hey, you all right ? 

745
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:44,574
It's nothing.  Bad medianoches for lunch.  I'm okay. 

746
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:47,103
I'm sorry, miss. It's okay.  Thanks. 

747
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,309
We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all. 

748
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,520
Yeah, we are. 

749
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:51,129
Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now. 

750
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,418
Don't be a baby --

751
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:56,447
being part of a family means smiling 
for family photos, right ? 

752
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:09,573
My friend left this. 

753
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:12,152
He's showing me where to go. 

754
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,578
But I wonder...am I going because it's what he wants

755
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:18,828
or because that's what harry would want ? 

756
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,859
What do i want ? 

757
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:52,744
The hospital's shut down now,

758
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:54,292
abandoned for years,

759
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:58,311
but tonight it's visiting hours again. 

760
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:30,990
Well, james...

761
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:36,644
why did you have to be such a pain in the ass, huh ? 

762
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:43,069
Ugh !  Fuck. 

763
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:46,176
I didn't tell you you could get up. 

764
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:07,158
Please, please

765
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:11,673
Now you get up. 

766
00:50:18,914 --> 00:50:22,857
You traumatize my little girl in church...

767
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:27,250
break the knees of my best turner. 

768
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:32,179
You're a wild dog,sergeant. 

769
00:50:33,919 --> 00:50:36,340
The only thing to do with a wild dog...

770
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:40,249
police ! Hands in the air ! 

771
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:47,586
Thought you could use backup. 

772
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:50,692
You could have filled me in,man. Shit. 

773
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:55,719
Got you going after a goddamn cop, motherfucker. 

774
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,517
We own your ass now. 

775
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:05,286
So this was the plan all along...to use me 
as bait to bring down guerrero ? 

776
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:09,877
Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace. 

777
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,373
We're done now, doakes. We're even. 

778
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,049
I'll call this in,bring the paramedics. 

779
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:18,573
Get this piece of shit out of here. 

780
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:57,560
Please. 

781
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:03,177
Just do it. 

782
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,735
Kill me. 

783
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:11,692
I'm ready. 

784
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:25,138
Just don't cut me anymore. 

785
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,403
Please don't cut me anymore. 

786
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:34,456
Gift-wrapped,begging for death. 
Tools at the ready. 

787
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:35,872
Just kill me. It's okay. 

788
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:39,110
He was left here so I would kill him,

789
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:43,523
but my new friend doesn't see me 
as clearly as he thinks. 

790
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:45,646
I can't kill this man. 

791
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:48,497
Harry wouldn't want it. 

792
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,120
And neither would I. 

793
00:53:11,206 --> 00:53:12,670
Are you moan ? 

794
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:15,873
Message came through dispatch for you. 

795
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:22,957
Who left this ? 

796
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,965
Who left it ?  ! 

797
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:38,065
jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises. 

798
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:40,005
I'm sorry. I'm so excited. 

799
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:42,326
Try a hug once in a while. 

800
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:47,007
I don't know who your contacts are, morgan,

801
00:53:47,008 --> 00:53:48,510
but you are my up-and-comer. 

802
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,050
You saved a man's life tonight. 

803
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,651
I'm just the one who got the call, sir. 

804
00:53:52,652 --> 00:53:54,708
But you followed it up. 

805
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:57,192
Right place at the right time, sir. 

806
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:58,405
Where we at ? 

807
00:53:58,512 --> 00:54:01,933
Morgan's tip was good. They're 
taking tucci over to county. 

808
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:03,607
Alive ? 

809
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,365
Alive. 

810
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,259
So, I suppose this gets deb off 
of surveillance-tape duty. 

811
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:17,082
Really ? 

812
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,098
Is that what you suppose ? 

813
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:20,029
I got your page,lieutenant. 

814
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,271
Doakes is caught up in the guerrero bust. 

815
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:23,354
You're taking point here. 

816
00:54:23,355 --> 00:54:25,721
- You got it. 
- I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. 

817
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:29,141
I want forensic evidence if you have to tear 
apart this building brick by brick. 

818
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,651
...Entiende ? 
...s ? 

819
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,909
Use morgan here. 

820
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:41,630
How did your wife like that necklace, angel ? 

821
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:43,366
Oh, you were right. She loved it. 

822
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,463
You nailed that one. 

823
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,808
Everyone hides who they are...at lea some of the time. 

824
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,775
Sometimes you bury that part of yourself 
so deeply that you have to be reminded

825
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:25,342
it's there at all. 

826
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:37,945
Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

827
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:46,186
and sometimes you just want to 
forget who you are altogether. 

828
00:55:58,642 --> 00:56:01,163
And what about me ? 

829
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:05,649
Maybe I'll never be the human harry wanted me to be. 

830
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,881
But I couldn't kill tony tucci. 

831
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,304
That's not me, either. 

832
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:16,765
My new friend thought I wouldn't be able 
to resist the kill he left for me,

833
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,702
but I did. 

834
00:56:27,314 --> 00:56:31,147
I'm not the monster he wants me to be. 

835
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:34,716
So I'm neither man nor beast. 

836
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,463
I'm something new entirely,

837
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:40,190
with my own set of rules. 

838
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:51,199
I'm dexter.
