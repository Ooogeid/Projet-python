- This child is happening.

00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,831
<i>I'm going to have a child.</i>

3
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,694
<i>But I can't be a father to it.
Can I?</i>

4
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:49,088
The Oscar Prado case?

5
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah, fucker's running career
maker of the year.

6
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,532
They nailed
this Freebo guy in golden.

7
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:55,743
This time he killed
a senior ADA's brother.

8
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,995
<i>Except he didn't kill Oscar.</i>

9
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:58,912
<i>I did.</i>

10
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,748
What do you have on Freebo, Maria?

11
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,149
Well, we're working
on some new angles.

12
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:04,501
You've got shit.

13
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,421
This doesn't look good. I think
you fucked a girl who's now dead.

14
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:09,715
All right, I passed her to a friend.

15
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,676
- Who could feed her...
- A friend? Right.

16
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,427
Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.

17
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:15,053
Freebo?

18
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,233
Why do you think Freebo's
still in town?

19
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:19,794
Because I think he killed
his girlfriend on sunday.

20
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:20,914
Jane Doe.

21
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:23,230
And wasn't Jane Doe
missing a patch of skin?

22
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,921
Freebo's still out there, killing.
We got to catch him fast.

23
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,357
Yeah, but we got a lead now.

24
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,985
<i>This department is
becoming annoyingly effective.</i>

25
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,404
Anton

26
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:34,156
is my contact.
If you wear him out,

27
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,618
- or blow his cover...
- I know how to work a CI.

28
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,162
So unless there's some other
reason you don't want me to talk to him?

29
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,081
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

30
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,672
You'd get me a shield
for being a rat?

31
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,131
For being an honest cop, Debra.
Like your father.

32
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,984
I know all about
the Chicky Hines case.

33
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:57,455
He was a big one for the prosecutor.
And guess who that was?

34
00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,625
Miguel Prado.

35
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:01,309

36
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,796

<i>It's only fitting I use it
to complete the task.</i>

38
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:12,986
It was self-defense.

39
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:18,537
Thank you.

Well, it'll get easier.

107
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,252
What is that?

108
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:43,864
You've dedicated so many of
your resources towards resolving this.

109
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,927
- <i>He's trying to end the investigation.</i>
- Is it worth it?

110
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,304
We both know

00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,930

112

113
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,385
This is not the time to give up
or even slow down.

114
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,906
We will find Fred Bowman.
We'll bring him to justice.

115
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,192

00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,544

You'll be home by eight.

120
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,854
- Don't know if Rita will be up for it.
- Syl already talked to her.

121
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:21,324
She'd love to go.

122
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,006
Then, <i>viernes cultural</i> it is.

123
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,853
Did he say anything
about the Chicky Hines situation?

124
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,666
I still got a witness in lockup
that says Hines is innocent.

125
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,729
- Miguel is aware of that.
- I know.

126
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,649
I was just wondering when he'sgoing 

127
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,621
to questioning my witness?

128
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,205
I assumed he had already.

129
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,125
Not as of this morning.

130
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:50,963
Well, I'm sure he'll get to it.

131
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:53,824
I'll talk to him.

132
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:58,456
We got a new murder victim.
Dumped in the parklike our Jane Doe.

133
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,668
Some of his skin was sliced off.
It looks like Freebo struck again.

134
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,229
All right. Let's get there.

135
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:04,544
<i>It can't be Freebo.</i>

136
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:05,814
<i>I killed him.</i>

137
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,844
<i>But only Miguel and I know that.</i>

138
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:19,496
<i>And we're not at liberty to tell.</i>

139
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,342
Javier Garza.
He was a low-life pimp.

140
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:39,778
He's the one that connected
our Jane Doe to Freebo.

141
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:42,278
Well, it looks like Freebo
paid him back for that.

142
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,213
Well I can't say for certain
until I get this under the scope,

143
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,801
but I'm guessing we're looking
at something like an eight-inch blade,

144
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,799
razor sharp.

145
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,123
Single-edged. Same type of...

146
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,722
- instrument used on our Jane Doe.
- So Freebo killed Javier.

147
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:57,725
<i>No, he didn't kill Javier.</i>

148
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:01,019
One of the tree-trimmers called it in,
said he didn't see anything

149
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,480
- or anyone unusual.
- It all points to Freebo.

150
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,049
Looks like he gotta little hungry
for flesh this time.

151
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:08,401
- What's that about?
- Do we think he's eating it?

152
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,906
There's a lot more cannibalism
in this country than any of you realize.

153
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,843
Maybe the skin's
like a trophy or something.

154
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:19,674
Or he just likes to hurt people.
What do you think, Dex?

155
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,718
Well, they all sound
like good theories to me.

156
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:23,988
Way to commit.

157
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,130
All right, so far
we haven't found shit on Freebo.

158
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,969
But now he's
giving us a second chance.

159
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,133
So let's not blow it. Quinn, Morgan...
Let's get a canvas going.

160
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,026
One block perimeter.
Start with the tree trimmers.

161
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,305
Why don't you take the tree trimmers.
I'm going to start over here.

162
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:38,807
Gosh. I wonder why.

163
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:46,606
Can you come down here?

164
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:50,587
Sure.

165
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,199
I'm detective Joseph Quinn.

166
00:10:57,964 --> 00:11:00,465
There's nothing to worry about here.
Did you guys see anything?

167
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,671

You been out here a while?

168
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,250
- What's your name?
- George Washington King.

169
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,712
- And you called this in?
- Yes, I did.

170
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,854
- You found the body?
- Uh... no, no. Mario did.

171
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,589
- Will you join us please?
- <i>Van aqui.</i>

172
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,488
Mario, did you notice anyone else?

173
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,057
Keep my eyes on my work.

174
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,560
I got to go with Freebo on this one.

175
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,762
That means he's stepping out
from wherever he's been hiding.

176
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,279
Not so good for our latest victim,
but good for us.

177
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,281
Let's grab a beer tonight,
talk about my Jane Doe.

178
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,780
I'd like to help you, but I have
too much to deal with.

179
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,850
What do you have to deal with?

180
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:43,538
Rita's pregnant.

181
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:45,458
Say again?

182
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,668
Rita's pregnant.

183
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:50,837
You're lying!

184
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:52,506
I'm not lying.

185
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,837
A baby?!

186
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,251
A motherfucking roly-poly

187
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,554
chubby-cheeked shit-machine?
Are you kidding me?

188
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,808
I've never heard it described
in quite those words before, but yeah.

189
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:06,686
That's so great!

190
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:10,815
I'm so happy for you guys.

191
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,237
Thank you.

192
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:17,923
<i>Baby on board.</i>

193
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,275
<i>I've got to get on board.</i>

194
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,211
Grab a sweater.

195
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:24,956
It'll get cool later.

196
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,215
You okay?

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,676
I always get my morning sickness
late in the day.

198
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,261
You want to stay home?
We don't have to go.

199
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:43,890
The Prados will understand.

200
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:47,214
I was looking forward to seeing Syl.

201
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,521
And I know how much you love
hanging out with Miguel.

202
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,990
<i>Miguel. My new "bestest" friend.</i>

203
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,903
Besides, the doctor says
the way I'm feeling is fine.

204
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,809
What else did the doctor say?

205
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,142
He asked me a million questions
about my medical history.

206
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,037
There's a form for you to fill out too,
but I told him you were adopted.

207
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:08,429
I mean...

208
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,182
Are there any details
that you do know?

209
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:14,250
<i>Like mom was killed by a chainsaw.
My brother was killed by...</i>

210
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,247
<i>Well, me. That kind of stuff?</i>

211
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,174
No, I don't really know anything.

212
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,055
It's okay.

213
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,808
I could go to the doctor
and get checked out, if you want.

214
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,478
You'd do that?

215
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:31,305
Of course.

216
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,875
I'm glad we're
in this together, Dexter.

217
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:35,745
You'll make a good father.

218
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,866
You know, if you want to.

219
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,503
Here.
It'll help settle your stomach.

220
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:00,884
Thank you.

221
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,870
- How are you doing with everything?
- Good.

222
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,750
I feel better about it now.

223
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,100
Actually kind of excited.

224
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,228
Good. And Dexter?

225
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:16,608
I think he's still
a little overwhelmed by everything.

226
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:20,001
Men. They're such babies,
they need to be carried

227
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:22,338
kicking and screaming
into fatherhood.

228
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,645
I guess they're just scared
about losing their freedom.

229
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:28,662
Dexter.

230
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,874
I don't know if you officially
got to meet my other brother, Ramon.

231
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,041
Beautiful wife, Sara.

232
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,118
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

233
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,206
Sheriff's department, right?

234
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,339
That's right.

235
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:44,260
So you're the guy that Miguel
is always talking about?

236
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:48,880
Don't worry.
Like they say, it's all good.

237
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:51,358
Yeah, if good means
being part of the team

238
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:53,687
that's never going to catch
our brother's murderer.

239
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,018
My gracious brother.

240
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:58,425
Grab a beer?

241
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:04,088
- <i>Gracias, mi amigo.</i>
- <i>Para servir.</i>

242
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,826
Free beer. Must be nice to be you.

243
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:12,566
A lot of people appreciate
knowing that I'm on their side.

244
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,377
I understand you're soon
to be a father.

245
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:20,679
Yeah.

246
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,758
What? Some mixed emotions there?

247
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:26,854
No. It's just...

248
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:30,149
Yeah, mixed emotions.

249
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:33,602
I don't know what's more complicated,
having a father or being one. But...

250
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,680
it's good to know
you're not taking it lightly.

251
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,882
You'll see your way through it.

252
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,360
Hope so.

253
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,065
So...

254
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,129
Our friend Freebo...

255
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:50,209
Does he come back from the dead,
or are the police mistaken?

256
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,244
I'd venture to guess
the police are mistaken.

257
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:54,606
You're positive?

258
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:57,750
Miguel, he's dead.

259
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:02,171
I believe you.

260
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:04,173
Well, good.

261
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,003
You just seem a little...

262
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,683
You seem a little unsettled
with the whole thing.

263
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,627
That's what he's looking for.
A sign that I'm normal.

264
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,871
To be honest, I haven't been sleeping
too well lately.

265
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,108
Just know you did
the right thing, my friend.

266
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,730
And it will never be forgotten.

267
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:36,154
<i>A full day of work.
An evening of socializing.</i>

268
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:38,155
<i>And now... Finally.</i>

269
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:42,307
<i>The calm, cool, aloneness
of my apartment.</i>

270
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,053
<i>Hello, Nathan Marten.</i>
<i>"Cheerios" man.</i>

271
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,867
<i>My animal instincts are never wrong.</i>

272
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,629
<i>Hello, Nathan Marten.
"Sexual predator".</i>

273
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:11,491
<i>You did four years
at South Bay correctional facility.</i>

274
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:14,676
<i>Your official status is "released."</i>

275
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:18,395
<i>Which leaves you free
to slither about the earth.</i>

276
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,620
I went back to my office,
to finish up with some paperwork,

277
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,977
and it just...
It kept on nagging at me.

278
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:44,183
Cono, what Ramon said to you.
I wanted to apologize.

279
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,360
Ah... Really not necessary.

280
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,696
At least share a drink with me.

281
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,241
Yeah, I'll grab some glasses.

282
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,245
<i>Showing up late at night like this,</i>

283
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:58,621
is it creepy,
or just what friends do?

284
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,379
How'bout out here?

285
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:07,245
My father, he caught me drinking

286
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,682
from his bottle of rum
when I was, like, 12.

287
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,268
He grabbed that bottle,
he threw it at me.

288
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:16,367
Eight stitches, right in the back
of my head, right there.

289
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:17,308
Ouch.

290
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,854
He was a college professor
back in Cuba.

291
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,371
Once he got married
and had a couple kids, he realized...

292
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,931
Time to get away
from Castro's world.

293
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,112
So we came over on one
of these old fishing boats.

294
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,403
I was like, five.

295
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:34,968
The boat actually sank 50 yards
from the shore.

296
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,185
My mother grabbed Ramon.
My father grabbed me,

297
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:38,749
and they swam to the shore.

298
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,415
- Wet foot, dry foot.
- Sounds brave.

299
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,920
Yeah, he was a real hero,
my father was.

300
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:49,785
He spent the rest of his life
telling everybody

301
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:52,245
what a great man he could have been

302
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,560
if it wasn't for Castro.

303
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,869
The more he drank,
the greater he became.

304
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,599
I would look at him and tell myself

305
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,888
"I'm not going to be like him."

306
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:09,143
You succeeded.

307
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:11,305
Yes, I did.

308
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:15,063
You know what the funny thing is?
In his eyes...

309
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:17,303
I was a failure.

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,990
I could never measure up.

311
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,940
My father was disgusted by me.

312
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:30,678
Disgusted?

313
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:35,135
Then no offense to the dead,
but your father was an idiot.

314
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,952
Never said that to anyone before.

315
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,242
Not Rita.

316
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,069
- Not my sister.
- Yeah... But Dexter...

317
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,741
They wouldn't understand.

318
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,745
You know that? They don't know
what it is to be a man.

319
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:51,400
To be a son.
With all the fucking pressure.

320
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:56,239
You grow up to be exactly the man
your father molded you to be. Still...

321
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:57,740
Not be good enough!

322
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,528
Exactly.

323
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,592
It was even harder on Oscar.

324
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:16,176
You know, by the time he was born,
my father was hardly even around.

325
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:20,815
I mean I tried to take care of him,
look after... You know.

326
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:23,476
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,216
<i>... that I killed him.</i>

328
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:27,413
To Oscar.

329
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,039
To Oscar.

330
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,563
So, Dexter...

331
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:45,121
I think I have an answer
for our other little problem.

332
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,515
Yes,
I think I got it all figured out.

333
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:53,293
All we have to do
is get Freebo's body, we dump it.

334
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:54,922
Then I can call Ramon.

335
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,843
Tell him that I received
an anonymous tip

336
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:00,259
about where Freebo can be found,

337
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,460
that would close the case.

338
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,931
And we can put it behind us.

339
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:07,587
Sorry, it's not possible.

340
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,528
Of course it is. I'll help.

341
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,738
Miguel, the body's... Gone.

342
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,567
I'll get it.
Just tell me where it is.

343
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:16,217
<i>He's not going to give up.</i>

344
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,087
<i>He needs to see something.</i>

345
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:19,488
I'll take you there.

346
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:22,074
Tomorrow. Huh?

347
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,523
Lunchtime.

348
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,704
I'll pick you up.

349
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,164
But look, Dexter.

350
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,834
You're not in this alone, huh?
It's you and me.

351
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:34,772
Together.

352
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,902
<i>That's the problem.</i>
<i>This whole "together" thing.</i>

353
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,097
- Hey, stranger.
- Shit.

354
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,344
Look. It's one thing
for you to come to the club.

355
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,571
But don't be tracking me down
all over the place.

356
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,640
I called you 3 times. If you'd bothered
to return any of those phone calls,

357
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,447
you could have picked the location.

358
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:04,116
No, I'm sorry doesn't work that way.

359
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:09,650
Shit.

360
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:13,085
This is bullshit.
What do you want?

361
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:18,590
- Tell me about Javier.
- In case you haven't heard, he's dead.

362
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,466
I have heard.
What else do you know?

363
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:23,878
That you were one of the last ones
to talk to him. Looks like

364
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:26,806
having a conversation with you
can be dangerous to one's health.

365
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:28,724
Who had problems with Javier?

366
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:30,036
I don't know.

367
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:34,064
But I shouldn't give you any more names,
or they might end up dead too.

368
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,148
Well, you better give me
something, Anton.

369
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:39,066
I don't like you
talking to me that way.

370
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,488
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you
were such a high-class snitch.

371
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:47,650
Well, no part of me needs this, so
why don't you just let me out of here?

372
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,813
- Not till I get some answers.
- Am I your prisoner?

373
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,095
Look, we have a deal!

374
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:53,333
And I'm not leaving
until I get some information.

375
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:56,377
You know something?
I know what'll make you leave.

376
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,170
What the fuck? Get rid of that.

377
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:01,401
You sure don't want anyone to know
you came to the men's room with your CI

378
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:04,710
- and lit up a little joint, do you?
- Fucking flush it.

379
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:08,347
I can't flush this, mama.
This is Premium Island Lady.

380
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:11,517
If you light that, I'll arrest you.

381
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,181
Don't worry,
there's more than enough.

382
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:15,924
I'll share.

383
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:29,629
I told you not to fucking do it!

384
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:41,476
<i>It seems ironic that I,</i>

385
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:43,441
<i>an expert on human dismemberment,</i>

386
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:47,053
<i>have to pay $800
to have myself virtually dissected.</i>

387
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,708
Check out this brain.

388
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:01,816
This one belonged to a serial killer
executed last month.

389
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,186
Killed 11 women.

390
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,522
Then he really snapped.

391
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,408
Killed his wife, two kids,
and the neighbor's dog.

392
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:12,285
Why are you showing me this?

393
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,460
Look how much smaller
the right hemisphere is.

394
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,630
This guy sure doesn't process
a lot of emotions, huh?

395
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:21,179
And you see all this activity
in the sub-cortex region?

396
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,964
That's where feelings of aggression
and violence come from.

397
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:27,365
- Why are you...
- Because. Look.

398
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:32,315
It's exactly the same
as your brain, Dex.

399
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:46,527
Freebo's final resting place.

400
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:49,365
How?

401
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:56,372
They dig the graves the day before,
they place a tarp over each one.

402
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,707
It wasn't that hard

403
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,835
to bring Freebo here late at night,

404
00:25:01,051 --> 00:25:02,960
find an open grave
to place his body in,

405
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,422
and then to cover it up
with a foot of dirt.

406
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:08,342
And then the next day,
they lower a 500 pound

407
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:11,345
casket on top of him,
cover it all up with dirt.

408
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,973
Hiding a body in a cemetery.
You're fucking brilliant.

409
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,398
I'll just get a judge to issue
an exhumation order now, and then we...

410
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,981
I need you to not do that.

411
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:25,565
I've never done this before.
I don't know what kind of evidence

412
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:27,747
I left on the body.
Hair, and fibers...

413
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,488
I can't have it traced back to me.

414
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,158
Fair enough. Fair enough.

415
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:38,343
It does leave us
with our next little problem.

416
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,166
What is that?

417
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:43,800
Well, we still have someone out there
skinning and killing people.

418
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,264
- Yes, we do.
- And your homicide squad,

419
00:25:46,384 --> 00:25:48,896
they think it's Freebo,
and they're wasting time and energy

420
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:51,085
looking for a dead man, when...

421
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:54,995
The real killer, whoever that might be,
is out there walking free.

422
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:56,809
Well how's that our problem?

423
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,179
Because justice isn't being served.

424
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:00,739
Of course.

425
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
- Of course.
- We have to...

426
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,191
steer the police
in the right direction.

427
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,090
How do we do this?

428
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:09,965
I don't have a fucking clue.

429
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:12,481
<i>But I've got a feeling
you're not going</i>

430
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:14,684
<i>to leave me alone
until we figure this out.</i>

431
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:15,804
<i>Together.</i>

432
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,079
What do you think about cowboys?

433
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,704
Rugged American heroes?

434
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:28,548
No, I meant for the baby's room.

435
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:31,677
Nice.

436
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,369
We can do something different
if you want.

437
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:37,882
Yeah, cowboys are...

438
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,367
Fine.

439
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:52,067
Hey, are you ready to go
to that yoga class?

440
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:53,553
Sure.

441
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:55,614
Astor! Cody!

442
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:57,156
Come on. Let's go.

443
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:14,205
<i>Nathan Marten.</i>

444
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:17,925
<i>As the sun begins to set,</i>

445
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:20,561
<i>the lowly scavengers
reveal themselves.</i>

446
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,269
Hey, it's the Cheerios man.

447
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,366
Who?

448
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,691
The guy from the grocery store.

449
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:31,365
What guy?

450
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:33,947
The man who talked to me.
Dexter knows.

451
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:37,679
Who is he?

452
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:41,328
He's no one to be concerned about.

453
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,282
<i>Because in a land of predators,</i>

454
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,318
<i>a lion never fears the jackal.</i>

455
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,953
And here we go,
into another warrior pose.

456
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,641
Feel your hips open up.

457
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:03,185
We are strong warriors.
All of us.

458
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:05,495
<i>This is absolutely, without a doubt,</i>

459
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:07,248
<i>the worst moment of my life.</i>

460
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:09,606
Now let's go
into a little free-form yoga.

461
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:11,827
Just let yourself dance.

462
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,541
<i>I was wrong. This is.</i>

463
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:18,639
... dust dancing
against the sunlight.

464
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,020
Be as beautiful

465
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,809
as the golden flakes
of dust, Dexter.

466
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:31,378
<i>I could probably kill her
before anyone realized what happened.</i>

467
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:34,257
Excellent.

468
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:38,513
Now I want all the partners
to turn and face their pregnant women.

469
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,722
Take your handand place it on her belly.

470
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,335
And I want you to send

471
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:48,706
all of your positive intentions
to your unborn baby.

472
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,777
<i>I'm sorry.
I just don't want to hurt you.</i>

473
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:14,297
Good morning, M. Prado.
Are you satisfied

474
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:17,147
- with the sentencing of Chicky Hines?
- I am.

475
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,833
I pushed for the maximum on this case,
and I got it, and for just cause.

476
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:23,903
With Mr. Hines behind bars
for a very long time,

477
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,462
I hope that the families of his victims
can finally find some peace.

478
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:28,582
Thank you.

479
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,125
- Miguel.
- Maria.

480
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,460
Another win for our team, huh?

481
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,030
I have to admit,
I'm a little confused.

482
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,445
What happened
with the witness I gave you?

483
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,115
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines?

484
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,076
I reviewed his statement,
it just didn't add up.

485
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,747
I thought it had at least merited
a conversation with him.

486
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,252
I see this kind of stuff
all the time.

487
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:55,960
And I know you do too.
Scumbags trying to play the system,

488
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,298
doing whatever they can
to stay out of jail.

489
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:06,412
- Trust me on this one.
- Ms. Wolf, do you have a statement?

490
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:10,144
Yes, I imagine the assistant district
attorney Prado's gonna go home now

491
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:13,585
and strip down
to his American flag underwear,

492
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:16,108
and pour himself maybe a nice
crime-fighting drink.

493
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,742
Make a fewfund-raising phone calls
for his upcoming run for D.A.

494
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:21,655
But the truth is...

495
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:24,394
He just sent an innocent man
to prison.

496
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:25,664
For 28 years.

497
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,717
He should be ashamed of himself.

498
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,803
It's despicable.

499
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,466
Someone's got to know who she is.

500
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:41,522
No luck?

501
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:44,792
I'm thinking of putting
her picture on milk cartons.

502
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,639
Not a bad idea.

503
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,017
Yeah, except nobody
would ever drink milk again.

504
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:58,526
Why the fuck did you lock up my C.I.?

505
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,611
Why are you calling him your C.I.?

506
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:04,753
Is there something
you're not telling us?

507
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,160
You're very curious about me,
aren't you?

508
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,638
Look at you, changing the subject.

509
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:13,124
Sarge!

510
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:15,336
Can you ask officer Morgan

511
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,092
why my C.I.'s in lockup?

512
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:23,050
He was antagonistic.
He produced a joint.

513
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,057
I warned him not to light it
or I'd have to bust him.

514
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,055
He lit it.

515
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,271
I knew I couldn't back down or he'd
never have to cooperate with me again.

516
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:32,809
He practically arrested himself.

517
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:36,788
That makes sense to me.
You got a problem with that?

518
00:31:37,515 --> 00:31:38,515
Good.

519
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:44,916
Cut him loose.

520
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:11,640
Do I know you?

521
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:15,679
We met at the grocery store
the other day.

522
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:17,702
I don't recall.

523
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:21,358
You asked my girlfriend's daughter
to help you find the Cheerios.

524
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:24,060
Right, right, right.

525
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:27,757
- What can I do for you?
- Shut the fuck up, Nathan.

526
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,529
- Stay away from my kids.
- What?

527
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:34,159
Sorry, buddy,
you got the wrong idea.

528
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,011
I saw you at the beach yesterday
with your camera.

529
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,852
I'm a photographer.

530
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,590
- I always have a camera with me.
- I know who you are.

531
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:45,155
I know what you are.

532
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Once.

533
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:51,929
Once I made a horrible mistake
and I paid the price for it.

534
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,480
I did my time.

535
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,529
But I'm not like that anymore.

536
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:58,903
I learned my lesson.

537
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:00,663
I've changed.

538
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,734
You haven't changed.
That's impossible.

539
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:07,776
We are what we are.

540
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:16,701
<i>Night.</i>

541
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:19,626
<i>Good for the hunter.
Bad for the hunted.</i>

542
00:33:21,451 --> 00:33:22,601
<i>Nathan Marten.</i>

543
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:25,626
<i>Is your past the prologue
to your future?</i>

544
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,770
<i>From the outside, he looks normal.</i>

545
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,432
<i>But like me, his brain is flawed</i>

546
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,138
<i>and he has a compulsion
he's unable to control.</i>

547
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:35,892
<i>We're really not so different,
Nathan and I.</i>

548
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,685
<i>Except that I
would never hurt a child.</i>

549
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:42,026
<i>Then again,
Nathan has never killed anyone.</i>

550
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:43,940
<i>Which means he doesn't fit my code.</i>

551
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:48,612
<i>I have other problems
to deal with besides Nathan.</i>

552
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:02,459
<i>Miguel Prado.</i>

553
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,670
<i>And Teegan Campbell.</i>

554
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:13,679
<i>If I take care of one,
I take care of the other.</i>

555
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:20,310
<i>It's a new day in Miami.</i>

556
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:23,188
<i>Perfect time
to help Deb help herself.</i>

557
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:25,895
<i>One of the things that makes
my sister a good cop</i>

558
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:28,289
<i>is that she's like a dog
with a bone.</i>

559
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:31,738
<i>Once she's got her teeth
into something, she'll never let go.</i>

560
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:33,949
<i>All I have to do is lead her
to the bone.</i>

561
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:40,487
Hey, papa!

562
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,119
God. Almost forgot.

563
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:49,298
Isn't it great?!

564
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,046
Nice.

565
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,511
Have you started thinking
about names yet?

566
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,945
Not that I want to push it on you
or anything, but, if you have a girl,

567
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,933
Debra's a really good name.

568
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:02,310
Deb, I should tell you...

569
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,770
My God. What happened?

570
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:05,461
Nothing happened.

571
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:09,569
It's just... I'm not sure I'm going
to be there to raise the baby.

572
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:12,362
What?

573
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:14,614
I don't know if I'm going to be
a father to the kid.

574
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:19,286
Of course you are, you moron.

575
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:20,740
Shut the fuck up!

576
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,990
How could you even say you're not
going to be a father to that kid?

577
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,667
Where would you be without Harry?

578
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:29,446
And he wasn't even
your biological father.

579
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:32,132
I'm going to be a lousy father.

580
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:35,051
- I don't want to screw the kid up.
- Would you please stop doing that?

581
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,053
Then stop saying stupid things.

582
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,185
First of all, who are we kidding?
You're going to be a great father.

583
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:45,771
And second...

584
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,595
And much more important,
big dumb brother of mine,

585
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,485
this isn't about you.

586
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:56,907
Who's it about?

587
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:00,870
The baby.

588
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:04,800
So it doesn't matter
how scared you are,

589
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,173
how reluctant
or unprepared you might feel,

590
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:10,086
the baby comes first.
And that baby needs you.

591
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,925
So you're just going
to have to set aside all of...

592
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:19,496
Holy shit. That's my Jane Doe.

593
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,360
<i>It's about time.</i>

594
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,257
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's her. Teegan Campbell.

595
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:29,069
- It looks like her.
- Yeah, I gotta go, Dex. This is big.

596
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:33,360
What's that for?

597
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,111
I know you, Dex.

598
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:39,560
You're the best brother in the world.
And you can do this.

599
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:43,483
And if you don't trust yourself,
trust me.

600
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:45,455
I'm the smart one in the family.

601
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,558
<i>They look motivated.</i>

602
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:08,362
- Anything?
- <i>Claro.</i>

603
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:11,482
Once Morgan here found out
that Jane Doe was Teegan Campbell,

604
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:14,423
it was a step to find her apartment.
Guess who'd been hiding out there?

605
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:18,363
- Freebo. His shit was everywhere.
- All kinds of fingerprint evidence.

606
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:20,989
- That's good.
- Fucking guy's got an airtight alibi.

607
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:23,989
We checked the call logs.
Freebo called Abby Wilson four hours

608
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,163
before the estimated time of Teegan's
murder. We followed up with abby.

609
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:30,125
Yeah, but get this. She's saying
she spent all day in bed with Freebo.

610
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:32,990
If that theory holds,
that means Freebo didn't kill Teegan.

611
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,238
And there are several calls
from this phone

612
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,366
to Teegan's cell
after she was killed.

613
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:40,510
Assuming Freebo made those calls,
he may not even know that she's dead.

614
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:42,722
We know Javier was killed
by the same person

615
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:45,301
who killed Teegan,
so he's off the hook for that as well.

616
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:48,175
I was just telling Miguel
how we weren't giving up on Freebo.

617
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:50,801
Now I have to call him and tell him
that he's probably right?

618
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:52,272
Freebo's probably long gone?

619
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:54,796
Looks that way.

620
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:00,446
What is that?

621
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,701
You stuck a piece
of chewing gum on it?

622
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,171
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,708
This is a deliberate insult
against me, and my people!

624
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:13,921
- Come on! Come on!
- Asswipe.

625
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:17,300
Who the fuck are his people?

626
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,050
I don't know.
Little scientists, I guess.

627
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,862
The lieutenant's right.
We're starting all over here.

628
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:28,361
We need to get out there
and see what we can shake loose.

629
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,113
We're looking at two cases now.

630
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:34,195
Ramos, liason with tri-state P.S.
on the Freebo situation.

631
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,524
Quinn, Morgan.
You stay on the skinner.

632
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:39,405
And you need
to mend fences with that CI.

633
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:42,488
He's part of that world.
We need all the help we can get on this.

634
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,916
Lucky break, huh?

635
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:54,459
Seeing that flyer?

636
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,628
You make your own luck.

637
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:05,095
<i>And now that I've dealt
with Teegan...</i>

638
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:11,143
Hi, it's Dexter. Good news...

639
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:14,270
I was going to call you.
We need to meet.

640
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:20,610
Today, right after work.
Under the bridge, near the beach club.

641
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:39,991
So you said on the phone
we have good news.

642
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:44,588
It was just the other day
that I was stressing

643
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:47,676
the importance
of getting the police

644
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:49,446
off of the Freebo trail.

645
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:51,022
And today...

646
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,394
Suddenly...

647
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,645
I get the word that the police
have done exactly that.

648
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,109
I don't know how you did it, Dexter,
but I'm impressed.

649
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:04,696
Actually, it wasn't me at all.
It was my sister, Debra.

650
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:08,736
You're a little uneasy with compliments.
Aren't you?

651
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,287
We all need to be liked.

652
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:16,185
I also notice that you always
have your guard up around me.

653
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:19,919
That's not true.

654
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:21,963
Ah, it's okay.

655
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,740
Actually, it's a good thing.

656
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,410
I appreciate
that you're a cautious man.

657
00:40:27,986 --> 00:40:31,431
It's a very valuable trait to have,
considering our circumstances.

658
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,767
It's just my nature.

659
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:37,491
I just want you to know
that you don't have to worry about me.

660
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:38,813
We're on the same side.

661
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,430
Honestly, I try to avoid taking sides
in most situations.

662
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,098
There you go again.
Always being careful.

663
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:51,862
Come on.

664
00:40:52,298 --> 00:40:53,848
I got a gift for you.

665
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:56,237
A gift?

666
00:40:59,236 --> 00:41:01,737
You know when you took care
of my brother's murderer,

667
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,511
you gave me, uh, peace.

668
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,049
Now let me give you peace.

669
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:12,347
A shirt?

670
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,171
The shirt.

671
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:17,769
This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

672
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,528
That's his blood, right there.

673
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:31,091
This shirt implicates me
in his death.

674
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,988
Accessory after the fact.

675
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:36,830
Why?

676
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:39,122
Because I trust you.

677
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,720
I trust you.

678
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:45,898
And I want you to trust me.

679
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:50,635
Same question. Why?

680
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,558
Because I like you.

681
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,257
I like working with you.

682
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:05,261
You're a good man, Dexter Morgan.

683
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:10,905
You've got a lot
of potential in you.

684
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:16,870
I think that you
are the only one who doesn't know that.

685
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:20,373
So I'm going
to be seeing you again soon.

686
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:22,112
All right?

687
00:42:23,734 --> 00:42:24,734
Yep. Okay.

688
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:30,592
<i>Is it possible I've
actually made a friend?</i>

689
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:33,374
<i>Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?</i>

690
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:37,390
Or am I being foolish for even
asking myself these questions?

691
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,862
Listen, if you've come
to arrest me, I'm clean.

692
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,831
I don't even have my cuffs.
Look...

693
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:56,374
I feel...

694
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,637
Not good about what happened.

695
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:03,792
Came on a little strong,
didn't you?

696
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:06,632
Yeah, well you kinda pushed me
into it, didn't you?

697
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,004
I'll admit that.

698
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:13,358
All right, so, I feel

699
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:15,679
not good too.

700
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:23,269
I've even been working on a song.
For you.

701
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:25,390
Kind of an apology.

702
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,312
No fucking way!

703
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:31,851
It's not done yet.

704
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:44,256
I was wondering if you
were coming by later tonight?

705
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:46,004
<i>If I do, it'll be pretty late.</i>

706
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,253
I've got some work stuff
I got to take care of.

707
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,248
Well, do you think you could
to pick up some milk for the kids?

708
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,342
For their cereal in the morning.

709
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,487
I'll try to remember.

710
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,629
- He wrote this for me.
- You're the <i>puta mala flaca</i>?

711
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:45,999
Yeah, that's me.

712
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,979
She's the skinny mean bitch.

713
00:44:57,624 --> 00:44:59,074
<i>So here I am again.</i>

714
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:02,872
<i>Drawn to the house of a man
who doesn't meet the code.</i>

715
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:22,987
<i>But maybe there's another code.</i>

716
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,710
<i>A code that says,
"you've stepped uninvited</i>

717
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:29,730
<i>into my world."</i>

718
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,660
<i>And that's a place where I decide
who gets to live.</i>

719
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,310
<i>And who doesn't.</i>

720
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:44,256
I am not like you!

721
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:03,374
Nobody hurts my children.

722
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,559
Milk.

723
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:38,937
Thank you.

724
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:41,936
You're welcome.

725
00:46:48,813 --> 00:46:49,934
So how was your day?

726
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:55,248
Long.

727
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:57,108
You?

728
00:46:57,935 --> 00:46:58,985
It was good.

729
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:03,897
Yeah, mine was good too.

730
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:07,023
Took care of some stuff

731
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:09,183
I needed to do.

732
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:16,354
That always feels nice.

733
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:34,924
Just sending out my positive intentions
to our baby.

734
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:54,309
<i>So there it is.</i>

735
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:56,433
<i>I'm going to be a father.</i>

736
00:47:56,686 --> 00:47:58,136
<i>And raise my child.</i>

737
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,800
<i>It's what any good man would do.</i>

738
00:48:02,936 --> 00:48:03,986
<i>After all...</i>

739
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:07,962
<i>it's a jungle out there.</i>
