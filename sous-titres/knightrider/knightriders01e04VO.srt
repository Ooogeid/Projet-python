1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,060
Michael, are you awake?

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,370
I am now. What's up?

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,950
Your mission files are being uploaded.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,440
Bio-sensing matrix indicates you are still fatigue

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,660
From our previous assignment.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,850
You need a bio-sensing matrix to figure that out?

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,300
If you like, I could display the files inside the car.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,440
That's okay. I like it out here.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,460
Morning soon.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,960
Will you have enough time to fully prepare?

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,100
Kitt, I can handle it.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,930
But you do remember that tomorrow night is--

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,250
Yeah, I know.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,040
Will Sarah not be upset?

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,860
Probably.

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,540
I have confirmed the item's location.

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,280
Putting it on-screen now.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,910
That's our boy.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,360
Stay on him.

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,400
Where's dr. Graiman? D.C.

21
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,520
What for? Hmm.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,490
Oh, that's right. He didn't tell me.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,620
Billy.

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,110
Did Sarah go too?

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,950
Sarah's out picking up her dress.

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,740
Right.

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,540
Today's the-- uh-huh.

28
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,030
Oh, man, she is gonna be-- oh, yeah.

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,330
Guys!

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,030
This man couriered stolen nsa intelligence to north korea,

31
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,160
Smuggled Ali Atwa out of afghanistan,

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,680
Delivered weapons to african rebels.

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,340
This is our chance to grab him.

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,730
Focus.

35
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,460
He's on the move, right on schedule.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,430
Item's down.

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,780
Stay with the item. I'm on the courier.

38
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,460
Guys, we got company.

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,910
Any idea who they are?

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,140
They must be with another agency.

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,710
If they grab the courier or the item,

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,180
We're dead in the water.

43
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,010
Kitt, can you access the radio frequency?

44
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,660
I will attempt to locate it.

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,510
Mike, be advised the mission may be compromised.

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,500
Copy that. Keep me posted.

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,910
Five bucks we're screwed.

48
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,160
You're so on.

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,230
Item is mobile.

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,020
Uh-oh, he made me. He's trying to evade.

51
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,510
Don't lose him. Detain him now if you have to.

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,080
I have located the frequency, patching it through now.

53
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,120
I lost him.

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,210
Repeat, I have lost contact.

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,420
So have we.

56
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,890
Wherever that door Leads, there are no cameras.

57
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,740
Looks like mama's about to get paid.

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,850
I'm moving in. We can't lose them both.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,660
You with the briefcase,

60
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,820
Stop right there, on the ground now.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,710
Drop the case.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,260
Okay, okay, just don't shoot.

63
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,360
Some guy paid me 300 bucks

64
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,710
To take it to the far side of the mall

65
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
And Leave it there.

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,340
What?

67
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,540
What is it? This whole thing was a misdirect.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,000
Are you gonna tell my parents?

69
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,080
Get up.

70
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,290
Oh, that smells like victory.

71
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,290
Mike, proceed as planned.

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,030
Find out who they were.

73
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,530
Everything all right?

74
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,960
Paid well for my services,

75
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,610
And with me, you get what you pay for.

76
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,910
Get up.

77
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,140
You don't want to do this.

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,180
It's already done. Hands behind your back.

79
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,740
What the hell?

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,330
Hold on, Michael.

81
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,930
Michael, are you all right?

82
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

83
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,520
I just hate these masks.

84
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,800
I can't see a damn thing.

85
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,360
May I discard my disguise as well?

86
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,950
Just be careful. The last thing we need is camera-phone footage

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,470
Of you transforming on youtube.

88
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,460
Yeah, that...

89
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,210
Does not get old.

90
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,030
I've contacted the Ssc

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,670
And informed them of our imminent return.

92
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,310
They are standing by to initiate duplication.

93
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,250
Duplication?

94
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,770
Don't talk to me, criminal.

95
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,230
Chamber doors closing.

96
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,930
He almost got the drop on you.

97
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,770
Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.

98
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,960
Any idea who crashed our party?

99
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,380
Homeland security. We're debriefing them right now.

100
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,870
If you want to throw them a bone.

101
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,000
We know you have another job today.

102
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,480
We need to know the details.

103
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,740
Not happening.

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,310
Read this.

105
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,650
Not happening.

106
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,020
Ooh, I love this part.

107
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,940
Michael,

108
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,690
Last time the subject regurgitated

109
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
All over my console.

110
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,780
Yeah, and I got stuck cleaning it up.

111
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
Last chance.

112
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,760
What are you gonna do?

113
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,920
Kitt, auto restraints. Hit it.

114
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,020
Occupant restraint system activated.

115
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,110
May i?

116
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,470
Thank you.

117
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,740
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,030
All right, let me out of here.

119
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,370
Let me out of here, and I won't come after you.

120
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,590
Woah! Okay!

121
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,680
I'm gonna hurl.

122
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,000
Michael, the subject appears to be moments away

123
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,280
From regurgitation.

124
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,330
I am so not cleaning it up again.

125
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,190
Read it,

126
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,510
Or this time I won't tell Kitt to strap you in.

127
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,650
"the quick brown fox

128
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,440
Jumps over a lazy dog."

129
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,440
Got it.

130
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,650
Come on.

131
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,960
Let's go. There you go.

132
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,200
What a relief.

133
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,280
The quick brown...

134
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,440
Fox...

135
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,140
Jumps over a lazy dog.

136
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,240
What are those for?

137
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,290
You won't talk, so I'm gonna extract the information

138
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,850
Directly from your frontal and temporal lobes.

139
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,220
Kidding.

140
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,000
But I wouldn't squirm if I were you...

141
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,730
Or blink.

142
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,750
Come to think of it, try not to move at all.

143
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,150
Careful. Last time you just about burned the guy's eyes out.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,550
I was hungover.

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,120
Relax, man, I got this.

146
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,120
Kitt, I need a time and location for the pickup.

147
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,260
Relax, man, I got this.

148
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,200
Cute.

149
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,490
I heard they gave you another assignment.

150
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,360
Sarah, I am so sorry.

151
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,100
It's okay.

152
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,400
And, uh, I know you didn't want to go by yourself,

153
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,930
And I said I'd take you, no, really, it's fine.

154
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,930
And she's the last one of your single friends to get married,

155
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,430
Which has to be a little upsetting in itself.

156
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,640
Mike, honestly, it's okay.

157
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,720
Promise.

158
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,920
Oh, okay. I thought you'd be mad.

159
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,120
Well, national security

160
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,690
Should probably take precedence over Lindsay Rickel's wedding.

161
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,240
Besides, it doesn't start for another five hours.

162
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,840
We could still make it, right?

163
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,850
Sure.

164
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,640
Pick up the item, identify its contents, drop it off.

165
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,700
How hard can that be?

166
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,060
Actually, the job involves

167
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,610
An infinite number of variables which could result in--

168
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,530
Hey, Kitt, have some faith, huh?

169
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,770
You, me, this dress,

170
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,330
And a dance-- deal?

171
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,840
Whatever you say.

172
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,770
Sarah?

173
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,920
If the wedding isn't for another five hours,

174
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,440
Why are you wearing your dress?

175
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,620
Motivation.

176
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,940
Yo, criminal.

177
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,170
Don't do that.

178
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,330
Billy.

179
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,960
The pickup is scheduled to take place in 34 minutes

180
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,540
And 18 seconds at an industrial warehouse.

181
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,480
How far?

182
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,300
Estimated travel time, taking into account travel,

183
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,900
Distance, weather-- Kitt.

184
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,970
42 minutes, 12 seconds.

185
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,400
Let's go.

186
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,160
You've worn contacts before, right?

187
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,290
I think I can handle it.

188
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,600
Way to not incinerate his retina.

189
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,980
Kitt will help you sync it up. Cool.

190
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,450
Get this done so you can take her to that wedding.

191
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,630
You don't ever

192
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,100
Stand up a girl in a dress like that.

193
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,050
Michael, what did Sarah mean when she said

194
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,410
She was wearing her dress for motivation?

195
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,570
Kitt, if you don't know, I can't tell you.

196
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,550
Son of a--

197
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,890
How do people do this?

198
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,570
I am having trouble processing something.

199
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
Welcome to my world.

200
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,000
Sarah asked me to have faith.

201
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,290
I'm assuming she was not referring

202
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,290
To belief in a higher power.

203
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,670
No, she meant you have to think positively.

204
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,130
But would thinking realistically

205
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,450
Not make more sense?

206
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,100
Doesn't mean

207
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,520
You throw realism out the window,

208
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,800
Just that you hope for the best.

209
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,490
So we will hope for the best.

210
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,620
Sounds good to me. You almost finished?

211
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,030
Yes. Would you say one more sentence, please?

212
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,800
I hate contact lenses.

213
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,330
It is a perfect match.

214
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,890
You have a package for me.

215
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,090
This way.

216
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,810
You're late. We're on a strict timeline.

217
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,620
Let's not waste any more.

218
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,140
Could you look into the camera, please?

219
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,920
Is the gun really necessary?

220
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,880
Oh, let's hope not.

221
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,140
Retinal scan approved.

222
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,130
Identity confirmed.

223
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,880
Could you speak into the microphone, please?

224
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,420
The guy with the gun

225
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,900
Is pissing me off.

226
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,090
As much as deniability

227
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,080
Is a wonderful thing,

228
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,380
There's a downside to your particular service.

229
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,410
And what's that? Trust.

230
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,590
Our simple faith that you'll do the job we're paying you to do.

231
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,310
I assume that you hired me

232
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Because someone told you I was the best.

233
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,120
But if you're nervous about my loyalties,

234
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,740
Hire someone else.

235
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,160
That won't be necessary.

236
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,700
What did you just do?

237
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,500
That's us guaranteeing your loyalty

238
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,700
By poisoning you.

239
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,470
You're kidding.

240
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,360
Your instructions--

241
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,500
You have approximately three hours

242
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,350
Until your central nervous system shuts down.

243
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,960
After you've completed the drop,

244
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,630
We'll meet, and we'll give you the antidote.

245
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,560
Any questions?

246
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,350
Yeah, how do I know there's an antidote?

247
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,060
Do I strike you as a man who Leaves loose ends?

248
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,560
Just do your job.

249
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,810
You'll be fine.

250
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,200
Kitt, we got a problem.

251
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,240
Shall I tell Sarah

252
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,040
You will not be attending the wedding,

253
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,610
Or should I continue to have faith?

254
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,780
Chamber doors open.

255
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,210
To drop the item on time,

256
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,950
We must Leave in exactly four minutes and 32 seconds.

257
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,510
Document everything.

258
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,350
Leave it exactly as you found it.

259
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,410
How are you feeling? Like I ate bad sushi.

260
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,650
You got anything on the poison?

261
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,100
We linked up with Kitt. It's being analyzed as we speak.

262
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,160
In the meantime, take this.

263
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,530
It's a general inhibitor.

264
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,820
It should buy you some time.

265
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,200
Oh, no way!

266
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,870
It's a pass to tech for tomorrow.

267
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,870
Hold on. I'm dying because of what?

268
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,790
It's a symposium where tech's greatest minds

269
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,530
Discuss the new technology

270
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,340
Their companies are working on--

271
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,320
The most promising r&d.

272
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,500
You don't talk like that in front of girls, do you?

273
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,530
What else?

274
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,260
Looks like a coat-check ticket.

275
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,560
You think maybe it's encoded or fixed with a gps?

276
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,230
Uh, no, I think it's a coat-check ticket.

277
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,580
Foreign-substance analysis complete.

278
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,750
According to this,

279
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,130
We're not dealing with one poison,

280
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,130
But a combination of toxins--

281
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,550
Most predominantly hyoscine,

282
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,250
Which acts as a hallucinogen and truth serum.

283
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,480
Truth serum.

284
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,410
You ever fantasize about Sarah in a catholic schoolgirl outfit?

285
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,100
No.

286
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,640
Hmm, clearly not working yet.

287
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,770
I'll start on an antidote.

288
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,490
We'll take a team to the rendezvous location

289
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,340
The assailants gave you.

290
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,250
Once you've dropped the item and i.D.'d the recipient,

291
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,690
We will take down the bad guys and retrieve your antidote.

292
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,780
If there is one. I've hidden a homing beacon inside

293
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,850
So you can track the case.

294
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,360
After you drop the item,

295
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,080
You must obtain a photo i.D. Of the recipient.

296
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,880
You hear me?

297
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,460
Yeah, i.D. Recipient-- got it.

298
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,270
Based on your initial blood sample,

299
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,190
I have calculated the estimated time

300
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,930
Before the poison ends your life.

301
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,600
Shall I put it on-screen?

302
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,580
The countdown to my death...

303
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,260
Sounds like fun.

304
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,460
Kitt, you got it?

305
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,810
Yes, I have also just finished analyzing

306
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,650
The most recent blood sample.

307
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,410
You will be dead in two hours

308
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,590
And 12 minutes.

309
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,690
Wow, don't sugarcoat it or anything.

310
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,920
Michael, can you hear me?

311
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,690
Yeah, I'm here.

312
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,290
That the item is moving.

313
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,630
Which direction?

314
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,190
It is headed southwest.

315
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,650
Which way is southwest?

316
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,180
To your left.

317
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,690
I got her.

318
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,400
Moving in to acquire photo i.D.

319
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,810
Kitt.

320
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,230
I'm headed towards you now.

321
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,580
Recipient is a very reckless driver.

322
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,490
We'll be sure to charge her with that too.

323
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,520
How's it going?

324
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,400
I approached too quickly, was seen, got distracted,

325
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,220
And she took my picture before I could take hers.

326
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,230
The truth serum side effects of the poison

327
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,650
I mean, fine-- it's going fine.

328
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,530
Have taken effect.

329
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,170
Of the road ahead is picking up an obstruction.

330
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,530
What kind of obstruction?

331
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,960
It is a semitruck.

332
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,350
The recipient may be unable to avoid a collision.

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,770
What do you mean may be? Give me numbers.

334
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,210
Chances of a collision...

335
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,930
100%.

336
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,550
I am patching through agent Rivai.

337
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,960
Tell me something good, Carrie.

338
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,160
Our team just breached the location.

339
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,300
Nobody's there, Mike.

340
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,690
Probably never planned on showing up.

341
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,770
You need to bring in the recipient for questioning.

342
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,330
He's our only link to tracking down the antidote.

343
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,130
It's not a he, it's a she,

344
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,940
And bringing her in for questioning

345
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,100
Is gonna be a problem.

346
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,160
Why's that?

347
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,640
She's dead.

348
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,330
Wow, Mike, you don't look so good.

349
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,330
Did you know that Billy calls you "the asian sensation"

350
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,710
Behind your back? Dude.

351
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,760
Can you pretend

352
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,840
I didn't just say that?

353
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,890
Truth serum is fun.

354
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,240
What do we have?

355
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,470
Uh, Mike pulled this gun out of the wreckage,

356
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,900
Along with a laptop, which Kitt's examining.

357
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,620
The gun is synthetic-- uh, plastic and rubber

358
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,260
With porcelain bullets.

359
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,140
A weapon you could get through a metal detector.

360
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,470
Show-off.

361
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,290
I'm sorry. This thing is specially made.

362
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,660
Coupled with the v.I.P. Pass, I'm guessing...

363
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,110
Mike and Kitt killed an assassin without identifying a target

364
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,600
Or who's behind it.

365
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,870
Passive-aggressive much?

366
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,080
What did you say to me?

367
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,880
I don't know.

368
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,150
Can the poisoned guy get a break here?

369
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,790
Guys, how do we fix this?

370
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,600
The next logical step is to assassinate the target.

371
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,370
Is it just me, or does going to tech for tomorrow

372
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,900
And assassinating someone in broad daylight

373
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,810
Sound like a bad idea?

374
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,800
I vote bad idea.

375
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,210
According to deleted e-mails I have recovered

376
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,720
From the assassin's laptop,

377
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,790
Once the target's death is confirmed,

378
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,340
$10 million will be deposited into her bank account.

379
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,720
Using the laptop, I can trace that deposit,

380
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,860
Leading us to the people who poisoned Michael.

381
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,180
It'll have to look legit,

382
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,010
Which means that we can't do much to help you, Mike.

383
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,610
Use the mask from the exchange

384
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,750
So Michael Knight isn't identified as the shooter.

385
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,590
I can engineer paint pellets for the gun,

386
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,440
So, you know, you won't actually have to kill anybody.

387
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,180
You guys are worrying about the wrong thing.

388
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,850
The assassination's not gonna be the hard part,

389
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,910
It's getting out afterward that might get me killed.

390
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,290
Hello, Sarah. Michael's settings are active.

391
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,650
I got it.

392
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,950
You're really going through with this?

393
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,850
You find an antidote?

394
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,410
Then I guess I am.

395
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,120
Thanks.

396
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,240
Mike?

397
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,490
Mike! Oh!

398
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,050
Mike! Oh, g--

399
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,350
Mike! Yeah?

400
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,590
Yeah, I'm all right.

401
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,830
You're not all right.

402
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,190
You are so beautiful.

403
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,030
Have I told you that recently?

404
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,770
Oh, god.

405
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,530
No, and you wouldn't if it weren't for the hyoscine.

406
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,220
Maybe, but it's still the truth.

407
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,160
How Long till I die?

408
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,360
Countdown at one hour, 17 minutes, six seconds.

409
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,610
You're all set to go.

410
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,260
Good luck, Mike.

411
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,070
Initiating launch prep.

412
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,870
Occupant restraint system active.

413
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,190
Chamber doors open.

414
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,890
Launch prep activated.

415
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,300
Hangar door open.

416
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,720
Do you have any metal in your pockets?

417
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,530
No. No, I do not.

418
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,860
Turn around, sir.

419
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,240
Okay, turn back around.

420
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,190
It's just my belt buckle.

421
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,390
Your purse.

422
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,110
I'm a poisoned government operative

423
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,770
Working for a highly classified organization,

424
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,590
And this purse is a part of my mission.

425
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
Okay.

426
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,240
Great, more contact lenses.

427
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,020
What is their function?

428
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,950
You'll know as soon as I do, Kitt.

429
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,910
I can barely do this without the mask.

430
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,790
I've got to lose it.

431
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,310
Without the mask, Michael Knight

432
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,380
May be identified as the shooter.

433
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,920
With the mask, there won't be a shooting at all.

434
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
The lenses are a tracking system.

435
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,440
If they are operational,

436
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,720
May I suggest you get moving,

437
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,090
As your vital signs are destabilizing.

438
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,730
These things are a one-way ticket

439
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,090
To an epileptic seizure.

440
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,250
Your heartbeat is accelerating.

441
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,850
Michael, do you have a target yet?

442
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,010
Kitt, I think I'm losing it.

443
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,930
It is essential

444
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,860
To your survival

445
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,260
That you calm yourself and complete this task.

446
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,430
I'm trying.

447
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,720
Do or do not.

448
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,960
There is no try.

449
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,970
Are you quoting movie lines now?

450
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,150
I'm attempting to keep you focused

451
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,840
On the task at hand, Michael.

452
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,250
I can't handle much more of this.

453
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,120
Thank you so much.

454
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,920
Well, as I said, we do have a working prototype,

455
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,060
But I'm not at liberty to say

456
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,900
When it will be available to the general public.

457
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,220
But believe me, rest assured,

458
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,810
When it is, you'll be hearing a lot abouout it.

459
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,380
It's Darian Richards.

460
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,250
Darian Richards is the visionary founder

461
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,070
And ceo of innovative technologies.

462
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,040
Forbes lists him as the 34th wealthiest man

463
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,160
In america.

464
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,040
He is married, with five children.

465
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,690
It would be better to wait to assassinate Richards

466
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,410
Until he exits the convention center.

467
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,090
I can't wait any Longer.

468
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,320
In that case, I have escape routes plotted.

469
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,370
I am repositioning Zoe and agent Rivai.

470
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,760
Kitt,

471
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,930
You're the best soldier I've ever known.

472
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,250
Thank you, Michael.

473
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,840
And so, everybody, thanks so much for coming.

474
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,330
And have a terrific afternoon.

475
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,980
Police officers are approaching you from all sides.

476
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,950
Help is coming. Just hang in there.

477
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,920
Fbi, give us some room.

478
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,610
Stay down, mr. Richards. You're gonna be just fine.

479
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,140
It's Rivai.

480
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,800
Kitt, where am I going?

481
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,560
Continue through the Kitchen.

482
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,420
Do not use the exit doors. Continue along this hallway.

483
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,730
By stopping, you are allowing the authorities

484
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,930
To reach you.

485
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,020
Two officers will emerge from around the corner

486
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,410
In eight seconds.

487
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,110
In your current condition, it is not wise

488
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,170
To engage in a physical confrontation.

489
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,390
Too late.

490
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,460
Kitt, please tell me that's you.

491
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,230
Yes, Michael, it is i.

492
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,230
Your display of affection is appreciated,

493
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,680
But unnecessary.

494
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,110
Your reaction time has improved.

495
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,580
I think the adrenaline's helping.

496
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,130
Reverse.

497
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,870
Commencing reverse motion.

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,070
They are setting a perimeter around the building.

499
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,640
If they search us, we're done.

500
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,520
I got this.

501
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,190
Attention, all units.

502
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,930
Suspect spotted two blocks west of the convention center.

503
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,840
Please be advised

504
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,320
And approach with caution.

505
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,860
Good job, Kitt.

506
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,390
Your vital signs are reaching critical levels.

507
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,340
Did you erase the security-camera footage?

508
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,940
Yes, all evidence of you has been deleted.

509
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,150
My research into Darian Richards has discovered

510
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,100
An offshore company that has been short selling

511
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,040
Large chunks of innovative stock.

512
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,680
Pretend I skipped business school.

513
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,950
Short selling is when an investor hopes to gain

514
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,990
From the expected decline in the price of a stock.

515
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,100
As founder and ceo of innovative,

516
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,620
Richards' death would cause the stock to plummet,

517
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,390
Making the owner of the shorted shares

518
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,790
Instantly rich.

519
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,510
Find out who's shorting the shares.

520
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,310
I am running a trace now.

521
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,570
We have just received a confirmed report

522
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,810
That Darian Richards,

523
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,580
Billionaire scientist and the genius

524
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,260
Behind innovative technology,

525
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,430
Has been shot to death while giving a speech

526
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,520
At the tech for tomorrow symposium.

527
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,200
The fake story is working.

528
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,690
It's all over the news.

529
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,530
You okay?

530
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,410
Well, I'm not dead or arrested, if that's what you mean.

531
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,080
You need to find these men, Mike.

532
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,970
$10 million has just been transferred

533
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,760
Into the assassin's bank account.

534
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,000
I got to go.

535
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,540
You tell him there's no antidote?

536
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,700
I'm guessing he already knows.

537
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,820
Don't worry. He'll still finish your mission.

538
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,900
Oh, I know he will, Sarah. That's why we chose him.

539
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,510
You're going to let him die?

540
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,760
Go help him.

541
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,920
He'll find them.

542
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,010
He's a closer. That's what he does.

543
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,150
Take what you have and go help him.

544
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,590
I have traced the funds deposited

545
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,370
Into the assassin's bank account.

546
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,710
The transfer originated

547
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,830
From an offshore account

548
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,660
Connected to the same company shorting innovative stock,

549
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,500
All owned by Walton Axe.

550
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,330
He is currently under investigation

551
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,540
By the fbi and s.E.C.

552
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,370
His profile fits that of the man

553
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,790
We are looking for.

554
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,950
That's him. That's the guy who poisoned me.

555
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,230
Walton Axe uses

556
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,350
A registered cell phone.

557
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,110
I am currently hacking multiple satellites

558
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,460
And phone towers

559
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,170
To pinpoint its gps signal.

560
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,580
Kitt, get me Carrie.

561
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,010
We have a line on our guy.

562
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,360
Once Kitt gets a fix, I'll have him relay it to you.

563
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,380
How's Richards?

564
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,970
Considering the circumstances,

565
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,350
I'd say he's handling it pretty well.

566
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,110
You know, if I'd known you were gonna use so much fake blood,

567
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,400
I'd have worn a less expensive shirt.

568
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,620
Mmm, it tastes like Cherries.

569
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,040
Mike, hang in there. I'll see you soon.

570
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,580
I have Axe's phone signal.

571
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,280
Relay the signal to Carrie,

572
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,710
Plot to intercept.

573
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,020
Attack mode.

574
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,260
Kitt, get me Sarah.

575
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,490
Mike, I'm heading towards you now.

576
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,320
We should be at that wedding.

577
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,220
What?

578
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,210
I should've told Torres to shove this mission.

579
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,130
Mike, I'll be with you in a few minutes.

580
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,130
Just hold on.

581
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,820
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

582
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,030
I just-- I want you to know...

583
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,130
That I love you.

584
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,700
Mike?

585
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,650
Hello? Mike?

586
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,940
Kitt, do you have Mike?

587
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,550
Michael's heart has stopped. He is dead.

588
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,410
Kitt, how close are you?

589
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,310
Our paths will intersect in approximately four seconds.

590
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,460
I will pull over to your side of the road.

591
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,430
He is here, Sarah

592
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Mike!

593
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,260
Kitt, defib.

594
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,680
We do not have much time to revive.

595
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,890
Mike.

596
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,130
Wake up.

597
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,760
Kitt, how Long till it recharges?

598
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,270
One minute, 38 seconds.

599
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,260
That's too Long.

600
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,840
I can administer the correct voltage.

601
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,360
Now, Sarah.

602
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,450
Holy crap, that hurts.

603
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,950
His vitals are stable, but will not remain so for Long.

604
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,410
Okay. Come on, we got to get you back to the Ssc.

605
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,430
Kitt, do you still have Axe?

606
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,580
Yes, he is continuing on the same general course. Mike,

607
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
You just died. This is over.

608
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,580
You coming or not?

609
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,210
We will intercept Walton Axe's cell phone signal

610
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,920
In under three minutes.

611
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,780
Mike?

612
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,600
Mike?!

613
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,460
Kitt, we need adrenaline!

614
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,220
I have something that may help.

615
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,130
Oh, my god, that's a rush!

616
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,460
I have a visual on Axe's signal.

617
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,230
On this route, Axe's car

618
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,090
Must turn into the parking structure.

619
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,260
Why would he do that?

620
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,450
He'll have nowhere to go.

621
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,680
Don't look ahead. Look up.

622
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,450
The helicopter's trajectory

623
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,560
Has it landing on the parking structure's roof.

624
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,470
If he makes it

625
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,050
To that helicopter, I'm dead.

626
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,590
The s.U.V.

627
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,660
Is ballistic plated,

628
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,260
Has run-flat tires,

629
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,940
And contains a large weapon.

630
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,280
What kind of large weapon?

631
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,400
It is 15 calibre machine gun.

632
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,870
That is a big gun.

633
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,910
The bullets contain an explosive charge.

634
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,030
Each hit is doing extensive damage

635
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,300
To my nano-skin.

636
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,710
Kitt, we need to stop the s.U.V. Without wrecking it.

637
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,180
In such tight quarters,

638
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,850
It is highly likely our weapons will do lethal damage

639
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,470
And almost certainly destroy

640
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,160
Any antidote on board. What about the grappling hook?

641
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,030
Preparing grappling hook.

642
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,610
We cannot sustain another hit. Mike!

643
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,840
Kitt, fire the grappling hook!

644
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,920
I need to attain the proper angle.

645
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,750
Kitt, do it now!

646
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,150
Firing grappling hook.

647
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,850
Now stop!

648
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,650
To protect you from gunfire,

649
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,410
The door will open straight out.

650
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,240
We need to keep them on the ground. Use your e.M.P.

651
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,630
My e.M.P. Has been damaged and is not operational.

652
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,430
My sensors indicate other vehicles

653
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,250
Are rapidly approaching.

654
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,050
Get on the ground!

655
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,600
Drop your weapons! Get on the ground!

656
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,580
Hands on your head!

657
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,450
Get on the ground!

658
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,900
Mike!

659
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,500
Mike.

660
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,740
Hands behind your back.

661
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,820
Follow me.

662
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,840
Where's the antidote?

663
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,730
Right now it's just attempted murder.

664
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,050
He dies, you killed a government operative.

665
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Sarah!

666
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,530
I swear to god, I will kill you right now.

667
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,670
Slowly.

668
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,270
No!

669
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,130
Kitt, I need this analyzed.

670
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,110
The only component absent from your mixture

671
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,890
Are the "a" antigens.

672
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,150
But "a" antigens only help people

673
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,570
With type "b" blood, right?

674
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,600
Yes, Michael's earlier blood samples showed him to have

675
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,150
A.B. Negative blood,

676
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,550
Which means we need both "a" and "b" antigens

677
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,100
To complete the mixture.

678
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,230
I guess you know who else has a.B. Negative blood.

679
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,090
Yes, if you give me a blood sample,

680
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,890
I can extract the antigens.

681
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,500
I really hate these things.

682
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,850
That is five milliliters

683
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,710
Of "a" and "b" antigens.

684
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,520
Is this going to work?

685
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,070
Due to the rudimentary nature

686
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,020
Of the mixture, its effectiveness

687
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,770
Is nearly impossible to calculate,

688
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,950
But I have faith.

689
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,290
Me too.

690
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,910
Come on, Mike, wake up!

691
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,950
Mike.

692
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,210
You know, you're blocking my sun.

693
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,400
Didn't know you were so concerned with your tan.

694
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,880
I'm convalescing, Sarah.

695
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,800
I need the sun's rejuvenating rays.

696
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,450
You're so full of it.

697
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,420
Guess the truth serum wore off.

698
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,960
I really didn't take advantage of that

699
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,520
The way I should have.

700
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,570
Still, you did say a few interesting things.

701
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,850
Such as?

702
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,700
Maybe someday I'll tell you.

703
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,240
You should get poisoned more often.

704
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,750
May be the only way we're gonna get a day off.

705
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,780
Funny, I was considering poisoning myself

706
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,250
Right now, actually.

707
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,970
Kitt?

708
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,080
Yes, Michael?

709
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,030
Initiate beer-run program.

710
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,650
Michael, my database contains no such program,

711
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,520
And it is illegal

712
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,990
To have open alcoholic-beverage containers on the beach.

713
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm joking, Kitt.

714
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,310
Your attempt at humor would suggest

715
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,580
That you are well on the way to recovery.

716
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,460
What do you mean attempt at humor?

717
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,630
What the Ssc doesn't know won't hurt them.

718
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,350
Better to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?

719
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,290
Speaking of, I owe you an apology.

720
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,830
We missed Lindsay's wedding.

721
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,830
Oh, it's okay.

722
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,770
I mean, it's not even so much

723
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,260
That I wanted to see Linds get married.

724
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,490
It's just...

725
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,760
I wanted to feel like we still had normal lives.

726
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,470
Getting poisoned with a neurotoxin

727
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,390
And saved by a talking car?

728
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,640
Not normal?

729
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,930
Not so much.

730
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,300
Would've been nice to have that dance, though.

731
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,000
Well, if a dance is what you want,

732
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,650
We can take care of that right here.

733
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,540
You are so Cheesy.

734
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,300
Come on.

735
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,440
Come on.

736
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,760
Kitt, music, please.

737
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,960
You have a lovely hat.

738
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,200
Kitt, where are Mike and Sarah?

739
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,650
I have been instructed to inform you

740
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,940
That they are completely indisposed

741
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,430
And not to be disturbed.

742
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,150
Kitt, tell me where they are,

743
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,730
Or I'll remove all of your spark plugs.

744
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,070
I do not have spark plugs. Kitt.

745
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,510
Michael and Sarah are dancing on the beach.

746
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,370
Dancing? Yes.

747
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,320
Patch me through.

748
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,710
Michael, I have Alex Torres for you.

749
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,420
It's Torres.

750
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,120
It was fun while it lasted.

751
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,620
Kitt, put him through.

752
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,400
We have a situation.

753
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,650
An iranian physicist with intimate knowledge

754
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,450
Of their nuclear-weapons program

755
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,700
Emigrated to the u.S. Late last night.

756
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,820
And as of this morning, he's gone missing.

757
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,030
Let's go to work.

758
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,230
It's tough saving the world.

759
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,040
What do you know about it?

760
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,300
I just saved your life. I had that.

761
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,630
Right. No, I did.

762
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,290
The physicist's last known location

763
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,760
Was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

764
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,610
And his contact's code name is the lamb.

765
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,530
You will rendezvous in 20 minutes

766
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,360
With agent Revai in the cargo plane.

767
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,920
The lamb will meet you in Philadelphia

768
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,480
And from there you will track and recover the physicist.

769
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,110
And, Mike, welcome back.
