1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,930
What the hell is wrong with you,private?!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,300
Princess,you better not be laughing at me!

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,800
Are you laughing?!

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,860
You got your panties in a bunch?!

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,100
You got an answer for me,Princess?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,760
You think this is funny? You think this is a game?

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,130
Michael,how much longer must we watch this?

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,660
I'm sorry,Kitt,it's the only footage

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,100
Annie had of the guy.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,830
Army news video of sgt. Jack Burber,

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,560
"the meanest drill sergeant west of the Mississippi in training."

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,600
Yep.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,130
What,exactly,is he training people in?

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,430
The usual... shooting,fighting...

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,900
Breaking the human spirit.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,530
I thought you said the human spirit

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
couldn't be broken.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,960
Doesn't stop people from trying.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,300
Mike,you're still not there?

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,900
I am 15 minutes away.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,360
You guys find out any more about sgt. Burber's death?

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,100
Only what was in the local paper.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,760
Small town. Army vet. Overdose."

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,460
Then the story goes away.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,660
You think Annie is overreacting?

26
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,130
Annie Ortiz kept my company's Blackhawks running

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,560
During two weeks of heavy fire and did not lose her cool once.

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,130
If she says there's something off about her D.I.'s death,

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,900
It's worth looking into.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,860
- Even if it is this guy.  - We're on it.

31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,260
Oh,I like the sexy librarian look.

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,900
Are you laughing?!

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,900
You think this is  some kinda game?!

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Okay,we'll play a game then!

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,000
All of you on your face and give me 20,

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,230
You bunch of ignorant,miserable,worthless bags of...

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,060
Should be fun.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,500
Just so you know,I tried to handle this solo

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,830
Before putting the call out.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,830
The lawman here is an idiot.

41
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,860
For starters,death by overdose?

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,230
Sarge didn't do drugs.

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,060
You did say he was having a rough time,though.

44
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,460
Yeah,you would too if you had just risked your butt

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,530
For your country,

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,700
Then got out and found no one gave a crap.

47
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,530
Look,maybe it was harder on him than most,

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
But he was getting it together.

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,060
How do you know?

50
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,860
For the past six months I've been loaning him cash

51
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,760
Pretty regularly.

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,900
Then last week he says not to worry,

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,700
He was was "onto something" out here.

54
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,360
Two days later I get a call from this idiot sheriff

55
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,630
Who says sarge od'd,and I'm the only contact on record.

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,200
You see the body?

57
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,600
Hospital rules.

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,130
He's got no blood relatives,so I gotta wait a week.

59
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,860
I really glad that you can help.

60
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll see what I can do.

61
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,460
Great.

62
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,400
Mike...

63
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,730
despite Annie's feelings,the chance of a veteran

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
dying from an overdose is surprisingly high.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,600
According to government data,one in eight soldiers

66
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,630
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,900
suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,230
and over 12,000 veterans attempted suicide

69
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,430
last year alone.

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Maybe so.

71
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,000
Still,Annie's asked,so we gotta check it out.

72
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,800
The database and the county hospital and clinic indicates

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,500
sgt. Burber's body is in examination room three.

74
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,530
I have uncovered the name  of another deceased individual

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,900
who is also being held here,

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,700
and I am providing appropriate I.D.

77
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,460
Kevin Lee?

78
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,430
Son of Peter Lee,recently expired

79
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,260
of natural causes.

80
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,200
Quiet Zone

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,900
Let's go see dad.

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,530
Death does change a man.

83
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,760
Just the other day,he and I were laughing

84
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,800
over... a pu-pu platter,and now...

85
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,630
Can I get a moment here?

86
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,730
All right,wise guy,I'm in.

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,230
Hospital data has Sgt. Burber's body awaiting

88
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,860
an autopsy in a body bag that should be evident.

89
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,860
Got it. Unh.

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,330
Hey,Sarge.

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,160
You look different in person.

92
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,800
Nicer.

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,130
Michael?

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
Jeez,Kitt!

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,900
It occurs to me you have limited experience

96
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,000
in forensic science,

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,930
so you will need assistance in examining the body.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,530
What do you mean "examining"?

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,360
Sgt. Burber's time of death is listed as 11:00 p.m. Friday

100
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,560
with overdose as the cause.

101
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,030
Annie has said she feels this assessment is lacking.

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,930
Therefore,another examination is needed.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,900
Uh,what would I have to do?

104
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,600
The reports suggest Sgt. Burber

105
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,230
may have died from secobarbital poisoning.

106
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,760
Look at the sergeant's lips.

107
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,500
Do they appear redder than normal?

108
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,800
Yeah.

109
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,100
He's got a pretty nasty bruise on his jaw.

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,300
The sheriff's report also suggests

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,830
that Sgt. Burber's body was bruised

112
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,230
during transportation from the roadside

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,130
where he was found.

114
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,160
This,however,is a problem.

115
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,560
Why?

116
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,000
Bodies do not bruise after death.

117
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,660
Looks like there's something on his shirt?

118
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,000
Sawdust.

119
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,630
And down by his neck is a really big,nasty mark.

120
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,530
That suggests asphyxia.

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,460
We need to check for petechial hemorrhaging.

122
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

123
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,760
Lift the sergeant's eyelids and closely examine

124
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,400
the conjunctiva of the eyes.

125
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,360
- Dude,I'm not doing that.  - Michael...

126
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,800
It's dead eyeballs.

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,300
Then you can be assured they won't bite.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,660
Look for red dots on the gelatinous

129
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,200
outer rim of the eye,

130
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,060
and within the sergeant's eyelid.

131
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,800
Hey,yeah,I see them.

132
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,900
He's got the dots.

133
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,900
That means Annie was right.

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,630
The sarge didn't o.d.

135
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,060
That is correct,Michael.

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,300
Sgt. Burber was murdered.

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,300
You discovered he was murdered,and tampered with the body?

138
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,470
Well,not in that order.

139
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,100
And anyway,I barely touched him.

140
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,940
After lying to a hospital employee

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
and impersonating a dead Samoan's son.

142
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,640
Come on,Sarah,

143
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
next you're gonna say

144
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,170
I shouldn't have taken his personal effects.

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
You took his personal effects?

146
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,940
Well,I wasn't gonna go through them there.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,340
Great,now going to the police is definitely out.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,370
No problem... all we need is to find out

149
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,040
who had motive,means,and opportunity.

150
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,340
We do that,we have our killer.

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,470
Impressive,Sherlock.

152
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,700
Please.

153
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,100
Matlock.

154
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,440
Motive means an opportunity,huh?

155
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,170
Okay,that's what I'll ask the sheriff.

156
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,270
No,Mike,I said we can't go to the police.

157
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,300
First some army girl tries to tell me

158
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,070
How to run my investigation.

159
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,600
And then you go messing with the body.

160
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,900
I didn't mess with it,sir.

161
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,040
Just looking out for one of my own.

162
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,070
That ain't your job.

163
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,700
What about when the job calls murder a suicide?

164
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey...

165
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,540
That was a preliminary assessment.

166
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,670
I haven't had time to get into the details.

167
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,370
Okay,I get it. You're overworked.

168
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,540
Probably the one guy who has to handle the whole county.

169
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
It must give you a lot of...

170
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,170
- Stress?!  - Yeah.

171
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,470
- You got no idea.  - So maybe I can help.

172
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,240
Or maybe I can just arrest you.

173
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,370
You could do that.

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
But like you said,

175
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,340
I'm not the first to look into this.

176
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,240
And if you put me away,I won't be the last.

177
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,900
Attention all county units,

178
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,240
Bank robbery in progress at rancher's national bank.

179
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,040
Cutter responding.

180
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,170
You mess with any of this?

181
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,340
I haven't even broken the seal,sir.

182
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
If I find anything's missing...

183
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,100
I will be at the hotel in town.

184
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,340
I'll throw your ass in jail.

185
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,570
Now get!

186
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,200
I think he likes me.

187
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,070
Rancher's bank?

188
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,270
The bank is on the other side of the county,

189
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,470
which gives us an hour before the Sheriff realizes

190
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,740
My report was erroneous.

191
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,870
Great. So what'd you find?

192
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,300
- Find?  - Come on,super car.

193
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,840
I put the bag of the Sarge's stuff on your hood.

194
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,100
You have surface tech there.

195
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,800
And I wanted it to be a surprise.

196
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,500
The items in Sgt. Burber's personal effects

197
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,600
Include American coins and currency,

198
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,440
A watch,the sergeant's I.D.,

199
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,940
And a matchbook from Newcomb's ranch bar,

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,770
Which seems to contain flecks of sawdust.

201
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,340
Like the sawdust on sarge's shirt in the morgue.

202
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,670
Exactly.

203
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,770
Newcomb's ranch sounds like it might be nearby.

204
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,400
It is. That's why we're driving there now.

205
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,370
Okay. Beautiful.

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,570
The Newcomb's ranch bar

207
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,100
Doesn't have anything unusual on its business records,Mike.

208
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,400
No report of criminal activity,either,

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,300
Though the place did get a new owner last year.

210
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,540
Anything on your end?

211
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,540
Just that this bar's

212
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,940
A frikkin' long way out of town.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,100
Michael,the Newcomb's ranch bar

214
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,940
Is just up ahead.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Thanks.

216
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,740
My scanners have identified nothing unusual

217
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,470
On the main floor.

218
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,740
But the basement is radiating far more electricity

219
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,140
Than one would predict from a bar.

220
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,640
Any way to get a picture of what's down there?

221
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,770
It will take some time to penetrate the substructure,

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,600
But I will try.

223
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,140
And so will I.

224
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,300
You lost?

225
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,600
Looking for a beer.

226
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,370
We don't get a lot of that out here.

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,340
This... is a bar,isn't it?

228
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,470
It's for locals,

229
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,270
And you and I have never met.

230
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,140
Uh... Mike.

231
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,340
Constance.

232
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh,that's a nice tat. Army?

233
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,640
Good eye.

234
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,100
Yeah,well,I got a thing for men in uniform.

235
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,370
You in or out?

236
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
Out.

237
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,470
Uh,left ordnance at Fort Carson

238
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,440
two weeks ago,

239
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,540
and,you know,here I am.

240
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,140
Ordnance,huh?

241
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,440
You miss the 75th?

242
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,170
It's the 76th,actually.

243
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,770
And no,I'm just happy to be here.

244
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,370
Michael,according to Billy's latest update,

245
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,370
Constance Savage is the new owner of the bar.

246
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,370
After all,I heard this is where I'd find

247
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,170
the best-looking bartender in the state.

248
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,900
She not only runs the place,she owns it.

249
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,300
What else have you heard?

250
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,200
I should ask what's downstairs.

251
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Well,why don't you follow me and find out?

252
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,500
- Hey.  - Do it.

253
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,400
That's enough!

254
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,300
What the hell is this?!

255
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,400
Call it a test.

256
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,970
Don't worry,you passed.

257
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,740
Still wanna see my downstairs?

258
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,270
How could I say no?

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,770
Ty!

260
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,640
I got another one for you.

261
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,370
Hey,you think you can do this?

262
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,470
What is this?

263
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,570
It's fight night!

264
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
Yeah!

265
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,070
Get up!

266
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,970
Michael,I have just accessed the lower level

267
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,570
via their closed-circuit system.

268
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,270
It's about time.

269
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,470
Actually,my processing speed was quite impressive.

270
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,670
Do you think this place might be connected

271
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,970
to Sergeant Burber's death?

272
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,800
I think it was where he was killed.

273
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,470
From what we can tell,fight night is controlled

274
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,700
by a self-styled promoter and vet named Ty Mckelver.

275
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,170
It's also one of the fastest-growing

276
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,170
Internet sites on the web.

277
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,970
So it's like boxing?

278
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,470
It's more hardcore than boxing.

279
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,340
Every night they live-stream at least three bouts.

280
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,500
No rules,no refs.

281
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,370
Most of the fighters are vets.

282
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,040
Winner gets three grand,cash. Loser goes home.

283
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,200
That's a lot to put yourself through

284
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,800
for three grand.

285
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,040
Not for these guys.

286
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,140
Most are hard cases,

287
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
desperate for anything they can get.

288
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,800
I'd be desperate too up against that.

289
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,500
That is "Monster" Molina,

290
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,200
fight night's reigning champ,

291
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,970
and the most horrifying thing I've seen on the web

292
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,840
since mini-me uncut.

293
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,240
Okay,can't you guys just call in the cavalry?

294
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,700
Not yet.

295
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,300
Busting these guys won't get us any closer

296
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,670
to finding out what happened to the sarge.

297
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,370
You're sure he was there?

298
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,470
From what I saw at the hospital and the club,yeah.

299
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,640
Think you can find a witness?

300
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,840
Good luck with this crowd?

301
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,140
What about the web? They post every match.

302
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,870
But they do it via a read-only live stream

303
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,200
that's up during the fights.

304
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,240
Once the fights are over,they're gone.

305
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,640
That's marketing. Keeps up demand.

306
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,140
Then where are the highlight reels?

307
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,900
They gotta be hanging on to recordings of past fights.

308
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,070
And if sarge was in the crowd,

309
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,640
maybe one of the cameras caught something.

310
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
All right,we'll look into Ty and his web site.

311
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,940
You and Kitt go back to the club and see what you can find.

312
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,670
So what time you wanna head over to the bar?

313
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,270
Annie,I gotta do this alone.

314
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,800
No way.

315
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,240
If anyone should be taking care of this,

316
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,400
it's me.

317
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,170
- I don't think so.  - I do.

318
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,170
Mike,the sarge saved my life.

319
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,970
What are you talking about?

320
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,240
The last week of basic... I was ready to quit.

321
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,070
But the sarge knew that,for me,

322
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,440
that would be going right back to everything

323
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,600
I had been trying to get away from.

324
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,370
When I gave him my D.O.R.,he wouldn't take it.

325
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,240
He said,"You can do it. Don't give up."

326
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,800
He made me who I am,Mike. I owe him.

327
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,140
And that is why you can't go.

328
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
You're too close.

329
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,770
Well,you can't stop me.

330
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,040
No,but my car can.

331
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
Right.

332
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,470
How'd you... Hey!

333
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,500
Hey!

334
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,170
Michael,it would be easier for my sensors

335
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,540
to access the club if we parked a little closer.

336
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,770
I'm supposed to be desperate for a cage fight,Kitt.

337
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,370
I can't be rolling up in a supercar.

338
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Sadly,I have no hooptie application at this time.

339
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Given the centralization of RF cables,

340
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,940
it appears all the camera feeds go into this room

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,170
in the basement,adjacent to the fight cage.

342
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,470
Anything in there you can see?

343
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,500
No,but the level of magnetic radiation

344
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,740
suggests the presence of digital tapes.

345
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,600
I guess it's time for round two.

346
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,370
I'm here to fight.

347
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,100
Not with you.

348
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,670
And he's back.

349
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,240
Hmm.

350
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,840
He's early.

351
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,640
I wanted to make sure I got a shot tonight.

352
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,370
Yeah,well,I don't make my picks

353
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,300
Till I see who's here.

354
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,070
Of course,if you want to make yourself useful,soldier,

355
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,440
you can... you can grab a broom.

356
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,270
Whatever it takes.

357
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,770
You army boys don't quit,do you?

358
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,470
Nope.

359
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,570
Me,I'm a navy seal.

360
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,570
Seals are tough.

361
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah...

362
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,500
It was cool.

363
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,000
Got to kick a lot of ass.

364
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,570
Is that how you got into this?

365
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,900
- To keep kickin' ass?  - No.

366
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,300
This is all about the money,my man.

367
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,740
So the fights are fixed.

368
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,840
Hell no.

369
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,670
If I did that,nobody'd watch.

370
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,370
This is as real as it gets.

371
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,100
Must feel pretty weird

372
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,440
Messing up other vets for cash.

373
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,370
Hey...

374
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,000
You got a better offer,take it.

375
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,270
Most of my guys are happy to be able to make some cash,

376
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,970
not to mention the opportunity to be famous.

377
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,140
Famous?

378
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,040
Yeah.

379
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,140
Take Monster from last night.

380
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,670
Two months,never been beat.

381
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,370
Three million hits on Google,and climbing.

382
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,640
That could be you.

383
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,300
All it takes is one good fight.

384
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,600
What about a great fight?

385
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,340
Now we're talkin'.

386
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
There was this knob of a drill sergeant

387
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,640
I had in basic.

388
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,600
I heard he came this way.

389
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,270
Thought I'd get a little payback.

390
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,040
His name was Jack Berber.

391
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah,you know,I'm sorry,

392
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,470
But Jack... He's no longer with us.

393
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,400
He,uh... It was in the paper.

394
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,400
Overdose.

395
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,340
Guess I'll have to settle for someone else then.

396
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,800
I guess you will,army. I guess you will.

397
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,800
Fight night! Fight night! Fight...

398
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,700
Tonight,right? You gonna be there?

399
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,970
- I'll be there.  - Yeah!

400
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,540
Ty Mckelver is an exploitation king.

401
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,100
Before coming up with fight night,

402
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,240
he was the scum-meister behind bum battles,dog eat dog,

403
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,400
and Ghetto girl smackdown.

404
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,600
- The one with the rolling pin...  - Yeah.

405
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,840
He's not even a vet.

406
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,440
He was never in the armed services.

407
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,240
He got kicked out of film school.

408
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,460
Ha! Doesn't get any lower than that.

409
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,500
I don't understand.

410
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,930
If this is the guy behind all this,

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,460
why hasn't he been arrested yet?

412
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,960
He has expensive lawyers and keeps moving from state to state

413
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,400
to change up jurisdiction.

414
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,800
That explains his hook-up with Constance Savage.

415
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,560
Sociopathic capitalists and the women who love them.

416
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,230
Uh,she's no angel.

417
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,560
Five years ago she was co-defendant

418
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,730
in a pretty big sweat shop case in Denver.

419
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,500
- Poor workers...  - Homeless vets?

420
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,300
It's like they find the most vulnerable people,

421
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
and then take advantage of them on a massive scale.

422
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
We've gotta bust these guys.

423
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,560
I can keep digging into their backgrounds

424
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,430
and see if anything useable shows up.

425
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,400
I'll keep trolling the web for more stuff on fight night.

426
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,160
If it turns out Ty doesn't keep archives,

427
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,160
maybe the fight night fans do.

428
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,430
Yeeeaah!

429
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

430
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,830
welcome to fight night!

431
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,400
For tonight's first spectacle,

432
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,860
we are gonna give you a big,bruising brawl

433
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,860
that's sure to be a classic.

434
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,530
Army...

435
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,900
Yeah...

436
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,230
Versus navy!

437
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,530
Kitt,I'm in.

438
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,630
About time,Michael.

439
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,830
I don't see you down here.

440
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,700
You should not be looking for me.

441
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,830
You should be looking for a tape that corresponds

442
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,060
to the date of Sgt. Burber's death.

443
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
I don't see any tapes.

444
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,460
Given the amount of magnetic radiation

445
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,960
emanating from the room,

446
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,900
there should be tapes.

447
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,860
I don't see a group of tapes.

448
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,200
Have you checked for secret panels in the wall

449
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,330
at the east end of the room?

450
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,760
I think I got it.

451
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,660
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,460
Cleaning up.

453
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,360
Is everything okay in here?

454
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,300
You tell me.

455
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,700
Good news. You're up.

456
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,730
Fight night!

457
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,300
Fight night!

458
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,000
Michael,you should be headed for the exit.

459
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,000
And instead,you are headed for the fight cage.

460
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm working on an out.

461
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,730
What's the matter?

462
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,300
Nervous acid reflux.

463
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
You got a bathroom around here?

464
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,600
Sure,but I don't think you want to leave your partner all alone.

465
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Partner?

466
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,430
It's the two of them versus you...

467
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,330
And her.

468
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,100
I told you you couldn't stop me.

469
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,830
Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen,

470
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,000
For our next event tonight,

471
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:54,060
we are bringing you not one on one...

472
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,960
Not one on two...

473
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,560
But two on two!

474
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,960
Yeah!

475
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,700
Fight night presents the beauties...

476
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,200
and the beasts!

477
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,500
Beauties?

478
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,000
What kind of name is... aah!

479
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,230
Unh!

480
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,800
I think I got something.

481
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,960
It's a ripped file on a shared network

482
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,960
and it's titles "fight night choke-out."

483
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,730
It's dated the same night as sgt. Burber's death.

484
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,960
What just happened?

485
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,760
It looked like monster was about to kill sgt. Burber.

486
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,460
- Well,play the rest of it.  - I can't. File ends there.

487
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,630
We gotta warn Mike.

488
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,960
Too late for that.

489
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,000
Mike and Annie are in the cage now.

490
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,760
Mike,what are you doing?

491
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,530
You were supposed to get the tape and get out.

492
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,730
Yeah,I got sidetracked. Unh!

493
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,900
Well,get un-sidetracked!

494
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,430
Get over here!

495
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,300
Aah!

496
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,560
Kitt,a little help here.

497
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,060
I'm analyzing your opponent's

498
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,100
physiology and posture

499
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,630
to anticipate his next move.

500
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,330
Knee to the groin.

501
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,660
Good call.

502
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,630
Movement analysis recommencing.

503
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,060
Just tell me what to do!

504
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,430
Unh!

505
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,060
Sidestep to your left now.

506
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,060
- Just like old times,right?  - Yeah.

507
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,100
Except for people weren't cheering for our blood.

508
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,600
Sarge used to say

509
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,700
if the enemy's in range,so are you.

510
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,260
- Not bad.  - Not bad yourself.

511
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,300
Mike,stop goofing around and get out of there.

512
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,630
Don't worry,we got these guys.

513
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,300
Mike,you don't understand.

514
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,400
From what we can tell,

515
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,600
monster killed sgt. Burber.

516
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
And the only evidence of it is on that tape.

517
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,130
What is it?

518
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,030
We gotta get away from this guy.

519
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,360
You just figure something out about sarge?

520
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,830
Annie,we gotta get away from this guy now.

521
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,660
It was him?

522
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,600
- Annie. Annie!  - Aah!

523
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
Michael,look out.

524
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,330
Aah...

525
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,460
- You're tappin' out?!  - We're out!

526
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,960
Kitt!

527
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,500
Kitt...

528
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,900
Commencing internal scan.

529
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,030
Michael,Annie has suffered a collapsed lung

530
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,930
and is in need of immediate medical attention.

531
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,860
Let's get her to the hospital.

532
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,600
Hey!

533
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,000
I knew you weren't here just to fight.

534
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,660
Good thing monster has quick hands,huh?

535
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,930
Kitt,get Annie out of here.

536
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,130
Who are you?

537
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,130
Michael?

538
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,160
I gotta get the tape back.

539
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,260
I said who are you?!

540
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,560
Go!

541
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,860
Get him!

542
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,500
I'll get the car.

543
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,900
Mike?

544
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,130
Please relax,Ms. Ortiz.

545
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,730
I will have you at the hospital shortly.

546
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,000
I am one of Michael's associates.

547
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,360
My name is Kitt.

548
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,530
Incoming emergency. Please assist.

549
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,430
The victim has a punctured lung.

550
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,700
Mike,do you read us?

551
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,330
Mike?

552
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,260
Still nothing.

553
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,760
Both his earwig and GPS crapped out...

554
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,060
Right after he left that bar.

555
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,830
He might as wall be on the dark side of the moon.

556
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,260
Stop.

557
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,060
You two stay here. You come with me.

558
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,130
Aah!

559
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,630
Kitt,do you have anything?

560
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,160
I've had no contact with Michael...

561
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,630
... since delivering Annie to the hospital.

562
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,400
However,given his last position,

563
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,830
I have isolated a promising search area,

564
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,960
and I'm entering it now.

565
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,160
Transformation.

566
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,000
Transformation completed.

567
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Hello?

568
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,760
Zoe,it's Mike.

569
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,160
God,are you all right?

570
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,230
I need Kitt now.

571
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,230
I'll patch you through.

572
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,730
Michael,it is good to hear you.

573
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,160
What is your location?

574
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,100
I don't know. I got a,uh...

575
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,560
... a dirt road by an old white shack,

576
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,860
maybe ten miles west of the bar.

577
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,060
Can you I.D. it?

578
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,400
Accessing my global photo database.

579
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,330
Dirt road,white shack. Nine miles from the bar.

580
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,800
I have it.

581
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,630
I'll meet you there.

582
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,160
Kitt at the evac point yet?

583
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,160
No. Why?

584
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,830
Look what I found.

585
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,560
Bank records?

586
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,560
For Ty Mckelver.

587
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,360
Every time Monster wins a match,

588
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,730
Ty's account bumps up five,maybe six figures.

589
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,160
Because of the popularity of the fights?

590
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,800
No. He's betting on them.

591
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,200
Check this out.

592
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,460
I ran a reverse trace on the account...

593
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,930
... after the fight last night against Mike and Annie.

594
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,760
Ty made quite a haul.

595
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,100
And after he does,

596
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,030
look who he transfers half the money to.

597
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,360
About time,Ki...

598
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,260
I knew it was you.

599
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,930
Yep,it's me.

600
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,900
Got a report of gunfire around this way.

601
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,060
That you too?

602
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,160
No,sir.

603
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,960
Looked into that case of yours.

604
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,030
You were right.

605
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,460
Your friend was killed.

606
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,260
Now I'm trying to get to the bottom of it.

607
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,230
You got anything that might help me do that?

608
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,400
Like maybe a tape?

609
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,400
You gotta stick your nose where it don't belong.

610
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,630
Now give it!

611
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,800
You've been working for Ty the whole time.

612
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,930
Yeah.

613
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,300
He's got your girlfriend,so quit stalling.

614
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,160
We don't want no more people asking no more questions.

615
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,130
You want to give it to him in person?

616
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,100
I'll take you there myself.

617
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,360
No,thanks.

618
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,630
I've got my own ride.

619
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,630
Uhh! What...

620
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,460
Kitt,open the back door window.

621
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,060
Good night.

622
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,330
Nice of you to finally show up,by the way.

623
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,200
If you hadn't lost your earwig,

624
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,860
You'd have been much easier to track.

625
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,800
Tell me you got him.

626
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,930
I got most of 'em,Ty,and now I'm comin' to get you.

627
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,830
You mean you're coming to give me my tape.

628
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,230
And you're gonna give me Annie.

629
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
Half an hour.

630
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,560
- Come alone.  - Sure.

631
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,230
Just me and my car.

632
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,960
Mike,state police are 20 minutes out

633
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,300
with the FBI on their tail.

634
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,160
No time. Gotta go now.

635
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,560
But after what was on the tape...

636
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,500
We know exactly what to do,Sarah.

637
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,060
Annie,you okay?

638
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,160
That Sheriff yanked me from the hospital.

639
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,700
I'll be okay when I get some payback.

640
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,230
Nice little reunion.

641
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Now drop the gun and give me my tape!

642
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,460
First tell me why you were hanging on to it.

643
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,230
You never know what people are gonna want to watch next.

644
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,530
One day it's a cage fight,next it's murder?

645
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,560
What are you talking about?

646
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,730
Oh,I watched the tape.

647
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,730
Kitt,show him.

648
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,330
The Sarge was gonna take out your star

649
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,930
and leave you with a huge betting loss.

650
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,730
So you did what you had to do.

651
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,430
Kitt,zoom in and freeze.

652
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,660
Because you blocked in,no one could see you.

653
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,760
But your camera just did. You killed him.

654
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,500
That's as real as it gets.

655
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,600
Now let her go. It's over.

656
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,700
Heh heh heh. No,it's not.

657
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,400
Don't do it,Michael.

658
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,830
Heh heh heh heh heh.

659
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,430
Uuh! Unh!

660
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,130
No tap out this time.

661
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,130
- You got that right.  - Unh!

662
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,030
What are you waiting for?!

663
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,660
Go stop him!

664
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,930
What the hell is wrong with you,Private?!

665
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,300
This is for the Sarge.

666
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,300
Hey.

667
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,000
Did the footage finish uploading?

668
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,960
Uploaded to the state police,the FBI,and the World Wide Web.

669
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,130
There's not a jury in this country.

670
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,030
That'll let Ty and his buddies go now.

671
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,660
It still doesn't bring the man back.

672
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,030
No.

673
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,660
But maybe it will give his friend some peace.

674
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,660
Yeah. Thanks,Sarah.

675
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,430
You good?

676
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,560
Yeah. Just making arrangements

677
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,930
to have the sergeant shipped to Harlington.

678
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,530
You know how you said he made you who you are?

679
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,860
Yeah.

680
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,060
He did a great job.

681
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,560
Thanks.

682
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,300
Michael,are you all right?

683
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,960
Yeah.

684
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,260
Just a little black and blue from Ty and his gang.

685
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,200
Well,you know what Sgt. Burber says.

686
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,460
The pain is temporary,but the pride is forever.

687
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,560
You'd make a good drill sergeant,Kitt.

688
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,500
Thank you. Now drop and give me 20.

689
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Private Knight,you worthless bag of...

690
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,400
Kitt!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
