1
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,670
Aw, come on. Captain jack harkness.

2
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,340
Torchwood, doctor who?

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,000
Nothing?

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,489
Isn't captain jack gay?

5
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,280
He's not gay, he's bi.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,170
Or omnisexual, if you prefer.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,370
Save the cheerleader, save the world.

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,340
Save some for me.

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,180
Nice pom-poms.

10
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,379
Captain jack harkness.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,910
You trying to tell us something, billy?

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,520
What?! No.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,840
I-- what are you looking at?

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,259
Hate to break the news to you, lisa,

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,169
But you and katie look nothing like the pixar lamp that was just mean

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,920
I think you guys look great.

17
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,850
What-- now you're mocking me.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,260
Receiving encrypted message.

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,360
Encrypted message coming through.

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,880
Who's it from? Decrypting now.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
Cia. It's a video message from an operator.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,199
It's faint and degraded, like it's being blocked.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,530
Reset the frequency.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,909
Repeat...Instruction-- can you enhance it? I'm working on it.

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,130
Zoe, give him a hand. Put it up on all screens.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,470
Whoa, this thing is live.

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,139
Billy, boost the signal.

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,189
Re--re-- request immediate extraction.

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,599
Repeat, request immediate extraction.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,729
My cover's been blown.

31
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,230
Verify this.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,370
Looks real.

33
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,329
Where is he? Don't have a location.

34
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,559
What about a locator beacon? Doesn't appear to be on.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,319
Why the hell wouldn't he have it activated?

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,720
Maybe he can't.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,710
Try a remote trigger.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,579
Nothing.

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,880
Zoe, get me the cia.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,789
I'm losing the signal.

41
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,720
Hang onto it. I'm trying.

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,750
The cia put me on hold.

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,930
Code name samhain.

44
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,419
What did he say? Code name samhain.

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,459
Samhain?

46
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,059
Cross-check that code name.

47
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,230
Let's identify exactly what this is.

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,139
No match on the code name.

49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,490
Run anagrams.

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,389
Running anagrams. Crap!

51
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,050
Somebody's jamming his signal.

52
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,750
The coordinates are-- he's giving coordinates.

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,040
The coordinates are...

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,170
Happy halloween.

55
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,809
I got all of you. That is awesome!

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,859
Aren't you going to rip him a new one for that?

57
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,989
Actually, I thought it was pretty funny.

58
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,559
You need to learn to loosen up, sarah.

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,200
It's halloween.

60
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,190
I gotta loosen up?

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,440
This from the man that never smiles?

62
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,319
I'll see you at the halloween party.

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,080
And good job on the mission.

64
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,530
Nice work. Both of you.

65
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,569
Hey, guys, we are gonna try to climb above this storm.

66
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,220
See if we can get some smoother air.

67
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:16,120
Code name samhain-- the ancient celtic festival halloween is based on.

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,140
He got us good.

69
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,410
The video message was mike.

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,450
He just sent us the footage of his setup--look at this.

71
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,300
Where is he?

72
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,779
He's up in the air vents above the tunnel.

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,039
What's in his mouth?

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,019
A relay transponder.

75
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,710
So we wouldn't know he actually sent the message from the plane.

76
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,570
He's good.

77
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,449
The boy loves his halloween.

78
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,420
He certainly does.

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,409
How long have you been planning this?

80
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,989
Months. What are you, 12?

81
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,439
Michael, I do not understand the immense personal pleasure you find in

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,479
Frightening your friends you're supposed to scare each other on halloween

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,179
Nor do I understand the lengths to which you are

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,419
Willing to go to achieve your goal it's called trick or treat

85
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,050
But you did not give them the option of treat.

86
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,340
That's because I like trick better.

87
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,220
Halloween's his favorite holiday, kitt.

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,620
It's always been.

89
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,820
What is your favorite holiday, sarah?

90
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,449
I like fourth of july for the fireworks.

91
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,740
And...

92
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,100
Thanksgiving for the food.

93
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,689
But I love christmas.

94
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,269
Because of the presents?

95
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,159
I do like getting presents.

96
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,500
I have one for you.

97
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,769
Do I look stupid?

98
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,079
No, Sarah, you do not

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,260
What?

100
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,919
I'm so not opening that.

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,119
It's probably full of spiders or something.

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
It's a present, sarah.

103
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,930
Okay, I'll open it.

104
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,429
Happy halloween! Ha ha ha ha ha!

105
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,910
It reminded me of trick or treating with you when we were kids.

106
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,380
That's why halloween was always my favorite holiday.

107
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,810
'cause you were there.

108
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,729
Thank you.

109
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,079
You're welcome.

110
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

111
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,290
Eww! Mike!

112
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,720
God...

113
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,079
There seems to be no length to which you will not

114
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,320
Go for a halloween prank, michael absolutely not

115
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,900
Who are you supposed to be?

116
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,880
Captain jack harkness.

117
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,470
The time-traveling bisexual?

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,330
The one and only.

119
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,110
You look nothing like him.

120
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,190
Can you give me a hand?

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,330
Not a big fan of severed limbs.

122
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,180
It's for the halloween party.

123
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,969
I'm gonna get mike this year.

124
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,909
Payback?

125
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,679
Oh, it's a long time coming.

126
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,169
When he was in high school, he took my car apart piece by piece,

127
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,559
And then put it back together on the roof

128
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,060
Of my lab I had to hire a crane to lift it of

129
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,469
I'm gonna get him this year.

130
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,060
Come on, zoe, let's make our rounds and then we will hit the party.

131
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,100
Wait, you forgot your appendage.

132
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,980
I hate flying in bad weather.

133
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,850
Look, kitt. Somebody's scared.

134
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,479
Hey, kitt, have you decided on a halloween costume for the party?

135
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,870
Yes, sarah.

136
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,619
Do you think anyone will recognize me?

137
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,030
I think you look great, kitt.

138
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,400
Yeah, that's a-- that's an awesome costume.

139
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,339
Personally, I would have went more for a vampire look.

140
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,669
You do know, michael, that there is no such creature as a vampire.

141
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,069
You never met any of the girls he's dated.

142
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,320
Are you implying that michael has dated bloodsuckers?

143
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,830
Be nice, sarah.

144
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,029
Let's just say that mike doesn't always make the best choice.

145
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,040
But at one point, his choice was you, sarah.

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,520
I believe I have said something that made both of you very uncomfortable.

147
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,419
No. Not at all.

148
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,809
It has caused your hormone levels to rise dramatically. Kitt...

149
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,529
Once again I am detecting a release of pheromones.

150
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,209
Kitt, you've gotta stop doing that.

151
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,429
Doing what, michael?

152
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,619
The invasion of privacy... Kitt.

153
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,810
I cannot understand why you two cannot get it together.

154
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,210
This room's unlocked.

155
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,969
Good one, dr. Graiman.

156
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,409
This part of your plan to get mike?

157
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,630
No, wait, I didn't have anything to do with this.

158
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,700
Mike

159
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,300
Very funny, mike.

160
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,519
What?

161
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,810
Dead tech in the mainframe room.

162
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,229
Dead tech. What are you talking about?

163
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,169
That's awesome.

164
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,060
How long can you go without blinking?

165
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,900
Come on, blink.

166
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,410
I won't tell.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,270
Come on

168
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,529
Whoa, that dude's really dead!

169
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,090
Oh, nice one, doc. You almost had me.

170
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,609
I don't think this is a halloween prank.

171
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,110
What, you're in on this too?

172
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,500
Somebody accessed the mainframe.

173
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,159
This is great.

174
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,110
See, k kt, this is what halloween is all about.

175
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,039
Get carrie. We have an internal breach!

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,469
Michael, I do not believe this is a halloween prank.

177
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,649
Dr. Graiman appears to be truly frightened.

178
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,659
The mainframe has been compromised.

179
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,200
An internal breach means-- I know what an internal breach means, kitt.

180
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,479
Dad. Zoe!

181
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,149
Kitt, get the chatline back up!

182
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,550
I am unable.

183
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,749
What just happened?

184
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,399
Three shots were fired at dr. Graiman and zoe.

185
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,360
The probability of a fatal hit from that range is 97%.

186
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,960
Emergency lockdown.

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,940
All personnel, please remain at your workstation.

188
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,650
External communications suspended.

189
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,820
Repeat external communications suspended.

190
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,709
Emergency lockdown.

191
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,650
All personnel, please remain at your workstation until futher notice

192
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,909
We have three people down. At least three shots were fired.

193
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,879
Kitt, what's happening?

194
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,309
The entire complex has gone into emergency lockdown, initiated by agent

195
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,949
Rivai, who is following fbi protocol for a situation such as thi

196
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,959
The suspect is armed and dangerous and trapped within the comple

197
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,989
Approach with extreme caution.

198
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,470
Apprehend with extreme prejudice.

199
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,059
Try re-establishing contact.

200
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,070
There is no communication into or out of the complex, sarah.

201
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,699
Sorry about that air pocket.

202
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,409
It looks like we weren't able to climb above the storm.

203
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,460
I'm gonna need you to strap yourselves in.

204
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,179
External communications suspended.

205
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,780
Check zoe. You got it.

206
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,919
What the hell is going on?!

207
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,669
Internal breach. Mainframe's been infiltrated.

208
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,369
Dr. Graiman and zoe are both, uh, down, and there's a shooter with a gun

209
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,709
Somewhere in the complex run a security

210
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,929
Check on all entry points in the last 24 hour

211
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,959
What am I looking for?

212
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,239
Any anomaly of any kind, no matter how small.

213
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,989
Pull up surveillance footage from in and around the

214
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,240
Location of the breach we've gotta find this shooter...Now

215
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,309
Kitt, we need to know what's happening.

216
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,679
I am sorry, michael, but protocol dictates communication silence.

217
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,119
Can you override protocol?

218
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,520
I cannot.

219
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,889
What are you doing?

220
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,739
Michael, sarah must remain secure in her seat.

221
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,389
The odds are extremely high that she will be

222
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,370
Injured in a storm of this magnitude. I know, kitt sarah

223
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,629
Michael, the likelihood of one or both of you

224
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,740
Being injured has just increased what are you doing

225
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,569
Try and override the protocol.

226
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,569
Overriding the protocol is not possible.

227
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,369
It is if you've built in a back door.

228
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,499
Sarah, a back door is a secret means of access,

229
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,409
And implies that you deceived other

230
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:44,449
Members of the team kitt, stop your slide

231
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,649
Gravity is controlling my slide, michael, not me.

232
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,380
Kitt, do something now!

233
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,700
What part of now didn't you understand?

234
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,849
If I had just fired "now," as you suggested, I would have ripped a hole

235
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,089
Through the fuselage I h d to calculate the area with the greatest

236
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,129
Tensile strength so as not to damage the structural

237
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,859
Integrity of the aircraft next time, calculate fast

238
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,300
Were you injured?

239
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,940
No.

240
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,660
Then my calculations were fast enough.

241
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,819
The storm is a lot bigger than we thought.

242
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,590
Please keep yourselves strapped in until we get through it.

243
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,029
It all happened so fast.

244
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,049
I dove to the floor right before the gunshots.

245
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,040
I think I knocked dr. Graiman down and he hit his head.

246
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,419
This is billy.

247
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,389
Billy, pull up all the surveillance footage from

248
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,800
In and around the crime scene already working on it

249
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,349
There's nothing unusual at any of the entry points in the last 24 hours.

250
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,609
Expand the entry search to the last 48 hours.

251
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,929
All our weapons are accounted for.

252
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,970
They had to get that weapon in here somehow.

253
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,380
This is impossible.

254
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,449
There's no shooter.

255
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,130
No dr. Graiman and no zoe.

256
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,890
Who don't you trust you need to give yourself a back door?

257
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,309
All good programmers give themselves a back door.

258
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,290
Is there a back door in me, sarah?

259
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,309
There's nothing in the room. No fingerprints.

260
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,379
Mainframe access identification has been wiped.

261
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,749
Even the memory of the code key at the door has been erased.

262
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,719
What do you got on surveillance?

263
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,649
We got nothin'.

264
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,899
Somebody programmed a loop to slow us down.

265
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,929
The cameras were disabled.

266
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,879
What about outside the room?

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
The cameras outside were disabled as well.

268
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,729
Where's the nearest camera? Main corridor.

269
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,529
Hundreds of people.

270
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,109
It would take hours to get through playback.

271
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,580
You got a better idea?

272
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,590
Pull an audio fingerprint from the mainframe room.

273
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,569
Recreate the conversation. Yes.

274
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,459
You can do that?

275
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,669
As long as there was a conversation.

276
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,869
And chances are the victim didn't go quietly.

277
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,990
Do it.

278
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,830
You have not answered my question.

279
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,900
Is there a back door in my programming?

280
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,860
Don't look at me.

281
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,570
There probably is, kitt. Why?

282
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,540
You know, I still think you would look better as a vampire, kitt.

283
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,649
You know, big fangs, a cape.

284
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,070
Michael, why are you helping sarah avoid my question?

285
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,560
'cause sarah doesn't want to answer your question, kitt.

286
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,480
Are you okay?

287
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,000
What was that?

288
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,529
I think you hurt kitt's feelings.

289
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,179
He doesn't have feelings.

290
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,869
You should talk to him. I'm a littleleusy.

291
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,940
Sarah

292
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,210
Kitt...

293
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,599
I don't know why my father would have built a back door into you.

294
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,969
But if he did, there's a good reason.

295
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,680
What reason would that be?

296
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,779
Why don't you help me re-establish contact with the

297
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,410
Ssc, and then we can ask him 

298
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,180
thank you. We'll be outside

299
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,460
You okay?

300
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,089
Kitt's self-destruct program has been activated from the mainframe.

301
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,919
What self-destruct program?

302
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,819
The one I uploaded.

303
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,329
You had no right to build a self-destruct-- I had every

304
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,500
Right! I had no choice I will not have another karr on my hands

305
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,339
Who activated it?

306
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,079
I don't know.

307
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,399
Whoever it was in that room that shot at us.

308
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,050
How much time do we have?

309
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,339
Less than 30 minutes.

310
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,970
We gotta get that plane down or sarah and mike are dead.

311
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,380
They're over the ocean, a thousand miles from land.

312
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,930
Just turn off the self-destruct.

313
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,120
I can't.

314
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,279
- how were you able to make contact in the middle of

315
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,299
A lockdown sarah programmed a back door into the system

316
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,659
Like father, like daughter. Okay, mike, listen up.

317
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,119
Kitt's self-destruct program has been activated.

318
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,709
You've got less than 30 minutes.

319
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,099
Self-destruct program?

320
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,569
What self-destruct program?

321
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,779
I'll explain later.

322
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,729
Sarah, use my password to enter kitt's system.

323
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,239
If sarah can get into the system, she can shut it off, right?

324
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,739
No, only the person that activated the self-destruct can de-activate it

325
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,429
By a digital hand scan which means the only

326
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,439
Way for us to stop it now is to find the shoote

327
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,109
Well, you guys are in the middle of a lockdown.

328
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,039
And we don't know who we're looking for.

329
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,159
No one saw anything.

330
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,869
There's over 1,700 people working in this complex.

331
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,340
Which means the killer could be anywhere.

332
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,839
Or anyone.

333
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,340
So what happens when kitt self-destructs?

334
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,409
He explodes.

335
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,960
Yeah, that's what I thought.

336
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,399
Kitt, activate touch-screen keyboard.

337
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,100
Activating keyboard.

338
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,599
Self-destruct sequence in 20 minutes and counting.

339
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
Why is there always a ticking clock?

340
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,160
The ssc can't help us.

341
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,319
We're on our own.

342
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,789
Why does your father wish to destroy me, sarah?

343
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,899
He doesn't, kitt.

344
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,119
Then why would he program a self-destruct sequence into me without my

345
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,289
Knowledge? I'm sure he had a reason although I am not capable of emotions,

346
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,479
I cannot help but feel that I have been

347
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,379
Betrayed first, you have to separate the sound wav

348
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,279
The brighter the color, the stronger the sound.

349
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,709
In most cases, the stronger sound waves are the most recent.

350
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,250
Except the gunshots. Those are the red waves.

351
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,119
Now, because the gunshots are so easily identified, I'm using them as my

352
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,969
Starting point now, I've isolated all the

353
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,289
Sounds after the shooting-- they're in gree

354
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,080
Those are you, the security team, and the emts as you enter the room.

355
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,339
Dr. Graiman is purple.

356
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,119
Zoe is yellow, because that's her favorite color.

357
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,310
Did I just say that out loud? Go on, billy.

358
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,869
Uh, once I capture and digitize the sound waves,

359
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,549
The conversation can be reconfigured

360
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,829
Like this somebody accessed the mainfram

361
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,340
Get carrie. We have an internal breach!

362
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,560
The mainframe has been compromised.

363
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,040
So what I do now is eliminate what I've identified.

364
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,709
You, the security team, dr. Graiman, the emts, zoe, gunshots.

365
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,809
And what you see is everything that's left from the time the door

366
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:50,579
Lock was first opened until zoe and dr. Graiman enter now I separate these

367
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,559
One we know is the dead tech, and the other is gonna take

368
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,990
A little longer to figure out can't we just listen to it

369
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,359
Uh, taking a sound as a pattern is easy.

370
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,739
Translating that pattern back into a sound is...

371
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,939
Very difficult.

372
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,130
Unless you have an existing match.

373
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,770
And this could be any one of over 1,700 people in the complex.

374
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,170
Kitt, we have to figure out how to shut down this program.

375
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,039
There is no way to shut it down.

376
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,579
Your father's self-destruct program is foolproof.

377
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,979
There has to be something we can do.

378
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,249
There is one thing.

379
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,129
What's that?

380
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,980
Remove me from the plane.

381
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,699
What?

382
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,339
I must be removed from the plane so that you and sarah are not killed.

383
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,659
Oh, that's not gonna happen, kitt,

384
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,140
Sarah will figure out a way to stop this thing right, sarah

385
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,909
Sarah?

386
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,260
I can't stop it.

387
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,759
If we can identify the shooter as male of female, that will cut your

388
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,149
Voice-recognition time in half, right yeah,

389
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,769
But we haven't got a visual on the shoote

390
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,800
The med techs just completed an autopsy.

391
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,430
Virtual forensics hologram now active.

392
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,790
Virtual bullet reconstruction.

393
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,319
Acute angle for the bullet.

394
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,460
Wide pattern for the gsr.

395
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,689
So the killer's gotta be under 5'5", and be able to get close.

396
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,399
No defensive wounds, either, which would suggest that the killer knew the

397
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,679
Victim we were able to pull enough bullet fragments

398
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,430
To do a virtual reconstruction see if you can pull print

399
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,229
Who was he?

400
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,320
The victim?

401
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,519
Bobby maccrory, lab tech. Been here seven months.

402
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,859
Seven months?

403
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,500
Man, I gotta start going to those company mixers.

404
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,789
This is interesting. You got a print?

405
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,359
No, there's a human fiber on the bullet.

406
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,839
Obviously from the victim.

407
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,959
I'm thinking not.

408
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,699
Why?

409
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,840
Because it doesn't contain a "y" chromosome.

410
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,440
It's female dna.

411
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,779
That doesn't mean the shooter's female, just that a female touched the

412
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,829
Bullet no, but coupled with the height and the lack of struggle,

413
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,479
I'm guessing we're looking for a woman what if you guess wron

414
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,549
With the time we have, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

415
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,130
Narrow your search to females.

416
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,529
Dr. Graiman, if we don't stop kitt's self-destruct...

417
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,940
I know, zoe.

418
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,439
Can't we just download his files?

419
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,940
His shell's expendable.

420
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,619
Sarah, we'll download kitt back to the ssc, then jettison his shell.

421
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,289
Dad, we'll only be able to download his

422
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,019
Files, not his neural network or thought process

423
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,139
Okay, what does that mean?

424
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,389
It means we will only be downloading my data, michael.

425
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,629
Not my being, or the essence of who I am.

426
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,839
My memories will be reduced to raw data with no

427
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,309
Significance or attachment so we're giving kitt a lobotomy

428
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,659
Kitt, I can upload your files into the backup neural network.

429
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,429
The backup network is not me.

430
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,200
It's the only way I can save you, kitt.

431
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,749
Then I would rather not be saved, dr. Graiman.

432
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,629
And I must confess, I am not pleased with your deception.

433
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,549
I had no choice, and I'm sorry, but-- I am sorry, dr. Graiman.

434
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,360
I cannot allow you to download my files.

435
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,090
I will do everything I can to protect you, kitt.

436
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,120
It's okay, kitt.

437
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,169
Sarah and I will take care of you.

438
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,490
I promise.

439
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,000
I trust you, michael.

440
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,959
I will unlock my files.

441
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,480
Sarah, you may begin the download.

442
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,549
Look at this.

443
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,190
They're starting to have panic on some of the other floors.

444
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,720
If we're right about the shooter being a woman, I have the voice print.

445
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,230
That's a female voice but it's not saying much.

446
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,570
Nothing pers-- just in the wrwrg-- wrong time.

447
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,169
This is a mistake.

448
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,819
The voice print is 99.9% accurate.

449
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,589
Do I look 5'5" to you?

450
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,249
Actually, I recalculated the bullet's entry angle.

451
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,889
The shooter is not under 5'5".

452
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,240
They're crouching and at least 5'10".

453
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,670
I'm sorry, carrie...

454
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,260
But I'm gonna need your weapon.

455
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,099
Zoe, get security.

456
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,429
Whoa, wait a minute!

457
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,409
Security to the ssc...

458
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,890
Carrie, please... Your weapon.

459
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,659
Agent rivai! Hey, hey! Hold on a second, Alex!

460
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,819
Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the audio print.

461
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,440
Carrie, you don't want to do this.

462
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,340
Move your hand away from your weapon.

463
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,320
Alex... It's all right.

464
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,429
He's just following protocol. I would do the same.

465
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,080
Confine her to a pod room.

466
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,389
Two guards posted outside at all times.

467
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,750
Is that really necessary?

468
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,790
Alex, you can't seriously believe she has anything to do with this.

469
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,320
We have her on surveillance exiting the chamber right before the murder.

470
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,199
Time codes match.

471
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,609
Look, she was making her rounds.

472
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,419
She makes her rounds at this time every night.

473
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,180
But she makes her rounds alone.

474
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,250
Check playback. Cross-check the time codes.

475
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,939
Carrie does make her rounds at the same time every night.

476
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,520
A perfect alibi.

477
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,439
What? She shot at me.

478
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,989
You too, dr. Graiman. She could've killed us.

479
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,289
Just like the tech.

480
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,569
We don't know it was her.

481
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,299
We don't know it wasn't.

482
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,170
Check tonight's playback.

483
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,639
It's another loop.

484
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,559
Are you sure? Yeah, yeah.

485
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,559
The same tech guy keeps walking past.

486
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,639
Check playback for the rest of the floor.

487
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,789
Cross-checking.

488
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,519
All playback for this floor is gone.

489
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,319
What do you mean, gone?

490
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,730
Gone. It's--it's been wiped.

491
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,979
There's no way carrie's a killer.

492
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,579
Who better to misdirect an investigation than the person leading it?

493
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,199
Not possible. Not carrie.

494
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,399
Deception does seem to be the theme of the day, michael.

495
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,519
Starting with sarah and dr. Graiman.

496
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,149
Is it possible everyone is playing an elaborate halloween prank on you?

497
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,480
I wish they were.

498
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,840
Mike...

499
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,910
I think we might be able to de-activate kitt's self-destruct manually.

500
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,989
How?

501
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,530
Old-school mechanics.

502
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,889
Basically, my father created what amounts to an internal bomb using

503
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,839
Kitt's operating system his processor acts as the trigger,

504
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,249
And his propulsion system the incendiary

505
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,159
Device we pull out his propulsion system

506
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,399
You meme drop the engine.

507
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,199
Sort of.

508
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,409
Sarah, defusing my self-destruct manually will take a team of highly

509
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,929
Trained mechanics exactly 11 minutes,

510
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:53,060
17 seconds at maximum efficiency which would leave you 47 seconds shor

511
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,429
I can't believe you'd think carrie had anything to do with this.

512
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,330
The voice print doesn't lie.

513
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,559
And as head of security, she had access to the entire surveillance system.

514
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,599
All right, we're going to use billy's audio print to

515
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,689
Track carrie's movements now, there's no way she's the shooter

516
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,850
Somebody's setting her up, and we're gonna find out who and why.

517
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,039
Michael, what is it like to not remember?

518
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,129
Sarah and I will help you remember who you were, kitt.

519
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,129
Thank you, michael.

520
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,599
But I am afraid I will no longer be me once my data is uploaded

521
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,679
To the backup neural network the backup is not me. It is a replica

522
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,740
I promised we'll take care of you, kitt.

523
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,779
If you don't mind, I'd like to replay some of my favorite

524
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:36,659
Memories, just in case kitt, when did you start using contractions

525
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,020
I didn't realize I was, sarah.

526
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,490
Kitt? Yes, michael?

527
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,419
Initiate beer run program.

528
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,919
Michael, my database contains no such program.

529
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,500
And it is illegal to have open alcoholic beverage containers on the beach.

530
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,940
Kitt, roll down your windows.

531
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,079
Mike? Ha ha ha ha.

532
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,160
Aah! Aah! Dude!

533
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,600
Happy birthday, sarah.

534
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,580
All your favorite memories are of us.

535
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,369
Yes, michael, they are.

536
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,079
Every cowboy needs a sidekick.

537
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,209
I would not sell yourself short, michael.

538
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,180
You are much more than a horse.

539
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,810
Hey, sense of humor. That's new.

540
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,530
So is friendship.

541
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,550
It's got carrie in the record.

542
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,980
Any idea when?

543
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,049
It appears as if the sound waves are the same

544
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,189
Strength as the mainframe room what are you doing

545
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,619
Reversing the voice print.

546
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,240
A person can't be in two places at the same time.

547
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,980
They're exactly the same strength, which means one of 'em is a fake.

548
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000
Run a side-by-side comparison.

549
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,549
It's carrie's voice, but it's a manufactured version.

550
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,999
It had to have been faked using samples, and then pieced back together

551
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,559
With very sophisticated software so if

552
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,119
Carrie was in here, who was in the mainframe roo

553
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,399
Well, whoever it was knows everything about us.

554
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,960
Every procedure, every protocol.

555
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,210
Fire emergency. Oh, great.

556
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,049
That's all we need, a fire in the middle of a lockdown

557
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,740
With a killer on the loose I'll bet the killer started it

558
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,519
We have a fire.

559
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,109
Where? Carrie's pod room.

560
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,840
Get fire control on it now.

561
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,400
Fire control to pod room, stat.

562
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,369
Torres. Alex, listen to me.

563
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,789
Carrie is not the shooter.

564
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,889
The killer is still on the loose.

565
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,179
I think whoever they were started the fire so you would cancel the

566
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,079
Lockdown and open the doors if that fire

567
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,960
Spreads, we have to open the exits, or we're all dea

568
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,279
I don't care if this whole place goes down in flames-- nobody goes in

569
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,250
Or out until we find out exactly what's going on here what's going on

570
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,240
What's going on

571
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,639
We thought there was a fire.

572
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,259
The alarm went off, and the computer identified your

573
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,769
Pod room as the source 

574
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,949
I believe I have discovered why dr Graiman uploaded the self destroy to me

575
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,809
dr Graiman is concerned that I may develop the ability to self-program

576
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,679
Kitt, self-programming's not possible.

577
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,470
It was possible in my original prototype.

578
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,209
What prototype?

579
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,439
I thought you were one of a kind.

580
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,789
Yeah, kitt, what are you talking about?

581
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,330
I am talking about karr, sarah.

582
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,889
There's another mustang out there, and it's named car?

583
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,839
Not c-a-r, michael. K-a-r-r.

584
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,959
Knight auto-cybernetic roving robotic-exoskeleton.

585
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,869
And he was not a mustang.

586
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,559
He was a cybernetic exoskeleton programmed for self-preservation.

587
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,489
A killer robot.

588
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,280
By the time he was decommissioned, he was more cyborg than robot.

589
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,760
You wouldn't happen to have a picture of this thing, would you?

590
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
And I thought you were cool, kitt.

591
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,409
Carrie, can you u ace your hand on this tablet?

592
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,229
Why?

593
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,680
If you're the shooter, you'll stop kitt's self-destruct.

594
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,799
Access denied. You were set up.

595
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,239
Why? We don't know.

596
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,590
But we'll find out.

597
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,800
Give her back her weapon.

598
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,679
Kitt, what else can you tell me about karr?

599
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,499
I have given you all the information that I have access to.

600
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,269
So you're saying there's information about karr you don't have access to?

601
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,579
I believe there is much about karr to which I don't have access.

602
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,820
We don't have much time.

603
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,230
Mike?

604
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,250
Mike?!

605
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,960
There's something about this thing, sarah.

606
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,380
What?

607
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,400
I don't know, it's like deja vu, but...

608
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,370
I feel like I know k kr somehow.

609
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,979
There is no fire.

610
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,819
Someone's setting off false alarms randomly throughout the

611
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,179
Complex. They're screwing with us her voice was faked using samples

612
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,930
She's the head of security.

613
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,539
Oh, man. It's a misdirect.

614
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,570
Carrie... I would have done the same.

615
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,249
There's no audio print of the shooter leaving the room.

616
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,159
What are you talking about?

617
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,079
The sound waves should have drifted if someone left the room.

618
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,719
Instead, it's like the shooter disappeared inside the room.

619
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,980
They're still there. That's why we haven't found them.

620
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,700
Mike, carrie was set up.

621
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,510
Then the whole murder and break-in was just a cover-up for something else.

622
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,440
What is it making us do?

623
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,950
Stop the download.

624
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,160
Why?

625
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,739
Everything that's happening in the ssc is a

626
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,529
Diversion so that we'll download kitt stop the download

627
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,830
It's too late.

628
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,900
His files are gone.

629
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,520
Clear.

630
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,769
Clear.

631
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,640
Check for false doors and walls.

632
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,610
Nothing.

633
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,850
Alex

634
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,900
Oh, my god!

635
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,720
She knocked me out.

636
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,039
This is billy.

637
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,479
Billy, listen carefully.

638
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,620
Zoe is not zoe.

639
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,339
What are you talking about?

640
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,939
Listen, she's not zoe.

641
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,370
She's an imposter.

642
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,939
You're not zoe, are you?

643
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,420
Not even close.

644
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,570
I knew zoe would never kiss me.

645
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,459
Can we just cut a wire like in the movies?

646
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,970
You know, red or blue.

647
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,500
It's not that simple.

648
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,740
Then we're running out of time.

649
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,179
I'm gonna have to dump kitt out of the plane.

650
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,740
Come on, mike, we can do this.

651
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,389
Michael's right, sarah.

652
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,760
You must jettison me from the aircraft.

653
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,990
Cancel the lockdown and open the exit doors.

654
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,739
I'm afraid I can't do that.

655
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,949
Then I'm going to kill you.

656
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,300
I'll see what I can do.

657
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,789
She set off the self-destruct so we'd download kitt.

658
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,630
She's after his files.

659
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,680
You all right? Mm-hmm.

660
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,629
Emergency lockdown override.

661
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,870
She's got billy.

662
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,600
Where are they going?

663
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,639
Chamber doors opening

664
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,729
The entry tunnel.

665
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,950
Why would billy lead her out through the tunnel?

666
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,860
All right!

667
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,130
Open the next one. Now!

668
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,759
Ow. Faster.

669
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,390
You know, in some ways you're a lot like the real zoe.

670
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,889
Fbi, freeze!

671
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,419
Do not open those doors, billy!

672
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,169
She gets into that tunnel, it's a clear shot to the outside.

673
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,490
We have no idea who's out there waiting for her.

674
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,550
Uh, I'm not real comfortable with this, guys.

675
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,699
Drop your weapon!

676
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,449
Sarah, we're running out of time.

677
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,279
You must allow michael to jettison me before it's too late.

678
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,870
Drop your weapon! There's no way out!

679
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,729
Take another step, and I'll kill him.

680
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,939
You shoot him, I'll drop you like a bad habit.

681
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,030
Someone tell me this is some sort of halloween prank.

682
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,450
Please?

683
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,930
He's losing it.

684
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,519
No, he's not.

685
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,929
He's a genius.

686
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,460
He's telling us exactly how to stop her.

687
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,309
Zoe!

688
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,459
You're gonna reach out to the control panel and close the

689
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,640
Door at the opposite end of the tunnel billy, don't do it

690
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,499
If I move, they're gonna shoot.

691
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,280
If you don't, I'm going to.

692
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,759
Okay.

693
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,629
We're out of time. No! Mike!

694
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,800
Sarah, please listen to michael.

695
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,819
I'm moving closer.

696
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,040
Billy...

697
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,219
I'm almost there.

698
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,960
Come on, move it!

699
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,460
I can't believe you thought she was me.

700
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,930
I didn't really... Think it was you.

701
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,339
Michael, the cargo door has malfunctioned.

702
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,939
The window to jettison me has passed.

703
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,159
I have informed the pilot and co-pilot.

704
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,580
They are ready to evac on your mark.

705
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,839
Don't worry, sarah.

706
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,009
With michael's exceptional skills, you have a better

707
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,909
Than 50% chance of survival I'm not worried about us, kitt

708
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,849
I'm worried about you. We gotta go.

709
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,180
Kitt, tell the pilot and co-pilot to evac now.

710
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:30,879
20  19  18  17  16  15  14  13  12...

711
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,340
Give me your right hand!

712
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,089
Hold still, or I will cut it off at the rest!

713
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,279
7  6  5  4...

714
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,220
Access granted. Self-destruct aborted.

715
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,400
Michael, my self-destruct has been aborted.

716
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,479
Kitt, are you sure?

717
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,720
Yes, michael, I'm sure.

718
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,100
Who do you work for?

719
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,690
Maybe you should ask yourself the same question.

720
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,170
No, no!

721
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,750
She's dead.

722
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,400
Decontamination complete.

723
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,010
Chamber door is opening.

724
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,809
We have dna confirmation.

725
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,239
Her name was teri lee.

726
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,599
She underwent facial reconstruction and altered her voice to

727
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,260
Assume zoe's identity how did she know so much about this project

728
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,420
I don't know.

729
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,329
It's in washington's hands now.

730
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,609
Security's been doubled.

731
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,559
Every password and code has been changed and re-encrypted.

732
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,350
Every employee will be re-screened.

733
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,109
This will never happen again.

734
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,509
Alex, there are only three neural networks that support kitt's files.

735
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,920
Kitt, the backup, and karr.

736
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,709
Karr wasn't decommissioned. He's still out there.

737
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,629
You don't know that.

738
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,340
There's no other explanation.

739
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:30,119
And if this woman had succeeded in putting kitt's brain into karr's body,

740
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,800
She would have had the ultimate weapon karr killed seven people, charles

741
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,620
There's no way they'd keep him around.

742
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,590
I hope you're right.

743
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,900
Well, this has been the craziest halloween ever.

744
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,419
And I've had some crazy ones.

745
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,140
Try having someone dress up as you for halloween.

746
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,239
Try having everyone think you're a killer.

747
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,689
Try almost blowing up.

748
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,150
And we have a winner!

749
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,350
I don't feel much like a party. Me neither.

750
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,740
How do I know you're you?

751
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,160
Maybe a little...Kiss?

752
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,960
Okay.

753
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,520
Really?

754
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,480
That's funny.

755
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,210
It's good to have you back.
