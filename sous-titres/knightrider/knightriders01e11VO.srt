1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:01,640
Previously on Knight Rider...

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,540
Olara Kumali... she's the best hope

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,170
to end the civil war in central Africa.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm going to give you an ambassador,

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,300
but you're gonna have to do a little something for me.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,500
They're going to give you a box.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,940
The material in the box is hafnium.

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,600
You're having me build a bomb?

9
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,940
No, I'm having you collect pieces

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,040
so I can build a bomb.

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,270
Get into this car now and gun it to 100 miles per hour.

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,600
And then you stay on that road.

13
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,070
If you dip from 100 miles per hour,

14
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,770
the bomb will just explode automatically.

15
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,970
I'll find you.

16
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,100
You, too.

17
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,340
I got something. No!

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,170
Carrie?

19
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,270
Oh, my god.

20
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,400
Guys, what do we know?

21
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,870
All communications are down.

22
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,370
I can't get a visual on any of our people,

23
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,700
including Carrie.

24
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,500
Open a line to Mike.

25
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,540
Mike. what's happening?

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Warehouse where they were holding the ambassador

27
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,600
has been blown.

28
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,370
I think Carrie and her people are down.

29
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,400
Any idea what your destination is?

30
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,600
No, Stevens told me

31
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,470
to travel North and stay above 100.

32
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,000
We're on it, Mike.

33
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,140
Zoe, go to the warehouse

34
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,470
and find out what happened to Carrie and our team.

35
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,700
I should go, too.

36
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,270
No, Sarah, I need you and your father

37
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,570
to figure out how to defuse a bomb

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,700
without dropping below 100 miles an hour

39
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,470
or veering off course.

40
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,300
Come on, dad.

41
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,040
Billy, we have to find Stevens.

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,770
Okay.

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,100
Carrie's a survivor.

44
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,240
She'll be all right.

45
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,040
Put her out of your head.

46
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,440
Let's get this done.

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,170
Michael, satellite imagery

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,970
is showing a blockage in the road ahead.

49
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,570
Are you serious?

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,770
We've been on the road for, like, five minutes.

51
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,500
You put up everything

52
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,670
on the touch screen except for my speed.

53
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,570
Would you like me to drive?

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,900
Sorry, Kitt.

55
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,570
You're programmed with too many safety protocols.

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
You slow down to avoid a pedestrian,

57
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,100
and that bomb will blow.

58
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,940
But go to attack mode.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,270
And can you get me lights and sirens?

60
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,640
Will this suffice?

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Kitt,

62
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,300
This is awesome.

63
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,340
A good idea, but I'm afraid the bottleneck ahead

64
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,340
is the result of a construction zone

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,700
merged to a single lane.

66
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,170
Cars have nowhere to go.

67
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,870
And neither will we.

69
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,040
Where were you on that one, super car?

70
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,870
Sorry, Michael. He was hidden quite well.

71
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,240
Well, I hope this guy can drive,

72
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,570
Because this is about to get gnarly.

73
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,740
Sorry!

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Bomb in my trunk!

75
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,140
pull over!

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,840
I always wanted to elude the cops in a high-speed chase.

77
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,040
Just not quite like this.

78
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,500
I do not understand your enjoyment in breaking the law.

79
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,900
Eh, speeding is fun.

80
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,040
Is it fun that there's

81
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,170
an impassable obstruction ahead?

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Binocular enhance.

83
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,700
You know what this calls for.

84
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,900
- I do.  - Will the cop be okay?

85
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,000
He should be fine.

86
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,270
I guess that'll have to do. Turbo boost.

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,770
Remember, you must stay above 100 miles per hour.

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,170
Yeah, you honestly think I've forgotten?

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,740
Any more obstacles coming up?

90
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Funeral processions, circus trains?

91
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,740
Duck crossings?

92
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,370
Not immediately.

93
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,740
But there will be numerous obstacles

94
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
in the next 50 miles.

95
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,700
Kitt, we are gonna ditch this bomb,

96
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,100
find Stevens, and get Olara back.

97
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,370
You with that?

98
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,470
Yes, I'm with it.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Kitt, contact the S.S.C.

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,500
Tell them it's Stevens. Patch it through.

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,760
You didn't have to blow the warehouse.

102
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,360
And you didn't have to tell you friends where I was.

103
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,600
And now your friends are dead. Lesson learned.

104
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,760
Is Olara okay?

105
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,130
You know, I don't want you to take this personally.

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,530
Michael, it just doesn't do me any good

107
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,860
to talk to you anymore.

108
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,130
So will your boss please speak up? Uh, yoo-hoo?

109
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,960
Mike's boss? I know you're there.

110
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,730
Alex Torres, 

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,060
of knight research and development.

112
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,360
Well, pleasure to meet you, 

113
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,860
Alex Torres of knight research and development.

114
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,530
I have a question for you.

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,860
Do you have access to funds?

116
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,330
What kind of funds are we talking about?

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
A billion dollars.

118
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,830
You have less than two hours.

119
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,060
My boy Michael'll tell you what happens

120
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,260
if you don't deliver.

121
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,830
I don't doubt your resolve, 

122
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,760
but a billion's gonna take some time.

123
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,100
Spare me.

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Play around, I will kill the ambassador

125
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,530
And I will make 30 miles of this country glow.

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,960
Have a nice day!

127
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,100
Billy.

128
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,130
What do we have? 

129
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,530
I found satellite imagery

130
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,230
of Stevens fleeing the mill property in a helicopter, 

131
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,730
but the flight patterns are too erratic to track.

132
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,700
I pulled the call numbers, 

133
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
distributed them to every air field within 200 miles.

134
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
That's a good idea.

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,200
I have another idea. Pay Stevens his money.

136
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
But we'll never

137
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,100
get a billion approved so quickly.

138
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,630
Besides, if we pay him, 

139
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,830
he could still blow the bomb and kill the ambassador.

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,230
GPS is on a closed circuit.

141
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,730
Kitt can't hack it.

142
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,260
Then we transfer the bomb into another car.

143
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,130
That won't solve the problem.

144
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,500
Only delay it.

145
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,030
At least we save Mike and Kitt.

146
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,660
Mike and Kitt are the only ones

147
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,860
capable of keeping this thing from blowing.

148
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,230
Well, what if Mike bails out?

149
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,760
And we detonate the bomb inside Kitt?

150
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,060
Kitt can't contain this blast.

151
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,360
How do you know?

152
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,730
Beause I built it.

153
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,530
Just got off the phone with Washington.

154
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,500
We have 45 minutes

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
to present a viable solution.

156
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,030
Inbound planes on screen?

157
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,730
Right away, Mr. Torres.

158
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Are you crazy?

159
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Kitt's headed toward a highly populated area.

160
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,200
It doesn't matter.

161
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,030
Kitt can survive a missile hit.

162
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,930
Unless we order him not to.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,660
45 minutes, they'll launch their missiles, 

164
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,460
unless you can figure out

165
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,630
how to defuse that bomb.

166
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,830
Dad,

167
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
you wanna weigh in on this?

168
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,330
I got it.

169
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,460
And I thought I was crazy.

170
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,060
We're making the necessary arrangements.

171
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,800
We'll be there within 40 minutes.

172
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,830
Kitt, given your current velocity and trajectory, 

173
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,930
compile a list of possible targets

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,300
where Stevens might detonate the bomb.

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,400
- Compiling now.  - Any luck tracking Stevens?

176
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,960
The helicopter seems like a dead end.

177
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,100
We're digging into his personal history

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
to see if we can figure out where he might be hiding.

179
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,860
We are running out of time

180
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,130
to get the ambassador to the negotiations, 

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,430
so dig faster.

183
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,430
She's been unconscious since we found her.

184
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
B.P. Is 90 over 50.

185
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,100
She's got a few broken ribs, 

186
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,200
and her left lung may be collapsed.

187
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,800
Thank you. We'll take it from here.

188
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,030
Let's get her intubated and in for a C.T.

189
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,000
We need to see what kind of damage

190
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,200
is under these broken ribs.

193
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,860
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

194
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,130
I've calculated the possible targets

195
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
based on our current course and speed.

196
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,230
And?

197
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,600
In 56 minutes, 

198
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,860
We will arrive at a government disposal facility.

199
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,460
Disposal for what?

200
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,560
Nuclear waste.

201
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,300
And detonating a nuclear bomb

202
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,630
in a nuclear waste dump?

203
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,300
- Would be catastrophic.  - Get Sarah.

205
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,830
Our target is the nuclear waste dump

206
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,030
about 40 miles away.

207
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,200
How far out are you guys?

208
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,530
You should be seeing us now.

210
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,230
Mike, two minutes till the F-15s get here.

211
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,800
What F-15s?

212
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,330
You didn't tell him about the F-fif...

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,060
Nothing to worry about, Mike.

214
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,760
We got the road blocked off, 

215
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,230
but there's an overpass up ahead.

216
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,700
We need to do this now.

217
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,900
Ready when you are.

218
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,700
Kitt, normal mode.

219
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,230
Initiating transformation.

222
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,330
See, Kitt? Fun, right?

223
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,700
A riot.

224
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,300
It's in! Lift off!

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,630
Copy that.

226
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,000
Lifting off.

227
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,560
Glad someone's calm.

228
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,000
Gus?

229
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
Yeah, we might be in a bit of a pickle.

230
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,400
Oh, god.

231
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,830
Folks, 

232
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,930
We may have us a little contact.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
I suggest you go ahead

234
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,430
and maybe get in those crash positions

235
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,230
we all love so much.

236
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,600
- We're not gonna make it.  - Sure we are.

237
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
No, you're right. We're not.

238
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,100
Kitt, what's the probability we hit the overpass?

239
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
Calculating collision probability.

240
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,660
This is gonna be really bad.

241
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Collision probability...

242
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,930
100%.

243
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,430
Please brace yourselves for impact.

247
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,600
Kitt, speed and course.

248
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,460
Speed is holding at 134 miles per hour, 

249
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,160
But we're veering off course.

251
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,030
Gus, we don't get back on that line, 

252
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,530
This bomb's gonna blow!

253
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,660
Back on track.

254
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,260
Easing off.

255
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,500
You okay?

257
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,330
That was not fun.

258
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,060
You said it, Kitt.

259
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,730
Kitt, hook up to the plane's computer.

260
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,160
Run a diagnostic.

261
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,300
We maintain this speed and heading, 

262
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,930
Stevens will never know we're 10, 000 feet up.

263
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,260
Avionics at 73%.

264
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,830
Hydraulics at 47%.

265
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,460
Structural integrity, 61%.

266
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,430
Landing gear is non-operational.

267
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,460
What do you mean, "non-operational"?

268
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,230
To use the technical term, 

269
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,360
it's gone.

272
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,960
Kitt, transfer the call to the monitor

273
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,230
and make sure Stevens can't see us.

274
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,300
Hey, sorry about the detour, 

275
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,630
but we're back on track now.

276
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,730
Oh, really? Be sorry again and you'll explode.

277
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,700
And why can't I see you?

278
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,030
I don't know.

279
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,760
Maybe the radiation

280
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,300
from the hafnium you stuck in my trunk

281
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,630
is messing with your signal.

282
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,930
Oh, but Mike, I love seeing you.

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
You're so pretty.

284
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,530
Well, why don't you come and say hi?

285
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,360
I'd love a little one-on-one time.

286
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,660
Oh, Mike.

287
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm sure gonna miss you

288
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,130
when you're in a thousand little pieces.

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,260
Now put your manager on. I have to lodge a complaint.

290
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm here. I don't see my money yet.

291
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm working on it.

292
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,960
Okay, Alex Torres.

293
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,560
I have someone here who wants to say hello.

294
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,900
Olara.

295
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,160
Do you have anything to say

296
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,730
to the guys who are gonna let you die?

297
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,860
Do not give him anything. 

298
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,630
You so crazy.

299
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,360
You have a half hour.

300
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,160
Guys, where are we on that bomb?

301
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,360
We'll get back to you.

302
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,360
I've never seen anything like it.

303
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,330
Great. Kitt, what do you think?

304
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,000
It's makeup doesn't match anything in my database.

305
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,430
Given stevens' penchant for trickery, 

306
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,930
I'd strongly advise against attempting to disarm it.

307
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,830
I count five different triggers.

308
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,100
Yeah.

309
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,030
In theory, we could detonate the bomb

310
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,530
at an altitude which would render its fallout ineffective.

311
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,060
Explain.

312
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,330
If we jettison the bomb into the stratosphere, 

313
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,100
its radiation will be carried by the jet stream

314
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,560
to the atlantic ocean

315
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,700
where it will disperse, doing minimal damage.

316
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
What altitude?

317
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,630
Taking into account current weather patterns, 

318
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,230
the bomb's size, 

319
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,400
the atmospheric conditions

320
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,560
relative to our global position...

321
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,230
51, 255 feet.

322
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,430
No way.

323
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,930
We could probably do it.

324
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,330
Gus, this plane has a ceiling

325
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,130
of 32, 000 feet, okay?

326
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
At 50, 000 feet, 

327
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,130
the pressure could rip our fuselage, 

328
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,030
which is already hurting from the collision.

329
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,360
Can we do it or not?

330
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,930
Yeah, she can do it.

331
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Start climbing. Stay on course.

332
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,930
But don't crank it too far above 160 miles an hour

333
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
or stevens might get suspicious.

334
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,060
You have 27 minutes.

335
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,330
Roger-dodger.

336
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,130
Stevens' history drops off a cliff

337
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,230
after he left the pentagon.

338
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,630
Scattered financial records, 

339
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,400
no discernible place of residence.

340
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,660
Reports claim he approached a few companies

341
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,760
about private funding for his satellite.

342
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,400
The only interesting lead I turned up

343
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,730
was his name

344
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,460
on a number of flight manifests to Phoenix.

345
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,300
Does he have any family there?

346
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,130
No obvious connection I can find.

347
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,560
Keep on it.

348
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,860
They're closing her up now.

349
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,330
So the next 24 hours...

351
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,400
Dial 118.

352
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,200
Is this her colleague?

353
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,460
Yeah. I'll let her know.

354
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,360
Sure. Okay.

355
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,760
Doctor says you came in with Carrie.

356
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:00,900
That's right.

357
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,200
- She's your colleague?  - And my friend.

358
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,500
Mmm. Well, she's in surgery.

359
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,500
There's no damage to the spine, 

360
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,400
but the C.T. shows that one of her broken ribs

361
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,260
pierced her pulmonary artery.

362
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,260
That's what they're trying to repair now.

363
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,700
Are you a doctor?

364
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
No.

365
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,860
Company notified me.

366
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,000
- What company?  - Knight research?

367
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,360
C.I.A.

368
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,930
I don't understand.

369
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,360
Why did the C.I.A. notify you

370
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,300
about an injured F.B.I. agent?

371
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,660
Because I'm her father.

372
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,560
Lawrence Rivai.

373
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,960
Okay. Let's go, hank.

374
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,530
There we go.

375
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,700
Slow. Slow, slow, slow.

376
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,700
Kitt.

377
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,230
How long till we're over the target?

378
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,830
1 minute, 43 seconds.

379
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,030
How long till we hit altitude?

380
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,500
1 minute, 39 seconds.

382
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,400
Go... ho ho ho ho.

383
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,860
Why do we always have to cut these things so close?

384
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,000
Great.

386
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,860
Good job.

389
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,730
Okay. This is liquid plastic.

390
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
It'll mold itself around any object

391
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,600
and form a protective layer.

392
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,730
It'll ensure that the bomb

393
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,560
doesn't get jostled and blow, 

394
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,730
and Hank tosses it out.

395
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,900
Wait, why can't we toss it out ourselves?

396
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,260
At that altitude, 

397
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,530
if you are not inside my cabin

398
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,860
when we open the back door, 

399
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,260
you will either freeze

400
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,100
or asphyxiate within seconds.

401
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,400
All right. Got it.

402
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah, got it.

404
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,800
Kitt, transfer the call to the S.S.C.

405
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,200
All right, Alex Torres.

406
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,730
It's the end of the road.

407
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Bottom of the ninth.

408
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,800
The last hurrah.

409
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,460
The money should be in your account any minute.

410
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,860
Ah, now, see... you gotta remember, 

411
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,200
I used to work for the government.

412
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,030
I know you're all liars and crooks.

413
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,960
so if you're planning to stall, 

414
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,900
the man who has his finger on the trigger

415
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,230
is gonna be very upset.

416
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,360
We all want this situation

417
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,860
resolved quickly and peacefully.

418
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,360
Really? I don't. You have one minute.

420
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,360
We're over the target!

421
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,800
Into Kitt now. Come on!

422
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,500
Hank, hang on to the bomb

423
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,860
till I tell you to let go.

424
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,660
Come on, doc.

428
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,100
Pressurizing cabin now.

429
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,430
Kitt, open the cargo door.

432
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,030
Plane's structural integrity

433
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,800
is at maximum stress levels.

434
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,630
We're past the location.

435
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,000
- Release the bomb.  - Not yet.

436
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,330
This plane can't take much more of this.

437
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,930
Just hold on.

439
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,230
Okay, we're at altitude.

440
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Hank, release the bomb now!

444
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,200
Still nothing, Alex.

445
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,900
You know, I hate to say this, 

446
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,130
but I just don't believe ya.

447
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,300
I don't control the treasury, Stevens.

448
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,230
A lot of people have to sign off on this.

449
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,030
Please tell that to someone who cares.

450
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,300
You do this, 

451
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,460
and it's on your conscience

452
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,430
for the rest of your life.

453
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,560
Oh, no. It's on yours.

454
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,660
Guys, hold on!

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,660
Billy! Get that feed back up!

458
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,060
I've got no signals.

460
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,900
Kitt, what's happening?

462
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,130
We have lost power.

466
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,530
We're back on line.

467
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,830
She's coming on up.

468
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,730
Lost the navigation computer!

471
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,700
Auxiliary power has been restored.

472
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,300
Our rate of descent is decreasing.

473
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,930
God, I hate flying.

474
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Equalizing pressure and de-icing windows now.

475
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,330
You guys okay?

476
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,960
Yeah.

477
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,300
Kitt, I thought you said

478
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,230
the bomb had a blast radius of 30 miles.

479
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,100
No, I said its radius would be

480
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,660
10 miles for each gram of hafnium, 

481
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,160
and we provided Stevens three grams.

482
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,900
If that's true, we should all be dead.

483
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,160
By my calculations, 

484
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,060
the radius of the blast was 6.2 miles, 

485
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,730
which would imply that Stevens

486
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,100
used approximately 1/5 of the hafnium.

487
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,730
Stevens has another bomb?

488
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,030
Why would he put a bomb inside Kitt

489
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
if he had another bomb?

490
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,030
Because he knew we'd devote all our resources

491
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,500
to help Mike.

492
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,830
He was right.

494
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,160
He has another target.

495
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,700
And by now, 

496
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
he's probably already there.

497
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,200
Alex, how's Carrie?

498
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,200
We don't know anything yet.

500
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,560
Here's, um... for your coffee.*

501
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,430
Mmm. Thank you.

502
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,930
You must be proud of her...

503
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,360
following in your footsteps.

505
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,060
Carrie had been accepted to Columbia Law

506
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,360
just like her mother.

507
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,930
Instead, she goes to Quantico.

508
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,030
You didn't want her to?

509
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,430
Horrible hours, 

510
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,760
lousy pay, 

511
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,500
risking one's life for an ungrateful employer?

513
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,730
She's good at her job, Mr. Rivai.

514
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,860
She would have been good at anything.

515
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,600
What we do is necessary, 

516
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,000
And she knows it.

517
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,860
I have been doing this for 30 years, 

518
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,700
young lady, 

519
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,660
and I understand what is necessary.

520
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,830
Then you of all people should understand

521
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,530
that the sacrifices are worth it.

522
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,200
My only daughter will probably die

523
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,660
on that operating table.

524
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,400
Still think it's worth it?

526
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,430
Okay.

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
We'll set a course for the pacific, 

528
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,830
get everybody off the plane and then scuttle it.

529
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,300
Mike, I need you and Sarah to drop inside KITT

530
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,830
When we get a location on Stevens.

531
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,460
- Copy.  - No.

532
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,830
Sarah.

533
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,630
No, if Josh and Gus wanna jump, that's fine.

534
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,030
But you're coming with Mike and me and KITT.

535
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,530
I can safely accommodate up to four passengers

536
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,830
during a drop.

537
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,100
Okay, all right.

538
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,360
When the time comes, I'll drop inside KITT

539
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,460
with the two of you.

540
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,730
We managed to repair the damage, 

541
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,000
and for the moment, she's stable.

542
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,460
But the problem is we can't put her on a respirator

543
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,860
because the forced breathing

544
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,630
could tear the stitches in her artery.

545
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,230
So now we wait and hope that she

546
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,230
can continue to breathe on her own.

547
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,530
Can I see her?

548
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,030
Take your time.

551
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,600
You dumb kid.

552
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,830
Dumb, stupid kid.

554
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,100
Come on, Stevens.

555
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,830
What the hell were you doing in Phoenix?

557
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,100
Speak of the devil. On screen.

558
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,760
Maybe... maybe you can help me with something.

559
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,630
According to the bomb's GPS, 

560
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,700
The bomb exploded over the target.

561
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,700
And yet, it didn't explode over...

562
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,030
The GPS doesn't measure altitude.

563
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,600
Well played, Alex Torres.

564
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,130
No more games, Stevens.

565
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,460
What do you really want?

566
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,630
Oh, something that money cannot buy.

567
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,160
That last bomb...

568
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,500
Yeah, that was just window dressing.

569
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,460
The next one will unleash horrors

570
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,360
that you cannot bear to imagine.

571
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,030
What does that mean?

572
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,430
"something money cannot buy."

573
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,130
It means he's a true believer.

575
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,200
But if we can figure out what he does want, 

576
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,230
then we'll be able to stop him.

577
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,000
We're right here.

578
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,700
You're in the hospital.

579
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,460
Stevens rigged the warehouse, and it exploded.

580
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,630
Pen?

582
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
"Valdor."

583
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,200
Valdor.

584
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,060
Valdor.

585
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,830
Valdor.

586
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,960
That's what she wrote down.

588
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,630
Uh, John Valdor pitches for Boston.

589
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,830
Val-d'or... a city in Quebec.

590
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,200
Valdor Chemical.

591
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,460
Bring that up.

592
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,700
They produce chemicals

593
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,660
for household products, cleaning supplies.

594
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,030
Cross-check it against Stevens.

595
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,230
Nothing.

596
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,400
Try again with the Pentagon.

597
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,030
There's something here.

598
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,460
It's encrypted but I can get through it.

599
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,030
Mike, are you getting this?

600
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,730
Yeah. KITT gave us some broad strokes.

601
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,730
The files detail a government contract

602
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,260
for Valdor to synthesize compounds for chemical weapons.

603
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,560
That's impossible.

604
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,800
There aren't supposed to be

605
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,400
any chemical weapons plants in the US

606
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,160
These documents indicate otherwise.

607
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,700
Stevens is gonna blow the plant.

608
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,660
That's what he wants.

609
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,860
Destruction on a massive scale

610
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,030
to prove to the Pentagon

611
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,300
that they were wrong for not building his weapon.

612
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,660
The guy wants revenge.

613
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,100
KITT, do the documents say where the plant is located?

614
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
No, but I am currently accessing

615
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,730
the location of Valdor's production plants.

616
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,330
It could be any of them.

617
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,660
What about that one?

618
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,400
It's in Phoenix.

619
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,400
That's it!

620
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,900
Mike, that's your target.

621
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,000
KITT, can you access security cameras

622
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,360
for that Valdor plant?

623
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,700
I'm already attempting to do so.

624
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,030
Maybe they're not there yet.

625
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,600
Or maybe it's the wrong location.

626
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,400
There we go.

627
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,900
And there they are.

628
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,700
Olara's with them.

629
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Have gus set a course?

630
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,260
KITT, what's our ETA?

631
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,230
The plant is 142 miles from our current location.

632
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,960
We can be at an optimal drop point

633
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,300
in 34 minutes.

634
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,030
KITT, how many people are in that plant?

635
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,430
It appears very few at this hour of the night.

636
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,060
I'll alert the local authorities.

637
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,560
Call this in and 50 black and whites will show up.

638
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,730
Spook Stevens, and he'll blow that thing sky-high.

639
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
We can handle this.

640
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,860
All right, Mike.

641
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,560
You finish it.

643
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,500
Why are you doing this?

644
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,000
The country is incapable of taking care of itself.

645
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,430
They just don't know it yet.

646
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,400
So you're going to prove it by blowing up a building?

647
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,500
I handed them a weapon that could've stopped all of this.

648
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,360
They just didn't wanna make it.

649
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,760
But after today, they will.

650
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,800
I have spent many years of my life

651
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,500
trying to protect my country

652
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,160
from self-important children like you.

653
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,460
Hey, you know what?

654
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,800
During this whole time, 

655
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,200
I just didn't feel bad once about killing you, 

656
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,460
And I still don't.

657
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,930
All right.

658
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,430
I want you to lower the gate, 

659
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,230
Then I want you to wait a half an hour.

660
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,660
Then I want you to get them in, 

661
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,930
And then I want you to take the $1 million ransom

662
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,630
We got paid for that one and go.

663
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,960
Got it? Go.

664
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,430
Who is your mother?

665
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,500
We will reach our drop zone

666
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,400
In 32 seconds.

667
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,000
Thanks for everything, Hank.

668
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,000
Good-bye, Hank.

669
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,030
Couldn't have done it without you.

670
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,500
Dad, come on.

671
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,660
Let's go.

672
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,900
Kitt, protocol theta 7-3.

673
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,800
Dad!

674
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,900
Kitt, open the door!

675
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,230
Dad!

676
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm sorry. Per dr. Graiman's programming, 

677
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,300
I cannot.

678
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,800
Dad, what are you doing?

679
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,000
Sarah, I can't leave these guys right now.

680
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,330
I'm fine. Just do your job.

681
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,230
Find Stevens and stop him.

682
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,230
Dad!

683
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,030
I love you.

684
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,630
Are you sure about this, Doc?

685
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,100
If I can help, I'm staying.

686
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,230
Drop 'em.

687
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,630
I must commence the drop or we will miss our window.

688
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,160
Kitt, commence the drop.

689
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,430
Sarah, strap in now.

690
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,360
Ooh!

691
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,130
Kitt is away.

692
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,460
You're quite a ride, kitt.

693
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,430
Glad you're enjoying it.

694
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,930
We will have ground impact in 38 seconds.

695
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,200
Gus, you won't be held responsible

696
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,200
If we've got to scuttle.

697
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,730
Sir, I'm not gonna put her on a possible collision course

698
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,330
with a hawaiian island peak.

699
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,860
I never jumped ship before, don't intend to start now.

700
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,100
Come on, Gus cut the cowboy crap

701
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,260
and let's ditch this bird. Tell you what.

702
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,430
You run the calculations, get me that landing zone, 

703
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,460
I can set her down.

704
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,200
You got it. Let's do it.

705
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,760
You guys are crazy.

706
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm jumping, no doubt about it.

707
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,160
I understand, son.

708
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,800
Permission granted.

709
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,600
Sorry, Gus, Dr. Graiman.

710
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,300
How long?

711
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,700
Six minutes, 12 seconds.

712
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,700
Stevens appears to be arming the bomb.

713
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,200
I hope six minutes is enough time.

714
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,400
I've been running the numbers.

715
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,160
If the bomb explodes in that plant, 

716
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,860
The chemical reaction alone...

717
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,160
I know, billy.

718
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,400
We're talking an immediate death toll of six figures.

719
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,660
The worst disaster ever on American soil.

720
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,960
Get respiratory in here stat!

721
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,930
She's not breathing.

722
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,030
What happened?

723
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,230
I got no pulse!

724
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,760
Get me a crash cart now!

725
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,100
Can somebody turn off that alarm?

726
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,030
And get them out of here!

727
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,600
Charge 200.

728
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,560
Clear!

729
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,700
Charge 300.

730
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,960
Clear!

731
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,530
Clear!

732
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,430
Okay, I've got a pulse.

733
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,830
Let's get an update and some vitals.

734
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,160
Tell radiology we need a stat ct chest.

735
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,560
Make sure those stitches are holding.

736
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,660
Landing zone is confirmed.

737
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,800
Dropping down to 7, 000 feet.

738
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,560
We're 81.3 miles from the landing zone.

739
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,130
Currently traveling at 178 miles per hour.

740
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,530
Head winds at 53 miles per hour.

741
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,500
The C-130 is attempting to land.

742
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Shall I patch the audio through?

743
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,900
I thought they were bailing out?

744
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,360
Kitt, get dad on chat line.

745
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,800
Dad, I thought you jumped?

746
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,400
Gus needed my help.

747
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,560
We're gonna land this. Don't worry, I've done the math.

748
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,930
We're in good shape.

749
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,230
You just concentrate on what you're doing, 

750
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,630
And we'll see you shortly.

751
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,200
Okay. Be careful.

752
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,030
You, too.

753
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,030
There's no one better than Gus.

754
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,560
He'll be fine.

755
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,800
Stevens is streaming

756
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,630
A live video message from the plant.

757
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,660
I will put it on-screen.

758
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,930
Video message? To who?

759
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,830
Everyone.

760
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,960
The pentagon refused to build my design, 

761
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,300
They called it excessive and unnecessary.

762
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,600
This is a weapon that would eliminate war.

763
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,560
If you wanted Bin Laden dead, 

764
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,130
Just push in the coordinates and it was done.

765
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,930
But you see nobody listens

766
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,230
Unless something horrible happens.

767
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,330
And now, once again, 

768
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,700
It will.

769
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,040
In exactly five minutes, 

770
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,770
I will detonate a hafnium bomb

771
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,470
In the valdor chemical plant.

772
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,970
Now, if you had my weapon, 

773
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,340
You could position it in time to stop me, 

774
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,770
But you don't.

775
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Good luck.

776
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,100
It's disrbing that Stevens truly believes

777
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,200
he's acting in the best interest of mankind.

778
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,500
I know, Kitt. That's why he's a crazy person.

779
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,770
Mike, did you see that?

780
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,440
Yup, that's guy's really lost it.

781
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,800
Don't worry. We're almost there.

782
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,340
We are approaching the barricade.

785
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,270
Put all available camera angles on the screen and enhance.

787
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,540
Kitt, go stealth attack mode.

788
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,840
Initiating transformation.

789
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,070
Stealth attack mode achieved.

790
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,740
Kitt, I need you to disable their radio frequencies.

791
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,870
Accessing and corrupting now.

792
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,340
We will encounter resistance in 14 seconds.

794
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,440
Kitt, what kind of weapon does he have?

795
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,900
Glock nine millimeter, extended clip.

796
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,170
How many rounds?

797
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,300
Twenty rounds.

798
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,770
That means you should be done right about... now.

799
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,740
Ooh, that's such a turn-on.

800
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,070
I'll go in alone.

801
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,640
You tell me where they are, I'll take them out.

802
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,940
I need you to back me up, can you handle it?

803
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,940
Yeah.

804
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,440
Michael, these men are armed and very dangerous.

805
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,140
Are you still having fun?

806
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,770
This part I don't like so much.

807
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,570
Enemy at your one o'clock high.

808
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,400
Another approaching three o'clock low.

809
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,700
10 yards down the right corridor

810
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,940
There is another target.

811
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,100
Stevens is in the second room on your left.

812
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,540
Olara and another employee are with him.

813
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
Perfect.

814
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,200
Do you have a plan?

815
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,570
I'm gonna walk in and shoot them.

816
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,570
Subtle.

817
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
I thought so.

818
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,640
Mike, he is holding the trigger!

819
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,340
Mike.

820
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,140
How are you? I am...

821
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,470
I am so impressed, man. Really, I...

822
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,970
How did you find us?

823
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Let her walk and I'll tell you.

824
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,370
Oh, no, no, no. Mike, I'm sorry.

825
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,240
Sincerely I'm sorry.

826
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,570
Nobody's walking out of here, 

827
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,240
Including me.

828
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,470
Stevens, disarm the bomb.

829
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,870
Mike, why do you do this job?

830
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,870
Because they let me shoot bad guys.

831
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,240
Mike, you are fighting for people

832
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,570
Who do not have the mettle to do what's necessary.

833
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,970
See, I disagree with you there, Stevens.

834
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,570
How's that? Well, I'm here, aren't I?

835
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,600
Yes, you are.

836
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,370
And that's exactly my point.

837
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
One man.

838
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,370
They send one man

839
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,040
to stop this.

840
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,840
And you can't.

841
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,570
You know what, stevens?

842
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,100
For the first time all day, you're probably right.

843
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,140
Sarah, trigger!

844
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,500
Nice grab.

845
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,500
Oh, my god.

846
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,040
Thanks.

847
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,270
It's all right. It's all right.

848
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,900
You're safe. You're okay.

849
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,140
Oh.

850
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,800
Come on, ambassador. We got a chopper inbound.

851
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,040
If you leave now, 

852
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,570
You can make it to the negotiations.

853
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,900
But I've already missed the negotiations.

854
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,940
We made a few calls. You can still make it.

855
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,970
You good?

856
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,340
Oh, yes, mike. I'm good.

857
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,870
Good.

858
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,870
Hey.

859
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,270
Still holding a trigger.

860
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,100
Just hold on, bomb squad will be here any second.

861
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,270
You can't leave me here.

862
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,870
You'll be fine. Just...

863
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,100
Don't let go.

864
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,670
Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.

865
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,600
Mike.

866
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,700
Mike!

867
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,470
Mike!

868
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,640
Fuel is dumped. Approach looks good.

869
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,240
Thanks for the help, Doc.

870
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,800
Any time, gus. Let's get this sucker

871
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,000
On the ground.

872
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,140
Sounds good to me.

874
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,470
Sorry, doc.

875
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,500
Remember, boys, 

876
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,270
Don't shoot the girl holding the trigger.

877
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
This is your ride.

878
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,370
Mike, I owe you everything, 

879
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,640
And my country owes you as well.

880
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,800
It is so good to know there are people

881
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,170
Who understand what is right

882
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,670
And are willing to fight for it.

883
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Thank you, Mike

884
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,140
Good luck, olara. We'll be watching.

885
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,140
Okay.

886
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,770
Michael, may I speak with you please?

887
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,140
You are speaking with me, kitt.

888
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,470
I have something we need to discuss.

889
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,640
It's important.

890
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,570
Dude, it's been a really long day.

891
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,270
And if you're secretly falling in love with me, 

892
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm gonna be awfully upset.

895
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,640
So, how do you feel?

896
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,540
Not great.

897
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,300
Zoe told me to tell you that they caught stevens

898
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,300
And stopped the bomb.

899
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,100
Did the doctor...

900
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,040
Do you have any idea when I'm gonna get out of here?

901
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,440
Carrie, Carrie, 

902
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,570
Your rib pierced what may be

903
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,000
The most important artery in your body.

904
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,600
It's a miracle that you're alive.

905
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,670
Just say it.

906
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,440
It's gonna be months and months before you're fully recovered.

907
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,500
You're never gonna work in the field again.

908
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,770
You don't know that.

909
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,440
I'm sorry. It's over.

910
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,200
This... this life is over.

913
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,970
Thanks a lot, douche-nozzle.

914
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,470
Next time you leave me holding the trigger

915
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,840
to a live bomb, 

916
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,340
We're gonna have a problem.

917
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,740
Sarah, we got word from the ssc

918
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,970
About the plane.

919
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,000
Did it make it back okay?

920
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,400
No, it didn't.

921
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,870
When they were coming in for a landing, 

922
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,640
There was an explosion.

923
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,600
I don't know, 

924
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,040
The fuel line maybe.

925
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,970
Sarah, no one survived.

926
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,940
I'm so sorry.

927
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,870
Mike...

928
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,370
Sarah, 

929
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,300
Our father is dead.
