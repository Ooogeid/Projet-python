1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,160
How long has he been asleep?

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,000
Four hours, 37 minutes

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,360
16 seconds

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,030
Shall I wake him for you?

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
No, no

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,130
Let him sleep

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,160
He's earned it after this last one

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,230
We all did

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,030
I just wanted to let Mike know

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,260
That the F.B.I. And D.E.A.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,460
Took down the entire cartel thanks to him

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,360
And you

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,430
Thank you, Sarah. It was a team effort

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,730
Michael and I

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,060
Could not have succeeded without you

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,830
Billy and Zoe

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,260
And I mean no offense

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,100
By what I'm about to say

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
But you look very tired

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,730
Maybe you should get some sleep, too

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,630
It's okay, Kitt

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm fine. Thanks for your concern

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,700
Did you just drool on me?

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,000
Maybe a little

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,460
Eww!

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,130
Man, I was out cold

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Actually, Michael, you were not out cold

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,860
You were in a very heavy R.E.M. State

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
You know you sometimes sound like hal from 2001

30
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,060
I find that movie extremely confusing

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,830
You know what confuses me?

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,260
There are not enough hours in the day

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,300
For me to list everything that confuses you

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Oh, snap!

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,300
Yes, Michael. Snap

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,730
I'm gonna need some coffee

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
If we're gonna continue this conversation

38
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,530
There are a number of facilities that serve coffee

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,230
In the retail establishments nearby

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,930
Large coffee, please

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,260
Black

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,830
Get down now

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,860
Everybody get down

44
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,200
Get down now! Take cover!

45
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,530
Maddie!

46
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,900
Maddie!

47
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,060
Kitt, call 911

48
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,700
Get down!

49
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,260
911, what is your emergency?

50
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,200
There are five heavily-armed suspects

51
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,460
Assaulting a bank

52
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,860
I have sent their location

53
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,260
Directly to your computer system

54
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,300
Please respond with your swat team immediately

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,660
We have a problem

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,930
Kitt, what's happening?

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,460
Michael is attempting to rescue a child

58
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,600
In the middle of what appears to be a bank robbery

59
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,430
The suspects are firing automatic weapons

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,830
Indiscriminately

61
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,760
Michael is seriously overmatched and outnumbered

62
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,030
Mike, do not engage

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,500
I repeat, do not engage

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,460
Sarah, Michael is not wearing his earwig

65
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,500
- He can't hear you.  - Then get him out of there

66
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,160
Give me satellite surveillance

67
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,830
We haven't had a bird in the sky

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,200
Since the government shut us down

69
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,460
Then co-op one from the N.S.A. Or C.I.A.

70
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,600
That'll leave us completely exposed

71
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,200
Zoe's right. It's too risky

72
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,600
We'll limit it to Kitt's cameras

73
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,360
Bringing them online now

74
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,430
- What's your name?  - Maddie

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,830
Hi, Maddie. I'm Mike.

76
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

77
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,460
- Okay.  - All right. Come on, then

78
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,860
My name's Kitt. What's yours?

79
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,130
Maddie

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,560
Please don't worry, Maddie.

81
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,700
You are perfectly safe inside my interior

82
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,030
But my mom is out there!

83
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,960
Maddie!

84
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,930
Move!Go!Go!

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,700
I'm an undercover D.E.A. Agent

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,230
M-16 in the trunk

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,360
Cover me

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Damn!Where is he?

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,530
Sarah, the gunmen's body armor is impenetrable

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Without armor piercing ammunition

91
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,700
Then get Mike out of there

92
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,830
He's not gonna make it unless we get him to the hospital

93
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,430
Kitt!

94
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,660
Kitt, we gotta get this officer to a hospital,

95
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,860
and Maddie to safety.

96
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,860
Michael, this situation

97
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,260
is beyond your control.

98
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,760
Kitt, do not leave Mike.

99
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,030
We have to get this man to a hospital or he'll die.

100
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,800
But what about my mom?

101
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,530
- I'll take care of your mommy.  - Promise?

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,900
I promise. Kitt, go.

103
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,860
Maddie!

104
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,500
Cover me.

105
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
Get up!

106
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,700
Get up!

107
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
Get up, move! Get in the bank!

108
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,460
Move!

109
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,230
Everybody on the ground!

110
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,230
Move another inch and I'll blow your head off.

111
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,230
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll kill you.

112
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,230
Shut up!

113
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,860
Get down!

114
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,000
Get down! Put your face on the ground down!

115
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,530
Anyone moves, I will kill the person

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,960
on either side of you.

117
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,300
Please don't hurt us! Please!

118
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,160
Then do not give me a reason to.

119
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,600
Hey.

120
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,860
Maddie's safe.

121
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,000
How do you know?

122
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,260
That is your final warning!

123
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,960
All of you!

124
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,830
Let's go!

125
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,630
Down on the ground! Move!

126
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,060
Everybody on the ground!

127
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,630
Billy, we need to see what's happening in there.

128
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,160
There's no way to see inside.

129
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,730
They've closed the drapes and disabled the security cameras.

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
If Kitt was close,

131
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,130
we might be able to use his infrared.

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,060
Until Kitt gets back, our best bet is news coverage.

133
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,330
I was able to pull the plates

134
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
from the two cars and the van.

135
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,500
Both were reported stolen this morning.

136
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,830
What's Kitt's E.T.A. to the hospital,

137
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,260
and how long till we can get him back to Mike?

138
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,960
Kitt, E.T.A.?

139
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,330
I am less than 90 seconds away

140
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,930
from the nearest hospital.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I called ahead and explained the seriousness

142
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,030
of the situation.

143
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,700
Medical staff are standing by.

144
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,330
Hello.

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,700
Hi.

146
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,230
Billy, this is Maddie.

147
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Maddie, this is Billy.

148
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,030
How are you doing, Maddie?

149
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,800
Well, I'm sitting inside a talking car

150
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,060
that's driving itself to the hospital

151
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,730
with a wounded police officer,

152
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,430
and my mother's been kidnapped.

153
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,100
How do you think I'm doing?

154
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,060
Okay, too precocious for me.

155
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,930
You have a problem dealing with any member

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
of the opposite sex, don't you?

157
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,460
Pretty much, yeah.

158
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,100
Hi, Maddie. I'm Sarah.

159
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,500
Hi, Sarah.

160
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,500
I see you've already met Kitt.

161
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,130
Yeah, he's pretty cool.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,730
And he's also a secret.

163
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,100
Can you keep a secret?

164
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
Of course she can keep a secret.

165
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,660
She's a girl.

166
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,030
Please.

167
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,660
Hey.

168
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,530
You okay?

169
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,760
I've had worse.

170
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,730
Are you a cop?

171
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,830
No.

172
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,600
You act like one.

173
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,360
Be quiet. You're gonna get us killed!

174
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,100
Sarah, I've dropped Maddie and the wounded officer

175
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,560
at the hospital.

176
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,960
I will be back at the bank in less than two minutes.

177
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,430
I counted five of them outside.

178
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,330
But there's only four in here.

179
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,300
One of them went into a back room.

180
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,360
What's your name?

181
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,660
Lynn.

182
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,030
Lynn, I'm Mike.

183
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,430
Will you two please shut up!

184
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,700
Kitt, we need to let the police know

185
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
that Mike is inside the bank.

186
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,930
I don't think we should tell them anything.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,060
They're cops. They can help.

188
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,560
Or they could get him killed.

189
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,200
Or they could save his life.

190
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,530
I agree with Zoe in this situation, Sarah.

191
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,360
In case you haven't noticed it,

192
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,730
Zoe has trouble trusting authority figures lately.

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
I noticed.

194
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,900
Zoe, you need to see a professional

195
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,730
About your trust issues.

196
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,500
- Yeah, like that's gonna happen.  - Like that's gonna happen.

197
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,260
Sarah, my concern is that the suspects

198
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,660
May be monitoring police frequencies.

199
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,400
They are well-armed and very well-prepared,

200
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,930
Evident by their use of body armor

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
And the military-style execution of their plan.

202
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm with Kitt.

203
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,230
We could put Mike in more danger.

204
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,760
Kitt, as soon as you're within range,

205
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430
I want infrared up.

206
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,030
What are you doing?

207
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,630
I'm calling 911.

208
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,130
I already called them.

209
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,300
Well then, where are they?

210
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,930
Give me the phone.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,100
No.

212
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,930
Give me the phone.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
What are you doing?

214
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,200
Accessing infrared

215
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,130
And tapping into police communications.

216
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,500
I have identified Michael's position.

217
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,660
His vital signs show he is alive and unharmed.

218
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,430
They're all face down on the floor.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,730
I count four gunmen.

220
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,500
What are they doing?

221
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,330
Call your husband.

222
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,260
Tell him where you are.

223
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,430
- Hi, Frank. It... it's me.  - Hi, babe.

224
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm at the bank and...

225
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,260
I know, you go every wednesday.

226
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,600
- What's the matter  - I can't...

227
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,860
Tina, what's wrong?

228
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,560
- Turn on your TV.  - Who is this?

229
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,830
Where's my wife?

230
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,200
Turn on your TV now,

231
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,660
Or your wife is dead.

232
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,930
What channel?

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Any channel.

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
You, get up. Get up. Move.

235
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,760
What are you gonna do?

236
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,130
Come on now. Move.

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,330
Oh, what are you gonna do?

238
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,560
Run.

239
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,200
Oh, my god! This is not happening.

240
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,700
This is not happening.

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,730
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

242
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,730
That's ok.

243
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,730
He shot him in the back.

244
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,830
Oh, my god.

245
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,130
They shot him in cold blood.

246
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,460
If you do not do exactly as I say,

247
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,430
The same thing will happen to your wife.

248
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,900
If you call the police,

249
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,430
I'll kill her.

250
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,030
If you talk to anyone, I'll kill her.

251
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,830
If you do anything

252
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,660
You are not told to do by me,

253
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,930
I will kill her.

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,900
Do you understand?

255
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,300
Yes.

256
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,260
Now sit at your desk and do not move

257
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,600
Until I call you back.

258
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,460
What's the situation?

259
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,460
They shoot a hostage by far.

260
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:50,260
Get him on the phone.

261
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,700
Right on time.

262
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,230
Cut the phone lines, all except one.

263
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,460
Take that one off the hook.

264
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,900
Sarah, my scanners indicate

265
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,600
Someone made a call from inside the bank

266
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,860
Using a satellite phone.

267
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,130
Who did they call?

268
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,300
They used a scrambler,

269
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,400
So I was unable to trace the call.

270
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,900
Pretty sophisticated for bank robbers.

271
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,830
Very sophisticated for bank robbers.

272
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,660
They may be much more than bank robbers, Zoe.

273
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,800
The hostage was shot with a handgun.

274
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,060
It takes exceptional skill

275
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,000
To shoot a moving target with a handgun

276
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,260
from that distance.

277
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,530
All phone lines in the bank except one

278
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,930
have been disabled,

279
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,900
And that one has been temporarily disconnected.

280
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,260
Sarah,

281
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,560
The hostage they shot is still alive.

282
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,460
He's in the open.

283
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,700
Swat is reluctant to move him

284
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,000
For fear they will be shot.

285
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,360
Kitt, block for the police

286
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,700
So they can get to the wounded man.

287
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,460
I want it out of commission now!

288
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,230
Who are you?

289
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,830
My name's Tina.

290
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,360
Why did he have you call your husband?

291
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,630
I don't know.

292
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,630
- Who's your husband?  - Nobody.

293
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,930
What does he do? Who does he work for?

294
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,430
Who are you?

295
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,500
Michael Knight.

296
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,600
- You a cop?  - No.

297
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,000
I was just passing by.

298
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,460
Well.

299
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,900
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time,

300
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,160
Michael Knight.

301
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,100
Some people would say

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,930
I'm at the right place at the right time.

303
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,360
Who'd you text?

304
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,500
Nobody.

305
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,330
Who'd you text?

306
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,360
My girlfriend.

307
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,430
Sarah.

308
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Who's Kitt?

309
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,360
You're gonna hit me again

310
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,630
When I tell you.

311
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,330
Who's Kitt?

312
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,200
My car.

313
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,230
I saw that one coming.

314
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,500
Attention.

315
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,000
Inside the bank.

316
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,500
This is the police.

317
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,100
We know that you've disabled

318
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
All but one phone line.

319
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,530
Please answer that line.

320
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,960
We don't want to see anyone else hurt.

321
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,660
We just want to talk.

322
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,500
Sarah, I lost contact with Michael.

323
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,830
How?

324
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,460
My infrared cannot penetrate the vault area.

325
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,000
Why would they take him to the vault?

326
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,560
It may be in anticipation of a swat assault,

327
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,900
Since the suspects

328
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,200
are refusing to speak to the police...

329
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,330
Which coupled with

330
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,500
The shooting of the hostage,

331
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,400
has caused the incident commander

332
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,800
to accelerate swat's plans.

333
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
The swat team is moving into place

334
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,130
as we speak.

335
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,460
Kitt, what are the chances

336
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,000
they'll be able to take out all five gunmen

337
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,500
before any of the hostages are hurt?

338
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,830
Not good, as I can only locate

339
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,460
four of the five gunmen.

340
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,300
There is still one somewhere inside the bank

341
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
that is unaccounted for.

342
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,300
See, I know what you're thinking.

343
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,230
Why haven't I killed you yet?

344
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,300
Well, I got plans for you,

345
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
Michael Knight.

346
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,800
Please stop!

347
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,100
Hey, leave her alone.

348
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,430
She has nothing to do with me.

349
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,760
Then why were you holding her hand

350
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,160
when you were on the floor?

351
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,800
She was scared.

352
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,100
I was telling her everything was gonna be okay.

353
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,300
Heroes get people killed.

354
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't try and be one.

355
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,530
I don't know either one of 'em, I swear.

356
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,860
I swear!

357
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,560
The only thing I hate more than heroes is cowards.

358
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,300
Aah!

359
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm not gonna hit you.

360
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,630
The hell I'm not.

361
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,130
Let's go.

362
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,900
Move the cart to the center of the room.

363
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,200
Stop.

364
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,800
The directions are simple.

365
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,030
Put the money in the bag.

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,430
Get up. Let's go. You.

367
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,500
Fill up a bag.

368
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,860
Get up! You, help him.

369
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,200
Move!

370
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,660
Get up. You can handle it.

371
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,430
Go, let's go! Move!

372
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,930
Let's fill up the bag! It's not hard!

373
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,600
Move!

374
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,060
The swat team is in position.

375
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,300
Have you located the fifth gunman?

376
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,460
I have not.

377
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,100
That's the master key

378
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,860
for the safe deposit boxes.

379
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,130
Open every box.

380
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,300
Pile the contents on this table.

381
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
That could take hours.

382
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,730
That's not your concern.

383
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,960
Why not just stick with the money in the vault?

384
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,130
You're completely surrounded. There's no way out.

385
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,260
Team one in position.

386
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,230
Team two in position.

387
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,930
Get those safe deposit boxes open.

388
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,130
Team three in position.

389
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
Kitt,

390
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,430
The bank is wired with explosives.

391
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,960
Sarah, the swat team

392
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,930
is in position and ready to fire.

393
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,900
Kitt, you have to get word to the swat team.

394
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,260
They have to abort.

395
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,860
It may be too late, Sarah.

396
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,430
My mark in five

397
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,430
Four

398
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,000
Three

399
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,500
Two

400
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,030
Stand down, stand down.

401
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,360
This is swat leader, abort.

402
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,960
Voice duplication active.

403
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,530
The bank is wired with explosives.

404
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,830
The bank is wired with explosives.

405
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,200
Team one standing down.

406
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,730
Team two standing down.

407
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,900
This is swat leader. I did not issue that order.

408
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,130
Repeat.

409
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,160
Swat leader did not issue that order.

410
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,600
What the hell's going on?

411
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,760
Is the bank wired or not?

412
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,160
Stand down, stand down.

413
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,300
Kitt, I'm sending you the text number

414
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,430
to contact Mike directly.

415
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,300
Texting him now.

416
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
Kitt, upload your replay files

417
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,860
of the initial incidents.

418
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,060
Uploading files.

419
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,400
What are you looking for?

420
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,860
Something's not right here.

421
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,960
Let's go!

422
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,030
Move it! Open the boxes now!

423
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,430
Whoever heard of fighting your way

424
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,700
into a bank?

425
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,330
You're supposed to fight your way out.

426
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Statistically, successful bank robberies

427
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,930
get in and out as fast as they can.

428
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Their actions were deliberate.

429
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,930
They got out of their vehicles and opened fire

430
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,830
before they were even close to the bank.

431
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,830
They were clearly trying to draw attention to themselves.

432
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,000
There was no reason for them to open fire.

433
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,660
Wiring the bank suggests

434
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,900
they knew the swat team would have handled this all.

435
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,660
So they're barricading themselves

436
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,200
inside the bank?

437
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,800
Why?

438
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,460
One of these gunmen never fired a shot.

439
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,700
- Are you sure?  - Kitt, confirm this.

440
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
Billy, you are correct.

441
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,830
One of the gunmen did not fire a single shot,

442
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,130
although he was armed.

443
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,630
His weapon appears to be taped to his hand.

444
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,800
Sarah, the person I am texting with

445
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,060
is not Michael.

446
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,130
Are you sure?

447
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,860
Yes, but I can't be sure

448
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,630
the original message was not from him.

449
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,400
Should I continue communicating?

450
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,360
You could feed him false information.

451
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,630
It might make matters worse.

452
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,960
You can't just stop communicating.

453
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,230
Kitt, what do you think?

454
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,230
I think you are all correct.

455
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,060
There are an infinite number of possibilities

456
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,760
since we have no idea what is happening

457
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,100
inside the bank.

458
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,000
But I believe Michael may have proven himself

459
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,260
to be an equal adversary

460
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,760
in some way.

461
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,100
Otherwise, the person I am texting with

462
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,900
would not be concerned about my location.

463
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
These guys clearly have a bigger plan.

464
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,300
Kitt, is there any way into or out of the bank?

465
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,960
The police have the entire area

466
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,000
Surrounded with swat and snipers.

467
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,560
Well, check the surrounding buildings.

468
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,930
There are no means of escape

469
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,130
In the surrounding buildings.

470
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,460
What about under the bank?

471
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,730
There are thousands of miles of tunnels

472
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,930
Under the city.

473
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,360
Sewer, flood control,

474
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,930
Subway, water, electric.

475
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,330
But there is nothing directly under the bank.

476
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,130
What about up into the building?

477
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,530
They could hide in the building,

478
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,760
But they could not escape.

479
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,600
Kitt, bounce the text message back

480
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,860
Like you didn't receive it.

481
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,730
The police have made contact

482
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,060
With the suspects in the bank.

483
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,960
They are making their list of demands.

484
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,300
Get us audio.

485
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,230
Listen closely.

486
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,430
I want five identical vans.

487
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,830
No windows.

488
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,660
Clear passage to the nearest private runway

489
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,030
And a private jet waiting on the tarmac.

490
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,900
The jet will be running and cleared for take off.

491
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,360
What?

492
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,360
They'll never give them a jet.

493
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,560
Kitt, what's swat protocol for situations like this?

494
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,830
They will not allow the gunmen

495
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,060
To take the hostages on a plane.

496
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,000
Unless they start killing the hostages.

497
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,600
That would definitely

498
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,000
Factor into swat's decision-making.

499
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
So it's possible they'd let them board the plane.

500
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,500
Unlikely, but possible.

501
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,730
The plane will be completely empty.

502
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,030
Void of all people.

503
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,600
No flight crew.

504
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,900
If I see one person near that plane,

505
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,800
We start killing hostages.

506
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,930
No flight crew?

507
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,430
That means they have a pilot with them.

508
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,800
Or one of the hostages is.

509
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,730
He couldn't know who the hostages would be.

510
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,230
Unless they followed a pilot into the bank.

511
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,630
The woman at the A.T.M. was clearly targeted.

512
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,030
You think she's a pilot? Can you identify her?

513
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,230
No.

514
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,200
Hang on.

515
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,800
Blow that up and enhance it.

516
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,860
That's Maddie's mom.

517
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,000
Kitt, track down Maddie.

518
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,660
You have one hour.

519
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,700
If I do not see five vans in front of this bank

520
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,060
In one hour,

521
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,200
I will shoot another hostage in the back.

522
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,930
Mrs. Martinez.

523
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,300
May I speak with Maddie Johnson, please?

524
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,700
Yeah, just one second. She's right here.

525
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,000
It's for you.

526
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,200
- Hello?  - Hello, Maddie.

527
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,200
It's Kitt.

528
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,360
Hi, Kitt.

529
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,660
I hope I haven't called at a bad time.

530
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,860
Just waiting for dad to pick me up.

531
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,360
He said he's gonna be a little while.

532
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,030
Maddie, your mother wouldn't happen to be

533
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,400
A pilot, would she?

534
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,560
My mom? No, she's afraid of flying.

535
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,030
Is she okay?

536
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,430
She will be fine.

537
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,330
I'm sorry to have bothered you, Maddie.

538
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,430
That's okay, Kitt. Bye.

539
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,760
Bye.

540
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Someone in there is obviously a pilot.

541
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,130
The fifth gunman?

542
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,430
Maybe he's not a gunman, but a hostage.

543
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,060
They brought him in with them to fly them out.

544
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,800
The bank's a sub-branch.

545
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,260
There can't be that much money in it.

546
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,400
Not enough to warrant this extreme of an undertaking.

547
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,700
What if they're buying themselves time?

548
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,100
- For what?  - To open the safe deposit boxes.

549
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,460
Any way we can find out

550
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,930
Who has a safe deposit box in the bank?

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,700
I'd need a branch code.

552
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
Move another inch,

553
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,230
And I'll blow your head off.

554
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,800
Drop it!

555
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,460
Now.

556
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,860
It take you found what we were looking for.

557
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,200
Yeah.

558
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,760
Found it, baby.

559
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,460
Good.

560
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,230
Kitt, pull up all account numbers with a dash.

561
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,560
Those are the safe deposit boxes.

562
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,060
I have generated a list

563
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,900
of all safe deposit box numbers

564
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,160
and the account bearer.

565
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,660
Any names of significance?

566
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,960
Searching databases and cross-referencing.

567
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,230
There is one.

568
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,260
Joe Carter?

569
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,530
Kitt, who is he?

570
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
A reputed mob lawyer

571
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,800
Who also represents and counsels many drug kingpins.

572
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,600
He's well-trusted by them and has kept most out of jail.

573
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,400
There were more accounts than we knew about.

574
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Let me guess...

575
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,760
Numbered offshore bank accounts?

576
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,330
Now, the account numbers

577
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,660
are no good without their code names.

578
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,030
A good attorney has the code names

579
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,160
for every client's account, don't you?

580
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,500
Right on time.

581
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,400
Your private jet is waiting at the airport.

582
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,660
I know I don't have to remind you,

583
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,930
but I will anyway.

584
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,430
If I see one person near that plane,

585
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,660
we start killing hostages.

586
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,730
Let's get 'em ready to move.

587
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,730
The vans are outside the bank.

588
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,000
There's no way the police

589
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,530
are gonna let them walk out of that bank.

590
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah, I have to know... what are they thinking?

591
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,430
They're thinking they have another plan.

592
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,830
Like what?

593
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,460
They have no intention of walking out to those vans.

594
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,600
There's no other way.

595
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,200
Write down the code names.

596
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,930
You need to worry less

597
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,460
About your drug and mob friends

598
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,060
And more about your own life.

599
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,160
Code names. Now.

600
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,500
The code names.

601
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,930
Or good-bye family jewels.

602
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,260
You planning on just walking out of here?

603
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,330
Something like that.

604
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,500
You know they'll never

605
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,730
let you get close to that jet...

606
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,960
If there even is one.

607
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,300
I know.

608
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,060
That's why you're going out the front door.

609
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,330
Tape him up and suit him up.

610
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,630
Let's move.

611
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,600
I told you I had plans for you, michael knight.

612
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,830
Get that armor on.

613
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,460
It's all a scam.

614
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,460
- The bank robbery?  - No, the escape.

615
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,800
- What are you talking about?  - These guys are smart.

616
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,960
Why would they suddenly turn stupid at the end?

617
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,030
They have to have another way out.

618
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,300
Tape their weapons to their hands.

619
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,460
What are you looking for?

620
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,960
Maybe another way out of the tunnel.

621
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,160
But Kitt said that there are no tunnels

622
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,360
Directly underneath the bank.

623
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,730
That we know of.

624
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,230
Tell your husband you're okay.

625
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,260
Frank, it... it's me.

626
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,700
Tina, are you okay?

627
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
- I'm okay.  - But you won't be.

628
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,760
- Unless you do exactly as I say.  - Yes, I will do whatever you need.

629
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,330
Please don't hurt her.

630
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,360
In exactly 90 seconds,

631
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,460
You will turn the power grid off for the entire city

632
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,430
or your wife is dead, do you understand?

633
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,200
I can't shut down the power grid.

634
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,360
Then say good-bye to your wife.

635
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,360
Ooh!

636
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,830
Wait. I'll do it.

637
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,560
The power's not off in 90 seconds,

638
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,000
She's the first to die.

639
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,030
Followed by every hostage we have.

640
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,160
Sarah, another satellite call was just made.

641
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,630
Who were they calling?

642
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,960
Whoever it is, they have to have something

643
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,700
to do with how they plan on getting out of that bank.

644
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,700
Maddie's mom was clearly targeted.

645
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,560
Why?

646
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,000
Should we call Maddie again?

647
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,360
She's waiting for her father.

648
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,030
I can check to see if he's there yet.

649
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,330
Why would he not be there yet,

650
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,800
Considering the situation?

651
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,100
Maybe Maddie's mom was targeted

652
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,630
Because of her father.

653
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,900
Who is he?

654
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,160
Kitt.

655
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,430
Accessing information now.

656
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,860
All right, who is he?

657
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,700
- Nobody.  - What does he do?

658
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,300
He works for the Department Of Water And Power.

659
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,800
He's gonna shut down the power grid.

660
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,900
This is swat leader.

661
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,730
Load armor-piercing rounds.

662
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,260
Snipers, you have the green light.

663
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,600
Repeat, snipers, you have the green light.

664
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,500
Sarah, we have a problem.

665
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,580
Sarah, Michael has been dressed

666
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,880
As one of the gunmen.

667
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,150
Snipers have been given the order to kill him.

668
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,320
Kitt, stop them!

669
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,580
Do not fire.

670
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,150
Gunmen are hostages.

671
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,020
I repeat, the gunmen are hostages.

672
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,280
Stand down.

673
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,280
We have all clear. Here we go.

674
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
- Got it?  - Yeah.

675
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,680
Holy crap, they just took out the entire city.

676
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Michael, raise the weapon above your head.

677
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,850
Kitt, they have another way out.

678
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,050
There's a tunnel under the bank.

679
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,580
When you clear the first tunnel, blow the bank.

680
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,680
Everybody get down!

681
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,080
The bank's gonna blow!

682
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,020
Fire in the hole!

683
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,180
Mike!

684
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,350
Sarah, Michael has disappeared under the bank.

685
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,650
Ah, they're going out through the sewer system.

686
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,520
There are 6500 miles of sewers under the city.

687
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,580
And 1500 miles of flood control tunnels.

688
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,080
That's not even counting the subway tunnels.

689
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,550
Wouldn't take much tunneling

690
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,050
If you knew where to dig to get from the sewer system

691
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,850
To the flood control system to the subway system.

692
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,680
With any kind of transportation,

693
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,980
They could move quickly

694
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,280
Within a 1700-square-mile radius.

695
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,550
We'll never find them.

696
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,120
I have plotted an intersect.

697
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,080
How?

698
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,680
They still have the cell phone, and I am tracking the signal.

699
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,550
Shutting down the power shuts down the third rail.

700
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,820
They're probably in the subway system.

701
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,080
No, no. That's too obvious.

702
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,720
What else does it do?

703
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,420
Opens the gates to the flood control tunnels.

704
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,950
They'd have a straight shot to the ocean.

705
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,320
With a fast boat, they could be in international waters

706
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,580
Within 30 minutes.

707
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,120
Clear!

708
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,120
- The electric bikes are over there.  - Let's go.

709
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,950
Sarah, they are headed toward...

710
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,450
A sewer service opening

711
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,780
In an abandoned parking lot.

712
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,420
Pardon my intrusion.

713
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,780
I see you've met my car.

714
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,250
There's more than enough money

715
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,720
in these accounts for all of us.

716
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,120
I'm talking billions.

717
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,880
There's more to life than money.

718
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,750
Kitt!

719
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,220
No!

720
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,280
Thank you so much.

721
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,480
Yeah, I don't know what I would have done

722
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,750
Without you... all of you.

723
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,080
Thank you too, Kitt.

724
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,120
It was my pleasure as well, Maddie.

725
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,080
How'd he do that?

726
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,780
You should see what else he can...
