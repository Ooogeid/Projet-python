1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,759
Michael we will be arriving in the exchange point in 1 min

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,409
In one minute. Do we have anything?

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,709
No heat signatures,

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,829
Nothing on the infrared or penetrating radar either.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,999
You think they're blowing us off?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,410
Not if they want their money.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,649
I guess if you're smart enough to kidnap a u.N. Ambassador

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,959
From a heavily guarded compound,

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,629
You're smart enough to stick around for your ransom.

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,479
All that matters is we get her back in time

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,059
For the peace negotiations,

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,929
With a minimum of public exposure.

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,029
I don't know why anyone would want to grab her

14
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,029
In the first place.

15
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,679
Olara kumali is the first diplomat in five years

16
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,499
To get her government and the rebels to sit down and talk.

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,479
She's the best hope to end a civil war in central africa.

18
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,979
Not everyone wants peace.

19
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,179
Don't worry, guys.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,650
Any sign now?

21
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,230
Not according to my scanners, michael.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,730
I'm gonna check it out.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,679
Michael, what happens if the kidnappers

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,629
Show up without the ambassador?

25
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,149
Then we go to the backup plan.

26
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,369
The backup plan,

27
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,439
A plan created

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,409
"whatever can go wrong will go wrong."

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,989
But isn't it true that there are an infinite number

30
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,729
Of ways a plan can go wrong?

31
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,670
That's why backup plans suck.

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,989
Kitt, you hear that? Yes, michael.

33
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,789
The sound is coming from under the truck

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,269
Via a third-generation umts handheld device.

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,000
It's called a phone.

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,689
Michael, there is an incoming ufo.

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,090
Where? Your 11:00.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,240
Son of a...

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,719
What is the backup plan, michael?

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
Follow it.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,919
The object in question is an advanced type

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,489
Of unmanned aerial vehicle,

43
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,339
Otherwise known as a u.A.V. Or drone.

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,449
Well, that drone just took our ransom money.

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,699
Activate missiles.

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,589
Shooting the drone will incinerate the money

47
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,169
And will most likely destroy

48
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,379
Any evidence that would lead us to ambassador kumali.

49
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,469
Lasers, then.

50
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,649
At the drone's altitude,

51
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,129
The results will be the same.

52
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,469
At least get a satellite on it. I have tried,

53
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,129
But the craft seems to be equipped with a stealth coating

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,549
That prevents tracking.

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,899
We have to do something.

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,859
There is still the phone under the truck.

57
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,189
If you answer it, perhaps I can trace the call.

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,850
Nice backup plan.

59
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,870
Hello?

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,659
Man, I thought you were gonna chase that thing all day.

61
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,840
Who is this? Wrong question.

62
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,669
Where's ambassador kumali?

63
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,290
Ding--better.

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,029
And by ambassador, you must mean olara, right?

65
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,490
Take a peek.

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,429
Ambassador.

67
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,929
Who are you?

68
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,849
Ambassador, my name is mike, and I'm coming to get you out of--

69
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,599
Okay, that--that--that--please. Will you please stop that crap?

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,649
That's enough, mike, all right?

71
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,739
Now, here's the deal.

72
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,469
I'm going to give you an attractive,

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,300
Very influential ambassador,

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,209
But first, you got to, you know, do a little something for me.

75
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,519
The money wasn't enough? Hell, no.

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,299
No, the money was just part of the equation.

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,859
Now, because you made good on the delivery,

78
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,439
Olara is alive.

79
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,709
If you keep playing ball, she stays that way.

80
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,940
If you don't, then she's dead. Do we have a deal?

81
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,099
Deal. Great.

82
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,639
Now, hang on to that phone and get away from the truck,

83
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,339
Because I got to,

84
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,539
You know, do that little crazy,

85
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,580
Destroy-the-evidence kind of thing.

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,759
Excuse me?

87
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,220
Run.

88
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,069
Michael, are you all right?

89
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,779
Please tell me you traced that call.

90
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,149
I could not.

91
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,879
The caller rerouted his cell signal

92
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,889
Through more junctions and hubs than I could trace in time.

93
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,129
Accordingly, I must agree

94
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,000
With your earlier assessment-- backup plans suck.

95
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,259
His name is gunnar haas,

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,689
Inmate number 32587,

97
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,859
At madras medium-security prison.

98
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,489
And I need him released in an hour.

99
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,999
I don't think that's possible.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,949
Oh, mike, please, will you cut it out?

101
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,299
Now, uncle sam trusted you to make the swap today,

102
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,219
Which means that you have more than enough juice

103
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,839
To spring a short-timer like haas.

104
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,329
I'll see what I can do. Oh, good.

105
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,889
That's great, because I was gonna have to do

106
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,740
Some really bad things to olara.

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,559
Ambassador. You again.

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,899
Do you know where you are? No.

109
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,899
Do you know who kidnapped you?

110
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,240
No, I do not,

111
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,010
But he is watching me.

112
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,310
He is watching us.

113
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,269
Just know that I'm gonna do more than watch her

114
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,969
If you do not stick with the plan.

115
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,769
Now, I'm calling you in an hour,

116
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,619
And I need you

117
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,809
Outside madras prison with gunnar by your side.

118
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,420
And if not...

119
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,940
Bye-bye.

120
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,599
Billy, I want everything we can find on gunnar haas. On it.

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,789
Any luck with the trace?

122
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,019
The signal was triple-encrypted

123
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,349
And rerouted twice around the globe

124
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,459
Through phone companies, server farms, bowling alleys,

125
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,369
Strip clubs.

126
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,449
Whoever this guy is, he's a real joker.

127
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,629
What about the drone?

128
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,949
Satellites can't help.

129
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,249
I'm checking kitt's footage

130
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,319
To see if we can connect it to a manufacturer.

131
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,069
Where's sarah and charles?

132
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,700
Working on a sick robot.

133
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,560
Get them.

134
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,910
Increase pressure by ten barries.

135
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,000
Decrease by ten.

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,330
Release.

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,099
Well, I don't know what to say.

138
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,059
The, uh, actuators, and the gears,

139
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,659
And the air muscles are all working fine.

140
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,919
Hank, when you dropped the compressor,

141
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,410
Was it a drop or more of a slip?

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,020
Dad.

143
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,160
It was definitely intentional.

144
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,429
And when I asked him about it,

145
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,819
He wouldn't admit what he'd done.

146
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,029
He's a robot, sarah. He can't lie.

147
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,750
He's acting weird.

148
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,849
It's the ssc.

149
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,809
Yeah, well, uh, you go. I'll finish up.

150
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,500
All right. Keep an eye on him.

151
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,030
Okay, big guy, she's gone. You got something on your mind?

152
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,450
Just between us guys?

153
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,099
Okay. Well, I'll keep an eye on you for the next few days,

154
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,789
And we'll see if there's another incident.

155
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,360
You get back to work, now.

156
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,490
Gunnar haas will be at the madras gate in 15 minutes.

157
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,970
Carrie?

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,659
Sorry.

159
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,689
That was a message from my dad. It's nothing.

160
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,909
When mike gets gunnar,

161
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,619
He'll make the swap for the ambassador.

162
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,029
Now, if we're lucky, we can still get her

163
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,009
To the negotiations by 6:00.

164
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,169
Has billy found out anything more about haas?

165
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,079
Well, he's an arms dealer,

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,699
So he may have something to do with this war

167
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,289
The ambassador's dealing with.

168
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,439
Still no definite connection.

169
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,199
So we have a political kidnapping

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,150
That doesn't look political.

171
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,959
I got a bad feeling about this.

172
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,179
All missions have their complications.

173
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,749
Yeah, but if it's just a kidnapping, why this extra step?

174
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,209
Mike's arrived at madras prison.

175
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,339
What do you mean we can't get gunnar haas released?

176
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,029
I mean, we can't.

177
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,589
Billy, I got kitt jacked into the prison surveillance cameras.

178
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,389
I can see gunnar right there.

179
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,609
According to prison records,

180
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,619
Gunnar haas is serving a five-year sentence

181
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,519
For the sale of contraband weapons.

182
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,489
A charge such as this could easily be commuted, billy.

183
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,639
That's true, unless the cia says no.

184
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,019
Cia? I guess gunnar

185
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,939
Ticked off a bunch of people before he got busted.

186
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,839
Well, if we're gonna keep

187
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,299
The ambassador alive, we need him out

188
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,419
In less than 15 minutes.

189
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,889
Yeah, that's why torres said

190
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,879
You should get creative.

191
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,820
Does that mean what I think it means?

192
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,870
Just don't get caught.

193
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,160
You hear something?

194
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,440
What the hell is that?

195
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,309
Communication in the prison has been disabled,

196
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,989
Along with all associated response systems,

197
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,379
Leaving a population of 87 inmates

198
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,729
And ten guards.

199
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,390
Kitt, turbo boost.

200
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,209
Get in!

201
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,430
All right!

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,580
Come in! Come in! Radio to command is dead!

203
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,229
Holy--

204
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,340
Shut up and hold on! Kitt, do it!

205
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,179
Well, he didn't get caught.

206
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,139
Prison cameras,

207
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,829
Radio chatter, alarms, witnesses--

208
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,089
I want all of it contained.

209
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,249
Doing the sweep now.

210
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,729
Sarah, do we have anything more on that drone?

211
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,289
Based on what carrie showed me,

212
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,619
The craft looks like some kind of prototype.

213
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,210
No markings anywhere.

214
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,840
Carrie...

215
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,529
Get on the line with the department of justice.

216
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,859
And tell them what?

217
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,919
That we're in the middle of a cover operation,

218
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,750
And we're handling all this.

219
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,729
Transformation complete

220
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,389
Amazing. Yeah.

221
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,769
Spectacular.

222
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,520
Excuse me. No.

223
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,289
First, you tell me about this car.

224
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,700
Kitt, protocol nancy bravo charlie four.

225
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,939
Okay, I got him.

226
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,270
Prove it.

227
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,780
Happy?

228
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,009
Mike, that's a philosophical question

229
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,209
That would take hours to discuss,

230
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,030
But I'm glad you got the job done.

231
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,269
Oh, and so is olara.

232
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,969
Great. So when do we do the swap?

233
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,199
Sorry? What swap?

234
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,049
Gunnar haas for the ambassador.

235
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,209
Come on, mike.

236
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,059
What, did you really think that I was just using you

237
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,769
To get some second-rate arms dealer out of prison?

238
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,909
Actually, yeah.

239
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,550
Oh, I'm so sorry.

240
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,040
Um, but your day's just begun.

241
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,299
He wants you to get an x-ray machine?

242
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,799
A research-quality micro a.P.S. X-ray machine.

243
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,189
That's high-end.

244
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,429
And we've got, uh, 40 minutes.

245
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,849
Sarah's running a search for the machine with kitt now.

246
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,929
First, he kidnaps an african ambassador.

247
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,439
Then he wants to get a hold of some international convict

248
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,049
With ties to cia,

249
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,119
Then some weird piece of equipment.

250
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,089
Yeah. What's the connection?

251
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,740
I'm working on it.

252
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,749
According to the g.A.O.,

253
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,849
The nearest a.P.S. X-ray machine

254
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,439
Is at state university.

255
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,689
Think they'll let me borrow it?

256
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,470
No.

257
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,199
Micro a.P.S. X-ray machines are incredibly hard to come by.

258
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,069
They're only used for specialized research--

259
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,499
Studying the molecular structure of organisms,

260
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,049
Uh, dating artifacts, penetrating large objects.

261
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,079
How does that have anything to do with an arms dealer?

262
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,849
Maybe he's smuggling something.

263
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,809
Or trying to prevent something from being smuggled.

264
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,689
Maybe he's planning on smuggling something

265
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,159
Inside something

266
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,170
That's inside something else...

267
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,350
Like an illegal turducken.

268
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,669
Mike, did haas say anything

269
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,209
To suggest he may have something against the ambassador?

270
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,859
Nope, according to him,

271
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,879
He doesn't even know her.

272
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,650
You believe him? Not really.

273
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,299
It's him.

274
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,600
We'll be listening.

275
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,060
Yeah. Mike.

276
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,339
Ambassador, you got the phone?

277
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,630
No.

278
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,070
He wants me to tell you

279
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,319
He has cut off my air,

280
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,969
And I have less than two hours to live.

281
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,379
Don't worry. I'm coming for you,

282
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,489
Ambassador.

283
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,250
Call me... Olara.

284
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,810
You're very brave, olara.

285
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,729
That was so nice.

286
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,539
I mean--i mean, maybe a little sappy,

287
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,599
But it had some humanity.

288
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,239
Still, you need to pick up the pace, or she dies...

289
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,249
Slowly.

290
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,679
You have some serious psychological problems.

291
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,229
Mm, yes, and you work for the government.

292
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,880
I think I know which one's worse.

293
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,219
You know, if I didn't know any better,

294
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,050
I'd think you were mad at me, hank.

295
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,810
So you didn't intentionally throw that ball?

296
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,800
No?

297
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,479
Okay, just gonna let this sweep

298
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,659
Run on your core a.I.

299
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,430
And I'll get back to kitt.

300
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,870
Hank.

301
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,559
Where's the machine?

302
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,790
The x-ray machine is located in room 312.

303
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,329
And I got 15 minutes to get it from up there to down here.

304
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,439
Sarah, please tell me

305
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,169
I don't have to turbo-boost into this place.

306
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,470
Don't worry.

307
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,319
We've got something a little more high-tech planned.

308
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,940
How's the disguise working out, michael?

309
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,310
Your 3-d generator never ceases to impress.

310
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,119
Let's try it on these guys.

311
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,249
As long as you don't tell them

312
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,059
I targeted the room's alternating current dispenser,

313
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,229
You should be fine.

314
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,229
You mean you unplugged it?

315
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,510
That's right.

316
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,079
I'm here for the x-ray machine.

317
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,629
We just called five minutes ago.

318
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,200
How'd you get here so fast?

319
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,490
Dedicated service department.

320
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,019
Mike, the machine you're looking for

321
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,279
Is about the size of a small refrigerator.

322
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,139
Yep, we treat all our machines

323
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,700
Like family.

324
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,139
That's the microwave.

325
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,510
I know. I skipped lunch.

326
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,620
You want to find the thing that looks like a telescope.

327
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,850
There it is.

328
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,529
It just stopped working. Why would it do that?

329
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,019
Tell him it has something to do with the computerized...

330
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,999
Tomographic system and micro-focus.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,419
From what I can tell,

332
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,019
The tomographic system got disconnected

333
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,519
From the micro-focus.

334
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,219
You can tell just by looking at it?

335
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,929
You can if the tube head is loose

336
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,279
From the x-ray generator.

337
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,160
Well, it makes sense...

338
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,889
Since the x-ray generator

339
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,779
Came loose

340
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,639
From the old tube head here.

341
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,379
Isn't that the tube head?

342
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,069
Jeez, mike, didn't you pay any attention in science class?

343
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,549
You shut your face.

344
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,959
Are you talking to yourself?

345
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,729
Say

346
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,149
You were testing the machine's resonance.

347
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,879
I'm testing the machine's resonance.

348
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,739
Why don't you just open it up and look at it?

349
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,739
What, does this guy want to try fixing this himself?

350
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,249
Hey, you want to try fixing this yourself?

351
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,469
No. Good.

352
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,719
'cause in my opinion,

353
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,959
This whole thing needs to come back to our lab.

354
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,430
For how long? Depends.

355
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,399
The sooner I can take it,

356
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,360
The sooner you can get back to your...

357
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,840
Bone.

358
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Thanks.

359
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,539
Nice work, mike. You too, kitt.

360
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,840
You are both welcome.

361
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,690
We'll be on our way in just a few more steps.

362
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,670
Open the door, kitt!

363
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,070
Hurry, michael.

364
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,900
Kitt, open the door now!

365
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,959
Michael, with the taser barbs removed,

366
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,329
You should be feeling better.

367
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,160
I'll feel better when we have olara.

368
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,160
Say you got it.

369
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,870
I did.

370
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,460
Oh, man.

371
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,919
I do not know which agency you work for, mike,

372
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,519
But I gotta tell you, man.

373
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,139
They gotta give you a raise.

374
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,249
Just tell me how many more of these random jobs

375
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,239
I'm gonna have to do.

376
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,829
Nothing that you are doing for me is random.

377
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,829
Do you understand?

378
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,379
See, now, look. See right there?

379
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,420
There's a navigator driving beside you.

380
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,349
Friends of yours?

381
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,489
Hey, slow down

382
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,079
Now all you have to do, wiseass,

383
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,239
Is just know that they are people

384
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,799
That I do business with, okay?

385
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,859
And now you do too.

386
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,959
Now up ahead is an amusement park.

387
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,819
Do you see?

388
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,779
Okay.

389
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,079
Now pull over into the lot, and what I want you to do is,

390
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,129
I want you to give mr. Haas to the people

391
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,259
In that vehicle.

392
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,549
And in return, they are going to give you a little box.

393
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,489
Do you get it?

394
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,459
Sure.

395
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,029
A convict, an x-ray machine,

396
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,149
And a box at an amusement park.

397
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,019
Yeah, it all makes perfect sense.

398
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,439
No, it doesn't.

399
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,879
You checking the car's plates?

400
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,859
Working on it.

401
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,429
What about fallout from the university?

402
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,439
Smoothing things over with the dean as we speak.

403
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,879
Anything on the x-ray machine?

404
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,519
Still nothing to suggest why the kidnapper

405
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,189
Or gunnar haas would want it.

406
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,079
What about ivana alexandrov?

407
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,029
She's the registered owner of the navigator.

408
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,099
What do we know about her?

409
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,549
According to the state department,

410
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,389
She's a businesswoman.

411
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,979
According to the nsa, she's s.V.R.

412
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,020
According to me, she's hot.

413
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,239
Sluzhba vnyeshney razvyedkee?

414
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,019
Russian secret service.

415
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,649
Cross reference her with the ambassador and gunnar haas.

416
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,390
There has to be a match.

417
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,580
What the hell has he gotten us into?

418
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,720
Hank!

419
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,260
Hank!

420
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,749
Look, now stop!

421
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,839
Hank, stop it!

422
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,110
H-h-hank!

423
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,330
Okay, look, you've given me no choice.

424
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,980
Oh, hank.

425
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,719
What is this?

426
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,110
This is where you get out.

427
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,800
Oh, no.

428
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,320
Not them.

429
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,929
It's three girls.

430
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,759
What's the problem?

431
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,289
We had a slight misunderstanding

432
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,080
During a business transaction.

433
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,240
Hello, gunnar.

434
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,220
Dude.

435
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,710
Come on.

436
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,549
Nice job for one man.

437
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,810
Thanks.

438
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,540
Now give him to us.

439
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,030
First give me the box.

440
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,250
Be glad we are giving you your life.

441
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,530
A little help, kitt.

442
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,830
Lethal or non-lethal?

443
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,019
Non-lethal.

444
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,960
Accessing micro-darts.

445
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,230
Last chance.

446
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,870
Oh, thank you, thank you.

447
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,179
Thank you, kitt.

448
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,779
Have carrie get an fbi team over here to clean this up.

449
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,819
Yes, michael.

450
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,470
You should be aware that the aircraft has returned.

451
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,449
Aircraft?

452
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,730
The drone. It is directly overhead.

453
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,590
I hate this guy.

454
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,299
This guy's name is christopher stevens.

455
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,729
I cross-referenced cia, fbi, and homeland security databases.

456
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,029
He's the one guy connected to ambassador kumali,

457
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,099
Gunnar haas, and ivana alexandrov.

458
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,869
How?

459
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,879
He was a weapons designer for the pentagon.

460
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,779
You know him?

461
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,809
I know of him.

462
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,039
Well, according to this,

463
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,419
He was suspected of selling secrets to russia.

464
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,269
He was put on trial, and it was stopped

465
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,349
When three key u.N. Witnesses disappeared.

466
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,639
So he was just let go?

467
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,229
His research was confiscated.

468
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,020
His project was scrapped.

469
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,539
It was a self-targeting, low-orbiting laser.

470
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,379
It didn't have anything to do with x-rays.

471
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,989
Still, no one kept tabs on him.

472
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm sure they've tried.

473
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,299
He's a smart guy.

474
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,490
If he has come back, it can't be good.

475
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,810
Come on, call already.

476
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,809
Kitt?

477
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,699
Michael, please exit the vehicle.

478
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,989
Exposure to an excess of 1,000 rads

479
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,559
Can result in human fatality in--

480
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,549
In english!

481
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,789
The package you are carrying?

482
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,530
It's radioactive.

483
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,080
Hazardous materials storage container opening.

484
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,949
Exposure limited to below serious.

485
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,399
Stand by for decontamination.

486
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,520
What?  Stand by for decontamination

487
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,710
Contamination removed.

488
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,259
Thanks.

489
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,590
You're welcome.

490
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,069
He's having me pick up uranium?

491
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,859
Actually, the material in the box is not uranium.

492
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,540
It's hafnium.

493
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,499
What?

494
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,979
Atomic number 72.

495
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,519
Hafnium is a ductile metal

496
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,049
With a high neutron-capture cross-section.

497
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,919
Given today's events, it is interesting

498
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,789
That hafnium can be made to release a bomb-like charge

499
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,219
When struck with a specific waveform.

500
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,799
X-rays? Correct.

501
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,789
What's more, the size of the resulting blast

502
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,249
Would be approximately ten miles

503
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,539
In diameter per hafnium gram.

504
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,010
Your box contains three grams.

505
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,319
Wow, you are good.

506
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,899
You're having me build a bomb?

507
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,649
No, I'm having you collect pieces

508
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,979
So I can build a bomb.

509
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,529
Not if I hang on to what I have.

510
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,559
Way to drop your purse and get into the game, mikey.

511
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,590
Yeah, sure, you can keep everything.

512
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,580
But then I'd keep this.

513
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,520
I mean, look at her.

514
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,329
Smart, kind.

515
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,840
And the only thing that's keeping her alive is you, mike.

516
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,879
And that's exactly why you're gonna bring

517
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,629
Everything in your car over to the hesperia sugar mill.

518
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,649
A sugar mill.

519
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,529
Yeah, a sugar mill which is exactly

520
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,109
20 minutes away from you.

521
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,639
Which is exactly the amount of time

522
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,719
That olara has left to breathe.

523
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,899
I'm sure you have gps in your car, am I right?

524
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,389
Hmm, you have no idea.

525
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,220
Great. Get going.

526
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,180
Hank?

527
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,269
I noticed that this went missing

528
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,069
From my files a little while back,

529
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,489
But I never thought it would be

530
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,580
Because one of my robots took it.

531
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,569
Hank, I know I haven't been spending

532
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,439
As much time with you as I used to,

533
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,749
And it must be kinda frustrating

534
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,459
To be in here all by yourself

535
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,280
While katie and lisa are with kitt.

536
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,239
That doesn't mean you can throw things

537
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,790
Whenever you want.

538
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,419
Well, I'll tell you what.

539
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,690
There's a work space in the ssc which needs filling.

540
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,160
Are you interested?

541
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,420
Okay, good.

542
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,309
You start tomorrow.

543
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,450
Dad.

544
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,710
We have a situation.

545
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,449
You can't be serious.

546
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,979
I'm not letting olara die.

547
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,059
You can't deliver

548
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,239
A hafnium bomb to a man like stevens.

549
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,189
He's right, mike.

550
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,319
Going into this blind is too big a risk.

551
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,469
So is letting him get away,

552
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,689
And that's exactly what's gonna happen if I don't show up.

553
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,100
Don't be so sure.

554
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,169
This is the hesperia sugar mill.

555
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,079
It's been abandoned, and from all our data,

556
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,819
It's where christopher stevens is

557
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,579
And ambassador kumali as well.

558
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,419
Sarah and charles just ran an analysis on the drone.

559
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,529
They're pretty sure this is where the controlling

560
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,879
Transmission comes from.

561
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,559
Also, ambient sound tests

562
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,279
On the phone calls from stevens

563
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,539
And the ambassador match,

564
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,570
Suggesting they're in the same place.

565
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,599
Plus there's this.

566
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,629
What is that?

567
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,149
An electromagnetic shield.

568
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,939
Every scan we've run on this place,

569
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,839
Heat, infrared, radar,

570
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,329
Sonar, gets blocked around this warehouse.

571
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,869
And why go through all that trouble unless

572
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,269
You're hiding something important?

573
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,149
Exactly.

574
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,939
Now stevens is expecting you here in about ten minutes.

575
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,599
The thing is, people can get irrational

576
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,980
As they're close to finally getting what they want.

577
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,499
If there were ever a time when stevens

578
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,499
Would let down his guard, this is it.

579
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,379
Carrie, I want you and a team

580
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,089
Out there asap. On my way.

581
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,390
Zoe, keep tabs on that drone.

582
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,119
Billy, help sarah and charles

583
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,029
Figure out a way to penetrate that shield.

584
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,339
Mike's going in.

585
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,550
We need to give him all the cover we can.

586
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,109
Michael, we will be in range in less than a minute.

587
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,029
We'll most likely lose contact

588
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,759
As soon as you enter the property.

589
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,889
Got it. You ready?

590
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,919
Yes.

591
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,069
Still, due to the nature of your plan,

592
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,649
I am compelled to ask.

593
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,289
What happens if the elements

594
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,719
Do not come together as you've predicted?

595
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,379
Then we go to the backup plan.

596
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,529
I thought we concluded

597
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,699
That backup plans are ineffective.

598
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,129
That's why we better get this right.

599
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,169
On my mark.

600
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,870
Three, two, one...Now!

601
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,720
Mike? Mike?

602
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,189
He's not responding.

603
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,529
He must be under the shield.

604
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,149
Can we get an image into the warehouse?

605
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,440
Not yet.

606
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,259
Kitt, we've lost contact with mike.

607
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,269
We're probably gonna lose contact with you.

608
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,829
You need to hold on until carrie gets there.

609
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,940
I understand, dr. Graiman.

610
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,760
Dr. Graiman--

611
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,400
We've lost them both.

612
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,210
Mike.

613
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,830
My man.

614
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,420
So nice to see you.

615
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,179
Sort of.

616
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,709
Now I want you to follow us into this warehouse.

617
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,309
Then you're gonna stop your car,

618
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,469
And then you're gonna get out.

619
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,000
You understand?

620
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,930
Talkative guy. Follow me.

621
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,510
Nice mood lighting.

622
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,490
Deal or no deal?

623
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,160
No deal.

624
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,519
Get stevens.

625
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,849
I wouldn't do that.

626
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,499
The sooner you do, the sooner he'll know

627
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,940
I kicked your ass.

628
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,259
Okay, time to get out.

629
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,600
Dr. Graiman?

630
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,430
Michael?

631
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,300
Time to get out.

632
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,479
Oh, come on, mike. Really?

633
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,339
I mean, if you don't wanna get out,

634
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,480
Then you don't get olara.

635
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,760
You get it?

636
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,310
Mike?

637
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,370
Olara.

638
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,470
Okay, mike. This just stopped being funny.

639
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,900
Open the door.

640
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,139
Open the-- all right.

641
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,650
What am i, talking to myself?

642
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,540
Olara.

643
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,100
Mike!

644
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,039
Okay, that's it.

645
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,109
You don't wanna get out of the car?

646
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,069
I'm bringing her out right now.

647
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,259
I'm gonna put a bullet in her--

648
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,840
Hang on, pal.

649
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,089
Say what?

650
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,680
Hang on, pal.

651
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,869
Hang on, pal?

652
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,490
I said, "hang on, pal."

653
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,970
You said--

654
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,690
Nobody says, "hang on, pal" to me!

655
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,870
When was the last time you heard from the others?

656
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,940
Talking car?

657
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,650
Nice.

658
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,859
Oh, I gotta tell you, mike.

659
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,079
While I do not like your deception,

660
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,110
I do respect your tenacity.

661
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,429
Now open the door and give me my stuff.

662
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,739
Don't. He is a terrorist.

663
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,409
Oh, yeah, I'm a terrorist.

664
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,820
Good call.

665
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,290
All right, we're gonna do it a different way.

666
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,300
If you don't give me my stuff,

667
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,990
I'm gonna pop her.

668
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,910
Open the doors and trunk.

669
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,189
A voice-activated talking car.

670
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,279
Right on.

671
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,419
You guys know what to do. Hafnium's in the trunk.

672
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,799
Machine's in the back.

673
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,350
That's so rad.

674
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,359
Who's it for?

675
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,620
You mean the bomb?

676
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,409
Oh, well, that's the great part about this whole thing, mike.

677
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,439
It's really funny.

678
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,870
Um, the bomb...

679
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,120
Is...For...

680
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,020
You.

681
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,220
Okay, so here's how it's gonna go.

682
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,379
While I hang on to olara,

683
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,379
You are going to get into this car now

684
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,289
And gun it to 100 miles per hour.

685
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,859
Now from that point on, you keep it at 100, 105,

686
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,350
And then you just stay on that road heading north.

687
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,719
Why 100?

688
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,729
Oh, this is really funny.

689
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,460
Actually, I was gonna say 60.

690
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,779
But then I just saw this car, dude.

691
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,370
You know, and I was like,

692
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,569
"you gotta take advantage

693
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,049
Of the speed, you know?"

694
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,109
Oh, and by the way, if you deviate off-course,

695
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,849
I'll know from the bomb's gps,

696
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,999
And then olara dies, and hello, genocide.

697
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,449
You are insane.

698
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,829
Yes, I know, but it gets better.

699
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,679
Just you wait.

700
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,369
Um, so if you go below 100 miles per hour,

701
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,980
Then the bomb automatically explodes.

702
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,169
Got it?

703
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,600
Good. Go.

704
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,090
You'll never get away with this.

705
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,869
Do they teach you guys to say that somewhere?

706
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,260
12 seconds.

707
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,160
Mike, go.

708
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,000
Please.

709
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,090
I'll find you.

710
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,649
You too.

711
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,639
Mm-hmm, yeah. Uh, buckle up safely.

712
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,100
Nine seconds.

713
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,030
Mike!

714
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,989
Carrie's about to get there, mike.

715
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,939
What's going on?

716
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,799
Stevens has olara, kitt has a bomb in his trunk,

717
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,360
And I have to stay above 100 or everything blows up.

718
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,500
There's no one in here.

719
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,720
I got something.

720
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,740
No!

721
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,240
Carrie?
