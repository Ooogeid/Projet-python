1
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,600
Where is he,Kitt?

2
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,600
The enemy is to the northest and still have the arm.

3
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,600
Got him.

4
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,600
Ha ha ha!

5
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,960
Busted!

6
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,960
Dude,Katie's not on your team.

7
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,800
You said you picked Lisa.

8
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
Me and Kitt versus you and Lisa.

9
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,130
They decided to switch.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,630
Decided? She's a robot.

11
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,400
Ooh,I wouldn't make her mad.

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,800
So... what'll it be,Mr. Knight?

13
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,500
Drench or dishonor?

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,460
Kitt,roll down your windows.

15
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,700
Mike!

16
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,200
- Targeting.  - Traitor!

17
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,060
Direct hit.

18
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,230
Hey,hey!

19
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,300
What the hell are you doing?

20
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,660
Hello,Sarah.

21
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,860
Hey,Sarah.

22
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,700
You guys missed the R&D meeting.

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
We were just blowing off some steam.

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,600
By soaking kitt?

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,300
- Yeah.  - Told you he should be waterproof.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,630
He is waterproof,

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,830
As long as you don't roll down his windows.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,960
So from now on,he won't.

29
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,230
Especially on this next one.

30
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,930
A week ago,a U.S. undercover agent

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,560
Went to meet with what we believe

32
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,560
Is a terrorist cell in Baja.

33
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,300
The operations code name was Iguana.

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,430
Agent Turner's cover was as an import facilitator.

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,530
He's a high end trafficker

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,100
Who specializes in getting illegal cargo into the U.S.

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,060
We think he was being asked to help bring in

38
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,500
A weapons system.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,330
What kind of weapons system?

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,530
We don't know.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,700
What kind of terrorist cell?

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,930
We don't know that either.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Day after turner reached baja,

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,300
He vanished.

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
12 hours later,

46
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,100
An extraction team was sent in after him.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,400
They vanished too.

48
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,360
That's not creepy.

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,200
Turner has a homing device on him.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,660
It's an active rfid transmitter

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,030
Inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of his wrist.

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,360
It has a range of 400 yards,

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,060
Transmit duration 216 hours.

54
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,730
Then the signal's deteriorating.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,930
Can kitt's frequency amp help?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,260
That's what we're hoping.

57
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,730
The meeting with Turner in the cell was set here

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,730
In Todos Santos.

59
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,660
A surf spot?

60
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,830
An international surf spot.

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,400
Which leads us to believe the cell Turner was contacting

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,030
Was either in the surf culture,or they're posing as surfers.

63
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,900
Great. One thing...

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,330
I don't do water.

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,500
Well,you don't seem to have a problem with it.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,900
I'm just better on dry land.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,260
Is this because of Lily Mulraney?

68
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,830
No,it's not because of Lily Mulraney.

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,660
Who's Lily Mulraney?

70
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,500
- Grade school bully that swirlied Mikey.  - It's not Lily Mulraney.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,230
And she did not swirly me.

72
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,400
I didn't realize how much it affected you.

73
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,630
Look,all we need to do is get Carrie to come with me,

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,460
And I'll be fine... she knows how to surf.

75
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,430
No can do. Agent rivai's in D.C.

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
Well,if this is where I'm goin',

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,630
It'd be helpful to have someone that knows how to surf.

78
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,930
Whoa! Sick swells!

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
That dude barreled 20 yards before he pearled.

80
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,800
Zoe,you surf?

81
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,160
Doesn't everyone?

82
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,500
She's coming with me.

83
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
Sweet! Where?

84
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,300
Can I have a word?

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't you think sending Zoe on an undercover mission

86
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,800
Might be a little risky?

87
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,700
Sometimes she can be...

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,300
Out there?

89
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,500
Well,she speaks spanish,and she surfs.

90
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,730
Do you?

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,160
No,and...no. But that's not the point.

92
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,330
Zoe is...

93
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,330
Zoe.

94
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
How 'bout you,billy?

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,900
Do you surf?

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,330
No. No.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,900
Th-the ocean's... Not really my thing.

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,830
I I rash up.

99
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,160
I want Mike and Zoe geared up for the beach in 40.

100
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,800
Cover is...devon and bonnie.

101
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,000
A honeymooning couple.

102
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,660
Awesome!

103
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,630
I have lost my coworker. She's a little crazy."

104
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,330
The closer you get,the stronger the signal,okay?

105
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,460
How much to post bail?

106
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,900
There are four modifications.

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
Function one is sand.

108
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,800
Function two is wet sand.

109
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,830
Guys...

110
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a mission.

111
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,500
It won't be any different than the others.

112
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,530
Right.

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,400
Let's do it,surfer.

114
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
Not too different.

115
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,630
Chamber doors opening.

116
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,800
Lock intra-strength system active.

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,500
Orale. Party wave!

118
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,830
Monster slash!

119
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,460
You really know how to do all that?

120
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,560
My fakies could use some work,

121
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,160
But my laybacks are solid.

122
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,200
How bout your hang tens?

123
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,830
Please tell me you're not gonna talk like that.

124
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,000
Michael,we have arrived in Todos Santos.

125
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,030
The hotel el surfer is 1/4 mile ahead

126
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,300
And is the last place

127
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,400
From which agent Turner made contact.

128
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,700
El surfer?

129
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,460
Only the best for my girl.

130
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,660
What more could I want for my honeymoon?

131
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,830
You...know we're not officially undercover yet.

132
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm getting into character.

133
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
- Mike  - Ah!

134
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,360
Are we interrupting something?

135
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,730
Oh,hey,guys,what's,uh...cracking?

136
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,060
What's your status?

137
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,130
Status is good. We're approaching the hotel.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,500
Once you arrive,

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,960
I want you to check in,

140
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,560
And let Kitt focus everything he has on that beacon.

141
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,830
Our plan exactly.

142
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,630
Except I¡¯m getting us some fish tacos

143
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,000
And margaritas first.

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,700
Excellent idea. Keep us posted.

145
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,360
Fish tacos and margaritas?

146
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,900
How is that an excellent idea?

147
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,900
Their cover needs to be convincing.

148
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,260
Of course,but...

149
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,700
Rather than worrying about the abilities of our field ops,

150
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,230
You should be digging

151
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,530
Into agent Turner's background.

152
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
He's squeaky clean.

153
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,800
Nothing's unusual in his files.

154
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,760
Then what's not in his files?

155
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,460
Until we know what's going on with Turner and this cell,

156
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,630
Our people are vulnerable.

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,300
I don't want them surprised.

158
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,060
Wow. What a great room.

159
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,400
With...

160
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,130
One bed.

161
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,500
Si no te gusta,vete a otro lugare.

162
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,730
No te ahueves. It's our honeymoon.

163
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,760
One bed's all we need.

164
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,700
What's wrong?

165
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,130
Nothing.

166
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,700
I'm trying to keep it real.

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,060
Sure. Uh,thing is,I kinda made it a rule

168
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,500
Not to do anything like that

169
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,760
With anyone from work.

170
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,130
- You do it with Sarah.  - No,I don't.

171
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,460
I mean,we did,but that's different.

172
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,500
She and I are...

173
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Don't worry,I promise nothing's gonna happen

174
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,600
That's not completely professional.

175
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,430
Okay.

176
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,960
As long as I don't have tequila.

177
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,460
Michael.

178
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,900
Yes,Kitt?

179
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,500
I have picked up agent Turner's homing beacon.

180
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Zoe.

181
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,630
Present.

182
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,730
Really?

183
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
It's called blending in.

184
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,000
Kitt,what's the status?

185
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,460
According to the homing beacon,

186
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,260
Turner is one of the two men in the beach cruiser,

187
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,030
25 yards to your 2:00.

188
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,430
You can't tell it's him for sure?

189
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,260
The beacon is transmitting from the vehicle,

190
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,000
But as I do not have a visual on either man,

191
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,500
I cannot confirm the identity.

192
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,860
Let's follow him.

193
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,630
Burn rubber,Kitt!

194
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,800
Burning rubber.

195
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,360
Just stay on the beacon,Kitt.

196
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,060
Beacon tracking system locked.

197
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,830
I have picked up a stronger signal.

198
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,260
Stronger as in the beacon's gotten closer?

199
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,600
The tracking system has been replaced

200
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,800
By a targeting device.

201
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,830
Kitt,get us out of here.

202
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,530
Mike.

203
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,600
Kitt!

204
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,900
Pressure equalization on. Go for resurfacing.

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,530
This is cooler than the nemo ride at Disneyland.

206
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,430
It would be cooler

207
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,660
- If you didn't almost destroy the car.  - We didn't do anything.

208
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,060
Kitt tried to dodge that missile and couldn't.

209
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,460
It blew him into the frickin' ocean.

210
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,230
We know,Mike.

211
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,800
Kitt got a profile of the attack,

212
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,960
And we're looking into it,but whatever it was that hit you,

213
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,730
It's more advanced than anything in use today.

214
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,460
Well,if this is what they're trying to get into the U.S.

215
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,760
We got a bigger problem than we thought.

216
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,960
The real question is

217
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,400
How did Turner and these guys get their hands on it?

218
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,630
What makes you think it's Turner?

219
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,900
We never got a visual on him.

220
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,930
Mike,agent Turner has an offshore bank account.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah,we hacked the bank record.

222
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,900
Just last month,he withdrew almost everything in there.

223
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,600
It's over $2 million.

224
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,260
So you think he's flipped to the other side.

225
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,930
Anything's possible.

226
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,300
Just got word...

227
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,000
Two bodies washed up ten miles south of here...

228
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,700
The extraction team.

229
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,260
Great.

230
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,430
So now we have no tracking device

231
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,630
And no more contacts.

232
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,930
What do we do?

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,730
You hit the streets.

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,630
We drew them out once. Maybe we can do it again.

235
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay. But first we probably need to dry off.

236
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,460
Prepare to surface in three,two,one.

237
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,330
Michael,I am confused.

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
The answer is because it would be a mistake.

239
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,700
What would?

240
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,730
Sleeping with Zoe.

241
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
But she invited you in.

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,360
Do you not find her attractive?

243
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,900
Yeah. That's the problem.

244
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Does this have to do with your relationship with Sarah?

245
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,530
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

246
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,500
We're not in a relationship.

247
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,260
Now you sound agitated.

248
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,060
- I'm not agitated.  - Are you sure?

249
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,330
Yes!

250
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,760
Good night,Michael.

251
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,000
Good night,Kitt.

252
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,500
Kitt,any luck with the scanners?

253
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,900
Negative,Michael.

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
Though this beach has vehicles

255
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,430
Similar to the one we pursued last night,

256
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,660
I still have no conclusive matches

257
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,360
For agent Turner or any of the men who attacked us.

258
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,660
Well,it's been four hours.

259
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,560
One more,and we need to hit another beach.

260
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,760
# You don't know the game like I want you to #

261
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,830
# Wanna show you how to do it #

262
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,630
# Before we're through #

263
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,760
# Get your freak on #

264
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,260
# It's the thing to do #

265
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,260
# I said freak on #

266
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,860
Hola,chicas.

267
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,360
Estoy buscando este tipo.

268
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,930
Ele has visto?

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,530
Lo siento.

270
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,700
Gracias.

271
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,030
Voice scan negative.

272
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,600
The subjects are telling the truth.

273
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,400
Hey,you're on our beach.

274
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,800
Look for someone

275
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,400
Well,he ain't here.

276
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,130
Maybe look at the picture to be sure.

277
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Nope.

278
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,600
Get off my beach.

279
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,130
You all right?

280
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,000
Name's Skyler.

281
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,260
Devon.

282
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,830
Do you know who those guys were?

283
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,930
Beach hoppers.

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well,I owe you. Let me buy you a beer.

285
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,430
Uh...

286
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,800
Well,if... you insist.

287
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,200
Sorry,bro. Never seen him.

288
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,960
But you look familiar. Military?

289
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,760
Army.

290
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,430
Two tours myself before I had enough

291
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,430
and cashed it in.

292
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,600
Any reason?

293
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,800
I found this.

294
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,730
See,I realized I was living

295
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,960
In the land of the free without actually being free.

296
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,130
Here... it's a whole different story.

297
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,660
What's the catch?

298
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,260
No catch.

299
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,600
All you gotta do is an odd job here and there,

300
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,500
And the rest of it is paradise.

301
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,500
If...

302
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,630
You're willing to go for it.

303
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,030
I am.

304
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,430
Ever since we got here,

305
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,430
I've been telling Devon we should stay.

306
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,930
Well,you got the right idea.

307
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,100
Still... I have to convince him.

308
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,200
Can anyone say... tequila?

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,330
Tequila.

310
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,700
Ohh! Right.

311
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,660
That's it for me.

312
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,200
Thanks for the drinks.

313
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,400
Thanks for your help.

314
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,100
Think about what I told ya.

315
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,430
I will.

316
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,660
Don't worry,I'll have him agreeing to move by morning.

317
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,630
You guys really wanna see what I'm talking about,

318
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,730
You should come by el pescadero tomorrow.

319
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,260
El pescadero?

320
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,730
It's a local surf spot about five miles south.

321
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,060
That's where the waves are.

322
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,500
We don't normally bring in outsiders,

323
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,630
But you two might be all right.

324
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,260
Good night.

325
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,300
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

326
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,800
I can't sleep with you,Zoe.

327
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,260
That's not what I was thinking.

328
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,900
Oh.

329
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,100
I was thinking how this guy just happened to show up

330
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,700
Right when you were getting jumped.

331
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,700
Yeah.

332
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,130
And that's why we're gonna check his fingerprints.

333
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,300
Accessing afis.

334
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,960
Skyler Rand,explosives expert.

335
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,560
Purple heart,bronze star. Dishonorable discharge.

336
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,960
I knew he was bad.

337
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,800
Makes him even hotter.

338
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,230
According to the records,

339
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,660
Sergeant Rand was discharged for insubordination.

340
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,160
Coulda been me.

341
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,430
Perhaps,Michael,though in Skyler Rand's case,

342
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,960
His entire squad

343
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,730
Was dishonorably discharged with him.

344
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,130
How many guys in his squad?

345
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,130
Four surviving members at the time of the discharge,

346
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,760
Including Sergeant Rand.

347
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,430
Same number as the guys who jumped us last night.

348
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,860
Counting Skyler...

349
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,930
Same number as the guys on the beach today.

350
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,360
Kitt,can you get files on the rest of Rand's team?

351
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,800
Cross-reference them with anything you have

352
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,000
From last night or today.

353
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,430
Match is over 85%.

354
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,830
Dude... we rock.

355
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,530
You're better at this spy stuff than I expected.

356
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,860
Yeah? You too.

357
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,200
Now are you thinking what I'm thinking?

358
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,000
I told you not to let me have tequila.

359
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,700
Un momento,por favor.

360
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,700
Mike,we figured out how to track Turner.

361
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,660
He was given a radio ear implant on one of his old jobs.

362
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,430
All we have to do is load this into Kitt

363
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,260
And set it to track him.

364
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,200
Last night was epic.

365
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,230
How many times do I have to say it?

366
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Nothing happened.

367
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,160
How many times do I have to say it?

368
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,160
I don't care.

369
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,200
Your relationships are none of my business.

370
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm not having a relationship.

371
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,430
Nothing happened.

372
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,060
At least nothing I remember.

373
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,830
I think it was surprising,is all.

374
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,630
Please. I'm the naked one.

375
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,630
I got that.

376
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,030
They'll get over it.

377
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,260
Anyway,how cool is it

378
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,960
That we get to be out in the field?

379
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,500
Actually,I think I like it better in the kittcave.

380
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,230
Why?

381
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,560
Out here there are too many variables.

382
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,230
You never know what's gonna happen.

383
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,400
Billy... that's what makes it so fun.

384
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,460
What it is is you're jealous

385
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,600
Zoe got to work this mission instead of you.

386
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,760
Please. I was working last night.

387
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,230
Unlike some people.

388
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,360
I was working this mission last night.

389
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,930
That... is not what I meant.

390
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Billy and I came up with a new application

391
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,100
That will let kitt track down Turner.

392
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,500
Zoe and I i.d.'d a group of mercenaries as our terror cell.

393
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,330
- Really?  - Yeah.

394
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
- Were they with Turner?  - No.

395
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,060
But I know how we can find out if Turner's with them.

396
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,560
El pescadero beach.

397
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,030
Here we are.

398
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,800
Any hits,Kitt?

399
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,560
I have no readings for agent Turner.

400
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,600
However,I believe Skyler Rand is southeast of you.

401
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,100
Got him. Let's go.

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,630
So... what do we do now?

403
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,660
Relax and see what we can see.

404
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,260
Relax.

405
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,060
I can be relaxed.

406
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,500
Ooh.

407
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,960
You all right?

408
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,160
Clearly,I like four walls around me.

409
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,230
This whole nature thing...

410
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,930
freaks me out.

411
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,960
I think I'm getting hives.

412
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,100
Sweet beach.

413
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Glad you guys found it.

414
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,200
Outstanding bodysurf to the south too...

415
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,860
if you don't mind the rocks.

416
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,900
I'm there!

417
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,530
Great.

418
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,530
You don't mind if I take Devon out with my boys?

419
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,630
Yeah.

420
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Sure.

421
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,900
Cool.

422
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,800
I thought you had a thing about water.

423
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,360
I really don't have a choice.

424
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,300
Just remember,make your pop-ups fast,

425
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
duck dives smooth,and avoid the rips,pearls,

426
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,660
and any part of the north beach,

427
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,200
because those waves are monster.

428
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,660
Do you have any idea what I just said?

429
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,030
No. But how bad could it be?

430
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,860
Thought you might wanna try the north beach.

431
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,200
North beach,huh?

432
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,700
Lead the way.

433
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,230
All right.

434
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,730
Sure you don't wanna come out,Billy?

435
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Naw. Guess I must have the same thing

436
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,630
Mike has about water.

437
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,130
Water sand... and sunlight.

438
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,930
None of that bothers you?

439
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,100
Not really.

440
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,630
How come?

441
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,030
In the SSC,

442
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,660
you're geek central like me.

443
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,860
But out here you're... so cool.

444
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,660
First... I try not to overthink things.

445
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,330
And then I trust

446
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,800
that my training will get me through.

447
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,060
And that works?

448
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,960
As long as you go with the flow,you know?

449
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,530
- Sarah...  - Yeah,Kitt.

450
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,830
I have just picked up a signal on your tracking application.

451
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,300
Turner?

452
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,200
I believe he is less than 100 yards southeast

453
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
- of our current position.  - Let's check it out.

454
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,730
Once we get out past the second reef,

455
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,260
that's where the big waves are.

456
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,730
Looks like we missed your boys.

457
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,930
That's all right.

458
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,930
Give you and me a chance to talk about

459
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,730
what you're really doing down here.

460
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Thinking about what you were talking about.

461
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,230
Going for it.

462
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,630
What about your brother?

463
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,800
Ah,he'll turn up somewhere.

464
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
He's a wandering soul like you.

465
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,560
What about you,Devon?

466
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,760
You a wandering soul?

467
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,930
I did some things in Iraq I'm not proud of.

468
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,130
Now I'm just looking for a fresh start.

469
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,130
I hear you.

470
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,130
Seems to me you gotta look at life

471
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,960
like surfing the wave.

472
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,900
Some are big,some are small.

473
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,630
But in order to ride any of them,

474
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,460
you gotta be willing to let the wave take you.

475
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,030
What if it takes you somewhere you shouldn't go?

476
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,830
Shouldn't is a word that isn't in my vocabulary.

477
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,460
Like if someone were to offer me and my boys

478
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,830
a boatload of cash

479
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,160
to do a job like the ones we used to do...

480
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,230
Why should I say no?

481
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,130
Depends on how dangerous the job.

482
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,260
Don't wanna do anything stupid.

483
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,730
Stupid is not listening to your gut.

484
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,130
Sometimes even I make that mistake.

485
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,400
Well,at least there's always another wave.

486
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,560
True.

487
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,730
But out here...

488
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,330
That's what'll kill you.

489
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,530
Here's our set.

490
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,160
Dude.

491
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,100
Kitt,can you hear me?

492
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,300
Yes,Michael.

493
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,830
How do you get up on a surfboard?

494
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,430
You stand up on it.

495
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,630
I hate you,lily merry.

496
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,000
That's the dude Mike went surfing with.

497
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,600
Why is he meeting up with Turner?

498
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,160
Hey.

499
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,760
Are you all right?

500
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,100
Yep. I will be...

501
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,300
just as soon as I kick that guy's ass.

502
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,960
- Mike.  - Sarah.

503
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,530
We thought you were with Skyler.

504
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,960
I was,until he tried to kill me with a wave. Why?

505
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,800
Billy and I just saw him go into a motor home.

506
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,330
We think he's with Turner.

507
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
We're on our way.

508
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,430
Infrared x-ray and penetrating radar

509
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,960
are now fully active.

510
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,430
Cool. Give us audio too.

511
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,460
Accessing parabolic microphones.

512
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,730
So... we're good?

513
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,730
Trust me... they'll be across the border tomorrow.

514
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,030
They'd better,for you and your wife's sake.

515
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
They have his wife?

516
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,760
Mrs. Turner has not used her cell phone or credit card

517
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,960
in the last two weeks.

518
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,830
Will you help me with this?

519
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,830
What are those?

520
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,430
Kitt,we're losing picture.

521
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,400
I'm sorry,Sarah,but it seems sergeant Rand

522
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,300
has activated some sort of jamming device.

523
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,230
We need to see what's in there.

524
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,130
Perhaps you could get out and look through a window.

525
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,300
I'll go.

526
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
Sarah,the height on the lowest window on this motor home

527
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,500
is 6 feet.

528
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,600
I am afraid that you are not tall enough

529
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,960
to look through the window.

530
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,530
But Billy is.

531
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,260
Help you,buddy?

532
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,700
Yeah,I'm...

533
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
looking for a bathroom.

534
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,960
Bad chalupa.

535
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,700
Spicy?

536
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,960
Mm-hmm.

537
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,300
Never gonna make it.

538
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,060
What'd you see?

539
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,500
Three cases for a next generation smart missile.

540
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,830
You could tell all that from the cases?

541
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,060
Yeah. I worked on the prototype.

542
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,600
They're night industries'.

543
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,330
This is bad.

544
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,360
The weapons these guys have are our weapons?

545
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,830
That's not possible.

546
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,200
I saw it,Dr. Graiman.

547
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,060
Three k-17 cobra cases,plain as day.

548
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,860
What's a k-17 cobra?

549
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,660
It's a next generation smart missile

550
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,060
That uses stealth technology,

551
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,930
And it can modify its attack profile based on the target.

552
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,760
I thought that didn't exist yet.

553
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,060
The missile should have recognized kitt as friendly.

554
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,960
The chips in them are designed to know what they're targeting

555
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,060
To prevent collateral damage.

556
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,360
Not if they've been modified.

557
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,360
Last month's shipment to the d.o.d.

558
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,100
Was delivered as designed.

559
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,200
Well,then somebody took them and altered the logic boards.

560
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Skyler Rand.

561
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,860
His guys are explosive experts.

562
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,030
They must have stolen the cobras and changed them.

563
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,900
- But why?  - Money.

564
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,230
He basically admitted to me

565
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,400
That he and his buddies are mercenaries.

566
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,630
But who's he working for?

567
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,760
What does d.o.d. Think?

568
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,800
D.o.d. Denies losing any ordnance at all.

569
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,430
Come home. Skyler's motor home is off the map.

570
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,000
But they're making their move tomorrow.

571
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,430
With that jamming device,we won't be able to track 'em

572
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,360
Until the missiles are out in the open.

573
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,830
Then we'd better be ready to move fast.

574
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,660
All I'm saying is

575
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,760
Maybe I could get used to this sort of thing.

576
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,560
Field work?

577
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,230
Yeah.

578
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,400
You and Mike get to deal with killer surfers.

579
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,430
I had to infiltrate and exfiltrate the motor home.

580
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,060
Exfiltrate?

581
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,800
Yeah. It's a word we use in field work.

582
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,060
We're on.

583
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,900
Agent Turner just used a security override

584
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
To bypass customs.

585
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,360
Sandiego,two minutes ago.

586
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,200
Billy,get the crossing on the screens

587
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,200
And find that motor home!

588
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,230
You're en route in attack mode.

589
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,200
Now.

590
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,460
Chamber doors opening.

591
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,460
Launch prep complete.

592
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,900
Kitt,attack mode.

593
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,860
Initiating transformation.

594
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,430
Transformation complete.

595
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,660
Kitt,hang on.

596
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,900
Why are we stopping?

597
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,030
- I'm coming with you.  - Me too.

598
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,200
Michael,as you know,in attack mode

599
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,360
I can accommodate only two passengers.

600
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,060
My mission.

601
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,830
It's my car.

602
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,130
Close it up.

603
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,300
Occupant restraint system active.

604
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,300
Ow!

605
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,230
Yeah. Should be fun.

606
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,400
- Get off me.  - You get off me!

607
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,600
- You're heavy.  - I am not heavy.

608
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,260
Inner doors opening.

609
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,930
# I need some action #

610
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,430
# Yeah #

611
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
# I need some action #

612
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,260
# Oh,I need some action #

613
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,130
# Yeah #

614
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,060
Motor home's stopped.

615
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,960
- Where?  - There.

616
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,130
Billy,get mike.

617
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,360
Mike,they're going for the coronado mesa nuclear plant.

618
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,700
You know what'll happen

619
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,530
If one of those missiles hits that thing?

620
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,830
Given the k-17's configuration,

621
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,000
I expect an amplified detonation

622
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,700
Followed by a radiation plume

623
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,300
That could surpass the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.

624
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,760
Oh...

625
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,600
Yeah,you know,all you had to say is it'll be bad.

626
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,300
- Michael.  - Yeah,kitt.

627
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,800
It will be very bad.

628
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,660
Sweet.

629
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,160
Time to make some money,honey.

630
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,860
Thar she blows.

631
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,400
We're two minutes out. How does it look?

632
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,600
Not good.

633
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,560
What about Turner and his wife... are they in danger?

634
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,000
Just the opposite.

635
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,060
Looks like they've been a part of Skyler's gang all along.

636
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,830
Mike,remember,you can't attack directly with kitt.

637
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,530
Even in attack mode,he can't handle four cobras.

638
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,230
They have four of those things?

639
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,000
That we can see!

640
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,900
Glad you guys came along?

641
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,900
Skyler.

642
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,900
Light 'em up!

643
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,000
Aw. Run away,little piggy.

644
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,500
All the way home.

645
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,700
You shoulda stayed in the water.

646
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,960
It seems as though our decoy ploy has worked.

647
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,860
So let's back him up.

648
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,100
Put it down!

649
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,560
Not too late,bro.

650
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,700
You let me do this,we split 12 million bucks.

651
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,030
Who's paying ya?

652
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Does it matter?

653
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
What do you think?

654
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,330
Lower the weapon.

655
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,660
I thought it was you...

656
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,460
- Lieutenant.  - Drop it.

657
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,160
Afghanistan.

658
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,700
You had a different hottie for a partner.

659
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,730
Yeah.

660
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,900
But still the same holier-than-thou attitude.

661
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,830
Guys like you

662
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,500
Always forget one thing about freedom.

663
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,930
Drop it now!

664
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,260
It costs.

665
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
Missile flying.

666
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,930
Impact in 16,15...

667
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,160
The cobra.

668
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,430
Kitt,hit the emp.

669
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
It won't work on rocket fuel.  Launch missiles!

670
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,230
No,they'll never catch up.

671
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,730
8...7...

672
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,530
Impact in 5...

673
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,530
The amplifier!

674
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,160
Using my amplifier

675
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,960
To jam the missile's gyro chip

676
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,460
Will completely reverse the k-17's direction.

677
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,200
3...2...

678
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,100
It's either that or chernobyl.

679
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,430
Scrambler amplification activating now.

680
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,530
1...

681
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,130
Missile redirected.

682
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,330
Amplification successful.

683
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,700
Missile reversed.

684
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,460
Wait. It's heading back to Mike.

685
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,630
Skyler,we gotta get outta here.

686
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,830
Come on! Come on.

687
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,260
Live free,bro.

688
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,400
What are you doing?

689
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,000
Mike!

690
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,100
Mike.

691
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,630
Mike!

692
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm okay.

693
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,960
Just got word from DHS.

694
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,460
Skyler rand's team and the Turners

695
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,430
Are on full lockdown in a federal detention facility.

696
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
Looks like they'll be hanging 10...

697
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,300
To 20!

698
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,060
Anybody wanna celebrate?

699
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,030
Sorry,we have a meeting with the defense department.

700
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,630
It seems now they're interested in discussing

701
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,160
Some misplaced cobras.

702
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,500
I got work.

703
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,660
And I've got a date.

704
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,630
Rematch with the soakers?

705
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,630
Load 'em up.

706
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,730
Yes!

707
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,860
I got katie.

708
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,930
No switching.

709
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,030
Actually,Michael,

710
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,200
Lisa and Katie are on my team.
