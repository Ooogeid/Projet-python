1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,409
Initiating satellite surveillance co-op

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,779
In three, two, one.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,980
We have satellite surveillance.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,069
Who's in the truck?

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,919
Just stop the bad guys.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,180
That's all we know.

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,059
He seems nervous.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,800
I can hear you, billy.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,680
35 seconds to intercept.

10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,689
Ready?

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,269
Hydraulic systems operating within tolerable limits.

12
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,039
Fuel cells at 92%.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,659
Shields and defensive weapon systems--

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,819
There's times for long answers and times for a short one.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,989
Yes or no question, kitt.

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,260
The short answer is I'm ready.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,519
All right. Here we go.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,619
Attack mode.

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,540
Initiating transformation.

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,270
Transformation complete.

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,969
Not bad for a newbie.

22
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,650
Ten seconds to intercept.

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,039
Ballsy move.

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,669
Whose side are you on, mike?

25
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,959
Admiring the ballet.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,940
Your emp's ready.

27
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,890
Sorry, you tough

28
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,910
You're gonna wanna see this.

29
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,469
On my way.

30
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,890
On my way.

31
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,330
Come on, girlie.

32
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,709
Electromagnetic pulse fully charged.

33
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,690
Hold your fire. I'm taking over.

34
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,769
Kitt's switched to manual. Mike's driving now.

35
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm not deaf, billy.

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,100
Not your morning, is it?

37
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,149
Mike.

38
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,219
Your emp will fry

39
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,890
The big rig's electronics.

40
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,029
He'll stop in under ten seconds.

41
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,239
Fbi's ten miles out.

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,160
Just zap him and wait for back-up.

43
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,389
Emp will jackknife him.

44
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,320
Gotta get his speed under 80.

45
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,920
Kitt, calculations?

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,979
Michael is right, dr. Graiman.

47
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,900
At this speed, the truck will jackknife.

48
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,709
Damn it, mike!

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,590
You're missing the whole thing, sweet cheeks.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,089
Michael, I'm picking up some unusual readings

51
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,609
From inside the truck, and the biker's

52
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,490
Are prepared to disembark.

53
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,010
Deploy the emp.

54
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,449
Fbi, 60 seconds away.

55
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,820
Hit infrared.

56
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,709
Michael, something strange is happening

57
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,130
Inside that truck.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,989
Do not approach the truck.

59
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,600
Wait for back-up.

60
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,569
I'm sorry, carrie, I can't hear you.

61
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,860
The emp must have jammed my earwig.

62
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,820
Mike!

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,940
Can you hear me?

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,190
Do you copy?

65
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,389
Michael, he's getting away. Michael?

66
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,009
That's a '79 shovelhead.

67
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,750
It's got no electronics, so the emp has no effect.

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,630
Michael

69
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,540
What the hell is going on

70
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,149
Decontamination complete.

71
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,290
Michael, I want to apologize.

72
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,379
I should have identified

73
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,299
The '79 shovelhead sooner.

74
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,759
Of course it would be immune to my emp.

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,849
It'd be easy to miss.

76
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,059
It's just that sarah and I used to ride

77
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,889
Old harleys back in the day.

78
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,569
"back in the day."

79
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,139
I really like the sound of that.

80
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,859
No, not back in the day.

81
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,969
Back in the day.

82
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,399
I will take note of the placement

83
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,630
Of the emphasis in this colloquialism.

84
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,409
Look, kitt, you and I are a team.

85
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,569
Sometimes I'm gonna see something you might miss

86
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,140
And vice versa.

87
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,000
Today, I spotted the harley.

88
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,429
No big deal.

89
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,169
I got your back. You got mine.

90
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,320
Then you're going to omit my error from your report?

91
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,370
It's, uh...

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,250
It's what partners do.

93
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,849
They watch out for each other.

94
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,539
If I may attempt a colloquialism

95
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,990
Of my own...

96
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,330
Thanks, "brosef."

97
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,799
That's the last time you pull a stunt like that.

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,709
Do you understand?

99
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,949
We had a deal.

100
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,129
You run all of this.

101
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,609
I'm in charge of the car.

102
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,509
Sarah, make sure kitt's okay.

103
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,749
Running a complete diagnostic now.

104
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,680
So who was I chasing, motorcycle ninjas?

105
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,339
And what the hell happened in that truck?

106
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,979
The voltage on the emp was set too high.

107
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,439
That's all.

108
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,580
Then kitt just killed three men.

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,989
Why not just tell him the truth?

110
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,309
I'm busy, charles.

111
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,199
I don't like you blaming kitt for this.

112
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,210
This was not the emp.

113
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,209
This is the arrow virus.

114
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,719
Arrow has been out of the lab

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,039
Since the army bought him out.

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
Alex, listen to me.

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,239
Now, a nano-virus infects technology

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,399
Just like an organic virus infects people.

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,769
Anything that has a chip in it.

120
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,819
A processor of any kind at all.

121
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,979
Like televisions, or cell phones, or a computer?

122
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,749
Right, and almost everything electronic

123
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,759
Has some sort of microprocessor in it.

124
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,189
And the virus hones in on that processor and feeds on it.

125
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,659
So instead of spreading through the air

126
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,209
Via a cough or a sneeze,

127
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,469
It spreads through metal.

128
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,159
And if there's no metal, it stops.

129
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,879
Right, and it appears to burn itself out

130
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,989
If it doesn't have anything metallic to conduct it.

131
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,980
But the truck--

132
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,979
Now, the truck was surrounded by asphalt

133
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,389
And other organic material,

134
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,809
So the virus stopped there.

135
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,149
What about the harley?

136
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,299
It could be a carrier.

137
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,539
But what if it's not even infected?

138
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,379
Look, that bike could destroy everything electronic

139
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,169
Within a 500-mile radius in a matter of hours.

140
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,809
And if it uploads itself

141
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,769
Through the phones or the power lines,

142
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,789
Theoretically it could use the internet as a host

143
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,459
To create an epidemic.

144
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,539
Theoretically.

145
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,099
That damn thing gets online, we will have

146
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,079
A worldwide disaster on our hands

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,830
In a matter of days.

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,680
Go find that harley, charles.

149
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,499
Right.

150
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,069
Why'd you pass me a note to meet in the hall?

151
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,080
You're not gonna get weird on me again--

152
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,960
Act normal.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,939
You act normal.

154
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,879
I know what killed those men in the back of that truck.

155
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,259
It's a virus.

156
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,739
What kind of virus does that?

157
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,280
A nano-virus.

158
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,729
What if mike has it? No, no.

159
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,389
The virus only infects technology, not people.

160
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,869
Okay, that's not possible.

161
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,580
Not only is it possible,

162
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,269
I think it's spreading.

163
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,839
Okay, if it doesn't infect people,

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,999
Why were the bikers in the truck all dead?

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,839
Because they were wearing chain mail.

166
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,979
The virus spreads

167
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,999
Through metal.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,549
It has properties like acid when it moves.

169
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,019
It burned right through their bodies.

170
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,610
How do you know this?

171
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,099
There's rumors that the pentagon

172
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,329
Has been developing a tech virus for years.

173
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,689
It's ours?

174
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,099
I think so.

175
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,409
We've gotta tell torres.

176
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

177
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,050
Torres already knows.

178
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,620
But he blamed it on kitt.

179
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,619
It's not cool to blame kitt.

180
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,550
Haven't you noticed torres getting more secretive lately?

181
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,389
I overheard him on the phone the other day.

182
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,870
You mean you eavesdropped?

183
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,539
You have to swear not to say anything to anybody.

184
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,189
Who am I gonna tell? Swear!

185
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,539
Okay, I swear.

186
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,419
He was talking about karr.

187
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,110
Karr? Shh!

188
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,890
Come on.

189
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,439
Karr doesn't even exist.

190
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,819
That's what they want us to believe.

191
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,790
Karr lives.

192
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,049
I don't care what torres says, it wasn't the emp.

193
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,169
And I don't wanna just sit here

194
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,820
With my thumb up my--

195
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,869
So I'm having a threesome tonight

196
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,840
With zoe and torres.

197
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,759
Do you wanna make it four?

198
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,130
Okay.

199
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,340
Earth to sarah.

200
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,670
Hello?

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,819
What happened on that truck...

202
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,860
It's some sort of virus.

203
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,649
I've seen something similar before,

204
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,950
But only in a lab.

205
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,469
Kitt? Yes, sarah?

206
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,679
Show us a map of where the truck was hijacked.

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,250
I've got a hunch

208
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,330
Show all possible escape routes.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,609
Now show a radius indicating the maximum distance

210
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,149
A '79 shovelhead could travel

211
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,749
On one tank of fuel. One tank?

212
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,279
Why couldn't he stop for gas?

213
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,179
Assuming the bike's carrying the virus,

214
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,510
When he stops, all hell's gonna break loose.

215
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
Kitt, overlay all gas stations.

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,449
Your hunch, kitt. Where's the bike headed?

217
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,009
A hunch is defined as an intuitive reckoning.

218
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,039
I don't do hunches, michael.

219
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,229
Okay, then calculate a probability profile.

220
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,049
That is within my parameters.

221
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,649
There is a 75% chance the motorcycle

222
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,680
Is headed south on state route 85.

223
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,519
How did they know the virus was in the truck?

224
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,289
Maybe they didn't.

225
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,659
I mean, it's unlikely,

226
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,719
But it coulda been a random hijacking.

227
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,349
No, they must have been tipped off.

228
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,449
Of a hunch, I have formulated

229
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,609
An interactive evolutionary algorithm

230
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,229
Designed to determine the harley's initial escape route

231
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,430
And subsequent destination.

232
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,619
Billy, monitor all gas stations fanning out

233
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,389
300 miles south of the hijack area.

234
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,590
Monitor for what? You'll know it when you see it.

235
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,199
I believe sarah's hunch to be right.

236
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,399
Whomever is riding that harley

237
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,789
Knew exactly where that truck would be and when.

238
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,990
Oh, I see.

239
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,039
So it's okay when sarah has hunches?

240
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
Sarah is a genius, michael.

241
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,249
Who authorized kitt's departure?

242
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,149
I did.

243
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,289
Mike, you know that thing you were talking about

244
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,499
That seems impossible?

245
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,220
I think this is probably it.

246
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,680
Didn't move that fast before.

247
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,979
Whoa, did you see it jump there?

248
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,299
It's mutating.

249
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,259
Mike, are you seeing this?

250
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,329
Still think it's an overcranked emp?

251
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,409
It's a nano-virus.

252
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,029
It infects everything electronic,

253
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,329
And it spreads through metal.

254
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,369
Yeah, we know.

255
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,829
The only good news here is that humans

256
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,919
Appear to be completely immune.

257
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,079
Unless you're using a pacemaker,

258
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,180
Or a titanium hip,

259
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,380
Or steel plate in your head.

260
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,510
You have to find that harley.

261
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,729
We're already on it.

262
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,430
Intercept in three minutes.

263
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,429
How did you--

264
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,609
Kitt had a hunch.

265
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,129
I appreciate the credit, michael.

266
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,199
But it wasn't a hunch.

267
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,210
Initiating transfomation

268
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,459
Kitt, make certain your shields are up

269
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,099
When you approach the convenience store.

270
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,909
You sure it'll keep him from getting infected?

271
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,999
Yeah, these shields are designed to hermetically seal

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,759
The entire car, so they'll hold.

273
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,870
But Sarah and mine they may reduce Kitt's evidule

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,669
I pinged the convenience store's modem.

275
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,629
All it's got is an old dial-up connection.

276
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,339
Mike,

277
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,529
You've gotta find the phone line

278
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,029
Before the virus gets to the internet.

279
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,889
I suggest you remove your earwig,

280
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,060
And your watch, and your cell phone.

281
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,139
Oh, my god! What's happening?

282
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,139
Whoa, do you work here? Uh, yeah.

283
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,449
You got a phone inside? What?

284
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,859
Phone. No.

285
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,309
Just that one there.

286
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,070
Might wanna hide behind the building.

287
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,969
Dude, your car's glowing.

288
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,679
Michael, there is not much time.

289
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,139
Dude, your car's talking!

290
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,630
Dude, duck.

291
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,310
Kitt, take out the pay phone.

292
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,880
We have containment.

293
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,119
It appears we have overlooked something, michael.

294
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,029
What's that?

295
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,579
It seems the harley we are pursuing

296
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,019
Is spreading the virus

297
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,830
But is not affected by it.

298
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,649
Shoulda noticed it sooner.

299
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,399
See?

300
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,340
Now I've got your back, michael.

301
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,749
Okay, partner.

302
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,570
Thanks, brosef.

303
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,409
Come on, dad, we both know where

304
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,699
This virus came from.

305
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,619
Ryan arrow's fallen off the planet

306
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,839
Since he sold out to the defense department.

307
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,249
He was a research assistant. They'll see you.

308
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,230
I think he'd rather see you.

309
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,829
Mike know about you and ryan?

310
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,690
Mike and I are just friends.

311
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,709
Friends?

312
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,289
That what they're calling it these days?

313
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,840
Dad, eww.

314
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,870
Mike?

315
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,400
Yeah, billy?

316
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,710
I think I found your harley.

317
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,470
I'm on my way.

318
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,769
Nice move.

319
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,180
Thank you, michael.

320
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,709
Get shields up.

321
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,869
Engaging shields. Michael?

322
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,669
Yes, kitt?

323
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,999
There is an access road 200 yards ahead.

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,650
You could say I have a hunch he'll take it.

325
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,960
Diverting to access road.

326
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,839
The shields are interfering with my ability to give chase

327
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,819
On this terrain.

328
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,999
Drop your shields. We can't lose him.

329
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,430
But michael, there is a danger of infection.

330
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,220
He's trying to spread it to the power grid.

331
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,200
The virus is spreading.

332
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,069
Kitt, stop.

333
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,559
There is a danger of infection.

334
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,090
Now!

335
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,720
Arm plasma pulse.

336
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,280
Activate inpulse

337
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,669
Right where you said he'd be.

338
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,299
Old habits die hard.

339
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,619
Ryan.

340
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,769
Good to see you.

341
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,090
Listen, a virus-- doc.

342
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,920
I know why you're here.

343
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,310
You owe me a dance.

344
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,360
When we broke up--

345
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,730
When you broke up with me.

346
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,810
We were supposed to go dancing.

347
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,860
That's why you owe me one.

348
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,800
Something different about you.

349
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,110
A confidence.

350
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,670
You look the same.

351
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,360
Is that a good thing...

352
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,400
Or a bad thing?

353
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,340
It's good.

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,510
Very good.

355
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,329
Try sarah again.

356
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,819
She is not responding, but billy has updated me

357
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,039
On her mission status.

358
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,029
Where is she?

359
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,800
A drinking establishment called "the well."

360
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,859
A bar?

361
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,039
Sarah and dr. Graiman

362
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,769
Are attempting to track down a former colleague.

363
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,480
Dr. Ryan arrow.

364
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
Gimme a bio on this poindexter.

365
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,370
What is a "poindexter"?

366
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,289
A geek, a nerd, a dweeb.

367
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,019
Ryan arrow, magna cum laude, stanford.

368
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,419
Phd, particle physics, m.I.T.,

369
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,109
Phd, electrical engineering, cal tech.

370
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,889
He was dr. Graiman's research assistant for two years.

371
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,549
Concentrating on the theoretical

372
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,019
Molecular structures of silicon-based nano-organisms.

373
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,809
Egghead.

374
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,749
Olympic hopeful in the decathlon.

375
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,329
Spent one year as a fashion model in milan.

376
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,429
Also, he and sarah dated for a while

377
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,569
Two years ago.

378
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,789
I'm searching for exact dates.

379
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,999
Never mind the exact dates.

380
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,749
Just give me telemetry on sarah right now.

381
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,119
Coming up on screen.

382
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,549
I show unusually high levels of serotonin and adrenaline.

383
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,009
And she appears to be engaged

384
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,350
In some sort of physical activity.

385
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,560
Charles graiman always did love his alternative rock.

386
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,699
Your father said something about a nano-virus.

387
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,270
Your nano-virus.

388
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,650
It's loose.

389
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,929
First of all, it isn't my virus.

390
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,919
I sold it to the military so they could screw it up

391
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,409
Like they do everything else.

392
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,589
And second, it's harmless.

393
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,129
No, it's not harmless. It's mutating.

394
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,309
And we need your help.

395
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,640
Who's "we"?

396
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,950
Working for the man now, aren't you?

397
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,299
Yeah, I heard something about alex torres

398
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,129
And some secret project.

399
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,850
It's kitt, isn't it?

400
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,309
I'd tell you,

401
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,270
But then I'd have to kill you.

402
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
You remember big sur?

403
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,120
We didn't get out of bed for three days.

404
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,380
You were drunk.

405
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,780
We should never have broken up.

406
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,770
Tell you what.

407
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,560
Go out with me again.

408
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,800
I'll help you track down the nano-virus.

409
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,690
Ryan, it's not that sim--

410
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,740
I'm serious. We could start over.

412
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,829
You spilled my drink.Hey.

413
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,269
I'm sorry. I'll buy you another.

414
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,549
You gonna buy me another shirt too?

415
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,729
Someone should. Sarah.

416
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,619
Just tell the bartender,

417
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,329
Whatever you want.

418
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,139
What I want is for you to keep

419
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,980
Your little girlie here...

420
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,599
In line.

421
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,059
What did you just say? Girlie.

422
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,580
Maybe we should--

423
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,619
Sarah's heart rate is extremely high.

424
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,979
She might be in trouble.

425
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,590
Go, go, go, go.

426
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,410
I hate it when people call me "girlie."

427
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,200
"girlie" was a little ill-conceived.

428
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, hey, mike. Uh, you want a beer?

429
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,429
Michael?

430
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,110
Is everything okay?

431
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,780
Everything's fine.

432
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,439
Kitt, aimez-vous votre travail?

433
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,409
Oui, c'est tres gratifiant,

434
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,880
Autant pour les personnes que le travail.

435
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,729
You really went out with "le douche" over here?

436
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,859
How come you never mentioned him?

437
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,939
Because you disappeared off the face of the earth

438
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,529
For three years, remember?

439
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,209
The whole "i thought you were dead" thing?

440
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,709
Okay, good point.

441
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,720
And not that it's any of your business,

442
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,879
But I didn't sleep with him last night.

443
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,040
I know. I sat up all night watching him.

444
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,909
Merveilleux.

445
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,749
Kitt, you are marvelous.

446
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,309
Merci, dr. Arrow.

447
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,979
Are we just supposed to let anyone talk

448
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,550
To the talking car?

449
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,220
It's okay.

450
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,999
Ryan's a friend.

451
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,319
And his responses.

452
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
Not just simplistic "yes" or "no,"

453
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,839
But rich, thoughtful, complex answers.

454
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,959
Kitt's current capabilities go far beyond

455
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,429
The original prototype you saw.

456
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,469
Well, the detail evident in his chip matrix

457
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,080
Is spectacular.

458
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,060
The car part's not bad either.

459
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,799
You've done it, doc.

460
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,730
You created functioning artificial intelligence.

461
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,670
Payroll reports.

462
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,489
Ryan arrow's been on the defense department payroll

463
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,449
For the last five years.

464
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,519
Where did you get this?

465
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,729
From a very hot guy at the pentagon.

466
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,290
Shred 'em when you're done.

467
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,050
Get mike on the chatline.

468
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,950
Designed the original virus to clean up toxic waste.

469
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,979
Literally eats heavy metals and then craps out

470
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,910
Harmless organic matter.

471
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,739
Not anymore.

472
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,759
That's because they turned it into something else.

473
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,610
Something I never intended.

474
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,099
You act like someone stole your baby.

475
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,829
You sold it to the military, remember?

476
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,239
You're not a scientist.

477
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,849
You wouldn't understand.

478
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,970
You're right. I have a life.

479
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,020
We need your help.

480
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,269
I have no idea how to stop that virus.

481
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,809
Even if I did, why should i?

482
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,109
Serves them right.

483
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,790
Then we're wasting our time here.

484
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,059
Mike, are you alone?

485
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,710
I'm gonna get ready to go.

486
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,839
Go ahead, carrie.

487
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,939
Is arrow any help?

488
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,349
He says he knows nothing about the virus

489
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,879
Since he sold out five years ago.

490
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,319
Then why is he still on the d.O.D. Payroll?

491
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,360
He must still be working for them.

492
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,179
Kitt, show me blueprints of the house.

493
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,479
Michael, may I ask you a personal question?

494
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,439
Shoot.

495
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,569
I've never really seen you act this way before.

496
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,189
Are you threatened in some way by dr. Arrow?

497
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,719
You think I'm jealous of sarah and arrow?

498
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,279
Your behavior is consistent with the human emotion

499
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,699
Called jealousy.

500
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,940
I'm just concerned dr. Arrow's not telling us the whole truth.

501
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,019
And, yes, I'm jealous.

502
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,119
What's this?

503
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,039
There is an additional room beneath the main house.

504
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
The entry door is on the deck.

505
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,599
You mean a basement?

506
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,069
It is lead-lined and is too deeply buried

507
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,529
For my infrared sensors to penetrate.

508
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,620
Sounds like a good place to hide something.

509
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,359
Why don't you tell us what you're hiding?

510
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,839
Whoa, whoa! Mike, what is wrong with you?

511
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,209
I think your jarhead boyfriend wants to kick my ass.

512
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,229
First of all, genius,

513
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,079
Jarhead's a marine.

514
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,089
I'm army all the way.

515
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,289
Yeah, well, they only paid me.

516
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,060
Looks like they branded you.

517
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,419
I don't work for any "they."

518
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,250
Yeah, just keep telling yourself that.

519
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,059
I'm not the one still on the government's payroll.

520
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,050
You're still collecting a check.

521
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,820
Is this true?

522
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,929
I might be giving up 100 iq points here,

523
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,739
But how come I'm the only one who knows

524
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,470
You have a trap door... Hidden under your rug?

525
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,529
Ryan, what's going on?

526
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,520
Why'd you let the virus go?

527
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,510
'cause I'm a better scientist than I am a thief.

528
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,270
I screwed the whole thing up.

529
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,570
Impressive.

530
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,679
D.I.A. Came to me and asked me to mutate

531
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,019
My harmless little nano-virus.

532
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,589
Yeah, they just came and took it from you.

533
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,529
They didn't come with guns. They came with a checkbook.

534
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,620
I said yes on the seventh zero.

535
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,189
You all think you're part of this fantastic

536
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,280
Little egalitarian experiment.

537
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,419
Mark my words.

538
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,409
They'll find a way to take it all away from you.

539
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,570
That's why you tried to hijack the big rig.

540
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,289
It was you?

541
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,939
I knew they were transporting the virus.

542
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,640
I tried to take it back.

543
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,329
It's my one chance to put the genie back in the bottle.

544
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,619
But the bottle broke

545
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,360
And three men died.

546
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,730
And now it's too late.

547
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,470
Mike, sarah, charles, do you copy?

548
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,980
They must be out of range.

549
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,120
Kitt, scan the house.

550
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,759
The house is empty, mr. Torres.

551
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,819
Are you certain?

552
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,030
I am certain.

553
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,969
I detect the presence of the nano-virus

554
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,990
And a high-speed internet connection.

555
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,409
It's my recommendation that we take out the virus

556
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,019
And the means to spread it now.

557
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,919
Agreed.

558
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,969
We take out the compound and let it

559
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,430
Burn itself out.

560
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm proceeding to optimum firing position.

561
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,939
Kitt, load your missiles.

562
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,679
Warheads armed.

563
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,659
Fire when ready.

564
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,899
There is a way we can synthesize a vaccine.

565
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,160
Show me.

566
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,490
Missiles fully operational.

567
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,469
Kitt, what are you doing?

568
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,649
All clear.

569
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,029
No, not all clear!

570
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,779
Do not fire, kitt! Do not fire!

571
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,209
Oh, my god! They're in the house!

572
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,360
Kitt, abort, abort! Do not fire!

573
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,219
Ryan! No, I've gotta get the antivirus!

574
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,139
There's not enough time.

575
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,270
Firing two missiles as directed.

576
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,050
Ryan?

577
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,979
How could this have happened?

578
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,569
Maybe because they were underground,

579
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,979
Kitt couldn't see them and mike couldn't hear kitt

580
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,379
Because his ear wig was jammed.

581
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,319
Still doesn't explain why kitt fired the missiles

582
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,749
After he gave the order to abort.

583
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,149
Maybe he caught the virus. Maybe he's sick.

584
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,559
No, I've run a remote scan of all kitt's systems.

585
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,009
Everything comes back normal.

586
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,799
Have sarah and dr. Graiman run a complete diagnostic.

587
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,709
What are they doing?

588
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,159
Their helicopter lands in ten minutes.

589
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,810
Mike will be back with kitt in under an hour.

590
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,619
You are being

591
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,280
Uncharacteristically silent, michael.

592
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,660
I don't feel much like talking today.

593
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,579
Would you like to hear some music, partner?

594
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,839
Turn it off.

595
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,470
I am sorry, michael.

596
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,069
What part of "abort, abort" did you not understand?

597
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,689
I've thoroughly examined my memory unit.

598
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,259
I have no record of a transmission from you

599
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,409
Or the ssc.

600
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,089
You sure you don't have the virus?

601
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,619
Run another self-diagnostic.

602
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,039
I have repeated the test several times.

603
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,259
All of my systems

604
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,070
Are functioning normally.

605
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,369
Your screens are out, your lights are flickering,

606
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,619
What else could it be?

607
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,329
A short occurred when the missiles were fired.

608
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,150
I'm certain it's nothing serious.

609
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,830
I forget sometimes that you're not a person.

610
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,749
That you're just a machine.

611
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,609
I believe I am feeling what you would call regret

612
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,330
For causing dr. Arrow's death.

613
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,580
You're sorry about what you did.

614
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,020
But you don't have any feelings

615
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,919
Only people have feelings.

616
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,449
Of course, michael.

617
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,089
It was just a theory.

618
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,630
Chamber doors open

619
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,360
Decontamination complete.

620
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,740
Secondary robot cleared him. Kitt's okay.

621
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,099
We have to consider decommissioning kitt.

622
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,329
At least for a while.

623
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,379
Is that really necessary, charles?

624
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,690
You didn't have two missiles fired at you.

625
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,350
Doctor?

626
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,569
Well, kitt's primary guiding principle

627
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,290
Is that he do no harm to people.

628
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,219
And it's built in.

629
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,340
Literally hardwired into his core memory.

630
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,580
Now this sorta thing should never happen.

631
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,850
I'm afraid something's gone terribly wrong.

632
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,600
Sarah.

633
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,020
Do you agree?

634
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,530
Ryan arrow died for no reason today.

635
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,070
I'll call washington.

636
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,869
It's the virus. We're infected.

637
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,489
Security bypass.

638
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,200
Emergency procedures in effect.

639
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,229
We're infected! Initiate full quarantine!

640
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,029
Billy!

641
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,289
We gotta contain the virus!

642
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,370
Cut all connection to the internet!

643
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,030
It's not responding!

644
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,150
Oh, my god.

645
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,839
We've brought the virus in with us.

646
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,789
It's everywhere.

647
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,110
I can't get him to turn. Help me.

648
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,440
I can't cut our connection to the web.

649
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, ah!

650
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,719
Oh, come on! I just got that.

651
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,719
Why--

652
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,039
Kitt, how you feeling?

653
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,549
Sick, michael.

654
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,970
Really sick.

655
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,189
Is he drivable?

656
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,639
I think so, but it could

657
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,189
Damage him beyond repair. Why?

658
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,110
Another hunch. Get in.

659
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,609
We could spread the virus.

660
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,180
If we don't go, he dies.

661
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,530
Chamber doors open

662
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,279
Strap in.

663
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,090
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

664
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,169
Why did it take so long to infect him?

665
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,460
Ultra high-density carbon fiber.

666
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,919
His non-metallic parts protected his metal parts

667
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,070
From catching the virus for a long time.

668
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,209
He's fighting me.

669
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,379
Billy, status!

670
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,189
Virus has spread to levels three through six.

671
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,349
It's moving much faster now.

672
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,820
It's getting smarter.

673
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,689
It's using kitt's

674
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,529
Artificial intelligence to replicate itself.

675
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,950
Can't be stopped.

676
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,299
Kitt, can you hear me?

677
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,989
Sarah, is that you?

678
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,400
I'm here, kitt.

679
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,969
You've gotta let mike drive.

680
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,749
I killed ryan arrow.

681
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,610
I am very sorry.

682
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,589
We gotta distract him.

683
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,299
Kitt, can you calculate the value of pi

684
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,419
To its last digit?

685
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,909
Come on, girlie, you know that's impossible.

686
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,389
Pi is an irrational number,

687
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,770
Which means that it cannot be expressed as a fraction.

688
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,480
I said distract him, not get us killed.

689
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,339
I estimate we lose total control in 15 minutes.

690
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,059
Mike, sarah?

691
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,859
I recommend full evacuation

692
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,260
And initiation of the self-destruct sequence.

693
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,240
Destroy the ssc and let the virus burn itself out.

694
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,909
It's the only way.

695
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,119
It takes two of us.

696
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,920
Billy, begin a complete evacuation.

697
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,170
Total sci-fi moment.

698
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,870
Three, two, one, mark.

699
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,060
Self-destruct sequence commenced.

700
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,590
How did you--

701
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,859
This is what arrow was heading for

702
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,169
When kitt fired the missiles.

703
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,539
The bike's immune, but I don't think

704
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,110
It's because it's old.

705
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,720
What the--

706
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,129
It's running some sort of antivirus.

707
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,599
Can't you use it to immunize kitt?

708
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,189
You mean like synthesizing a vaccine

709
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,250
From the antibody rich blood of a healthy human?

710
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,319
Yeah, that or whatever.

711
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,529
Mike, didn't you ever pay attention in science class?

712
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,609
Not really. First, I need root access to the source code,

713
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,369
Then a detailed schematic, and of course,

714
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,209
A benign host in which

715
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,550
To transport... The antidote.

716
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,289
You know, I guess it is possible.

717
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:11,899
Great.

718
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,530
Download it.

719
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,759
It's a little ironic, don't you think?

720
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,449
That we end up the architects of our own undoing?

721
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,389
Evacuation in progress.

722
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,410
I'm not much for irony, charles.

723
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,100
I can't. It's encrypted.

724
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,530
All other levels have been evacuated.

725
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,220
We're all that's left.

726
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,920
Get outta here, billy.

727
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,649
It's an order.

728
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,679
Three minutes.

729
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,369
Ability to reach safe distance

730
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,609
May be compromised.

731
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,649
Dad, ryan put an antivirus program

732
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,629
Into the harley, but it's password protected.

733
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,310
How strong is the encryption?

734
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,049
512 bit.

735
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,219
Even if we had a supercomputer,

736
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,649
It would take days to unravel.

737
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,979
If only kitt were able to--

738
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,279
That's not an option right now.

739
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,649
What's that sound?

740
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,050
Self-destruct.

741
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,820
Two minutes to self-destruct.

742
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,709
I did not intend

743
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,069
To kill dr. Arrow.

744
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,660
It wasn't your fault, kitt.

745
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,889
You were sick.

746
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,979
Michael, sarah, I am afraid.

747
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,889
It's okay, kitt. We're right here with you.

748
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,710
I don't want to die.

749
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,600
We can't wait any longer, charles.

750
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,659
It's no use!

751
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,369
Ryan could have made

752
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,460
The password an infinite number of things.

753
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,720
He could have, but I don't think he did.

754
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,040
Michael, sarah...

755
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,900
Good-bye.

756
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,060
Michael?

757
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
He's alive!

758
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,160
Of course he's alive.

759
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,819
Dad, it worked.

760
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,569
Sarah, we can barely hear you!

761
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,859
Say again!

762
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,199
I uploaded the antivirus into the ssc's

763
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,529
Core operating system.

764
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,290
Cancel the destruct sequence.

765
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,949
Alex, it looks the virus are retreating. What's going on

766
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,429
Sarah reversed it.

767
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,529
Can you get back in here?

768
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,780
17, 16, 15, 14,

769
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,559
13, 12, 11,

770
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,970
Ten, nine, eight--

771
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,479
It's not working!

772
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,649
Six, five--

773
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,790
Four, three.

774
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,300
Piece of cake.

775
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,800
Identities confirmed. Self-destruct aborded

776
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,440
You don't think kitt was really feeling emotions, do you?

777
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,989
I'm sure it was just an anomaly

778
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,690
Brought on by the virus.

779
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,430
I'm sorry about ryan.

780
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,520
You would have liked him if you'd gotten to know him.

781
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,510
I'm sure I would have.

782
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,750
You gonna be okay?

783
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,429
Yeah, I'll be all right.

784
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,479
What about you, kitt?

785
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,379
You okay?

786
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,039
Core systems fully operable.

787
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,849
Tire pressure, compression, fuel system, normal.

788
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,939
Exoskeleton 99.72% healed.

789
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,240
He's fine.

790
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,700
Let's go home.
