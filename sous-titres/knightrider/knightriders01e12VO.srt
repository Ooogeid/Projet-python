1
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,630
Can I get another?

2
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,030
You're a great dancer.

3
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,060
A professional?

4
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,360
I am a professional.

5
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,830
How did you know?

6
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,500
Really?

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,730
Well, that might be the best thing i've heard all day.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,430
Well, it's gonna be the last thing you hear from me.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,260
So why don't you pick up your knuckles

10
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,700
And go drool somewhere else?

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,630
Attitude.

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,860
I love it.

13
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,660
You know, you and I could really

14
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,400
do some damage together, sweetheart.

15
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,760
Yeah?

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,900
Well, you're half right.

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,800
Hey, I'm gonna need two bouncers

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,600
and could you call a cab and have it ready

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,960
to go to the hospital?

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,360
Oh! I'm in love.

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,460
And would you mind throwing some ice

22
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,600
into a plastic bag for me?

23
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,760
- No problem.  - Thanks.

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm gonna ask you to leave one more time.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,100
Come on.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,360
You know you want it.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,360
Come on, baby. Let's get outta here.

28
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,630
- You ice.  - Thanks.

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,160
He's gonna need this.

30
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,400
I see you're dealing with things in a healthy fashion.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,900
Is there a bar you haven't gotten into a fight in?

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,300
You just can't take no for an answer, can you?

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
Good to see you too.

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,300
Don't start with me, Mike.

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
You shouldn't even be here.

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,660
That went will.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,860
Hey, detente, okay?

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,300
Can we start over?

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,360
Why are you here?

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,860
Well, you just kinda disappeared after your father's service.

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,460
Excuse me for being a little worried about you.

42
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,130
Really?

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,500
Worried about me in Hawaii? In my father's beach house?

44
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,030
He's really gone.

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,700
I miss him too, Sarah.

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,930
It's okay to let go.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,960
But this isn't gonna help anything.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't tell me what to do.

49
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Sarah.

50
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,060
Please, Mike.

51
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,430
I don't wanna be alone tonight.

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,030
How we doing with the chip?

53
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Relax.

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,330
We're almost there.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Mr. Torres, you cannot do this.

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,060
Dr. Graiman would never approve.

57
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,730
Graiman's not here anymore, Kitt.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
If you remove my chip, there is no

59
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,600
guarantee I can be reactivated.

60
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,960
Pull it.

61
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,030
Please, Mr. Torres.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,930
There it is.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,660
All of Kitt's personality.

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,200
His memories.

65
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,930
The most advanced artificial intelligence program

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,960
In the world.

67
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,230
With that in Karr...

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,930
It might well be the future.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
Yes, it might.

70
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,900
Get it out of here.

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,900
Come on, Mike. Pick up.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,160
Where the hell are you?

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
I can't believe this. I can't believe this.

74
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,130
Just calm down and tell us what happened.

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,160
They took Kitt, okay?

76
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,330
Who did, Billy?

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,330
It was Torres

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,530
And a ton of NSA guys.

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,730
He totally betrayed us.

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,360
And he was talking about the Karr project.

81
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,130
As in knight automated roving robot.

82
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,700
I mean, I didn't even know that project was real.

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,300
Are you sure he said, "Karr"?

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,700
He shut us down, Mike.

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,800
The SSC is over. History.

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,500
They took the A.I. chip out of Kitt

87
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
And scrapped the program.

88
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,360
I mean, they took my cell phone, for god's sake.

89
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,600
My father was the program.

90
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,830
Of course they shut it down.

91
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Don't listen to her, Billy.

92
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,530
She hasn't had her morning pitcher

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,160
of mojitos yet.

94
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,900
Also, I found a package in Graiman's office

95
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,560
Addressed to the both of you.

96
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,660
I managed to get it out before the NSA

97
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,760
had their garage sale.

98
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,760
I sent it overnight.

99
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,930
Yeah, it's here.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,230
We'll take a look and get back to you.

101
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,530
You ready to look at this?

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,160
I'm getting dressed.

103
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,760
Hello, Mike.

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,060
If you're looking at this, 

105
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,930
It means I'm gone and there are some things

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,030
you need to know.

107
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,430
First of all, your past.

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
You were used as an experiment.

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,130
You were the original driver for the Karr project.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,430
Now there was a fatal flaw in Karr's A.I.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,100
Which made him uncontrollable and extremely aggressive.

112
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,330
He reprogrammed himself. People died.

113
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,560
After the program was scrapped, 

114
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,800
it was decided that your memory be wiped.

115
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,960
They said it was for your own protection

116
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,360
that you must never know.

117
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,000
But still, I should have told you the truth, Mike.

118
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,560
You're like a son to me.

119
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,630
And I hope someday you'll find a way to forgive me.

120
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,630
Kitt was developed in the wake of the Karr failure.

121
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,830
It was a means of perfecting the A.I.

122
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,700
With the ultimate goal of re-launching the Karr project.

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,260
I was the only one that stood in the way and that I'm gone, 

124
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm sure they'll be moving ahead very quickly.

125
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,030
This must never be allowed to happen.

126
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,500
Karr is a devastating weapon and only the beginning

127
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,930
they believe that Kitt's A.I. can override the flaws

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,130
in Karr's programming, but they're wrong.

129
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,830
This is a disaster waiting to happen.

130
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,060
Now you must protect Kitt's A.I. and stop Karr.

131
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,730
This is vital, Mike.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,230
I just hope I'm not too late.

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,830
They're going to re-launch the Karr program.

134
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
That's why they took Kitt. I'm going back.

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,060
I'm going to the beach.

136
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,560
Sarah, we have to stop this.

137
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,660
- Good luck with that.  - Sarah!

138
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,860
Mike, it is not my fight anymore.

139
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,430
When you're done feeling sorry for yourself, 

140
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,860
You let me know.

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,160
I'm coming back, Billy.

142
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,060
Get Zoe and I'll meet you someplace safe.

143
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,260
We got work to do.

144
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,930
This whole thing is totally out of control.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,630
They've been through our apartments, okay?

146
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm afraid to even go home.

147
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,660
I've hacked into the old sat streams.

148
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,900
Everything's already been re-coded.

149
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,800
Slow down. What does that mean?

150
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,960
It means we have no idea where they've taken Kitt

151
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,000
or how to find him.

152
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,360
All right, let's think about it.

153
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,100
- What would he do?  - Kitt?

154
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
He's a conscious being.

155
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,400
He would know he's getting shutdown, right?

156
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah.

157
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,900
Okay, then what would he do? How would he help us?

158
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,230
I don't know. It happened so fast.

159
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,760
They walked in.

160
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,400
He had maybe a minute before he went dark.

161
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,960
He would tried to get us a message.

162
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,500
Now I checked my email accounts. There was nothing there.

163
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,630
What about you guys?

164
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,060
The government can access our email.

165
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,460
That wouldn't be secure. Kitt would know that.

166
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,600
Okay, then what wouldn't they

167
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,630
be able to access?

168
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,230
How could he get us a message

169
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,630
that they wouldn't know about?

170
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,230
- Come on, think!  - I don't know.

171
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
- I don't know.  - I know Kitt.

172
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,130
He wouldn't go down without a fight.

173
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,430
He gets that from me.

174
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,160
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

175
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,760
The Jam Haus.

176
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,060
The what house?

177
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,760
It's where Kitt and I would share music files.

178
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,760
It's online.

179
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,860
I was using music to help Kitt

180
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,600
develop his A.I. Personality protocols.

181
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,930
Graiman loved the idea

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Because Kitt was learning about human behavior

183
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,600
from the perspective of musical narrative.

184
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,100
There it is.

185
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,030
A file sent from Kitt late yesterday, 

186
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,060
Literally seconds before he was shut down.

187
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,060
Read it.

188
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,330
It's a... it's a song.

189
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,900
Absurd, by Fluke.

190
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,900
Musical narrative, huh?

191
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
I thought you were talking about Mozart.

192
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,400
You know, the classics?

193
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,500
No.

194
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,900
Kitt likes classical, 

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,100
But deep down he's into trip-hop and rave.

196
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,100
What can I say?

197
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,130
The car's a groove machine.

198
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,060
Cool song, but where's the message?

199
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, maybe play it backwards?

200
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,230
It's not zeppelin.

201
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,260
Binary.

202
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,060
- What?  - Binary.

203
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,660
Zeros and ones. Kitt's first language.

204
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,560
If there's a message in there, it's in the code.

205
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,630
Break it down.

206
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,100
Check it out.

207
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,260
I did a comparison of Kitt's version of the song

208
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,800
and the original, and look.

209
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,560
There are anomalous sections of code, they don't fit.

210
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,300
They're out of sync with the song.

211
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,630
If we calculate a numerical value

212
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,130
- for the anomalous sections  - Exactly.

213
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
- Okay, what the hell are you guys talking about?  - Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba.

214
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,430
- A yield in numerical value of 2-3-2-3-2-3.  - Well, that's not so helpful.

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Wait, it's a pattern.

216
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Try it this way. 23-23-23, as three numbers.

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,860
Try it as a letter.

218
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,000
The 23rd letter of the alphabet is...

219
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,560
W.

220
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,730
Damn!

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,230
Bush stole Kitt!

222
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,600
No.

223
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,700
It's three W's.

224
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,200
W-W-W.

225
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,460
The world wide web.

226
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,500
Kitt's on the net.

227
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,330
- Is that possible?  - It is.

228
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,360
And considering he only had a few seconds, 

229
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,960
and the sheer volume of data that he had to dump, 

230
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,100
it would've been the only option he would've had.

231
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,200
How would that work?

232
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,300
He would've had to use data packets.

233
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,700
Millions of tiny bits of data

234
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,560
that he could scatter and embed in various websites.

235
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,330
Like cookies... you'd never know they were there, 

236
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,330
unless you were looking for them.

237
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,660
And we can retrieve them?

238
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,460
- If we can find them.  - I've got it.

239
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,360
www.michaelknight.org.

240
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,760
Hey, Kitt.

241
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,160
I knew you were out there somewhere.

242
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,500
Damn.

243
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
What's the matter?

244
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,360
It's like I thought, the files are ginormous.

245
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,900
I can't do this on my laptop.

246
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,000
I couldn't do this on a hundred laptops.

247
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,430
We're going to need some major computing power.

248
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,900
I know a place.

249
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
No way! No, no, no, no, no, no.

250
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,760
Oh, yeah.

251
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,260
Hello, Sarah.

252
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,960
I love you, my girl.

253
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,330
And I know you're grieving, but there's work to be done.

254
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,900
Now the two greatest creations

255
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,900
in my life are you and Kitt.

256
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,860
And now they're going to use Kitt for destructive ends.

257
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,600
And the thought that my legacy has come to this,

258
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,900
that my life's work will bring about the devastation,

259
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,160
that I'm sure will come if they're not stopped.

260
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,330
It's unbearable for me  to even contemplate.

261
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,560
But you, Sarah...  You're my legacy, too.

262
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,760
I need you to help me.

263
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,560
You must stop this evil.

264
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,760
Stop Karr.

265
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,160
Now Mike has information about this, 

266
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,030
Which I'm sure has made him very angry.

267
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,630
You need to help him, Sarah.

268
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,760
Look out for him.

269
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,360
I have every confidence in you.

270
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Some of my greatest memories

271
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,460
are working hard at my desk, 

272
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,600
while you would play in the office.

273
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,500
And to think that that little girl

274
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,100
has grown into the one woman that I would trust

275
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,430
to carry on my work.

276
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,830
The answers that I've found at that desk

277
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,530
are there for you now, Sarah.

278
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,630
I know you'll use them wisely.

279
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,430
The answers that I've found at that desk, 

280
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,900
Are there for you now, Sarah.

281
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,630
Oh...

282
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Won't we be under surveillance?

283
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,630
The SCC was the surveillance, 

284
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,860
Lucky for us, they shut the SCC down.

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,160
Fire in the hole.

286
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,460
Give me a hand with this.

287
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,300
- Holy...  - Crap.

288
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,500
Can't pull power off the grid, or they'll know we're here.

289
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,730
Let's get a back up,

290
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Genny going to see what we have to work with.

291
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,660
You got it.

292
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,060
Where are we on funding?

293
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,460
Spoke to our guys in Alexandria.

294
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,030
Their putting in an allocation through channels.

295
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,530
Channels?

296
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,460
The usual channels.

297
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,630
But DOD won't commit without a hard look.

298
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,060
We can do that.

299
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,130
How long?

300
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,830
Kitt's A.I is not plug and play.

301
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,860
We need to conform Kitt's applications with Karr's.

302
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,730
So we test in a week? A month?

303
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,600
Give me 24 hours.

304
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,900
Beginning of eternity?

305
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,800
I set up a wicked encryption program.

306
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,060
No one's going to know we're here.

307
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,130
Computers are rebooted.

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,630
We can start whenever Billy's ready.

309
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,900
How you doing on Kitt's new A.I chip?

310
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,460
It's one of the most sophisticated data chips

311
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,960
in the world.

312
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,260
And considering I'm working with radio shack leftovers, 

313
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,300
We're doing fine.

314
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,960
But it's going to work, right?

315
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,900
Yeah, I mean... It'll do something.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,930
Something?

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,060
We're flying by the seat of our pants here, man.

318
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,060
What does that mean?

319
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,200
We'll find out in a minute.

320
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,700
Ready to be reloaded.

321
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,830
Hopefully.

322
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,960
Hopefully.

323
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,030
Not going to give me anymore than that?

324
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
Nope. Awesome.

325
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,530
All right...

326
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,860
Let's do it.

327
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,260
Begin download.

328
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,300
Wow.

329
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,100
It's Kitt's life.

330
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,660
Flashing before our eyes.

331
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,730
His memories...

332
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,100
His personality...

333
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,460
Mike, it's Sarah.

334
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,830
When I say, "the beginning of eternity, "

335
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,360
does that mean anything to you?

336
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,400
In what context?

337
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,430
My father.

338
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,460
Doesn't mean anything.

339
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,860
Wait, isn't that a riddle?

340
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,730
Of course, he always to used ask me riddles

341
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,900
when I was a kid.

342
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,260
But how did it go?

343
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,400
Um... "I am the beginning of eternity, 

344
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,760
the end of every rhyme, 

345
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,100
the beginning of the end, 

346
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,100
and the end of every rhyme.

347
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
who am I?"

348
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,530
That's it. But what's the answer?

349
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,760
The beginning of eternity, the end of space and time, 

350
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,960
- The begin...  - I got it.

351
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,760
It's E. The letter e.

352
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I got to go.

353
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,500
W-wait, where are you?

354
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,630
Hello?

355
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,600
Something's not right.

356
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,560
There's so very much here that's not right.

357
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,730
That might be the understatement of the century.

358
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
No!

359
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,700
I did a cross reference. We're missing a packet.

360
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,860
Okay, where is it?

361
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm working on it.

362
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,400
You have got to be freaking kidding me!

363
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,460
- What?  - Not good.

364
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,960
Kitt's learned behavior

365
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,700
integrative algorithms packet has been downloaded

366
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,500
onto an XBOX Console Somewhere in Portland.

367
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,830
You're saying some kid in Oregon's got Kitt on his xbox?

368
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,160
That's what I'm saying.

369
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,500
His name is Cody Lundstrom. He's 11 years old.

370
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,760
Well, find him. Get it back.

371
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,260
I think you can handle an 11-year-old kid.

372
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,730
You can handle an 11-yeaold kid, can't you?

373
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,900
Accessing Sarah Graiman number current.

374
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,060
Transferring funds from Knight industries accounts.

375
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,930
Transferring funds from Flag accounts.

376
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,360
Transferring funds from Knight function accounts.

377
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,030
Uh, you're not gonna blow us up, are you?

378
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
When the agents raided the place, 

379
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,930
they took all our surveillance files.

380
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,860
But Graiman built in a fail-safe.

381
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,630
In case of attack or natural disaster, 

382
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,000
all data's backed up to the mainframe.

383
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,760
However, we no longer have the access code, 

384
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,260
So we'll have to get at it the old-fashioned way.

385
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,860
Hacker style.

386
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,730
Hi.

387
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,330
I'm from gamer freak magazine.

388
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm doing a story on xbox enthusiasts.

389
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,330
Your son's name was Randomly Drawn

390
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,930
From our xbox 360 live site

391
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,660
To be featured in an article.

392
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,100
These are all beta versions, 

393
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,230
Won't drop until Christmas.

394
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,500
They're all yours.

395
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,130
Free stuff?

396
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,960
Excellent.

397
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,030
We've been looking at footage

398
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,360
three days back from the raid, 

399
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,600
and I haven't seen anything.

400
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,160
You?

401
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,400
Wait a minute. Look.

402
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,830
Let me see if I can get another angle.

403
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,460
Well, that's kinda suspicious.

404
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,630
What's Torres doing holding a meeting in there?

405
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,960
He's being smart.

406
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,400
There's no audio in there.

407
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,100
Can we get audio in an adjacent area?

408
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,760
Maybe another mike picked him up.

409
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,660
If we got anything, maybe we can enhance it.

410
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,030
Program.

411
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,930
Charles Graiman is dead.

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,160
This is your call.

413
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,660
Wait, go back.

414
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,930
See what you can do with it.

415
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,160
I think it's time we shut down the Kitt program.

416
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,400
And move forward with Karr.

417
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,860
Graiman didn't think

418
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,630
the technology was ready.

419
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,460
Charles Graiman never supported the Karr program.

420
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,060
This is your call now.

421
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,560
We've waited long enough.

422
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,130
Shut it down.

423
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,960
Let's move on to the next phase.

424
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,060
Torres totally sold us out.

425
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,730
Can't say I'm surprised.

426
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,430
Run a facial recognition on the other guy.

427
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,030
We need to know who he is.

428
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,630
Don't bother.

429
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,730
His name is Jack Hurst, 

430
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,460
NSA.

431
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,800
Yeah, well, he's the guy

432
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,830
Torres told to shut us down.

433
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,130
Then he's the guy we need to talk to.

434
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,100
He can tell us what happened to Kitt.

435
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,900
It's good to have you back.

436
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,700
How'd you get in here anyway?

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,100
There's a secret emergency entrance.

438
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,000
You guys coulda called me, but I'm sure whatever you did

439
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,330
was just as easy.

440
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,760
So Kitt was developed

441
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,700
after the failure of the Karr project?

442
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,330
Kitt was designed to be a more compliant personality.

443
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,760
They'd perfect the AI in Kitt

444
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,960
and then apply it to Karr.

445
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,160
That's been the plan all along.

446
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,660
My father was trying to stop it all this time.

447
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,000
Something went very wrong with Karr.

448
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,730
He was uncontrollable.

449
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,130
And people were killed.

450
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,900
Oh, my god.

451
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,730
I was Karr's original driver, Sarah.

452
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,200
That's why I can't remember

453
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,200
they took my memory.

454
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,630
Mike.

455
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,800
And I'm not gonna let it happen again.

456
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,530
Zoe, what do you got?

457
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,260
I tapped into Hurst's secretary's iphone

458
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,500
and recovered his schedule.

459
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,700
He's having dinner tonight

460
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,060
at IL Padrone in Georgetown.

461
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,400
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

462
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,460
Jack.

463
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,730
- Sarah.  - Hi.

464
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,760
What brings you to D.C.?

465
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,230
I'm meeting a friend. How are you?

466
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,760
Great. Thank you.

467
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm so sorry hear about your father.

468
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,500
It was quite a tragedy.

469
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,760
He was a good man.

470
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,160
Yes, he was.

471
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,000
This nation has lost one of its brightest minds.

472
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,960
He'll be sorely missed.

473
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,130
I counted him as a good friend, you know?

474
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,330
He's always spoke about you with such great affection, Jack.

475
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,460
- It was good seeing you.  - Good to see you too, Sarah.

476
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,560
Yeah.

477
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,360
Again, my condolences. Thank you.

478
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,500
Take care.

479
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,030
Yes!

480
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,460
Totally smoked you!

481
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,800
I've got homework and stuff, you know.

482
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,030
We have to keep going.

483
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,460
We've got to retrieve the orb.

484
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,060
That's the coolest part.

485
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,460
Hey, I thought you were gonna interview me.

486
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,630
Oh, uh, no, this is it.

487
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,730
Your game play style

488
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,100
is the focus of my story, 

489
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,200
and I must say, very impressive.

490
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,060
Whatever.

491
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,530
Hey, can't we at least play madden or something?

492
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,660
I'm not really into this stuff.

493
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,660
It's so lame.

494
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,930
What are you, nuts?

495
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,200
The graphics are stellar, 

496
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,060
and the narrative complexity.

497
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,300
It's a totally immersive experience.

498
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,730
You need to get a life, dude.

499
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,360
You need to get a life.

500
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,600
There it is.

501
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,900
Yes!

502
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,300
Ahh!

503
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,430
That's it?

504
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,330
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

505
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,230
Not really.

506
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,360
Yeah, well, I should get going.

507
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,860
Great hanging with you, pal.

508
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,200
You're a beastly player. Bump it.

509
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,900
Whatever.

510
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,030
What a douche.

511
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,960
She shows up at a restaurant where I'm having dinner, huh?

512
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,660
Just days after this whole thing goes down.

513
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you think she knows anything?

514
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,300
That's Torres.

515
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,960
I don't know.

516
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,330
I just don't feel comfortable assuming it's a coincidence.

517
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,830
There's too many loose ends we've left out there.

518
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,200
That doesn't matter.

519
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,760
Even if she does know something, 

520
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,800
what could she do?

521
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,600
Still, it'd be safer

522
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
if we just tied them up.

523
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,600
How close are we?

524
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,630
Hours away.

525
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,660
Well, Michael Knight.

526
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,730
This is nice and tidy, 

527
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
home invasion gone bad.

528
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,960
Lower your gun.

529
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,600
Have a seat.

530
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,400
You're in way over your heads.

531
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,160
This is bigger than both of you.

532
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,660
Your opinion on our chances

533
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,500
really doesn't interest me.

534
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,000
We want to know where Kitt is.

535
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,060
You're never going to get Kitt back.

536
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,860
That's a big problem for you.

537
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,900
You can't stop this.

538
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,260
My father's dead.

539
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,700
Everything he's worked for you've stolen.

540
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Now, you will tell us where kitt is

541
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,560
or I'll put a hole in your chest.

542
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,660
Okay.

543
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,060
It doesn't matter anyway.

544
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,660
Where is he?

545
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,200
If you had a top secret weapons program

546
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,560
that no one could know about, 

547
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,700
that you had to be able to deny even existed.

548
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,030
Where would you keep it?

549
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,400
DARPA?

550
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,230
Skunk works?

551
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,800
Black box?

552
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,730
Any bells ringing?

553
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,100
Area 51.

554
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,260
No one calls it that anymore.

555
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,160
Nevada.

556
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,800
You know you're dead, 

557
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,600
Don't you?

558
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,760
Both of you.

559
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,530
You're dead.

560
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,800
Graiman put together

561
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,300
a pretty comprehensive collection of weaponry.

562
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
He used them in live-fire testing of Kitt's defenses.

563
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,430
This goes back to the early days of development.

564
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,630
I don't even think Torres knows this place exists.

565
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm going up against US Soldiers.

566
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,800
I need non-lethal options, Billy.

567
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,430
I think we got some toys you're gonna like.

568
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,200
What do you think?

569
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,860
Looks like Christmas morning.

570
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,100
Oh, yeah.

571
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,230
Military-grade taser, rapid recharge.

572
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,060
Flash grenades, temporarily blinds the enemy.

573
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,930
30-mil grenade launcher.

574
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,360
Modified munitions disperse hard rubber pellets.

575
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,130
Ouch.

576
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,100
And my personal favorite, 

577
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,930
Single-barrel 12 gauge shotgun, 

578
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,660
Non-lethal beanbag rounds.

579
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,860
Packs one hell of a punch.

580
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,560
Nice, Billy.

581
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,930
Really nice.

582
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,300
It might take a while

583
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
for Kitt to integrate the data

584
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,460
after the chip has been reinserted.

585
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,760
But it should all be there.

586
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,760
What do you mean "should"?

587
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,830
You're still not sure.

588
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,730
Of course he's not sure. It's not that simple, Rambo.

589
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,060
We think we got it.

590
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,500
But without the original to compare it to, 

591
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,730
there's no way we can be certain

592
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,230
we got the sequencing exactly right.

593
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,160
And what happens if you didn't get it exactly right?

594
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,230
Then it's just a bunch

595
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,900
of ones and zeros.

596
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,430
Not Kitt.

597
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,460
It's time.

598
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,260
Are you sure about this?

599
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,700
Going in alone?

600
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,860
They taught me everything I know.

601
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,200
They used me.

602
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,930
It's time I got a little payback.

603
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,530
Sarah, can you hear me?

604
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,730
We've got you, Mike.

605
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,330
I've got the compound in sight.

606
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,460
How you doing with eyes in the sky?

607
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,760
We're kinda slumming it here

608
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,600
without government satellite access.

609
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,600
I'm trying to page back on commercial systems.

610
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,800
It might be a little hit-and-miss, 

611
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,700
but we'll do our best.

612
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,030
I know you can do it, Billy, 

613
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,600
if anyone can.

614
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,500
I'll contact you when I'm in position.

615
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,630
He's got faith in you, Billy.

616
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,430
That's so sweet.

617
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,530
It was. You just ruined it.

618
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,760
I've got him, he's in.

619
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,100
Dammit. We lost the signal.

620
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,600
What else do we got up there? We gotta find another bird now.

621
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,000
Wow, the take charge attitude. I like it.

622
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,000
- Zoe.  - I'm on it.

623
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,930
Mike, we got him.

624
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
We were able to pick up the radiation signature

625
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,030
from Kitt's nano skin.

626
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,860
Point the way, Billy. You have a fix on me?

627
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,900
Yeah.

628
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,100
Kitt's in a warehouse building

629
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,500
about 600 yards due east of your position.

630
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,960
It's showtime.

631
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,100
Little help, Billy.

632
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,960
Keep heading back.

633
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,330
- Up ahead on the left you'll see a large crate.  - Got it

634
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,230
System reboot commencing.

635
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,060
Sir, the Knight Industry vehicle has just been taken.

636
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,930
We must stop them.

637
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,260
Karr, stop!

638
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,230
Kitt must be stopped.

639
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,060
No. Kitt is no longer important. You have everything you need.

640
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,600
Let him go. 

641
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,360
My analysis indicates that Kitt is a potential threat.

642
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,600
I will not allow

643
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,330
for the possibility of being shut down again.

644
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,330
I'm giving you a direct order. Stand down.

645
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,160
I take orders from my creator, Dr. Charles Graiman.

646
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,400
Graiman is dead. I'm next in command.

647
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,400
You take orders from me.

648
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,300
Your reasoning is correct.

649
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,460
You are, in fact, next in command.

650
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,360
I do take orders from you.

651
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,630
Karr!

652
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,030
Now, we are one. And I give the orders.

653
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,000
System reboot complete.

654
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,500
Kitt, is that you?

655
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,400
Yes, Michael. I knew you'd come after me.

656
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,400
Save the sentiment for later, buddy.

657
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,960
Michael, I will be unable

658
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,960
to access my weapons or transformation protocols

659
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,000
until the download of my data is complete.

660
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,130
How long will that take?

661
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,230
I am unable to calculate, 

662
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,230
as that application has not yet been restored.

663
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,600
Ask a stupid question.

664
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,730
Mike, you've gotta get outta there.

665
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,160
Why? What's going on?

666
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,330
Karr's coming after you.

667
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,130
Look, just try to outrun him and get home.

668
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,730
We'll figure out what to do about Karr later.

669
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,730
No.

670
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
They'll move him. Hide him.

671
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,530
This could be our last chance, I'm finishing this now.

672
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,260
How ya doing, buddy?

673
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,600
My advanced functions are still mostly inoperative.

674
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,860
Well, suck it up. I'm putting you in the game.

675
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:45,030
You're playing hurt.

676
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,760
I am Karr.

677
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,400
I must merge with you, Michael Knight!

678
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,530
Kitt must die!

679
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,360
Then you and I will become one!

680
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,500
- It is our destiny!  - Well, I have a different destiny for you.

681
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,930
You are my original driver!

682
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,260
We must be one!

683
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:20,360
- It is time to achieve our destiny, Michael Knight!  - Not today.

684
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,730
Michael, my nano skin is not responding.

685
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,260
I do not believe I can withstand much more.

686
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,800
All right. We're not gonna out-muscle this thing.

687
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,830
We gotta think of something.

688
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,100
What about your mechanical functions?

689
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,200
- You still got those?  - Yes, Michael.

690
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,230
Turbo boost?

691
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,900
I believe turbo boost is operational.

692
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,230
Good. I'll bring the rest.

693
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,830
Kitt must die!

694
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,860
Ski mode.

695
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,630
Then you and I will become one.

696
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,060
Grappling hook!

697
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,030
- Fire.  - It is our destiny.  - It isn't gonna be happen.

698
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,330
Let's do this.

699
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,000
Kitt, turbo boost now.

700
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,960
Mike.

701
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,400
Sarah, get an ambulance.

702
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,660
I'm so sorry.

703
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,130
I was doing what I thought I had to do.

704
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,900
I thought we could control it.

705
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,900
I thought we could save soldiers' lives.

706
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,660
Charles was right.

707
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,000
Shut up, man.

708
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,260
Just hang in there. Help's coming.

709
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,530
I didn't mean to put you in danger.

710
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Or Sarah.

711
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,360
Or anyone.

712
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,460
Please...

713
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,100
Tell them I'm sorry.

714
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,500
Hey. Hey, just hold on.

715
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,560
I'm sorry...

716
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,160
It's just antiseptic, tough guy.

717
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,330
Yeah. It stings.

718
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
Baby.

719
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,830
Hey.

720
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,500
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

721
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,760
Little bit.

722
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,500
Your nano repair mods are hot again.

723
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,500
All right.

724
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,700
Kitt...

725
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,800
Go for it.

726
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,360
That's what I'm talking about.

727
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,360
How do you feel, buddy?

728
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,400
I feel excellent, Michael.

729
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,200
Well, we're glad to hear it, Kitt.

730
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,330
There is one thing.

731
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,830
I have scanned my memory files, and there seem to be gaps.

732
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,630
I don't know what it is I can no longer remember, 

733
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,660
but I can sense something is missing.

734
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,030
Like a piece of me is gone.

735
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,100
You're not gone, Kitt.

736
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,500
You're all right here.

737
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,960
Sarah, I seem to have detected

738
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,560
a message file in my database.

739
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,330
It is from your father.

740
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,360
I would say that congratulations are in order, 

741
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,930
as this message is programmed

742
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,430
to play only in success.

743
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,860
So, job well done. All of you.

744
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,060
I imagine you're now asking yourselves, what next?

745
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,960
Well, it is my hope that you will continue.

746
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,430
How do we do that?

747
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,300
I don't believe you know this, 

748
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,660
but the SSC is the property of Knight Industries.

749
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,830
The government leased this facility

750
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,330
from us, and now it belongs to you.

751
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,630
Yes!

752
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,960
As far as funding goes, 

753
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,560
Sarah, I assume you remember "the beginning of eternity"?

754
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,700
Yeah, what did that mean, anyway?

755
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,800
It means we're good.

756
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,530
You can now be

757
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
the Knight Industries

758
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,130
that Wilton Knight always envisioned.

759
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,230
You can reinstitute flag...

760
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,630
Foundation for law and government.

761
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,960
Completely autonomous.

762
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,900
No more hidden agendas, no more interference.

763
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,100
Just what you think is right.

764
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,130
You can make a difference, but you must decide.

765
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,800
So what do you say?

766
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,160
Are you kidding? Of course.

767
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,160
You know it.

768
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,130
One question.

769
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,660
Do I get to keep the car?

770
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,000
Sarah, your father is my father.

771
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,160
I will do anything to help honor his memory.

772
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,430
I won't let you down, dad.

773
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,730
I know you'll make me proud. All of you.

774
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,630
Well, god bless.

775
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,030
Carry on.
