1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,660
Oh, hold on.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,460
I'm coming.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,860
Increased productivity

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,070
Through ergonomically b eneficial surroundings.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,600
Well, in the spirit of ergonomy...

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,240
Is that even a word?

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,310
Ergonomy is the applied science

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,080
Of equipment design, Michael.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,540
Okay.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,950
Well, then in the spirit of... origami,

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,380
You ever thinking about making your backseat

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,950
Into a bed, Kitt?

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,320
I'm afraid you'd be tempted to invite strangers.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,790
You mean "hoochies," Kitt.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,890
Undesirable females, yes.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,090
This puppy has got a cooler

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,460
Built into the armrest

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,760
And a remote for the big screen.

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,030
First and 17.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,040
Ahh.

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,600
that is sweet.

22
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,210
chair belongs on the other side.

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,740
I like it where it is.

24
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,110
Move it, stretch.

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,950
The Chinese system of feng shui

26
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,910
Would indicate that Zoe's placement

27
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,980
Provides for better chi.

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,350
Very zen of you, Kitt.

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,750
We could use a little more eastern philosophy around here.

30
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,090
See? Better chi.

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Chop chop.

32
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,960
Who died and made you boss?

33
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,990
That would be Alex Torres.

34
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,800
Hmm, I see you're already enjoying your downtime.

35
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,930
Oh, I have not yet begun to enjoy.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Going anywhere special?

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,400
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,470
A little sentimental journey.

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,610
Wait, we get to go somewhere?

40
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,310
- Outlet mall.  - SPA day.

41
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,640
You guys are kidding, right?

42
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,210
I'm going to get mellow and be zen.

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,080
You mean "we," Michael.

44
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,550
Yes, we. We are going, Kitt.

45
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,190
Back to a special place.

46
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,720
A magical place.

47
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,050
Our own little happy place.

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,590
Michael is taking me to a bar.

49
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,990
Who'd have thunk it?

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,830
I want to go to a bar.

51
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,360
Oh, no, not just any bar. Sonny's.

52
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,560
Oh, I get it.

53
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,530
Your dad took me there for my first beer.

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,770
And his dad took him there for his.

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,070
It's a neighborhood institution.

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,270
A cold brew, beer nuts, live music.

57
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,740
Run by Sonny Nelson.

58
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,740
Amazing bartender, even better guy.

59
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,080
I haven't been there in years,

60
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,480
But I can tell you that there is no better place

61
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,650
To de-stress.

62
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,650
Sounds awesome.

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,290
I'm a veritable cornucopia of stress.

64
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,090
From what I remember,

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,390
Sonny had a daughter.

66
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,060
Yeah, Julie Nelson.

67
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,030
She went to med school I think

68
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,360
Somewhere back east.

69
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,960
Right. Have a great time.

70
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,470
- You too, guys.  - Initiating launch pad.

71
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,600
Hello!

72
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,240
Hi.

73
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,970
We better tell him.

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,410
Or else he might have a breakdown.

75
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,140
Somebody please say something.

76
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,810
Look, we're going on rotation.

77
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,280
Everyone's gonna get a chance to decompress.

78
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,050
First, Mike's gonna take a couple days.

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,220
And then you, and then Zoe, and then me.

80
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,290
When's this all gonna start?

81
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,860
Ask your boss.

82
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,420
Okay, not funny.

83
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,060
No, Billy, it was funny.

84
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,470
A little rougher than I remembered.

85
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,470
I must admit, I'm somewhat concerned

86
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,700
For you, Michael.

87
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,870
I'll be okay, Kitt. Just stay close.

88
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,070
And be zen.

89
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,270
I will try.

90
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,960
If you're here about the bouncer job,

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,220
You're too pretty.

92
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,630
No, I'm actually here to see Sonny.

93
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,990
Yeah, right.

94
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,600
If you're a collection agent, you can get in line.

95
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,830
Sorry?

96
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,400
Sonny's dead.

97
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,400
What?

98
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,900
Michael?

99
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,100
Oh, my god. Michael, hi.

100
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,270
Hi.

101
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,440
Julie.

102
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,780
I didn't know you were friends.

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,380
Is it true about your dad?

104
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,180
Yeah, car accident three months ago.

105
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,850
I'm so sorry.

106
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,090
Thank you.

107
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,350
Michael, a nefarious character

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,620
Directly behind you is attempting to steal $20

109
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,220
From the bar.

110
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,030
What the hell is going on around here?

111
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Wish I knew.

112
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,700
We've had three fires in the last six weeks.

113
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,540
Fights every night. Cops have been closing us down.

114
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,210
What can I do to help?

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,940
Can you fix the mess at the door?

116
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,810
Sometimes Eddie's a little bit too nice for his own good.

117
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,850
Big Wddie's at the door?

118
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,150
Eddie's a pacifist.

119
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,890
I know.

120
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,690
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

121
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,190
Man.

122
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,560
Hey, the dude that left this unattended

123
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,300
is gonna be taking public transportation

124
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,830
for a while.

125
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,370
please step back from the vehicle.

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,770
oh, hey.

127
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,240
Homeboy's got one of those talking alarms.

128
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,310
Yeah, at least you'd think they'd give it

129
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,050
Some bad-ass voice like,

130
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,180
"step back, clown, before you get smoked."

131
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,520
You get smoked.

132
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,320
ho, ho, ho, ho.

133
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,360
Michael, Two felons are eyeing me suspiciously.

134
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,990
Permission to administer non-lethal electric shock.

135
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,630
What did I say about Zen, Kitt?

136
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,030
"Restraint" is the word of the day.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,300
Alright, Michael

138
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,000
oh, my God, dude.

139
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,540
You just got schooled.

140
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,740
Michael, I suggest you use restraint as well.

141
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,710
Watch me.

142
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,280
It's $10 each, please.

143
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,180
I get comped at every club on the strip.

144
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,320
Why would I pay to go into this place?

145
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,820
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.

146
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,960
Nearly everyone at the door is armed.

147
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,200
All right, you're forcing my hand.

148
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,830
Can I talk to you for a second?

149
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,070
Would you hold on a moment, please?

150
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,200
Mike?

151
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,710
Hey, Eddie.

152
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,210
What are you doing over here?

153
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,140
I've been wondering the same thing.

154
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,980
All right, any day now, dummy.

155
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,550
I didn't want to resort to violence,

156
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,450
But I feel as though I've reached my limit.

157
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,180
Mind a little assist?

158
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,050
'Cause you're violating the cardinal rule at the door.

159
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,650
Really?

160
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,060
You never tell the bad guy what you're gonna do

161
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,000
Before you do it.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,130
Screw this. We're going in.

163
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,960
He's got a gun in his waistband, Michael.

164
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,670
Back up.

165
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,680
That was not smart.

166
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,510
Good night, gentlemen.

167
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,480
Go.

168
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,420
Anybody fighting inside walk them outside.

169
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,760
Take them one at a time.

170
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,090
Yell if you need any help.

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,700
Thanks, man.

172
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,240
Michael, I was harassed by two men.

173
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,680
Me too. Get Sarah.

174
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,980
How many you knock back so far?

175
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,380
Kitt, don't let him drive.

176
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,150
Sonny's dead.

177
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,120
Oh, no.

178
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,620
Car accident.

179
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,150
And the place isn't right... Mysterious fires, rough crowd.

180
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,490
A mess.

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,390
Sonny's never was in the best neighborhood.

182
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,790
Maybe you romanticized it a little?

183
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,660
I'm telling you, something's going on here, Sarah.

184
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,760
I need your help.

185
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,260
Sure, anything.

186
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,000
Kitt, tap into the local municipal database.

187
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,040
Send the accident report, arson files,

188
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,310
And anything else you can dig up back to the SSC.

189
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,510
You guys getting this?

190
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,970
We're on it. Yeah.

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,510
So what are you doing there?

192
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,910
I'm the new bouncer.

193
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,750
Bouncer?

194
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,310
Kick ass.

195
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,620
Be careful.

196
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,650
Let's get to work on those fires.

197
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,290
No, we should start on the car accident.

198
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,620
Begin a broad-spectrum search.

199
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,590
I'm sorry, what?

200
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,600
Sarah was only half joking.

201
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,200
She runs the place because Dr. Graiman

202
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,330
Left her nine figures,

203
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,930
Mike and Kitt do the outside stuff,

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,600
And I'm in charge of all this glory right here.

205
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,270
You? You're my boss?

206
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,810
Haven't you noticed

207
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,080
I boss you around almost all day every day?

208
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,910
Yeah, but it's part of our whole fun little dynamic.

209
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,650
No, it's me being your boss.

210
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,620
I have multiple advanced degrees.

211
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,950
I speak nine languages

212
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,420
And I have a card that gets me discounts

213
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,920
At participating Red Lobster restaurants.

214
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,590
Okay, if this wasn't so ludicrous,

215
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,460
It would be ludicrous.

216
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,160
All right, I'm on the accident.

217
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,470
You look into the fires,

218
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,000
And we'll see who's right soon enough.

219
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
It's on.

220
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,310
Oh, it's all the way on.

221
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,740
All right, folks, you don't have to go home,

222
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,050
But you can't stay here.

223
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,880
Come on, let's go. Come back tomorrow.

224
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,920
Let's go.

225
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
Didn't think you'd last the night.

226
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,260
Under-promise and over-deliver.

227
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,290
I'm Mike.

228
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,490
Robin.

229
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,860
Beer?

230
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,870
Nothing like a cold beer right after last call.

231
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,430
Michael helped my dad 86 some tough customers

232
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,700
Back in the day.

233
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,600
It was more him than me.

234
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,340
Sonny was a sweet guy, but he had one hot temper.

235
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,110
Well, thank God. You showed up tonight.

236
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm barely hanging on.

237
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,880
It was never like this before.

238
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,380
It's like somebody wants her outta here.

239
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,820
Any idea who that might be?

240
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,820
Maybe I'm not cut out for this like my dad.

241
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,790
I seriously doubt it's you.

242
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,460
Did you two have a thing?

243
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
Robin, come on.

244
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,160
Julie was a college girl,

245
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,730
On to bigger and better things.

246
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
She thought I was a punk.

247
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,670
You know, the kind of guy that hangs out in bars.

248
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,210
You didn't answer my question.

249
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,140
She calls you "Michael."

250
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,110
But you introduce yourself as Mike.

251
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,140
Are either of you gonna cop to prior nookie or what?

252
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,420
Go on.

253
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,120
You think you might be able

254
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,590
To stick around a little while longer?

255
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm sure I can squeeze it into my schedule.

256
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,960
Good.

257
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,330
Uh, staff meeting tomorrow morning,

258
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,600
11:00 a.m.

259
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,670
Good night, Julie.

260
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,070
Good night, Michael.

261
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,080
- See you tomorrow, Mike.  - Good night, Eddie.

262
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,210
What?

263
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,880
Nothing.

264
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,890
You getting shut out?

265
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,260
Three fires in the last two months

266
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
Of unknown origin.

267
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,430
Police did an arson investigation...

268
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,000
... and came up empty.

269
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,460
But you have a theory?

270
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,100
Spontaneous combustion.

271
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,240
Or maybe it's the tiny chubby gnomes...

272
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
... whose thighs rub together and make sparks...

273
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,540
... when they wear corduroy.

274
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,870
I suppose you're doing better with the car accident?

275
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,540
Patience, grasshopper.

276
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,810
Patience.

277
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,020
Anybody else bother you?

278
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,220
I was unmolested the remainder of the evening,

279
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,490
Why do you have to use words like "unmolested"?

280
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,590
Can't you just say it was all okay?

281
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,560
I practiced the restraint you recommended,

282
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,860
... but it wasn't easy.

283
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,490
Well, I'm proud of you, Kitt.

284
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,930
Michael, is it possible you are idealizing...

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
... Sonny's a bit?

286
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,900
Maybe you were remembering it the way you want it to be.

287
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,670
Come on, you too?

288
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,640
Thomas Wolfe wrote a novel about this phenomenon.

289
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,510
It was called "You Can't Go Home Again".

290
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,940
Still think I'm idealizing?

291
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,880
Michael, someone appears to be trapped in the fire.

292
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,050
Open up. It's Eddie, help!

293
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,220
Open up. It's Eddie.

294
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,150
It's Eddie.

295
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,190
Somebody open up!

296
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,680
Where is he?

297
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,610
Michael, the pressurized CO2 tanks...

298
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,450
... have become dangerously overheated.

299
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
We must act now.

300
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
Doing.

301
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,160
Get in.

302
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,970
Kitt, CO2.

303
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,980
The fire's out, Michael.

304
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,090
Are you okay?

305
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,930
All of his vital signs are normal, Michael.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,470
I'm gonna have to ask you not to mention...

307
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,430
... what you saw tonight to anyone.

308
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,380
Thank you.

309
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,960
That is the fourth fire in six weeks.

310
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,290
Doesn't sound much like an accident.

311
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,490
No, it sounds like arson.

312
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,090
Look, Kitt can investigate...

313
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,360
... while you go to your meeting.

314
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,860
She's hot, by the way.

315
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,570
Who?

316
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,130
I believe she means Julie, Michael.

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,170
Hadn't noticed.

318
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,740
You're a terrible liar.

319
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,640
Three months ago today,

320
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,440
Julie's father takes his '68 Dodge out for a spin...

321
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,710
... and ends up wrapping it around a telephone pole.

322
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,910
Anybody with him?

323
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,650
- Nope.  - Police report?

324
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,090
Same basic story.

325
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,590
Witnesses?

326
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,160
Cops say no.

327
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,090
But I found two blog entries from the neighborhood...

328
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,290
... from the next day.

329
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,190
Both say they saw the car...

330
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,200
... and heard nothing but a crash.

331
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,230
Okay,so it was an accident.

332
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,000
But you've got another theory.

333
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,970
Actually, I don't.

334
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
I've hit a dead end, literally and figuratively.

335
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,050
All right, let's get started.

336
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,550
First up, seems like we had another fire...

337
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,090
... around closing last night.

338
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,290
Did anybody see anything?

339
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,230
No? Okay, um...

340
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Hi, Phil.

341
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,440
Hey. How's the nose?

342
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,000
It's broken.

343
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,970
I guess you didn't know who the hell you were assaulting.

344
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,070
Hey.

345
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,710
My son's mouth tends to get...

346
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,010
... a step ahead of his brain.

347
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,980
- Mike, isn't it?  - Phil Driscoll.

348
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,920
Phil was an old friend of my dad's.

349
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,250
They were in a car club together.

350
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,250
My son comes home with a broken nose,

351
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
... I'd never expect to hear it happened at Sonny's.

352
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,660
Before I call the police or my lawyer,

353
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,160
... I wanted to hear your side.

354
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,690
Sir, I make it a general policy.

355
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,500
Not to raise hands to anyone...

356
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,800
... unless they plan on throwing shots at me.

357
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,000
I should've broken your nose myself.

358
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,270
Are you kidding me, pop?

359
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,310
What is the old saying?

360
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,240
Outside of your wife giving birth,

361
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,110
... nothing good ever happens at 2:00 a.m.

362
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,180
Nice to meet you, Mike. Sorry for the inconvenience.

363
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,450
Not at all. Thanks for coming by.

364
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,870
Creepy.

365
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,710
Ohh.

366
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,340
Come to mama.

367
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,040
Billy, Zoe, I'm analyzing...

368
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,600
... the aftermath of the fire.

369
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,540
You certain it was arson?

370
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,640
Yes, and I have isolated the accelerant.

371
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,410
Whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.

372
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
Can you follow it?

373
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,080
Not with my current software configuration.

374
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,680
Uploading new sniffer program now.

375
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,680
I'll do it.

376
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,520
Duh, I'm already doing it.

377
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,260
Hello?

378
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,300
Hey.

379
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Which one do you like better?

380
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,200
What's it for?

381
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,170
First amendment night.

382
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,210
Spoken word poetry and $2 jager shots.

383
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,270
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment..."

384
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,410
"... of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"

385
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,210
"... or abridging the freedom of speech."

386
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,480
They teach you about the constitution in the army?

387
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,950
Thought I'd be good to actually know...

388
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,220
... what I was defending.

389
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,220
Hmm.

390
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,760
My dad called it the marinated microcosm.

391
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,030
Everybody's equal with a drink in their hand.

392
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,630
He was a hell of a guy.

393
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,970
Yeah.

394
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,130
Is that your grandfather?

395
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,570
Yeah.

396
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,940
Built this building with his own two hands.

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,340
He still scares me.

398
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,380
He was one mean son of a bitch.

399
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,110
And then some.

400
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,610
This bar was a soup kitchen in the great depression.

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,580
A polling place every election.

402
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,950
A shelter in three earthquakes.

403
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,690
My dad was even born here.

404
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,090
How come we never...

405
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,660
For starters, your dad kept...

406
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,960
... a really big bat behind the bar.

407
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,830
It's still there too.

408
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,960
Great.

409
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,140
I tried calling and E-mailing.

410
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,110
I even wrote you a letter.

411
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,070
Everything came back "undeliverable".

412
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,880
Yeah.

413
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,450
Let's just say I got involved in some things...

414
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,120
That didn't turn out so well.

415
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,450
I was gonna be an ophthalmologist.

416
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,950
Now I run a bar.

417
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,670
Mike, I've discovered a faint chemical signature

418
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,100
from the fire.

419
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,640
We must follow its trail now

420
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,110
before it dissipates completely.

421
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,910
I will see you tonight.

422
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,720
Sonny's used to be a friendly neighborhood bar,

423
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,990
Right?

424
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,230
Mm-hmm.

425
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,760
All of a sudden, it starts to get rougher.

426
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,360
I thought you were working on the fires.

427
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,000
I was, but what if they're related?

428
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,470
What makes a crowd change?

429
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,270
New owner, neighborhood goes bad,

430
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,840
They water down the drinks.

431
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,810
Here's the greatest hits from the front door camera.

432
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,270
at Sonny's for the last three weeks.

433
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,810
Oh, he's cute.

434
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,450
He's also been in four fights.

435
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,150
So?

436
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,620
He's angry and he's cute.

437
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,290
So he just started showing up at the bar recently

438
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,050
along with those four other dudes

439
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,220
who've also been getting into fights.

440
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,390
And they are also hot. It's called coincidence.

441
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,190
It would be except I followed them to the bar.

442
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,560
No 20s, no credit cards,

443
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,730
Hundred dollar bills every time.

444
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,430
Maybe they're drug dealers.

445
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,170
Or maybe somebody's paying them to start trouble.

446
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,840
And how does this connect to the fires?

447
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,510
I don't know.

448
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,290
Hey, there's your stang, bro.

449
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,620
Still in the hood.

450
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,190
It's like he's teasing us.

451
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,230
I'd take that as a dare, I was you.

452
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,330
Yeah.

453
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,140
It's in the same family as methane,

454
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,170
but it's getting fainter as we go.

455
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,940
He must have gotten out of his car here.

456
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,150
You need to go handheld.

457
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,340
Kitt, you there?

458
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,380
Right behind you, Michael.

459
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,810
It just stops.

460
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,280
Whoever set the fire ended up here.

461
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,890
Phil Driscoll's office.

462
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,570
We traced him from the fire back to his father's office.

463
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,010
It's gotta be Terry.

464
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,640
He definitely had the opportunity.

465
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,280
And a broken nose is definitely motive.

466
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,250
I'd say the motive would be embarrassment.

467
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,620
You made him look weak in front of a beautiful woman.

468
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,050
Yeah, but Terry's a couple tacos short

469
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,220
of a combination plate.

470
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,750
You don't think he's capable?

471
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,060
I think he's a moron.

472
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
Hit me back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything.

473
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,030
Hey,

474
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,660
How's Julie Nelson?

475
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,000
Hanging in there.

476
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,910
Terry's a jerk, but he's not an arsonist.

477
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,650
I heard you went out with him.

478
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,480
Wow.

479
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,220
A bar is like ninth grade summer school, isn't it?

480
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,250
Uh, yes, it was once,

481
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,660
And it was years ago.

482
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,930
So maybe he was trying to get your attention.

483
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,730
Nothing like a two-alarm blaze

484
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,030
to get a girl all hot and bothered.

485
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,630
- Robin's looking.  - Of course she is.

486
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,540
So what about Terry's father?

487
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,870
Why would Phil want to burn a place he offered to buy?

488
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,010
He offered to buy your bar?

489
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,280
After my dad was killed,

490
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,580
He figured I couldn't handle the bar by myself.

491
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,980
And maybe he was right.

492
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,520
You do sit on a valuable piece of dirt.

493
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,190
A place like this is a drop in the bucket

494
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
to a developer like Phil.

495
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,860
Believe me, he's doing it as a favor.

496
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,300
Sonny Nelson was driving a '68 Dodge

497
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,770
the night of the accident.

498
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,040
Nice graphics.

499
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,980
- Nice grill.  - Thanks.

500
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,410
Where'd you get this?

501
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,150
I recreated his route from the blog descriptions,

502
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,480
then reenacted the accident

503
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,850
Using Kitt's 3-d graphic software.

504
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,620
Nice work.

505
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,420
Wait, I thought we established

506
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,920
No foul play in the accident.

507
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,950
That's what the police said.

508
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,120
Not what I say.

509
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,960
He comes around this turn,

510
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,290
Hits the brakes,

511
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,730
Gets a little squirrelly, continues till he crashes.

512
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,060
Okay, so we see the accident.

513
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,870
But what don't we see?

514
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,370
Remember, the blogger said that he heard nothing

515
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,270
but a crash.

516
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,270
Skid marks.

517
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,580
Exactly.

518
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,510
He hit the brakes but the car didn't skid.

519
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,380
No screeching, no skidding.

520
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,320
Because you think he lost his brakes?

521
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,450
Or somebody cut the brake line.

522
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,560
It's not proof.

523
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,020
You said nice work.

524
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,460
It's a simulation.

525
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,490
It's not evidence. It won't hold up in court.

526
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,360
Which is why we need to find the real car.

527
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,700
Hey, Mike.

528
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,670
You really made me think about things.

529
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,710
Introspection is good, Eddie.

530
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,750
I've always thought of you as sort of a simple guy.

531
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,220
And by "simple" I mean straightforward,

532
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,550
but not very complicated.

533
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,550
No offense intended.

534
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,890
None taken.

535
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,620
I set the fire last night.

536
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,160
I thought if I set it and put it out,

537
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,230
I'd be a hero.

538
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,860
But then the back door locked on me.

539
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,300
I know, stupid, right?

540
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,500
And nobody put you up to it?

541
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,240
You saved my life.

542
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,170
Who are you really, Mike?

543
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,640
Just a guy trying to make things better.

544
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,650
It's a 1968 Dodge Coronet.

545
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,090
I've uploaded tags and vin number to Kitt.

546
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,790
You've gotta find that car.

547
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,260
Or what's left of it.

548
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,230
You know, I may have found a flaw in your logic, Kitt.

549
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,390
Really?

550
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,960
Your assumption was whoever set the fire

551
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,400
ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.

552
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,930
Based on the spectrographic analysis,

553
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,270
that was correct.

554
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,140
But Eddie admitted he set it.

555
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,940
He could have gone to Driscoll's office

556
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,740
after he left us, or he could have been lying.

557
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,710
No, he was threatening to kick Terry Driscoll's ass.

558
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,210
So I'm guessing he wouldn't be heading

559
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,910
over to their place for a nightcap.

560
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,350
My gut says he's telling the truth.

561
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,750
It is possible the methane trail

562
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,650
could be related to another incident or person.

563
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,420
But outside of the fire,

564
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,520
there seems to be no logical reason.

565
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,790
holograms.

566
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,260
Really?

567
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,530
that's right.

568
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,770
that was some seriously impressive shizz back there.

569
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,870
I know.

570
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,040
that's usually my department.

571
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,170
I know.

572
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,640
kinda made me look bad.

573
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,240
I know.

574
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,610
That's why I got you something.

575
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,780
what?

576
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,650
level 14 knows how to party.

577
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,430
botcraft 6.

578
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,730
Quest for cyclops.

579
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,600
Hammer of Xerxes 7.

580
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,430
These aren't even out yet.

581
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,440
I know.

582
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,720
the DMV search was unsuccessful.

583
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,190
what about junkyards?

584
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,220
Insurance companies? Car collectors?

585
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,850
Maybe somebody bought it for parts.

586
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,760
I broadened my search parameters,

587
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,660
And they have come up with a possibility.

588
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,690
great. Where's the car?

589
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,040
the last place you ever would have expected.

590
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,610
an art gallery?

591
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,410
You're kidding.

592
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,010
the remains of Julie's father's car

593
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,110
Were purchased by an artist

594
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,680
And installed as the centerpiece

595
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,950
Of an exhibit here.

596
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,480
a man died in that car.

597
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,790
apparently there is an artistic subculture

598
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,720
Especially fascinated by automobile crashes.

599
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,660
outside their subculture,

600
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,390
They're known as idiots, Kitt.

601
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,650
go ahead, touch it.

602
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,350
It helps you connect.

603
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,190
I call it "beautiful agony."

604
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,860
wow. Where'd you get it?

605
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,260
I scan the police blotter for fatal accidents,

606
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,630
And I buy the wrecks from the insurance company.

607
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,760
yes.

608
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,730
Yes, I see.

609
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,030
I can tell that you're into it.

610
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,400
People come right up to the cars as if they...

611
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,440
It's as if they want to connect

612
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,440
With the moment of impact.

613
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,850
it's just so... visceral.

614
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,880
I'll let you remain in the moment then.

615
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,620
Listen to it.

616
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,690
It'll sing to you.

617
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,200
Enjoy.

618
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,070
ass clown.

619
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,070
Michael, the brake system on a '68 Dodge coronet

620
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,810
Has a fluid line running down the left side of the chassis.

621
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,850
yeah, I'm getting there now.

622
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,930
The brake line's been cut.

623
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,890
it may have been severed in the crash.

624
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,260
no, this cut's too uniform.

625
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,330
Someone did this.

626
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,830
Zoe's right.

627
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,500
It was murder.

628
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,700
who the hell is shooting at me?

629
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,670
the shots are coming from the bridge above.

630
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,370
what are you waiting for, a written invitation?

631
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,380
Come get me.

632
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
on my way, Michael.

633
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,850
cover me, scatter pattern.

634
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,650
rapid fire will exhaust my ammunition supply

635
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,680
In approximately seven seconds.

636
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,980
wow, seven seconds?

637
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,320
That's all you last?

638
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,150
that's 8,000 rounds, Michael.

639
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,660
no, it's fine. I'm sure Sarah can fix it.

640
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,790
Start shooting.

641
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,550
Got the wheel? How many?

642
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,820
two in pursuit

643
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,790
And two attempting to block the roadway ahead,

644
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,420
And we are out of ammunition.

645
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,520
okay, bad and bad.

646
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,100
michael, his is exhilarating.

647
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,800
won't be for long if we don't get outta here.

648
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,910
I'm gonna try something.

649
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,540
I'd advise against it.

650
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,240
why? You don't even know what I'm gonna do.

651
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,580
I rely on past performance to indicate future action.

652
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
Prepare for impact.

653
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,020
Kitt, turbo boost.

654
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,520
not on a turn, Michael.

655
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,160
ooh!

656
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,930
whoo, no fun being predictable.

657
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,930
Hey, you screamed like a girl.

658
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,820
where's Julie?

659
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,660
upstairs.

660
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,300
Michael, I have scanned the entering crowd.

661
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,770
So far I've detected six knives, a slingshot,

662
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,170
And two Chinese throwing stars.

663
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,700
this is worse than last night.

664
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,410
What the hell is going on?

665
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,940
I am wondering the same thing.

666
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,380
Michael, the felons have returned.

667
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,080
okay, you're good.

668
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,260
I'm gonna open it up like a tin can.

669
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,290
that's it.

670
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,970
Hey, hey, hey.

671
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,400
Come on.

672
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,810
Come on, let's get outta here.

673
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,110
Go, go, go.

674
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,110
Come on.

675
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,950
Billy, Zoe, you might want to see this.

676
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,280
whoa!

677
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,190
I thought Mike told Kitt to be zen.

678
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,560
sometimes a man just reaches his limit.

679
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,560
it's not like Kitt to disobey an order.

680
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,690
Kitt, what happened?

681
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,960
I am wondering the same thing.

682
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,000
you mean that explosion wasn't you?

683
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,570
it wasn't me.

684
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,900
But I do detect high levels of methane gas

685
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,770
That could have been ignited by the welding torch.

686
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,910
going to county registrar's files,

687
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,450
Pulling up the real estate records on Sonny's now.

688
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,410
geological surveys too.

689
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,660
they're not here.

690
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,320
already tapped into building and safety.

691
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,260
there was a confidential subterranean survey

692
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,330
Done six months ago.

693
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,170
by who?

694
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,500
it was paid for by Driscoll Development.

695
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,770
Why?

696
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,610
because it's not the bar.

697
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,240
It's what's under it.

698
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,440
the mineral rights.

699
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,290
Sonny's sits on top of a pool of methane.

700
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,630
Based on current prices and the estimated cubic footage,

701
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,960
The rights are worth at least 50 million.

702
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,630
that would explain the explosion.

703
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,030
and the fires and the fights.

704
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,400
and why Driscoll wanted to buy the place.

705
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,470
Mike.

706
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,840
yeah, Billy?

707
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,970
it's Phil Driscoll.

708
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,240
He's after the mineral rights.

709
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,710
they're worth at least 50 million.

710
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,850
Michael.

711
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,880
Phil Driscoll set the fires to force you out.

712
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,050
He hired thugs to start trouble at Sonny's.

713
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,190
He wants your bar because the mineral rights

714
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,360
Are worth a fortune.

715
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,290
What are you talking about? Phil was doing me a favor.

716
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,460
No, you don't understand.

717
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,500
He had a geological survey done without your father's knowledge.

718
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,160
Michael, stop.

719
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,000
Phil had a heart attack this morning.

720
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,370
Found him less than an hour ago.

721
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,640
Phil Driscoll's dead.

722
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,770
Phil was an honest man.

723
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,110
He was my father's friend.

724
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,510
Then why was he doing secret oil gas surveys

725
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,680
of your property?

726
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,910
What are you talking about?

727
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,350
Kitt, on screen in here.

728
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,420
How'd you do that?

729
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,520
Push in on the last page.

730
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,160
Is there a signature?

731
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,920
Yes, Terrance Driscoll,

732
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,790
Phil Driscoll's son.

733
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,060
Patch in Billy and Zoe.

734
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,800
We just got confirmation on Phil Driscoll's death.

735
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,930
Heart attack.

736
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,730
It's not Phil, it's Terry.

737
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
Always the crazy ones.

738
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,070
You gotta give me something solid enough to take him down.

739
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,040
I'm on it.

740
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,510
What the hell was that?

741
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,710
That is how I straighten out my karma.

742
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,510
Programmed image recognition

743
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,420
for a 1986 Dodge Coronet.

744
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,980
Okay, we're hacked into every business

745
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,350
With a camera system within a two-mile radius of Sonny's.

746
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,190
Running footage the day of the accident now.

747
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,630
I need you to call Terry Driscoll

748
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,990
And tell him you're so upset by his dad's death

749
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,330
You need to see him.

750
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,460
Tell him you can't handle the place by yourself

751
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,970
And you're willing to sell.

752
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,200
He'll never go for it.

753
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,340
Trust me.

754
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,840
He'll go for it.

755
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,240
I don't even have his number.

756
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,510
Kitt.

757
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,840
It's ringing.

758
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,680
Terry. It's Julie Nelson.

759
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,450
Listen, I need to see you.

760
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,450
This is a crazy long shot.

761
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,760
But we love long shots.

762
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,930
Right on schedule.

763
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm, uh, I'm really glad you called.

764
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,110
Can I get you something to drink?

765
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,410
Yeah, like a methane and soda?

766
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,440
Oh.

767
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,210
You know, I actually think it's harder playing dumb

768
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,550
than being dumb.

769
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,420
Don't see yourself short, Terry.

770
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,490
You're really good at both.

771
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,260
Hold him.

772
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,560
Robin, the bat!

773
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,260
Catch.

774
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,980
Oh!

775
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,370
Get him outta here.

776
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,070
We got a match.

777
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,910
It's from an ATM camera at a bank across the street.

778
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,940
While Julie's dad was inside the bank,

779
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,710
Terry Driscoll cut his brake line on his car.

780
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,550
That's right. No skid marks.

781
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,880
Skid marks.

782
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,430
Ow.

783
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,100
So what happened after I blacked out?

784
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,270
Well, I had you brought up here

785
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,280
And, um, then I had my way with you.

786
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,380
Okay, it wasn't a dream.

787
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,480
No.

788
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,090
I'm so sorry.

789
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,160
Oh.

790
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,160
I was hoping you would stay a while.

791
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,600
You're keeping the bar open?

792
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Mm-hmm.

793
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,900
Come on, you're sitting

794
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,670
on, like, 50 million worth of methane.

795
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,940
Well, somebody's gotta keep Robin

796
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,470
from sleeping with all the customers,

797
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,940
And look at Eddie.

798
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,270
He finally got his confidence back.

799
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,850
I made my dad a promise.

800
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,780
Hmm.

801
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,690
Sure you don't want to stick around?

802
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,420
Could be fun.

803
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,030
You could maybe, um, tell me how you did

804
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,760
all that, um...

805
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,000
Stuff.

806
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,400
You know what they say.

807
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,470
You can't go home again.

808
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,840
Or at least for the next, like, three to four hours.

809
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,080
That's it?

810
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,210
I'm hurt.

811
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,500
Stay zen, dude.

812
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,700
You too, Eddie.

813
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,880
I was wrong, Michael.

814
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,150
What are you talking about?

815
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,780
I guess you can go home again.
