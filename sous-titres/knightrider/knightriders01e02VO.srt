1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,360
Do not underestimate these guys, Mike.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,560
Johnny and Ian chang

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,700
Both have criminal records

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,900
And a history of violence.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,000
Use your contact

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,900
to get close to them.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,000
We have to figure out How they're smuggling

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,130
U.s. Military technology Overseas

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,500
And who their contact is.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,600
Who don't you just Take 'em down and sweat them?

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,900
If we move in now, We'll spook their supplier.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,530
See what you can find, But don't provoke them.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,130
Re the boss.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,960
# Dogs howling at the moon #

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,960
# Holding out for pain #

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,860
# Waiting for the day They'll leave their towns #

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,160
# and make their names #

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,560
# Make one more detour Recommend #

19
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,000
# Hard times in the hearts of young men #

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,200
Kitt, can you get a visual?

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,030
Accessing surveillance cameras.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,160
# But nobody cares #

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,130
Do you see The Chang brothers?

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,060
activating facial recognition.

25
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,700
Neither Johnny or Ian chang are in the establishment.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,200
Watch my back.

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,730
Our intel says this is Their favorite watering hole.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,160
Heads up! Oh.

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,230
You look pretty good For a dead man.

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,860
You should know better Than to believe rumors.

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,200
Ain't that the truth.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,530
Surprised to see you.

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,430
Last time I talked to you,

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,600
You were heading back To Iraq.

35
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm done with the army.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Or I guess you could say

37
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,260
The army is done with me.

38
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,060
I'm racing again.

39
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,200
Heard there's money To be made out here

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,300
If you can drive fast.

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,830
There is.

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,060
But getting another crew Could be hard.

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm sure I could Hook you up, though.

44
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,700
All right?

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,630
Michael, there is still no sign of the chang brothers. But Ian Chang's girlfriend Celine Lea is here.

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,460
She is the auburn-haired woman by the jukebox.

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,030
What do you say?

48
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,630
Ready to concentrate on something else?

49
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,630
Oh, man, ain't you tired Of losing?

50
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,800
Call it. Heads.

51
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,900
Her.

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Celine the ice queen?

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,300
No, man, she's taken. Pick somebody else.

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,460
- When has that Ever mattered?  - Never!

55
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,960
Kitt, change of plans.

56
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,160
We're gonna get Acquainted with the changs

57
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,500
From a different angle.

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,100
Tell me everything you can About Ian's girlfriend.

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,860
Celine Lea, 5'5", birthday october 10,

60
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,930
graduated corona high with a 3.9 gpa.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,260
According to her webbook profile,

62
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,900
things that make her hot are bad boys,

63
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,630
fast cars, and the poetry of Pablo Neruda.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm Mike.

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm not interested.

66
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,960
Oh, neither am I. I'm just trying to win a bet.

67
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,430
See, my friend over there

68
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Says that you're hot But superficial.

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
I say there's more To you than that.

70
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,930
I'm guessing you're a libra.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,860
What are you, A psychic or a stalker?

72
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm just observant.

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,830
You're all about balance,

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,400
But not afraid To take chances.

75
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,960
You're not like Most guys around here.

76
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,900
That's because I'm not from around here.

77
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,460
I'm here to race.

78
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,230
Michael, Johnny and Ian chang have entered.

79
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,560
They do not appear pleased

80
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,200
that you are talking with celine.

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,300
You know, I can read Your mind too.

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
And I know exactly What you're thinking.

83
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,030
And the answer is

84
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,230
Relax, bro, we were Just talking.

85
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,360
Do I like you?

86
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,700
'cause only people I like get to call me bro.

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,700
- Okay, then how about I buy you a beer?  - Right.

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,860
Maybe we'll become buds.

89
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,160
Take fishing trips together.

90
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,760
Maybe I'll just Kick your ass.

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,530
No fighting tonight.

92
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,860
Let's take this outside.

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,900
I got a better idea. Let's race.

94
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,160
We only race for pinks.

95
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
Mikey, Forget these dudes, man.

96
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,230
They're not worth it. Walk away.

97
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,000
I got this. Okay.

98
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,400
Let's go.

99
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,530
watch the bar.

100
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,060
That's my ride.

101
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,300
What do you got?

102
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,200
A mustang. I'm scared.

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,230
You should be.

104
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,160
The only rule is That there are no rules.

105
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,360
One loop around the canyon.

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,560
First one back wins pink.

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,130
Make it look good.

108
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,700
We blow 'em away, They might get suspicious.

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,300
May I remind you,

110
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,300
I am legal property of knight industries.

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,930
you have no authority to sell or assign my title

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
Should you lose.

113
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,530
I don't intend to lose.

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,300
Michael, Alex Torres is trying to contact you.

115
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,000
What part of "don't provoke the changs"

116
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,430
Do you not understand?

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,260
you're supposed to be infiltrating their crew,

118
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,100
not betting a piece of classified technology

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,330
in a street race.

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,300
The only thing these guys Respect is speed.

121
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
I gotta earn Some street cred

122
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,000
If I'm gonna get in With the big dog.

123
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,300
the big dog?

124
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,630
I was unaware there were canines involved.

125
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,060
No, I'm talking About pecking order.

126
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,530
The alpha male, The leader of the pack.

127
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
 that seems a dated concept.

128
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,800
Is not the goal of modern society to foster equality?

129
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,460
Maybe in theory.

130
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,760
But in reality, if you're Not the shark, you're food.

131
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,060
Kitt, I said to make it Look good, not let him win.

132
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,060
What's he got under there, A jet engine?

133
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,160
Actually, quite close, Michael.

134
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,660
His nitrous system is replicating a modified ramjet.

135
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,330
Michael, there is an oncoming car,

136
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,660
and you are in the wrong lane.

137
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,560
Michael, would you like me to drive?

138
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,360
Kitt, we gotta get back in the race.

139
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,730
Our delay was significant enough

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,300
to allow Ian an opportunity to win.

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,700
We can't lose, kitt.

142
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,400
Switch to attack mode.

143
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,560
If I switch to attack mode now, I risk exposure.

144
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,200
If you don't switch To attack mode,

145
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,400
You're gonna end up in a tijuana chop shop.

146
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,800
switching to attack mode.

147
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,400
the other driver is behaving irrationally.

148
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,860
That's because he's starting To realize he's food.

149
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,560
based on speed and trajectory,

150
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,900
There is no way to avoid impact

151
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,930
with the vehicle we are rapidly approaching.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,260
Kitt, turbo boost.

153
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,260
Activating turbo boost.

154
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,100
Sweet!

155
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,430
Kitt, they can't see you like this.

156
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,660
Transforming mid-air

157
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,260
could affect my structural integrity.

158
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,900
We don't have a choice.

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,700
Transforming now.

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
That is how we roll. Right, Kitt?

161
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,860
Kitt?

162
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,760
Kitt is never supposed to transform mid-air.

163
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,800
Were you asleep during the training sessions

164
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,930
or are you just a moron?

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,100
I thought "never" meant not very often.

166
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,030
So you are a moron.

167
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,800
Can't you just hit reboot or something?

168
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,130
He's not a laptop.

169
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Lisa, begin nano-paint application, please.

170
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,960
Thank you.

171
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,830
I didn't have a choice, Sarah. I would've blown my cover.

172
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,560
Your cover?

173
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,000
I was undercover.

174
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,830
Five more minutes

175
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,360
and you would've been under the covers.

176
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,700
Could you turn that off, please?

177
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,830
I'll be emailing that to myself for later.

178
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,100
We have a mission update.

179
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,300
Last night, NSA intercepted

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,430
encoded chinese satellite Transmissions

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,330
Sent via next gen U.S. Military equipment.

182
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,730
I take it we didn't sell it to them.

183
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,960
We're talking prototype, here.

184
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,900
Even we don't have it in the field yet.

185
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,100
It's worse than we thought.

186
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,930
Silent running systems, night vision,

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,460
Stealth components,

188
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,300
All restricted weapons technology

189
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,960
Ending up in china, where it's reverse engineered

190
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,800
and sold to unfriendly third parties.

191
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,930
We suspect the Changs' custom car export business

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,330
is a front for their smuggling operation.

193
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,730
The feds stripped their last shipment of cars

194
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,660
down to their frames and found nothing.

195
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,600
It's up to us to find their source.

196
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,230
This is vital to national security, people.

197
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,630
Let's get it done.

198
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,930
When will Kitt be ready to roll?

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
A couple hours.

200
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll take him out personally.

201
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,800
I want to keep an eye on him.

202
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,430
Sure it's not Mike you keep an eye on?

203
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,060
Mike is expendable. The car isn't.

204
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,760
How are we supposed to make our shipment

205
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,700
without the car we promised our buyer?

206
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,260
You're the one who told me to race for pink slips.

207
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,930
I didn't think you'd lose.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,930
I swear to god, he wasn't driving the same car.

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Yeah, i switched in the middle of the race.

210
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,900
So where's my car?

211
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,200
It's over there.

212
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,130
Oh!

213
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
That might take you a while to buff out.

214
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,430
Why don't I just take this one and we'll call it even?

215
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,600
Why don't I bury you in the desert

216
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
and then we'll call it even.

217
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,460
Because it wouldn't make you any money.

218
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,730
You need a driver. I need a sponsor.

219
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,260
Take me on and we'll both win.

220
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,830
What are you gonna drive?

221
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,600
That mustang you fried yesterday?

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think it'll be all right.

223
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,960
Sounds like you're running a little lean.

224
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,300
I keep my air fuel mix tight.

225
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,900
She your girl?

226
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,930
I'm nobody's girl. I'm the car's mechanic.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,530
Don't see a lot of girl mechanics.

228
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,900
How'd you get into that?

229
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,730
- Why, you looking for a job?  - No.

230
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,100
I keep my girls in my car, not under it.

231
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,900
Mind if i take a look under the hood?

232
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,300
I barely know you.

233
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
So what do you say?

234
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,300
Meet me here tonight.

235
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,460
We'll talk about it.

236
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,160
Is getting in Johnny's good graces

237
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,760
part of your strategy

238
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,430
for ascending their hierarchy, Michael?

239
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,900
You're learning, Kitt.

240
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,300
I gotta earn Johnny's trust If I want to race for him.

241
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,400
He's the big dog.

242
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,760
My programmers delineated

243
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,300
The difference between a big dog and an alpha male.

244
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,530
That's because the computer programmers

245
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,360
Do the alpha males' homework.

246
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,460
I hope you're not buying this macho crap, Kitt.

247
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,860
What do you want him to do?

248
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,030
Go to a meditation class

249
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,530
And get in touch with his inner prius?

250
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,260
He's gotta learn how to be guy.

251
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,700
What makes you think I am a man or a woman, Michael?

252
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay, never do that again.

253
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,230
I was merely pointing out

254
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,000
That other than for reproduction,

255
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,960
one's sex is purely arbitrary.

256
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,430
You've got a lot to learn.

257
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,660
# And after all your dreams are done and paid for #

258
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,360
# There's nowhere left to run #

259
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,460
# And nobody left worth staying for #

260
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,330
Ah ha ha ha! There he is.

261
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,100
I know he's a beer guy. What are you?

262
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,430
You're best single malt, neat.

263
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Lady mechanic who knows her scotch.

264
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Lucky man.

265
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,800
We just work together.

266
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,630
- I'm Sarah.  - Sean.

267
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,330
I'm gonna make a loop, see if Johnny's here.

268
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,130
So Mike tells me you guys were in the army.

269
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah, went through basic

270
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,730
And special forces training together

271
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Till they plucked him out

272
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,400
For some hush-hush black ops thing.

273
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,430
Hmm.

274
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,760
What was he like back then?

275
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,730
Oh, I was sure he would do great things in his life.

276
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,030
That's why I'm surprised to see him here.

277
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,230
You're here.

278
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,760
Yeah.

279
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,700
Two years in prison will lead to diminished expectations.

280
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,330
Receiving stolen property.

281
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,300
Hooked up with the wrong crowd when i got back from iraq.

282
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,760
Problem with being the middle man,

283
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,560
You get squeezed from both sides.

284
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,360
I just don't want to see Mikey

285
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,100
Make the same mistakes that I did.

286
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Enjoy.

287
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,230
Hey.

288
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm really sorry about what happened yesterday.

289
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,230
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

290
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,060
Looks like you're the one who got the worst of it.

291
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,960
I guess all the good guys are taken.

292
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,600
Michael, Ian has just entered.

293
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,060
He is heading straight towards you.

294
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,100
He has a knife.

295
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,000
I told you to stay away from her... unh!

296
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,560
That had to hurt.

297
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,660
I accept your offer on one condition.

298
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,660
Let's hear it.

299
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,900
Get me a car.

300
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,230
Exactly like the one my brother wrecked

301
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
By tomorrow midnight.

302
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,000
You owe me a car. Why should I steal one for you?

303
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,800
You want to race for me?

304
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,630
Those are my terms.

305
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,030
Get my brother out of here.

306
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,300
Any particular color?

307
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,860
Mike, I searched DMV and insurance databases

308
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,360
for that car you're after.

309
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,530
There's only two on the west coast.

310
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,400
And only one that fits your parameters.

311
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,830
I've upgraded Kitt's surface screen program,

312
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,200
and loading it now.

313
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,660
Cool. DimitrI Kasporov.

314
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,260
Served five years in federal prison

315
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,300
for racketeering and extortion.

316
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,960
Perfect.

317
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,530
Apparently our boy Dimitri

318
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,760
is well known for his "models and bottles" bikini parties

319
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,230
and considers himself the Ukrainian Hugh Hefner.

320
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,000
My name is Dimitri.

321
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,060
I have model bottle party every year.

322
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,860
Is best party in whole world.

323
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,860
You like it, girls?

324
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,230
Michael,grand theft auto is a felony.

325
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,860
Kitt's right.

326
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,430
Technically, the SSC doesn't exist.

327
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,860
You get caught stealing a car, and you're on your own.

328
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,900
It's not stealing if you steal from a thief.

329
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,460
Besides,I'll be in and out

330
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,330
before they know what hit them.

331
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,430
Are you kidding?

332
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,800
First, I've had the same training as you.

333
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,430
And second, I look better in a bikini.

334
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,530
Yeah, she does.

335
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm guessing.

336
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,030
I'll be right back.

337
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
You gonna stand there looking pretty

338
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,230
or you gonna help a brother out?

339
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,060
I got your message. You wanted to see me?

340
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,760
Yeah, I did.

341
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,960
I hear you're getting in deeper with Johnny's crew.

342
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,760
I told you. I need to make some fast cash.

343
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,500
Take it from me.

344
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,330
Shortcuts usually end up being the long way around.

345
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,860
You lose, these guys will kill you.

346
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,260
I don't intend to lose.

347
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,730
Once a ranger, always a ranger.

348
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,030
I got your back. You know that, right?

349
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,600
Yeah, I know. Cool.

350
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,030
Michael, I have an incoming chatline from Billy.

351
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,260
Go ahead, Billy.

352
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,900
Mike, we ran Kitt's scan

353
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,200
of the cars in Johnny's garage

354
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,460
But we didn't find

355
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,160
any restricted military technology inside.

356
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,960
If it's not there, that means Johnny

357
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,830
hasn't made the transfer with his supplier yet.

358
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,430
Well, it has be going down soon.

359
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Johnny told me he wants a replacement car by midnight.

360
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,500
What's the ETA for stealing this car?

361
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,130
# Tell me, tell me what you want to know #

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,060
Any minute now.

363
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,100
What's my daughter doing there?

364
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,730
And what the hell is she wearing?

365
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,900
Uh, must be losing you, doc.

366
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,860
Going through a bad reception area.

367
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,460
But you're not moving.

368
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,300
Communication with the SSC has been terminated.

369
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,000
# Tell me what you wanna #

370
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,330
# Tell me what you wanna do # 

371
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,530
# Tell me, tell me, are you all alone? # 

372
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,260
What?

373
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,560
You do better in a bikini than I do.

374
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,560
# What if I was the last man on earth? #

375
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,430
# Would you consider me? #

376
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,060
Zoom in on the invite and print a copy.

377
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,660
Zooming. Image secured.

378
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,830
Printing.

379
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,330
Sweet.

380
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,360
Hey, maybe next time

381
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,900
you could print a few of these.

382
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,760
- That would another felony.  - Ignore him, Kitt.

383
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,760
Dimitri's car is parked in the garage.

384
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,800
You wouldn't happen to have a spare key, would you, Kitt?

385
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,760
Scanning database.

386
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,730
Kitt, 3d object generator online.

387
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,560
Commencing 3D object duplication.

388
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,760
That... is... cool.

389
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,800
Thank you, Michael.

390
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,800
Is this really time to get your funk on?

391
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm getting into character.

392
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,130
This isn't grand theft auto 4.

393
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,530
You get all jacked up on adrenaline,

394
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,660
You're gonna make mistakes.

395
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,700
Save the lecture.

396
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,060
# The kids in town #

397
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,360
# don't care about the rules... #

398
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,060
Not exactly on my bucket list of things to do before I die.

399
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,600
But stealing a car could be fun.

400
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,200
Hey.

401
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,730
What is on your bucket list?

402
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,330
You couldn't handle the first two.

403
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,930
# They take their time #

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,560
# but they'll take you apart #

405
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,600
# But tonight, yeah #

406
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,260
# know the kids... #

407
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,630
Activating Sunglasses link now.

408
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,330
Sunglasses camera link established.

409
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,500
# Hit the beat and take it to the verse now #

410
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,960
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

411
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,430
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

412
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,160
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

413
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,560
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

414
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,160
Okay, I'm at the pool.

415
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,400
Go past the cabanas. Make a right.

416
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,060
God, these girls are such bimbos.

417
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,900
Seriously, what do guys see in girls like this?

418
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,460
I don't know. I just don't get it.

419
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,830
Have they ever heard of Gloria Steinem?

420
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
Yeah.

421
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,630
What's the point of shattering the glass ceiling

422
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,100
if you're just gonna be objectified.

423
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,200
Like a dessert buffet?

424
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,060
Okay, now where?

425
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,360
Mike?

426
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,460
Mike?

427
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,660
Uh, right. Go around the corner.

428
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,400
You should see a garage.

429
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,730
Ow!

430
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,100
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

431
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,500
# You got me begging you for mercy #

432
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,600
# Why won't you release me? #

433
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,700
# I said release me #

434
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,900
What is such pretty girl

435
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,400
doing so far away on my party?

436
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,200
I was just admiring your car.

437
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,200
It looks very fast.

438
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,900
Have you ever made love

439
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,560
in a half-million-dollar automobile?

440
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,960
As a matter of fact...

441
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,230
I have.

442
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,100
Unh! Ugh!

443
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,500
What was that about

444
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,660
making love in a half-million-dollar car?

445
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,300
I'm losing you.

446
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,530
Must be going through a bad reception area.

447
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,730
But you're not moving.

448
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,500
I got a little bit of a snag here, guys. 

449
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,130
Meet me at the gate.

450
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,630
kitt, shut the gates, scramble the codes.

451
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,830
shutting gate, scrambling codes.

452
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,760
Summit of Kilimanjaro.

453
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,200
Sail around the world

454
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,430
And make love on a tropical beach,

455
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Listening to Puccini.

456
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,430
What are you talking about?

457
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,560
Those are the things on my bucket list.

458
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,030
I know, totally out of character.

459
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,460
But that's why they're on my bucket list.

460
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,730
Not so out of character.

461
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,860
What is it?

462
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,330
I don't know.

463
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,600
I think its military ops. Kitt, identify it.

464
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,960
I am sorry, Michael. I cannot.

465
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,630
It does not match anything in my database.

466
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,730
Michael, the Changs are approaching.

467
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,060
We've got company.

468
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,030
Mike! Sarah, sarah...

469
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,960
You two need to get a room.

470
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,230
What can I say?

471
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,460
Driving fast cars gets me hot.

472
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,460
Key.

473
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,630
# safe in the arms #

474
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,830
# that hold your every move #

475
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,830
Hangar doors, open.

476
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,600
Decontamination complete.

477
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,000
we better get that hood sterilized.

478
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,630
I was undercover.

479
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,760
That's like the best excuse ever!

480
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,960
Kitt, you got anything?

481
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,160
no, Michael.

482
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,600
It appears to have been an anomaly.

483
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,700
Why are you rubbing yourself on the car?

484
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm trying to get it to work again.

485
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,130
Get what to work?

486
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,160
Kit's screen wigged out when my tattoo touched it.

487
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,360
What are you talking about?

488
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,330
Scan my tattoo.

489
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,730
- What?  - Just scan it.

490
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,730
Well, it's a...tattoo.

491
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,460
Fast forward the recording.

492
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,900
And push in and enhance.

493
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,130
Can't see much with all that grinding going on.

494
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,900
Fine. Pull up kitt's recent history.

495
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,730
It's been cleared.

496
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,600
Did you erase it?

497
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,360
Excuse us.

498
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,030
Erase what?

499
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,130
Come on, we both know kitt records everything he sees and does.

500
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,430
I want to see the part you deleted.

501
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,130
- Mike...  - Sarah saw it too.

502
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,100
It was military ops, wasn't it?

503
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,060
Mike, I have no knowledge of what you saw

504
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,200
or what you think you saw.

505
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,500
But whatever it is, I'll look into it.

506
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,660
Okay?

507
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,330
Okay.

508
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,060
Did you turn the car over to Johnny?

509
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,060
- He set up a race for me.  - Good.

510
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,400
Stay close to them.

511
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,300
They'll have to move that shipment soon.

512
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
Michael, what the hell were you thinking?

513
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,560
Sarah could've been killed.

514
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,530
Charles, we've had this discussion before.

515
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,030
Sarah's been trained.

516
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,930
She was only supposed to be there for support, Alex.

517
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,430
Whose bright idea was it for her to steal a car?

518
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,700
Mine.

519
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,060
It was a bad call.

520
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,130
Yeah, damn right it was a bad call.

521
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,900
Look, I don't know what's going on between the two of you,

522
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,660
But you better start getting it together

523
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,560
And using your head, or somebody is gonna get hurt.

524
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,660
there's something in your eyes 

525
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,200
a little bit different... 

526
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,260
What are you watching?

527
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,700
I am researching

528
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,900
the delineation of gender roles in the classic western.

529
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,060
Men appear to be limited to fighting, playing cards

530
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,930
and consuming prodigious amounts of whiskey.

531
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah, the good old days.

532
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
I detected dr. Graiman's agitated vocal tone.

533
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,030
why did you not justify yourself

534
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,160
by explaining that stealing the car was sarah's idea?

535
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,900
Never snitch on a friend, kitt.

536
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,300
Besides, he's right. It is my responsibility.

537
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,400
#Maybe i oughta go apologize.#

538
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,760
I think I understand, Michael.

539
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,260
Being a man means being able to take a punch

540
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,800
in more ways than one.

541
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,960
That's for sure.

542
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,900
#More whiskey! That did it!#

543
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,860
#come, gentlemen, let's act like...#

544
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,100
#there's something in your eyes#

545
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,400
That's enough research, kitt.

546
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,500
We gotta hurry to make the race.

547
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,300
Mike...

548
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,730
I had Billy do some digging

549
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,130
Into something Sean said about being the middleman.

550
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,560
It seems he recently made some large cash deposits.

551
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,860
Bars are a cash business. So what?

552
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,200
So maybe he's involved with Johnny

553
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,800
In more ways than you think.

554
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,160
He did serve time for fencing stolen property.

555
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,030
Sean would never get involved with those guys.

556
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,900
So that's it? End of discussion?

557
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,630
Look, Sarah, Sean has a past.

558
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,300
I have a past. You have a past.

559
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,830
We're all in different places now.

560
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,430
Maybe we are.

561
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,300
initiating launch prep.

562
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,800
launch prep complete.

563
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,630
# I cannot cut this fairy tale #

564
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,730
# and treat you how I please #

565
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,060
# thank you for the fun of it #

566
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,560
# and leave you on your knees #

567
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,330
I got 200 large riding on this race.

568
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,760
You mean we've got it riding on this race.

569
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,060
There's something you should know.

570
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,460
I don't take disappointment well.

571
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,760
Good luck, bro.

572
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,360
Got any money riding on this race?

573
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,200
Nah.

574
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,730
Gotta have money to bet money.

575
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,600
After you win, come by the bar.

576
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,060
I got your drinks.

577
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,100
Handle.

578
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,360
sunglasses camera link established.

579
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,030
Got everything we need. let's get this started.

580
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,630
Mike.

581
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,260
Where are you and why are you whispering?

582
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,460
I'm at the Changs'garage.

583
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,530
I think the supplier's here.

584
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,300
kitt, can you Id the guy with Johnny?

585
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,000
He is Robert Bellows,

586
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,860
a weapons designer for lawrence livermore, a government-funded research and development lab.

587
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,530
That must be our guy.

588
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,460
the race is just a cover for the exchange.

589
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,460
That's why customs couldn't find the tech.

590
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,400
it's not hidden in the cars. It is the cars.

591
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,630
They're building weapons systems right into the GPS.

592
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,960
Sarah, listen to me. You have to leave right now.

593
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,430
Don't worry. They don't know.

594
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,030
Take them off.

595
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,260
Sarah, can you hear me? Sarah!

596
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,530
Sunglasses link has been terminated.

597
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,000
Kitt, we gotta find her.

598
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,560
Michael, Sarah is in the Changs'garage

599
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,730
located behind the roadhouse.

600
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,760
Yo, I knew there was something up

601
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,800
with her and her boyfriend.

602
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,360
Who do you work for?

603
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,700
Get up!

604
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,200
Forget about her.

605
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,200
Grab this. Hurry up.

606
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,200
Sarah.

607
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,230
Michael, I have Sarah.

608
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,530
Good. Get her out of here.

609
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,500
Kitt, we can't leave Mike behind.

610
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,630
I am following Michael's pre-existing orders.

611
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,330
Johnny's crew was headed north

612
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,560
when Kitt lost Mike's signal.

613
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,760
Can you amplify his GPS implant?

614
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,860
I have tried, Dr. Graiman.

615
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,930
But I have not been able

616
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
to locate Michael.

617
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,100
They must be used an advanced jamming device.

618
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,600
What about tracking the heat signatures

619
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,730
of their vehicle?

620
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,900
I am scanning the desert floor

621
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,860
using heat sensing satellites.

622
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,060
There are thousands of vehicles in the area.

623
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,800
it will take some time to differentiate

624
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,200
their individual heat signatures.

625
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,200
We don't have time.

626
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,660
I've gotta find Sean.

627
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,230
Hey, Sarah.

628
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,330
Mike needs your help.

629
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Where would Johnny go

630
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,030
if he wanted to get rid of someone?

631
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,460
I told him not to get involved with those guys.

632
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,060
There's a place on the mesa.

633
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
We're a half-hour away. It's right near Mount Monroe.

634
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,830
What I'm about to show you

635
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,400
is above any security clearance

636
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,030
You've ever had in the military.

637
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,530
What are you talking about?

638
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
Kitt, online.

639
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,500
Kitt, transform, 4x4.

640
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,260
Okay... Who's driving?

641
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,600
I am, Sean.

642
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,830
Forget the driving. Who's talking?

643
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,060
I am. You can call me Kitt.

644
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
That's enough fun. We've got work to do.

645
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,130
Nobody touches him. He's mine.

646
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,160
4x4 program is no longer necessary.

647
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,500
I suggest we transform for greater speed.

648
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,900
Transform, Kitt. Maximum speed.

649
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,160
Initiating transformation.

650
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,530
Transformation complete.

651
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,230
Take it easy, Hoss.

652
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,900
Sean, you okay?

653
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Get up.

654
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,930
Get up!

655
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,960
Shut the car down.

656
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,830
Shut it down or I kill her.

657
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,300
Kitt, deactivate.

658
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,530
I told them not to touch you.

659
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,400
I didn't want you to get involved.

660
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,760
But you didn't listen.

661
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,260
I love you like a brother, Mike,

662
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,760
But you know too much.

663
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,430
And the car's just a bonus.

664
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,900
I can't walk away from this kind of money.

665
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,260
You understand?

666
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,330
Sarah? Sarah, you okay?

667
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,100
Whoa, whoa, what is that thing?

668
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,730
Kitt?

669
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,900
What'd you do to him?

670
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,230
Save your breath, Mikey.

671
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,660
That's the military's next gen EMP.

672
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,160
Your talking car can hear you about as much as that SUV.

673
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,960
Good work.

674
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,660
Do we have anything?

675
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,930
We're extrapolating from Kitt's last known location,

676
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,960
Trying to close down roads and highways.

677
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,500
Billy. Kitt's transponder is dead.

678
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,860
I got nothing.

679
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,360
No wonder you faked your own death.

680
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,530
You just go from one black ops to another, don't you?

681
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,100
Yeah, well, the same could be said about you.

682
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,800
Hey, they owe me this.

683
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,400
I spent two years inside for them.

684
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,860
Thought you said shortcuts were the long way around.

685
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,830
You always were a boy scout, weren't you?

686
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,730
Good-bye.

687
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,030
Put the car in the truck

688
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,030
and send it to the port with the others.

689
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,060
What about the girl?

690
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,200
Dig another hole.

691
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,500
Bellows!

692
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,430
Hey, bro. Ready to have some fun?

693
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,060
Wait, I got something.

694
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,230
It's super faint.

695
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,930
I hacked a mobile phone network

696
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
And used their towers to search for Kitt's signal.

697
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,400
Amplify it. Get us a direct feed.

698
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,960
Reroute power through Kitt's backup systems.

699
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,160
Come on, Kitt.

700
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,900
Let him go! Shoot him!

701
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,400
No! Argh!

702
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,260
He's back online.

703
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,760
Take cover, Michael. Activating laser.

704
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,230
Michael, Sean is escaping.

705
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,930
Come on, let's go.

706
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,930
According to my scanners,

707
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,700
Sean is headed directly toward a drop-off

708
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,230
hidden behind the next rise.

709
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,100
Kitt, Sean can't see that drop-off.

710
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,960
We gotta stop him. Try to cut him off.

711
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,460
Michael, the angle of intercept is rapidly closing.

712
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,830
We're getting close.

713
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,860
At his current speed,

714
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,500
Sean will be unable to stop in time.

715
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,830
Hey, thought you'd want to know

716
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,560
We recovered the stolen vehicles

717
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,400
and the military tech at the port of L.A.

718
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,230
Good job.

719
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,400
You find out about what happened with my tattoo?

720
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,930
You mean those files you saw?

721
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,830
Like Kitt said, probably an anomaly.

722
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,300
Dr. Graiman's working on it. Shouldn't happen again.

723
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,300
Still watching the cowboy movie?

724
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,900
It is a fascinating narrative.

725
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,700
In turns, dramatic, comedic, suspenseful,

726
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,600
and unabashedly heroic.

727
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,000
Sounds like a great story.

728
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,660
You seem troubled, Michael.

729
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,800
He was my friend.

730
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,860
I am still learning

731
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,460
about the complexities of friendship,

732
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,730
But I would be honored to count you as mine.

733
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,430
Every cowboy needs a sidekick.

734
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,300
I would not sell yourself short, Michael.

735
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,600
You are much more than a horse.

736
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,930
Hey, sense of humor. That's new.

737
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,700
So is friendship.
