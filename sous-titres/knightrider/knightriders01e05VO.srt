1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,360
- Loose ball!  - Oh.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,060
Picked up by...

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,930
The SSC has requested we review your cover identity together.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,660
They got you babysitting now?

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,030
You know you don't have to do everything you're told.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,430
The SSC has requested we review your cover...

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,660
Okay,okay.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,360
Cover's Jack Miller.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,460
Newbury,Kansas.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,930
Marine corps,special forces.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,300
I assaulted my C.O.,

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,100
skipped my court martial,currently listed as awol.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,230
Happy?

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,760
I have a question,Michael.

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,460
Why would a soldier assault his own commanding officer?

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,800
War can make a man do all kinds of things he can't explain.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,860
Kind of like women.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,060
Don't listen to him,Kit.

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,060
He may know war,but what he thinks he knows

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,100
about women is far more dangerous.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,300
Kitt,run the algorithm on the new transform system.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,630
Let's make sure it's clear.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Commencing algorithmic preview.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,530
Got to say,the whole brainiac,gear-head thing...

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,500
Very hot.

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,000
Hmm.

27
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,560
Shouldn't you be getting your game face on or something?

28
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,200
Who says I'm not?

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,730
What are you doing this weekend?

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,960
Nothing.

31
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,330
None of your business.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Nothing.

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,760
For your birthday?

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,860
Just stay home alone and watch TV.

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,660
The alone part sounds really nice.

36
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,230
When I get back,I'm taking you out and getting you drunk.

37
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,130
We're celebrating. That's a promise.

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,130
Wow.

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,230
That sounds like a dream date.

40
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,360
I will count the hours.

41
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,060
Whoa there,speed racer.

42
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,700
What happened to your face?

43
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,130
Oh,I was playing basketball

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
and caught an elbow.

45
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,060
Caught an elbow.

46
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,730
Looks more like three or four elbows and a knee.

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,030
It's not that bad,okay.

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,660
Really?

49
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,130
You look like something that should have stayed in Vegas.

50
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,360
I got into an argument with some idiot

51
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,530
over cracks for war craft.

52
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
And I took a beat down,okay?

53
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,630
There.

54
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,730
Are we all in the loop now?

55
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,460
Awesome.

56
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,130
His name is Walt Cooperton.

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,330
He runs a private military organization.

58
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,930
Was into a lot of nasty business in Iraq.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,930
That kind of stuff doesn't make the evening news.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,060
- Mercenaries.  - Six months ago,

61
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,430
D.O.D. Terminated his contract

62
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,260
at the request of the state department.

63
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,860
Must've been pretty messy,

64
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,830
since state's not releasing any of the details.

65
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,560
Now he's operating a compound outside of Phoenix.

66
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,060
Training a private militia...

67
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,260
Hard-core extremists,constitutionalists,

68
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,730
a real fun crowd.

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,430
Legally,we can't touch him.

70
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,430
The compound's privately owned.

71
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,030
Claims he's just training for company missions overseas.

72
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,500
But you don't believe him.

73
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,160
Take a look at this.

74
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,230
Our own declaration of independence

75
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,000
states that to secure our rights,

76
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,160
Governments are institute

77
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,060
amongst men.

78
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,660
Deriving their just powers from the consent

79
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,660
of the governed.

80
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,160
When the government becomes destructive of these ends,

81
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,460
It is the right of the people to abolish it.

82
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,130
I say beyond that,

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,830
It is their sacred duty.

84
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,930
It looks like someone found religion.

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,160
A little more than that.

86
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,160
Two weeks ago,he purchased state-of-the-art

87
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,760
Remote triggering devices.

88
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,830
We're talking military grade,

89
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,100
for multi-megaton ballistic weaponry.

90
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,830
Guy's definitely got an attitude problem.

91
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,430
We need you to infiltrate Cooperton's group

92
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,400
and find out what he's planning on doing with all his new toys.

93
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,200
And disable all their operational capability.

94
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,800
There goes the weekend.

95
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,030
One more thing,Michael.

96
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,800
There must be no communication

97
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,200
with me or the SSC.

98
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,960
If you are wearing the earwig,it will be detected.

99
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,400
Anything else?

100
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,330
Maybe I should do the whole mission blindfolded

101
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,060
or one arm tied behind my back.

102
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,760
Doing it with one arm was mentioned

103
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,330
in the dossier.

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,930
Wait,was that a joke?

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,930
Did you just make a joke,Kitt?

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,630
Prepare for transformation.

107
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,800
Transformation complete.

108
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Mike's out there taking on the world,

109
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,130
I can't even take on one gamer geek.

110
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,630
So do something about it.

111
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,600
Grow a pair and learn how to fight.

112
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
Who's going to teach me?

113
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,200
You?

114
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,900
Rec room,tonight.

115
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,560
And don't make me come looking for you.

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,830
Zoe,go easy on him.

117
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,530
Easy is not my speed.

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,760
His name is Oren Moss.

119
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,260
He was affiliated with a militia group in Utah

120
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,430
before he became Cooperton's lieutenant.

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,600
That's the idiot I need to talk to.

122
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,860
Michael,

123
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,800
My sensors indicate that these men are armed.

124
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,400
It would not be wise to approach them

125
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,200
Without a means of defending yourself.

126
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,630
One thing about soldiers,Kitt,

127
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,430
they are eyes forward predators.

128
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,660
You can lure them anywhere if they think you're prey.

129
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Huh.

130
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh,man,these are good.

131
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,330
You weren't planning on eating these,were you?

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,230
You're going to get hurt,cowboy.

133
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm not a cowboy.

134
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,830
I'm a marine.

135
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,130
Name is Jack Miller.

136
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
I'm looking for Walt Cooperton.

137
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,260
Don't know him.

138
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,160
If I were at liberty to do so,

139
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,900
me and my boys here would turn you into a puddle.

140
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,260
But I'm not at liberty.

141
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,930
If you've got a brain in your head,

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,560
You'll get your dumb ass back in that truck

143
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,030
and drive.

144
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,460
Well,Kitt,let's get us some hummer.

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,460
Michael,I heard moss threaten to turn you into a puddle.

146
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,360
while that is physically impossible,

147
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,130
It was rather direct.

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
Perhaps another approach would be prudent.

149
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,160
No,this is the fun part.

150
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,700
This is where the hunt begins.

151
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,000
Take it easy,Mike.

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,700
These guys know this back country inside and out.

153
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,830
Everyone relax. I know what I'm doing.

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
We are completely surrounded.

155
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,630
Shall I initiate defensive protocols?

156
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,400
No.

157
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,230
They got me right where I want them.

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,530
Mike,what the hell's going on?

159
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,500
Shut down all communications.

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,660
Mike,wait!

161
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,630
I'm in.

162
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,930
You have pretty nice form.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,760
Except you keep dropping your lead hand.

164
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,930
Someone's going to get you good

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,200
if you're not careful.

166
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,500
Let's try this again.

167
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,530
What are you doing here?

168
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,030
You know...

169
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,260
I bet when you smile,you really light up a room.

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,730
Get them!

171
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,230
Michael's endorphin and adrenaline levels

172
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,730
are excessively elevated.

173
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,530
Indicating the probability of internal injuries.

174
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,800
Shall I intervene?

175
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,660
This is what Mike is trained for.

176
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,300
We can't compromise the mission.

177
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,530
You're going to have to take a breath sooner or later.

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,530
And when you do,your lungs will fill with water

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,060
and you're going to drown.

180
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,530
Okay,okay,I'll talk.

181
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,430
Please.

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,430
The reason I'm here is...

183
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,500
I forgot.

184
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,060
Damn... I lost it.

185
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,400
I swear.

186
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,660
It was right there  on the tip of my tongue.

187
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey,

188
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
I'm kind of thirsty,

189
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,500
do you think I could get some water?

190
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,160
All right,that's enough.

191
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,330
Well.

192
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,500
I see you've met my girl.

193
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah,she's a real delicate flower.

194
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,530
Let's talk.

195
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,330
You have a navy cross,

196
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,760
bronze star,

197
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,330
purple heart,

198
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,730
Three times.

199
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,660
Never afraid to take one for the team.

200
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,260
Mm.

201
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,260
You were with O.E.F. at Mazari Sharif?

202
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,360
Yeah,I was part of the drop team

203
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,430
that took the compound.

204
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
What kind of support did you have?

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,500
F/A-18 Hornets,Daisy Cutters,AC-130s.

206
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,400
They tore them up for us pretty good.

207
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,000
You must have jointed up with the 337th.

208
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,130
Those are some hard-charging humps.

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
I read that.

210
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,460
I guess I'd know for sure if I was in South Korea.

211
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,000
337th never rotated in theatre.

212
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,230
Don't screw with me,sir.

213
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,730
I danced at your welcome party,

214
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,130
and I'm not complaining,but if you don't want me here,

215
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
just say the word.

216
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,000
This country was founded on a healthy distrust

217
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,900
of authority.

218
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,300
Live free or die,

219
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,560
that is America.

220
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,500
Now some 230 years later,we've traded a British despot

221
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,860
for a new breed of tyranny.

222
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,230
The federal government,it will not stand,

223
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,260
not as long as there is breath in my lungs.

224
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,230
You'll find I'm like-minded in that,sir.

225
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,330
Good.

226
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Get yourself cleaned up.

227
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,460
We chow in an hour.

228
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,730
Kitt,can you hear me?

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Good to hear your voice again,Michael.

230
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm going to scope things out tonight,

231
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,260
see what I can find.

232
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,760
You're going to have to be my eyes.

233
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,130
We will have a satellite overhead.

234
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,730
Don't worry,I've got your six.

235
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,500
That is the correct usage of the expression,is it not?

236
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,160
I got your back,you got mine.

237
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,360
That's how we roll.

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,530
Talking to yourself in the can?

239
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,660
What are you?

240
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,130
Some kind of P.T.S.D. Whack-job?

241
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,430
Maybe I am.

242
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,960
Or maybe you're just hearing the voices again.

243
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,360
You like hurting people,don't you,sweetheart?

244
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,600
Why?

245
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,300
You want to get hurt?

246
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,160
You and I have unfinished business.

247
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,460
My hands aren't tied now.

248
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,430
Might make it a little more interesting.

249
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,460
Oh,you do like it rough,don't you?

250
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,500
That's what I thought.

251
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
Do you think she believes that?

252
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,700
We'll find out.

253
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,430
I said punch me,not feel me up.

254
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,560
All right,geez.

255
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,830
No wonder you got your butt kicked,Billy.

256
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,160
Are you even sure you've got a y-chromosome?

257
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,230
Let's check under the hood.

258
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,360
Back off.

259
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,400
Little aggression,nice.

260
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,430
That's what I'm talking about.

261
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,960
So come on. Now hit me.

262
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,130
I'm not going to hit a girl.

263
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,530
Oh,really?

264
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm not saying you're going to hit me.

265
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,260
I'm saying take your best shot...

266
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,400
Bitch.

267
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,730
Rule one,

268
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
if you're going to make the first move,

269
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,100
make it count.

270
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
You see an opening,

271
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,630
you take it... hard.

272
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,230
Let's do it again.

273
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,660
Okay,you ready?

274
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,400
I am ready,Michael.

275
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,930
Okay,Kitt,talk to me.

276
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,260
Michael,be careful.

277
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,560
There is a guard approaching from behind your cover.

278
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,100
You are clear to proceed.

279
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,660
Okay,Kitt,what's next?

280
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,830
Cooperton's tent is to your 12 o'clock.

281
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,800
Base to unit 3,what's your 20?

282
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,930
Unit 3,copy.

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,960
Area 4,it's all clear.

284
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,330
Copy that.

285
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,730
Deploy along the south fence to the perimeter.

286
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Roger that.

287
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,730
Sarah,are you out there?

288
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,860
I've got you.

289
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,360
Kitt,I'm uploading an application

290
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,730
that should penetrate cooperton's firewall.

291
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,630
Let me know when you're in.

292
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,960
Stupid.

293
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,530
I have access,Sarah.

294
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,030
Okay.

295
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,530
Now it's a party.

296
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,730
Kitt,we're looking for any documents

297
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,230
that might clue us in on what this guy's been up to.

298
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,160
Also going to need schematics of the compound.

299
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,500
If he's hiding a weapon,we need to find it.

300
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,000
Building up schematics,searching for weapons...

301
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,100
Chateau margaux '86.

302
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,560
Something's not right here,Sarah.

303
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,000
Are you kidding?

304
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,560
That is an epic bottle of wine.

305
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,600
The guy's got a diamond rolly,

306
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,160
a closet full of $6,000 suits,

307
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,560
and come on.

308
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,500
Maybe if the wine were Californian,I'd believe it.

309
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,100
But no self-respecting far right freak

310
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,600
is going to drink French wine.

311
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,960
Yeah,what a waste.

312
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,630
Kitt...

313
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,230
Search cooperton's computer for personnel files.

314
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,760
Run backgrounds on everyone.

315
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,460
They'll have aliases and assumed identities,

316
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,660
so you'll have to go deep.

317
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,760
Go deepest on cooperton himself.

318
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,060
I want to know everything about him

319
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,400
Since the day he was born.

320
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,600
I will get right on it.

321
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,960
But I think I have found something.

322
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,960
There is a large structure at the south east perimeter.

323
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,730
And I am picking up traces of explosives.

324
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,160
Let's check it out.

325
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,530
There's nothing here,Kitt.

326
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,500
I am still picking up traces of explosives.

327
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,100
Whatever they have must be large-scale

328
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,460
to leave such a strong chemical fingerprint.

329
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,260
Tap into the compound's video security files.

330
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,230
If they moved it,we need to know where.

331
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,700
Michael,you need to leave at once.

332
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,930
Someone is approaching...

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,130
fast.

334
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,730
Told you about dropping that lead hand.

335
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Who are you?

336
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,330
Really?

337
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Jack Miller,232nd,Zulu.

338
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,930
Give it a rest,Jack.

339
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
Who sent you,N.S.A.? F.B.I?

340
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,460
My name's Cassandra Banks.

341
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,730
MI-6.

342
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,900
We've been tracking cooperton for over a year.

343
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,860
MI-6?

344
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,560
What,like licensed to kill,double-o status?

345
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,160
In her majesty's secret service... that MI-6?

346
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,000
What am I supposed to call you,Jane Bond?

347
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,860
Sure,if I can call you G.I.... jackass.

348
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,130
If you're MI-6,

349
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
How come my people don't know you're here?

350
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,400
Am I supposed to ring them up

351
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,900
And wait for someone like you to stumble in

352
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,660
A few days before our target is about to attack?

353
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,730
He's going in the next few days?

354
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
Best guess.

355
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,130
Cooperton has acquired a massive conventional weapon...

356
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,930
Modified,smaller scaled Moab.

357
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,660
It's quite the little prize.

358
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,930
What's he planning on doing with it?

359
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,260
It's a demolitions bomb.

360
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,100
I would venture he's planning to knock something down.

361
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,100
And brilliantly deduced. The target?

362
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,930
I don't know.

363
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,130
Are you going to lower your weapon?

364
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,660
Are you?

365
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,430
Go.

366
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,630
Take her alive

367
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,100
if you can.

368
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,730
You've got a nice accent there,honey.

369
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,860
But still,how do I know you're not setting me up?

370
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,660
I haven't opened fire yet.

371
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,100
That only tells me that you want to live.

372
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,700
It doesn't tell me whose side you're on.

373
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,930
Look... About six months ago,

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,330
I thought cooperton was on to me.

375
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,660
So I scuttled my communications.

376
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,430
I've been in the dark since.

377
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,700
So if you're who you say you are,

378
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,660
I'm rather glad you're here.

379
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
Michael,there are several  armed guards approaching.

380
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,430
I've located a side exit. It's directly to your left.

381
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,830
I will meet you there in ten seconds.

382
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,130
Got it,make it a party for two.

383
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,700
You have someone else on the inside?

384
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,660
It's a little hard to explain,come on.

385
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,500
Who's bloody driving?

386
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,660
Just get in.

387
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,830
Kitt,let's go.

388
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,260
Occupant restraint system active.

389
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,960
Kitt? You're talking to your truck?

390
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,230
It is a pleasure to meet you,Cassandra.

391
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,130
And he's talking to me?

392
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,730
Let's see Bond's car do that.

393
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,830
Let's go!

394
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,430
Michael,my sensors indicate the road ahead

395
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Is heavily mined.

396
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,160
Please secure yourselves,

397
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,960
I am initiating evasive maneuvers.

398
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,730
Transformation will improve my mobility.

399
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,330
Kitt,transform now!

400
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,360
You all right? I think so.

401
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,900
Kitt,are you all right?

402
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,060
I've hit a mine in mid-transformation,

403
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,400
Compromising multiple systems.

404
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,730
Can you get us out of this ditch?

405
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,330
My systems are not responding.

406
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,800
I am unable to access my diagnostic protocols

407
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,930
To fully assess damage.

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,660
I take that as a "no."

409
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,000
Michael,you will be captured if you do not leave now.

410
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,130
Sarah...

411
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,830
Kitt's down.

412
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,200
We're on it,Mike. Get yourself out of there.

413
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,460
No,I'm not leaving him.

414
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,830
Michael,go now.

415
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,230
Find them.

416
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,160
Shoot them on sight.

417
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,330
Kitt.

418
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,360
What's your status?

419
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,960
Tell me what I'm working with.

420
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,960
The blast must have breached a vulnerability

421
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,130
in my undercarriage,during transformation.

422
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm going to attempt accessing diagnostics

423
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,360
by shutting down and rebooting

424
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,930
with my secondary mainframe.

425
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,100
Okay,you got any Intel for me

426
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
before you go night night?

427
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,930
Your opponent has superior numbers

428
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,160
and an advanced knowledge of the terrain.

429
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,600
Okay,tell me something I don't know.

430
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,430
The amount of knowledge that you don't know

431
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,430
would take multiple lifetimes to...

432
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,830
Kitt,I need options.

433
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,430
As I am unable to assist you directly,

434
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,930
your best option is to move south,towards the river.

435
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
How far south?

436
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,660
How do you feel about Rio?

437
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,960
Initiating shut down.

438
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,630
You,that way. Go,go,go,go.

439
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,160
Okay,Michael,we're flying blind here.

440
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,460
Temporary,just until Kitt is back online.

441
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,760
Okay...

442
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,560
We made it to the river,

443
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,600
and I'm telling you this isn't going to work,

444
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
you need to find us another route.

445
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,800
Let me see what I can find.

446
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,060
Mike...

447
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,060
I'm looking at your coordinates,

448
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,600
there's just no other way.

449
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm telling you,we can't make it down to the river.

450
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,800
The descent is too steep.

451
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,660
Uh...

452
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,400
There is one way.

453
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,830
Oh,hell no.

454
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,360
You got to be kidding me,right?

455
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,860
Sarah,Kitt's back up.

456
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,230
Oh,thank god.

457
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,330
Kitt,I thought you said the river was our best option.

458
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,660
It is.

459
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,960
You have approximately a 30% chance of survival

460
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,360
if you make it across the river.

461
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,630
Compared with the near certainty of being shot

462
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,130
if you do not.

463
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,960
Always looking on the bright side.

464
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,960
He's right,Mike.

465
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,130
If you can get to the other side,

466
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,460
I've coordinates to a clearing.

467
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,630
If you can get there,we might be able to evacuate.

468
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,860
Okay,just rewind a second.

469
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,760
You're saying you want us to jump...

470
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,400
Into the river?

471
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,600
You know...

472
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,500
Phobias are really just symptoms

473
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,000
of a repressed painful experience.

474
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,100
The jump is a 67-foot fall into mountain run off,

475
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,760
33 degrees,low bottoms,sharp rocks.

476
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,760
Probability of injury,extreme.

477
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,130
That would be the painful experience

478
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,900
I'm trying to repress,okay?

479
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
We need to back track

480
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,430
and hike out of here...

481
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,960
I guess we're getting wet.

482
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,900
Current's taking them downstream.

483
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,560
I want that river forded and I want them found.

484
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,930
We've got two hours before we lose our window.

485
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,530
They're going to be cold,They're going to be tired.

486
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,900
Let's finish it.

487
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,300
Kitt,Mike's not responding on earwig.

488
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,030
What's happening?

489
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,230
The earwig was damaged in the fall.

490
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,060
If Michael and Cassandra do not get warm,

491
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,230
hypothermia will set in within the next seven minutes.

492
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,200
I'm attempting to reestablish contact now.

493
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,500
Find him,Kitt.

494
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,060
Wait.

495
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,430
What's wrong?

496
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,060
My ankle.

497
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,900
How bad is it?

498
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,500
You should be getting on just fine.

499
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,500
In about two months.

500
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,360
Get me the extra clip.

501
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,900
I'll buy you some time.

502
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,600
Stiff upper lip and all that English ya ya.

503
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,630
The crew that I ran with,

504
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,260
we had a little saying.

505
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,060
"Leave no man behind."

506
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,300
I'm not a man.

507
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,460
Even better.

508
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,160
Look,if we don't find shelter and get warm,

509
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,830
we're both going to die.

510
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,160
So forgive me for being so forward,

511
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,660
but I'm going to have to ask you

512
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,060
to take off your clothes.

513
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,130
My communications are not fully functioning,

514
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
but I did get a fix on Michael's position.

515
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,930
My sensors indicate

516
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,700
they are approaching stage two hypothermia.

517
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,930
If they are unable to raise their body temperature,

518
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
they will die.

519
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,530
Can you get me a visual,Kitt?

520
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
We'll have to divert power from the repair

521
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,600
in order to up link.

522
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,130
I just need to check on him.

523
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
Diverting power now.

524
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,360
You know what I wish?

525
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,130
That we were in a hotel room in Rio?

526
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,730
Besides that.

527
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,160
I wish I could forget the things I've done.

528
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,200
We're not going to die.

529
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,760
You don't need to confess.

530
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,500
You know,it's funny.

531
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,930
I'd give anything to remember

532
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
just to know what I've done.

533
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,960
Then I'd probably want to forget.

534
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,900
Mike...

535
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,460
I'm sorry I was so hard on you during the interrogation.

536
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,130
Because I had to make it look good.

537
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,630
Don't worry about it.

538
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,300
I've had worse first dates.

539
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,230
Is this a date then?

540
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,730
Sarah,I have acquired the visual you requested.

541
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
Main screen,please.

542
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,100
Sarah,I must tell you that...

543
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,260
Main screen now,Kitt.

544
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,960
What is that?

545
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,800
Huh.

546
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,960
Shut off the imaging,Kitt.

547
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,260
Mike's just fine.

548
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,130
And you need the energy to finish your repairs.

549
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,060
Call me when he's on the move.

550
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,830
Mike.

551
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,100
Sarah,is that you? Are we back up?

552
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Mike,what's going on? Where are you?

553
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,600
Something's wrong.

554
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,360
Cooperton's men,they were right on us.

555
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,500
And now they're just gone. Are we walking into a trap?

556
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,300
How close are you to the evacuation point?

557
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,700
Just about there now.

558
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,830
- I thought we were going to be evacuated.  - We are.

559
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,700
In what? This beat-up matchbox car?

560
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
Oh,come on,he's a Mustang...

561
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,600
An American icon.

562
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,830
An icon? Really?

563
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
As far as I know,no one ever wrote a song

564
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,200
About a Bentley.

565
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,760
I think I know why

566
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,360
You're not having any trouble from Cooperton.

567
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,200
He's making his move.

568
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,730
The weapon's mobile.

569
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
I repeat,the target's hot.

570
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,660
How's Kitt?

571
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,730
Still not 100%

572
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,060
- How close is he to being ready?  - He's functional.

573
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,900
He's just limited with his weapons and communications.

574
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,730
Fine,I'll take what I got and do it old school.

575
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Old school?

576
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,200
I'll drive.

577
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,160
The target and four humvee vehicles

578
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,260
Are moving south down highway 17.

579
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,000
If we head west on route 212,

580
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,730
We should be able to intercept.

581
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,900
How much time?

582
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,030
That depends. How fast can this thing go?

583
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,760
This thing?

584
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,630
Are you kidding me?

585
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,360
Prepare to scream like a little girl.

586
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,400
Kitt,show her what you got.

587
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,760
Michael,my systems are slow to respond,

588
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,560
But they are functioning.

589
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,460
Scream like a what?

590
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,330
Kitt,what the hell?

591
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,260
You might want to...

592
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,130
Right on schedule,gentlemen.

593
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,700
Keep it tight.

594
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Over there.

595
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,800
Cooperton's Humvees.

596
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,330
Michael,my search protocols

597
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,160
are operational again.

598
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,630
I can begin those background checks

599
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,330
- You requested on Cooperton's men.  - Good.

600
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm telling you,something's not right with these guys,Kitt.

601
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,000
How are we doing on the target list?

602
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,700
We're putting it together now.

603
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,500
Michael,I believe your instincts are correct.

604
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,200
Cooperton is not who he appears to be.

605
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,360
What do you got,Kitt?

606
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,930
Cooperton and his lieutenant Oren Moss

607
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,400
Are international mercenaries both implicated

608
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,700
In a major bank robbery in Dubai?

609
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,860
Moss escaped capture,

610
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,160
And Cooperton was never officially charged.

611
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,100
However,the incident did end his association with the D.O.D.

612
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,930
What are a couple of mercenary bank robbers

613
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,300
doing with right-wing extremists?

614
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,030
It doesn't make any sense.

615
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,700
What the hell is going on now?

616
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,100
Stay with the truck.

617
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,930
Oh,my god.

618
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,860
Sarah,I think we've got our target.

619
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,860
Mike,we're with you.

620
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,160
Alert local police and fire.

621
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,600
We need support at the dam now.

622
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,560
Michael,my sensors indicate

623
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,830
The truck does not have a driver.

624
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,100
It appears to be operated by remote control.

625
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,260
You'll have to override it.

626
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,300
Do it now.

627
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,130
Sit tight.

628
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,160
What? Mike?

629
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,530
Mike!

630
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,400
I have done an analysis

631
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,600
Of the dam's structural design and calculated

632
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,930
The optimum blast point.

633
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,930
The truck will reach optimum target location

634
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,100
In 47 seconds.

635
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,800
Yeah,that's about right.

636
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,100
Kitt,you need to stop this truck.

637
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,560
Commencing override protocol on the remote control.

638
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,330
Billy,I got three wires going to the detonator.

639
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,060
White,yellow,and blue.

640
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,330
Need a little help here.

641
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,760
- You can't be serious.  - Billy,now!

642
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,160
This is serious.

643
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,100
Okay,this doesn't make any sense.

644
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,660
Black is usually the ground. That's the one you gotta cut.

645
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,330
- Is there a black line?  - No!

646
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,600
There's no black,come on.

647
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,700
Michael,

648
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,730
Optimal blast site in 15 seconds.

649
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,930
You're gonna have to go with your gut,man.

650
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,800
My guts are about to be all over the damn road,Billy.

651
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,260
Take a breath and tell me what to do.

652
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,230
How much time do I have?

653
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,600
Less than ten seconds.

654
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,160
Oh,god.

655
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,160
- Red.  - White.

656
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
- Red.  - White.

657
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,530
- Red.  - White.

658
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,530
- White.  - White. It's white.

659
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
- Go with white.  - White.

660
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,760
The weapon is disarmed.

661
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,830
Whoo!

662
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,560
Remote control override complete.

663
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,830
I will stop the vehicle.

664
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
Please hang on tightly,Michael.

665
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,830
Are you all right,Michael?

666
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,100
Yeah.

667
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,400
I guess I can take riding a one megaton bomb

668
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,630
off my bucket list.

669
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,500
Looks like they scrambled

670
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,930
the entire Phoenix police department.

671
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,030
Mike,we found this.

672
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,230
A gold shipment downtown

673
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,260
is being moved to the federal reserve

674
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,000
this afternoon,a value of over $250 million.

675
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,130
You wanna know what Cooperton's doing

676
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,460
with a bunch of extremists?

677
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,530
He's using them.

678
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,030
The bomb was a decoy.

679
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,360
It's a gold heist.

680
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,860
All right,gentlemen,let's do it.

681
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,300
If Cooperton and Moss are successful,

682
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,830
they will have committed

683
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,160
the biggest gold heist in U.S. history.

684
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,160
Thanks,kitt. no pressure or anything.

685
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
Hey,Cooperton,looks like it's your army versus mine.

686
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,550
Give it up.

687
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,760
Looks like the revolution's over.

688
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,030
Well,you're wrong about that.

689
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,860
The revolution's just begun.

690
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,260
You really should stand down,son.

691
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,160
You're outgunned here.

692
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,900
Funny,I was about to say

693
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
the same thing about you.

694
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Kitt,

695
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,800
show them your dance moves.

696
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,260
What the hell is that?

697
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,330
That's my ride.

698
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,360
On my command!

699
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,960
You really shouldn't have done that.

700
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,630
clear!

701
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,630
Whoa.

702
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,060
police! Put your weapons down!

703
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,260
Get on the ground now!

704
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,930
All right,all right.

705
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,560
Don't move,don't move! Let me see your hands.

706
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,560
On your knees! On the ground!

707
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,900
Clear!

708
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,330
Don't you move!

709
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,860
Hands on your head.

710
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,530
On your head!

711
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,530
I'm gonna have to get one of those.

712
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,500
Drop me a line from the joint.

713
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
I'll send you a brochure.

714
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,300
oh.

715
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,000
How's the ankle?

716
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,130
It's going to need some attention.

717
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,530
You're one hell of an operative.

718
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,900
I couldn't have done it without you.

719
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,330
Somehow I doubt that.

720
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,660
Guess you can put your Cooperton file to bed,

721
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,800
get home,back to your life.

722
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,360
Yeah,it's been a while.

723
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,160
I don't know what I would have done

724
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,360
if you hadn't come along.

725
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,060
You've been practicing.

726
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,230
I'm gonna go back out there and kick that guy's butt.

727
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,500
Yeah,you could do that.

728
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,860
Or you could take me out for a drink.

729
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,200
really?

730
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,600
You are just so cute.

731
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,030
Yes,

732
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,830
- you can buy me a drink.  - All right.

733
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,130
Someday.

734
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,730
Some...

735
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,360
Sarah,are you staying in the pod tonight?

736
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah,I'm a little tired.

737
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,830
It's been a long few days.

738
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,200
I'll drive home in the morning.

739
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,530
I thought it was customary

740
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,100
to mark the day of one's birth

741
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,200
with celebration among family and friends.

742
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,200
Yeah,it's customary.

743
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,360
I'm just not into it.

744
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,130
Happy birthday,Sarah.

745
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,260
Thank you,Kitt.

746
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:34,800
Sarah,I think there is something you should hear.

747
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,060
I'd love to take this further,but...

748
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,900
Is there someone else?

749
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,300
It's complicated.

750
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,060
Wow,that guy is hard to track.

751
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,300
Hey,Sarah,I need you in the SSC.

752
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,730
Yeah,be right there.

753
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,360
Mike?

754
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,600
Lights.

755
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,430
Happy birthday,Sarah.

756
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,300
Oh,my god,I don't believe it.

757
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,760
Thanks for saving my life...

758
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,900
again.

759
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,630
This is really wonderful.

760
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,160
I told you I was taking you out.

761
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,200
Wanna go for a ride in my car?

762
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,630
You know,Kitt,we're not supposed to joyride.

763
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
True,Sarah,but then again,

764
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,260
we do not always have to do everything we are told.

765
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


766
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
