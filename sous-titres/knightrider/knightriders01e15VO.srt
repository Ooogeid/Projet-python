1
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:06,782
This is Tara two, Charlie nine,

2
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:09,082
Your transporters failed to copy!

3
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:13,382
Charlie nine, can you hear me?

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,082
Are you OK?

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,682
This is Tara two, Charlie nine,

6
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,483
Your transporters failed to copy!

7
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:22,651
Charlie nine, can you hear me?

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,087
Charlie nine, come on back I can't hear.

9
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:34,846
Michael. Wake up, Michael.

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:38,168
- Kitt - I'm sorry,

11
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:42,287
But I've encountered a possible situation.

12
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:44,423
What time is it?

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,826
It is 4:17 am.

14
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:49,729
Don't bad guys ever sleep?

15
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,863
No.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,565
But neither do I.

17
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,412
Morning, party people.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,780
What's the word?

19
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,314
Plane disappeared.

20
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:10,516
That is two words.

21
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,584
And planes don't just disappear.

22
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,586
This one did.

23
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:16,555
Vanished like my prom date at midnight.

24
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,290
Last contact was 4:03 this morning,

25
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,958
Over the sierras.

26
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:21,227
It was on course, smooth sailing,

27
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:22,428
Then-- disappeared.

28
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,029
Houdini's handcuffs.

29
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:25,464
Copperfield's fiancee.

30
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,999
It didn't disappear.

31
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,467
Something obviously happened.

32
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:30,202
When did Mike and Kitt leave?

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,771
4:30 in the morning.

34
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:34,106
Kitt wake you up again?

35
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:35,671
Yeah, and while we're on the subject,

36
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,857
I think we need to have

37
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:38,043
A little chat about boundaries.

38
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,034
We are approaching the latitude and

39
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,782
Longitude of the plane's last known GPS location.

40
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,384
Don't try and change the subject.

41
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,424
That would be changing the subject, Michael.

42
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,443
I am detecting an area of

43
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:56,194
Extreme heat just over this hill.

44
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:57,930
It could be a crash site.

45
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:00,533
Let us know when you turn up.

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,101
Let's get dirty.

47
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:04,503
I don't get dirty.

48
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,103
Initiating transformation

49
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:11,812
Transformation complete.

50
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,396
In approximately 200 yards,

51
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:16,281
We will arrive at the heated area.

52
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,769
And be aware, if the plane did crash here,

53
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,953
The scene could be very disturbing.

54
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,512
The wreckage appears to be that of a Leer jet.

55
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:48,581
Contact the NTSB.

56
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,248
Tell them we located the crash site.

57
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:51,984
I must protest, Michael.

58
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,388
You don't want to contact the NTSB?

59
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:59,091
I don't believe we've found the crash site.

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,028
Big smoking hole, leer jet wreckage...

61
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,697
What am I missing here, kitt?

62
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,843
Satellite imagery shows that the

63
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:09,702
Wreckage is spread across a 97-yard radius.

64
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,058
But a leer jet, crashing at minimal speed,

65
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,565
Would scatter wreckage

66
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,073
Over at least a quarter mile.

67
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,408
Could be an anomaly.

68
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:17,676
Blast radius aren't exactly consistent.

69
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,044
True.

70
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,453
But my analysis of the crater

71
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,795
Is registering traces of ammonium nitrate,

72
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:25,740
A chemical not found in any plane

73
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,686
But used in explosives.

74
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,338
So maybe something in the plane's cargo

75
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,923
Contained ammonium nitrate.

76
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:32,591
That, too, is possible.

77
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,360
But look at the tree line.

78
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:38,964
It's completely intact.

79
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,133
This isn't the crash site.

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,873
It's probable someone

81
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,546
Disabled the plane's transponder,

82
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:46,466
Then relayed the GPS location

83
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,386
To a second party on the ground,

84
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,431
Who faked the crash using explosives

85
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,477
And discarded plane parts.

86
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,847
Well, why would someone fake a plane crash?

87
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,182
Isn't that what we get paid to figure out?

88
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,018
You get paid?

89
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:47,838
Run the call numbers through your database,

90
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,173
See what you can find.

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,991
The numbers may be incorrect,

92
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,743
As this is not an actual crash.

93
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:55,263
Someone goes through all this trouble,

94
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,715
They'll be the right call numbers.

95
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,335
Michael, vehicles have arrived

96
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,187
And people are approaching.

97
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,127
Call in the location. Secure the perimeter.

98
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,264
Yes, Ma'am

99
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:14,464
Nice morning for a smoldering hole.

100
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:15,866
Who are you?

101
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,967
And why are you contaminating my crash site?

102
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:19,370
I was out four-wheeling,

103
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,706
And stumbled across this rather disturbing scene.

104
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:22,873
My name's Michael Knight.

105
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,009
Agent renning, DEA.

106
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:26,077
You know what that means?

107
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:27,411
That I'm leaving?

108
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,680
I do love a man who can take a hint.

109
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:32,517
Michael,

110
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,180
The call numbers belong to a leer jet

111
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,051
Registered to the DEA

112
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,923
It was your plane, wasn't it?

113
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,059
Weren't you leaving?

114
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,627
It didn't crash here.

115
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:45,429
Excuse me?

116
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:46,771
The tree line's intact,

117
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:48,365
Blast radius isn't consistent

118
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:49,959
With this kind of impact,

119
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,970
And there's ammonium nitrate all over the crater.

120
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,207
This crash was faked.

121
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,758
Though, I'm sure you would've

122
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,243
Figured that out sooner or later.

123
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,445
You wanna tell me what you're really doing here?

124
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:04,215
You wanna tell me what was on that plane?

125
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,316
Good-bye, Mr. Knight.

126
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,252
I don't think she likes you, Michael.

127
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:16,260
We're into the D.E.A. database.

128
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:17,527
Got it.

129
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:19,930
Leer jet departed redland airfield at 2:15 am.

130
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:23,134
Three passengers, two pilots, no cargo.

131
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,535
Both pilots and two of the passengers were D.E.A.

132
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,773
Third passenger...oh, no.

133
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,907
Are you kidding?

134
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:30,975
What?

135
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,009
What is it?

136
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:34,344
Give me a line to mike.

137
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:35,479
A kid?

138
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:37,314
Danny Clark, ten years old.

139
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:38,649
Fifth grader.

140
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:40,317
Won the state's science fair the last two years.

141
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,219
Mathlete.

142
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,215
Was competitive chess-player,

143
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,844
Ranked top 25 nationally, before he quit,

144
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,291
Because it was, and I quote, "too boring."

145
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,809
What's a kid like that doing

146
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,261
On a drug enforcement agency plane?

147
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,862
According to this,

148
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:53,397
He has information about Esteban Bahia.

149
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:54,865
Who's Esteban Bahia?

150
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,566
Peruvian drug trafficker.

151
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:57,701
Peru?

152
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:58,740
I knew they produced cocaine,

153
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,370
But I thought all the cartels were columbian.

154
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:01,839
They were, until Bahia came on the scene.

155
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:04,065
At 26 years old, he murdered 16 people,

156
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,677
On his way to gaining control of the cartel.

157
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:08,545
What? only 16?

158
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:09,001
Last year,

159
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,592
He was responsible for 20%

160
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,183
Of all cocaine and heroin smuggled into the US.

161
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,051
Pretty serious player.

162
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,485
Any idea on what Danny had on him?

163
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:17,204
The DEA's file doesn't specify,

164
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,856
So we're examining other avenues.

165
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:20,524
You and Kitt have a plan?

166
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,608
That plane landed somewhere,

167
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,693
Kitt and I are gonna find it.

168
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,661
Happy hunting.

169
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,020
Given the leer jet's fuel limitations,

170
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,310
I have calculated its potential range

171
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,601
From where the transponder failed.

172
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,020
Access all the air traffic controls

173
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,872
Computers for all the air fields in the circle.

174
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,074
Cross-check their records

175
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:37,208
With the plane's call numbers.

176
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,408
Cross-checking now.

177
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:40,511
Let's also get any relevant information

178
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,546
On the pilots and agents onboard.

179
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:49,523
So, after coming up empty on the DEA database,

180
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,655
We switched to the local police files.

181
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,557
Turns out, Danny's father, Jake,

182
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,392
Was murdered by Esteban Bahia.

183
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,627
Police files say Danny called it in

184
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:57,794
From his father's house.

185
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,263
DEA showed up a few hours later,

186
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:00,664
Took him into custody.

187
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,233
Danny probably witnessed the murder.

188
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,901
That's why the DEA had him.

189
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,602
They were putting him into witness protection.

190
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,780
So, Bahia hijacked the plane to grab Danny,

191
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,241
And faked the crash to throw DEA off his trail.

192
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:11,425
I hate to be the one to say this,

193
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,442
But if that's what happened,

194
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,947
The kid is already dead.

195
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,015
Danny's parents were separated.

196
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,917
I have an address for the mother,

197
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,752
Maybe worth seeing what she knows.

198
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:22,787
Yeah, one of you guys go,

199
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:25,155
See what you can find.

200
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:26,257
I'll go.

201
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,692
Okay.

202
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,826
Really?

203
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:30,928
"okay?" just like that?

204
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:32,597
You wanna be the one to tell

205
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,198
Mrs. Clark her son's missing and may be dead?

206
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,500
It's all you.

207
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:39,420
Right. On second thought, maybe

208
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,273
- I'll take care of it. - Yeah.

209
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,225
I have accessed the cell phone numbers

210
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,110
Of the DEA agents, and pilots.

211
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,945
And we'll trace the signals.

212
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:49,656
The plane's call numbers were

213
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,299
Logged at Jamison Canyon airstrip,

214
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,082
This morning.

215
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,717
Is the plane still there?

216
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,685
It appears to be.

217
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,821
Set a course, Kitt, as fast as you can.

218
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,157
The s.s.c. is right, Danny doesn't have much time.

219
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,065
Course plotted.

220
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,666
Hang on, kid.

221
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:25,749
Hello?

222
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,784
Mrs. Clark?

223
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,024
Keep your hands where I can see them.

224
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,359
Okay.

225
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:36,660
You're pointing a gun at me.

226
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,262
You're not DEA?

227
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,163
No, my name's zoe chae, I work for a private organization,

228
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,200
And we have information about your son.

229
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,535
What is this?

230
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,804
You want money?

231
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:50,007
Some kind of finder's fee?

232
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,508
No, nothing like that.

233
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,944
We have reason to believe your son is alive.

234
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:57,448
Dea agents who were here left hours ago.

235
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,149
They said that the plane crashed nobody survived.

236
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,708
The crash was staged, the real plane was hijacked,

237
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,772
and Bahia has your son.

238
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,361
Please.

239
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:12,896
Let's talk inside.

240
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:21,972
Danny was spending the weekend with Jake, his father.

241
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,077
Jake...ran logistics for Bahia.

242
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,778
Helped him move his product.

243
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,814
Did Danny witness Jake's murder?

244
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:33,517
No.

245
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,164
Two weeks ago,

246
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:38,879
Jake called me and told me he had something big in the works,

247
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,458
Something that would take care of me and Danny forever.

248
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:43,460
You think it had to do with Bahia.

249
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:48,165
I think whatever Jake called me about, that's why Bahia killed him.

250
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,560
And Danny wouldn't tell anybody what he knew,

251
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,569
Until he and I were safely reunited.

252
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:56,473
Amy, if Jake had something Bahia wanted, Danny may have it now.

253
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,142
And what does that mean?

254
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,145
It means he needs Danny's help.

255
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,879
Which means Danny is still alive.

256
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,900
It explains why Bahia hijacked the plane,

257
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,519
Instead of just shooting it down.

258
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:11,355
So, Bahia's trying to get information out of him as we speak.

259
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:12,756
that's what I'm thinking.

260
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:16,293
In that case, stay with the mother, she may be in danger.

261
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,128
I can't believe the dea left her alone.

262
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:19,563
god bless the government.

263
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,299
Watch your back, okay?

264
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,401
We are approaching the air field.

265
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,769
You have an id on the plane?

266
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:28,405
According to their records, it is in hangar seven.

267
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,987
There is no one in the hangar,

268
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,333
But I've located two cell phone signals in a

269
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,945
Shipping container on the air field's outskirts.

270
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:35,851
Why do we care?

271
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:37,009
The signals in the container,

272
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,372
are those of the dea agents cell phones.

273
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:41,418
Get to that container.

274
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:04,975
Kitt, the lock.

275
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:30,066
Are they the dea agents?

276
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:31,235
Yeah.

277
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:32,436
And they're dead.

278
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,601
Kitt, you try locating the pilot's cell phone signals?

279
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,871
Yes, they are not operational.

280
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,660
Access and track all security camera

281
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,143
Footage along every major road from this location.

282
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,989
Use your facial recognition software to search for Danny, Bahia,

283
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,047
And one of the pilots.

284
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,983
Accessing and tracking now.

285
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,019
Get agent Renning on the phone, would you?

286
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:01,554
Renning.

287
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:02,789
You know I wasn't really four-wheeling, right?

288
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:04,291
How did you get this number?

289
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm at Jamison Canyon airstrip, the plane's here.

290
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,695
Bahia's gone, I'm assuming with Danny.

291
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:10,264
Your agents are here, too.

292
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,865
Are they okay?

293
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,666
No, I'm sorry.

294
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,169
I'm guessing your pilots betrayed them.

295
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,238
Paid off by Bahia.

296
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,606
Did you check their badges?

297
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,740
Yes.

298
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:22,776
Was one of them named Wesley Graves?

299
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,016
Yeah.

300
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,184
Listen, anything you can tell me would help.

301
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,795
It's Renning.

302
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,897
I have a cell phone number I need tracked immediately.

303
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,968
Agent Renning sounded extremely upset.

304
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,736
It is likely she knew the victim.

305
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:53,140
Which means we need to avoid her.

306
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,106
Let's check out the hangar,

307
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:56,043
See if they left any clues to where they were heading.

308
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,677
that may not be necessary.

309
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:00,938
My facial recognition software just flagged these

310
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:04,717
Images from 15 minutes ago, at a gas station on route 12.

311
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:09,189
That's Danny.

312
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:13,460
There's another camera inside.

313
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,637
Did you report the shooting?

314
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,739
Yes, police are on the way.

315
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,411
are you tracking that suv?

316
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,213
I am.  good.

317
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,294
Whatever Danny yelled into the security

318
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,457
Camera prompted Bahia to kill the attendant.

319
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:46,526
I will attempt to read Danny's lips and recreate the dialogue.

320
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,895
Good. how long to intercept?

321
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:51,064
approximately 43 minutes.

322
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:53,500
I hope that's not too much time.

323
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,902
Okay, thanks. bye.

324
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,271
He's alive? are you sure?

325
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,641
Yes, we have a line on him, and we're heading after their car now.

326
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:02,876
Oh, thank god.

327
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,181
Hey, hon. what you doing?

328
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:09,916
Mom, you know what I'm doing.

329
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:13,786
Is that Danny?

330
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:17,557
Yeah, yeah, it's stupid, but it makes me feel better watching him.

331
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,610
It's a super-sonic, carrier-friendly,

332
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,761
Variable geometry wing fighter plane.

333
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,530
It's the coolest.

334
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,235
And where did you buy that model?

335
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,703
I didn't buy it, I designed it.

336
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:34,107
I had all the pieces cut to my specifications.

337
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,410
It's gonna be awesome.

338
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:41,714
He seems like an amazing little boy.

339
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,217
I don't know what I'll do if I lose him.

340
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:45,718
Mike is the best there is.

341
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:46,886
He'll get him back.

342
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,290
You have to say that.

343
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:54,161
That doesn't mean I don't believe it.

344
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:57,931
We will intercept the van momentarily.

345
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,348
Safely recovering Danny will be difficult,

346
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:01,701
under these circumstances.

347
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,203
What do you suggest?

348
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,139
The best technical advantage we have is that of surprise.

349
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,309
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

350
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,478
Ready the e.m.p.

351
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,413
E.m.p. is active.

352
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:14,747
Do it.

353
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:20,587
What is it?

354
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:22,589
Yo no se.

355
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,157
Se murio.

356
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:29,362
Nothing funny.

357
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:41,841
Michael, those are the dea pilots.

358
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,144
Everyone in the car appears to be armed.

359
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:44,911
I must reiterate,

360
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:48,162
recovering Danny safely in this situation is unlikely.

361
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,417
Don't worry.

362
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:51,593
If Bahia hasn't killed Danny by now,

363
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,086
this won't put him over the edge.

364
00:16:57,091 --> 00:17:00,093
Besides, I got a plan.

365
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,671
Hey, guys. car trouble?

366
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,406
I'm a mechanic, any chance I can help?

367
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:14,541
Yeah, we got it under control, pal.

368
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,742
You sure?

369
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,475
'cause, uh, from the looks of it,

370
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:20,547
Your timing belt might be a little-- whoa, partner, whoa.

371
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:21,681
Take it easy.

372
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,583
Come here. come here.

373
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,218
Bahia!

374
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:26,819
Out of the car!

375
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,291
Danny, my name is Mike. I'm here to help you.

376
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,194
Please, I just wanna go to my dad's house, to my room.

377
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,530
Back off, right now.

378
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,632
Okay, okay. look, it's my fault.

379
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:41,168
I'll tell you what, why don't you guys take my car.

380
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,969
Go on your way, and no one gets hurt.

381
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:47,641
This was clever, this little ruse.

382
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:51,044
No, I don't think I'll take your car.

383
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,111
Then you can have it tracked.

384
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:58,851
Let him go or I will kill your man right now.

385
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,487
Go ahead, I was gonna kill him anyway.

386
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,458
Danny, I'll take care of this.

387
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,994
I promise.

388
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,597
Stop.

389
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,499
Get out of the car!

390
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,434
You don't follow us.

391
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:17,470
If I feel you behind me, I will kill the kid.

392
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:27,080
Kitt, what can you do?

393
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,117
I'm afraid any action I might take would put Danny's life at risk.

394
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:32,485
Who are you talking to?

395
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,953
Your mom.

396
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,292
Okay, kitt, you can re-inflate now.

397
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:43,796
Way to play opossum.

398
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,600
You have Bahia's car?

399
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:46,826
Yes,

400
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,994
I have finished my analysis of Danny and

401
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,705
Bahia's lip movements from the surveillance tape.

402
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:54,219
Based on the voice samples I just recorded,

403
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,933
I will recreate the dialogue,

404
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,677
Using their actual voices.

405
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:00,847
He just wants his shipment back!

406
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:02,649
As soon as he finds it, he'll kill me!

407
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:05,452
Read the writing on the wall!

408
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,153
Shipment?

409
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,256
What, the writing on the wall?

410
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,991
It seems an odd phrase for a young boy to use.

411
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,760
Get the s.s.c.

412
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,562
Kitt pieced together the audio from the gas station.

413
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,096
Danny talks about his shipment.

414
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:19,266
He says Bahia will kill him after he tells him where it is.

415
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,667
Shipment?

416
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,834
Danny's dad stole his shipment from Bahia, hid it,

417
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,405
Then told Danny where it was hidden, before he was killed.

418
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:27,039
Yeah, I'd buy that.

419
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:30,644
In the video, Danny says that we should, "read the writing on the wall."

420
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,011
That mean anything to you guys?

421
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,513
No.

422
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,348
and then just now, he said that he wanted to go home.

423
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,049
To his dad's house.

424
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,818
Of course he does, he's terrified.

425
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,052
No, it wasn't like that.

426
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,104
I think the location of the shipment is written

427
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:44,257
On the wall in Danny's room in his father's house.

428
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:46,326
that's pretty thin, mike.

429
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,927
No, I'm telling you, this kid is smart.

430
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:50,330
He knew he had to leave a trail, in case something went wrong.

431
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,598
It'll be there.

432
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,732
You willing to bet Danny's life on it?

433
00:19:56,637 --> 00:20:00,139
I'll get to the father's house.

434
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,555
Your turncoat pilots are unconscious.

435
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,957
I am one step behind Bahia.

436
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:21,060
Sorry about your man.

437
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:22,629
Arrest him.

438
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:23,896
What?!

439
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:25,432
On what charge--unh!

440
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,900
Interfering with a government investigation.

441
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,502
I told you to leave this alone.

442
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,037
I am trying to help you.

443
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,939
I don't need your help.

444
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:35,007
Michael, shall I intervene?

445
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,611
Stand down, kitt. stand down.

446
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:44,161
Arrested? seriously?

447
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,579
They are transporting michael to a holding facility,

448
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,731
Pending formal charges.

449
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,200
So, where are you?

450
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,668
I am currently traveling north on highway 18.

451
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:53,270
Nice, you got away.

452
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:54,605
Not exactly.

453
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,980
I am being towed to an impound lot.

454
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,916
Why did you let yourself get towed?

455
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:10,053
Under the circumstances, driving away on my own seemed like a bad idea.

456
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:14,858
Kitt, you have to get off that truck, free mike, and find Danny.

457
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:16,693
Michael and I will become fugitives.

458
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:18,095
I'll take care of that.

459
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,296
You just get mike out of there.

460
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:20,931
Yes, sarah.

461
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,726
I disengaged from the tow truck,

462
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:48,058
And I'm following the signal emanating from michael's earwig.

463
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:49,884
If mike gets processed at that jail,

464
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:52,095
It'll be almost impossible to get him out.

465
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,765
Don't worry, sarah. I got this.

466
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:58,469
Mike and kitt have been spending way too much time together.

467
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:02,806
I can't believe you're wasting your time with me.

468
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:05,942
If they make it to that shipment, Danny's dead.

469
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,311
Our team's tracking the minivan they stole.

470
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,379
We'll find them.

471
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,413
Sure you will.

472
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,284
It only took you what,

473
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,616
Three hours to figure out I was right about the fake crash?

474
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,518
I checked you out, michael knight.

475
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,687
It seems you were with knight industries for a while.

476
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:19,523
Quite the train wreck that experiment turned out to be.

477
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:20,791
That wasn't our fault.

478
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:23,860
I don't want you fumbling around and screwing up my investigation.

479
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:26,297
Michael...

480
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,865
I am closing in rapidly on your position.

481
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:31,235
Actually, these days...

482
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:32,869
We've pretty much got things figured out.

483
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:44,381
Roamstar activated.

484
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:48,419
What the hell!?

485
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:52,723
everything okay up there?

486
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,924
I'm not driving!

487
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:55,959
That's strange.

488
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:16,079
Oh, my god!

489
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,552
Later.

490
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:31,328
Epic rescue, kitt.

491
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:32,496
Thank you, michael.

492
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:41,605
It's agent Renning...

493
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,340
I have a fugitive on the loose.

494
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,208
He's driving a black ford mustang.

495
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:48,309
Kitt, get your 3d object generator online,

496
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,247
See about making a key for these handcuffs.

497
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:53,417
Agent Renning is calling in an apb on us.

498
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,519
Then we better go incognito.

499
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:56,787
Shall we go old school?

500
00:23:56,854 --> 00:24:00,357
To use the lingo of the time, I can dig it.

501
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,401
Still have the minivan?

502
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:13,036
no, I lost their location upon being impounded.

503
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:15,606
Head back to his last known location.

504
00:24:15,674 --> 00:24:17,174
Is billy almost to the dad's house?

505
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,544
Yes, he should be there shortly.

506
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:25,382
Nsa, cia, fbi, dea, dod?

507
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,384
If there's a security agency in the government,

508
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,486
With a three-letter acronym, they answer to you.

509
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:31,355
Sarah.

510
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:34,958
Out of respect to your father, I would love to help you, you know that.

511
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:38,669
But knight industries does not exactly have the best reputation,

512
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:39,363
Right now.

513
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:41,799
You know what? you're 100% right.

514
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:43,867
And nobody has paid for our mistakes more than me.

515
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:45,703
But we can help you.

516
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,172
All I'm asking is the autonomy to work in cooperation with your agenda.

517
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,441
That's what you're doing now?

518
00:24:50,508 --> 00:24:52,843
Look...

519
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,011
I know about Bahia and this boy.

520
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,451
I also know that agent Renning arrested your operative,

521
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,516
Said that he was hindering the investigation.

522
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:01,047
If it weren't for our operative,

523
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:04,020
Agent Renning would still be investigating a fake crash site.

524
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:07,257
And now, he has escaped custody, and is a wanted fugitive.

525
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:08,992
Look, how about this?

526
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,512
We bring the boy in safely, recover the shipment,

527
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,096
And you give us what we need.

528
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,297
And if you don't?

529
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:16,299
Then a ten-year-old boy is dead.

530
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:20,804
That boy dies...

531
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:24,742
Your man will come up on charges, simple as that.

532
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:27,411
And there won't be anything I can do to help you.

533
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:31,448
You told him what?!

534
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,283
It was the only way to get you some wiggle room.

535
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:35,068
Wiggle room? I was doing just fine until you

536
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,920
Stamped the word "guarantee" on my forehead.

537
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,455
Really?

538
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,290
'cause you're a wanted felon who just lost the kid.

539
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:41,658
"fine" isn't the word I'd use.

540
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:42,860
Great.

541
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:44,127
Anything constructive for me?

542
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,896
Yeah, don't screw it up.

543
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,765
Thanks.  your welcome.

544
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,780
It's there.

545
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,982
Excava.

546
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:19,195
do you mind if I ask what happened between you and Jake?

547
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:21,865
Uh.

548
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:25,702
I was 19 when I got pregnant with Danny.

549
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,905
I hadn't known his father very long.

550
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,973
But we decided we'd try and make it work.

551
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,475
And it did for a while.

552
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:36,613
But then... Jake lost his job and started working for Bahia.

553
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:40,884
I begged him to stop, but...

554
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:42,085
He didn't.

555
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:44,922
And you left.

556
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:50,427
Danny adored his father.

557
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:51,929
They'd see each other every few months.

558
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:59,135
When I heard Jake was killed, i-- how could he have been so stupid?

559
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,071
Stealing from Bahia when Danny was there?

560
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,340
he wanted his family back.

561
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:04,908
He saw his chance and took it.

562
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,081
Your neighbor's dog always bark like that?

563
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:13,817
No, she's usually pretty calm.

564
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:14,885
We're going out the back door.

565
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,753
Why? what's wrong?

566
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,489
They're here.

567
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,494
Go.

568
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,367
Drop it right now, and let her go!

569
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,456
Mike, they took her.  who took who?

570
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,859
Bahia's men. they have Danny's mom.

571
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,160
Are you okay?

572
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,028
I'll live. I'm so sorry.

573
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,064
Get back to the s.s.c.

574
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:57,970
We are out here digging, finding nothing.

575
00:27:58,037 --> 00:28:01,339
I think you are lying about the location, Danny.

576
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,275
No, I'm not!

577
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:07,312
maybe we should find out.

578
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,513
Danny!  mom!

579
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,982
Are you okay?

580
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:11,549
Yeah, are you?

581
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:13,385
I'm fine, just Danny, don't give them anything.

582
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:14,519
Don't--ah!

583
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,921
Mom!

584
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,156
Tell them to stop!

585
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:20,000
You tell me where my shipment is, and I will let her go.

586
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:24,496
Fine.

587
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:26,165
Kill her.

588
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:27,532
No, okay! I'll tell, I'll tell you!

589
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,769
Just don't hurt her.

590
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:33,423
You lie to me again

591
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:36,409
and I will kill your mother right in front of you.

592
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:38,344
I'll give you the location

593
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:40,212
but I want my mom to meet us there.

594
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,614
What?

595
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:42,782
You're giving me orders, huh?

596
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,820
Yes, and as soon as I see her

597
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,791
and you let her drive away safely

598
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:52,691
I'll show you exactly where it's hidden.

599
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,594
It's the only way you'll get your stuff back.

600
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:58,531
Well, that's very brave of you, danny.

601
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:00,599
Your mother will meet us there.

602
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,868
And if you deliver, she will be free.

603
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:11,877
Michael, I have Billy.

604
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,579
Billy, we have no time.

605
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,248
I'm at the dad's house

606
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:16,849
just entering the kid's room.

607
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:20,686
Writing on the wall.

608
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:25,491
Writing on the wall.

609
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,961
Hello.

610
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,700
Bingo. Hang on one sec.

611
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:40,306
Mike, I've got an unsolved equation

612
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:41,640
written on the wall.

613
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,876
Looks like we're solving for two variables.

614
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:45,310
Equation?

615
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:46,812
Why would he do that?

616
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,114
Well, maybe because he knows a drug dealer

617
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,348
wouldn't be able to solve it?

618
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:50,816
Question is, can you?

619
00:29:50,884 --> 00:29:53,118
Please, I was doing this stuff in middle school.

620
00:29:53,186 --> 00:29:54,920
Then get your nerd on, Billy.

621
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:57,790
First number is...

622
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:02,394
34.49 and it looks like it's measured in degrees.

623
00:30:02,462 --> 00:30:04,096
That's the format for the

624
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,731
coordinates of latitude and longitude.

625
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,766
Kitt, check each number for latitude and longitude.

626
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,034
I know, Michael.

627
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:11,470
All right, you don't need to get snooty.

628
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:13,589
Maybe if you respected my autonomy a bit more

629
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,641
I would respect yours.

630
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:19,545
I'm sorry, are we having a couples moment here?

631
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,545
I am simply making you aware that I do

632
00:30:21,545 --> 00:30:23,782
No need to be told what to do all the time.

633
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,184
Kitt, I hear you. okay?

634
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:27,553
Okay.

635
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:29,187
Mike, did I just hear kitt smacking you around?

636
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:30,990
Kitt and I are communicating.

637
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:33,025
That's what partners do.

638
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,359
No, it just sounded like Kitt was making you his bitch.

639
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:35,995
Billy, solve the second equation.

640
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,897
Second coordinate is...

641
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:42,635
118.800.

642
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:45,310
The coordinates are between Xinyi and Donghai,

643
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,339
In the jiangau province of China.

644
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:49,074
Billy, what the hell?!

645
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:50,543
Dude, it's not my fault

646
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:51,944
The kid's dad hid the shipment in China!

647
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:53,378
Road trip.

648
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:54,997
Billy, is it possible you

649
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:56,549
left a negative sign off the second answer?

650
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:00,586
Oops.

651
00:31:00,654 --> 00:31:02,355
those coordinates are 19.3 miles

652
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:04,056
from our current location.

653
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:07,152
Okay, Kitt, if it's okay with you, let's go to attack mode,

654
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:08,928
We gotta get there before Bahia.

655
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,162
It is fine with me, Michael.

656
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:12,164
Thank you for asking.

657
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:12,798
Initiating transformation.

658
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:17,365
Transformation completed.

659
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,184
- Mom! - Danny!

660
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:35,253
Danny are you all right?

661
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,722
Okay, they're all here.

662
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:42,928
Let my mother go, or I won't show you where it's hidden.

663
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:45,397
I admire your heart, Danny. I really do.

664
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:47,166
But you don't have to tell me where it is

665
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,867
Because it's obvious.

666
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,245
Excava aqui.

667
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:13,191
I am standing by to initiate the plan.

668
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:14,760
Man, I hope this works.

669
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,328
So do I, Michael.

670
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:19,197
Because if it doesn't, Danny will be dead.

671
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:20,432
And you will be in prison.

672
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,934
Thanks for reminding me.

673
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:22,239
Okay, get ready.

674
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:26,376
Mike!

675
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,511
Danny get down.

676
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,046
Kitt, now.

677
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:40,457
Get in the car!

678
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:47,565
Occupant restraint system active.

679
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:55,072
Take it easy, Bahia.

680
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,173
It's over.

681
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,642
You planted the explosives?

682
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,443
How did you get here before us?

683
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:01,712
I have a really fast car.

684
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,415
We have to go back, we can't leave Mike there.

685
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:05,917
I'm sorry, Danny.

686
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,335
My orders are to get you

687
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:08,686
and your mother out of harm's way.

688
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:10,688
Forget your orders.

689
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:14,224
Can't you do any thinking for yourself?

690
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,826
Yes, I can.

691
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,101
I can't believe you're arguing with a mustang.

692
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:26,170
it's an extremely advanced thinking algorithm.

693
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:28,039
I can't believe you're arguing with that either!

694
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:29,640
Hey, I don't want to shoot you, Bahia.

695
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,442
Death I can handle. Prison, I can't.

696
00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:33,844
There's nowhere you can run, where I won't find you.

697
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:35,212
Well, I look forward to the chase.

698
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,388
- Kitt, what're you doing? - Thinking for myself.

699
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:53,764
- Nothing crazy, all right? - Trust me.

700
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:00,270
Yeah, get him!

701
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:02,039
Danny, do not encourage the car to be violent.

702
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:34,238
It's a miracle.

703
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:37,441
Praise the lord.

704
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:55,159
Danny, put the gun down right now.

705
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:59,263
Danny, listen to your mom, put it down.

706
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,497
He killed him!

707
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:02,166
He killed my dad!

708
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,370
Last year, someone killed my mom.

709
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:09,140
Shot her, right in front of me.

710
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:12,109
I found myself standing over him

711
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:15,012
gun in hand, and I didn't kill him.

712
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,181
'cause I knew that taking a life wouldn't bring anyone back.

713
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:42,639
You destroyed the shipment?

714
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,444
Is this the part where you arrest me again?

715
00:36:47,512 --> 00:36:50,081
You can't do that! He saved our lives.

716
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:53,517
Actually, I can do that.

717
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:57,021
Get them to a safe house.

718
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,157
But...I wanna go with Mike, in his super car.

719
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:07,431
Kids.

720
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:09,734
Thank you...Agent Renning.

721
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,572
You're lucky you got the kid back.

722
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,007
But I ever see you during one of my investigations again,

723
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,712
I will lock you up, and throw away the key.

724
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:27,317
Okay, good talk.

725
00:37:27,385 --> 00:37:29,286
Now, how 'bout you and I talk?

726
00:37:29,354 --> 00:37:31,055
You know, you almost shot me, right?

727
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,379
Michael, there was almost no chance

728
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:33,635
I don't want to hear it.

729
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:34,458
It was this close.

730
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:35,626
- It was not close - This close.

731
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,228
I had clearly targeted to avoid injury.

732
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:38,562
No, it went past my head.

733
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:45,136
So am I gonna get arrested on every case we have now?

734
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,882
The director of National Intelligence will help when he can,

735
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:50,107
But we're not an official government operation.

736
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:51,642
You're on your own out there.

737
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,026
Just try not to piss off

738
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:54,344
Any more people than you have to, okay?

739
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:55,379
I'm outta here.

740
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:57,014
Yeah, fat chance of that.

741
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:59,116
Hm. How was the tour?

742
00:37:59,184 --> 00:38:01,585
This place is awesome.

743
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,154
I really wanna work here when I'm older.

744
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:04,421
Well, we'd be lucky to have you.

745
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:07,024
Thanks for inviting us.

746
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:08,492
Of course.

747
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:13,097
How's he doing?

748
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,065
Hasn't been the easiest couple of days.

749
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,935
And being cooped up in witness protection doesn't help.

750
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:21,115
While we're happy to provide a little distraction,

751
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:24,608
But there is another reason why we asked you to come.

752
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:30,614
I don't want any drug money.

753
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,767
Uh... the D.E.A pays a reward

754
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,852
For the apprehension of certain criminals.

755
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,955
Bahia was pretty high on their list.

756
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,489
I don't know what to say.

757
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:41,425
It's a new life.

758
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:44,161
A house in a good neighborhood, private school.

759
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:45,830
Say you'll take it.

760
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,400
Is that money from my dad?

761
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:55,973
You know how I was telling you about my mom?

762
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,180
Well, she didn't always make the best decisions.

763
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:06,283
But I knew that she loved me.

764
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:08,719
And she tried everything she could to give me a good life.

765
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:16,460
Your dad was trying to do the same thing.

766
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:19,563
Yeah.

767
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,567
That helps me, remembering that.

768
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:27,171
Maybe it'll help you, too.

769
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,773
Thanks.

770
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,775
Well, take it easy, Danny.

771
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:35,545
You too, Mike.

772
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,148
Thank you for everything.

773
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,985
Yeah, you let us know

774
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:43,754
The D.E.A's not taking care of you, okay?

775
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:45,890
Hey, Do you think Kitt could drive us home?

776
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:48,325
Why don't you ask him?

777
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:49,860
Kitt?

778
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:52,997
I would be happy to, if it's okay with Sarah.

779
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:56,867
It's fine, have fun.

780
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,269
Sweet!

781
00:39:58,336 --> 00:40:00,371
Thank you.

782
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:01,872
Hey, Kitt

783
00:40:01,872 --> 00:40:03,307
Do you think we could shoot something along the way?

784
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,209
I don't think that's a good idea.

785
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,978
Nothing alive, just maybe a stop sign or two.

786
00:40:08,046 --> 00:40:09,079
Okay.

787
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:09,880
Really?!

788
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,614
No

789
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,757
Occupant restraint system active.

790
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:25,796
They grow up quickly, don't they?

791
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:30,167
Yeah, he's a special kid.

792
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:32,102
I meant Kitt.

793
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,849
Go, Kitt!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
