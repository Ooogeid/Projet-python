1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,100
Not if she sleeps with him first.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,000
Wow can she be rated ex

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,400
Is this a sparring match or a mating ritual?

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Both.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,100
I'm afraid I don't understand the dynamics

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,900
Of the male-female relationship.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
And you probably never will, kitt.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,200
Come on, he wants to learn.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,100
We should teach him.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,900
See, this so-called sparring session is how they say

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Let's play a little "how's your father?"

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,300
Without actually

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Having to say it.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,200
Why not simply ask for sex?

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,600
'cause it reeks of desperation.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,000
He should know.

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,900
I did detect a rise in hormone levels

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,100
When mike and sarah started hitting one another.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,100
Now you're starting to get it.

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,400
Not bad.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,400
Maybe if you put a little more oomph into it.

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,200
Like that?

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Is this another example of an indirect request

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,600
For intimacy?

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,900
She's straddling him.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,900
I'd say that's pretty direct.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,900
Mr. Torres is approaching.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Kitt, screen off!

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,000
Mike!

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Briefing in ten minutes.

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,300
You're going out.

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,100
I need a shower.

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,100
Me too.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,300
Me too. Me too.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
Billy, your hormone levels elevated with zoe's

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,000
When you hit on top of each other.

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,000
Does that mean that you also want to play

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,400
"how's your father?"

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,900
No.

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
This is all very perplexing.

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,600
Can I borrow your shampoo?

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Look at my sexy man.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Here we go.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
I see answers.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,100
Oh, boy.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,800
Now that's shock and awe, people.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
You have everything on screen?

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,200
Everything as of three minutes ago.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,600
This is their last live screen.

50
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,300
I smell foreplay.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Freshly showered foreplay.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,900
What are we looking at?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,100
Bonnie and clyde.

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
You'll like these two, mike.

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,900
They hacked into the treasury and transferred

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,700
All senatorial and congressional salaries

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,000
To iraqi war widows through untraceable wire transfers.

58
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,900
Not bad.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
Oh, they're good.

60
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
Real good.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
They're anarchists.

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,200
And they're getting more brazen by the day.

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,400
They started with soft targets

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,600
And they're working their way up.

65
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,900
Their website states that their primary objective

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Is to take down the military industrial complex

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,300
Of the united states.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,500
Of which we are a part.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,300
If their online following keeps growing

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,100
At its present rate,

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,100
They might actually be able to do it.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
These guys are becoming a pop phenomenon.

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,500
Top hit on all search engines.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
What do they call themselves?

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
Nikki and max for a free america.

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,200
You aren't serious.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,200
Unfortunately, I am.

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Wow, they're hot.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I think sarah should come with me on this one.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
I bet you do.

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,900
Yeah, I should go with mike.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,300
I don't think that's a good idea.

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Dad, I think a female perspective

84
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,800
Will be a valuable asset

85
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
On this one.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
She's absolutely right.

87
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,300
Kitt, have you figured out where they'll hit next?

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I have factored in all known variables,

89
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Including, but not limited to online chatter,

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,700
Websites, blogs. And?

91
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,900
And I have deducted the probable location

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Of their next target.

93
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,600
The town of hastings.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,900
You're guessing, kitt?

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,200
Deduction, logic, and probability are not guessing.

96
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,500
A guess is a prediction about the outcome

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,700
Made without factual evidence or support.

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
I do not guess, mike.

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Chamber door is open

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,100
????????????

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
Chamber door is closing

102
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,600
Why didn't you tell him who nikki is?

103
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,300
'cause they don't need to know.

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
And the fbi doesn't want it public.

105
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
Mark my words.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
This is gonna blow up in our faces.

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,700
So?

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,300
So.

109
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,300
So we're alone.

110
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's talk.

111
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,900
Come on.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,900
It's not like we're ever really...Alone.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
What, kitt?

114
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,500
He's cool.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Actually, my core temperature

116
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Is running a bit high

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Due to the incline and low altitude.

118
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,600
What about billy... Zoe, torres?

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,500
Your dad?

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
'cause nobody has anything better to do

121
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,000
Than spy on michael knight all day.

122
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,800
I have nothing better to do.

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Me neither.

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,500
Got all the time in the world.

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
We're on a mission.

126
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,400
I like to keep personal stuff

127
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
And work stuff separate, that's all.

128
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,700
So why did you want me to come?

129
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,200
What, you didn't wanna come?

130
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,000
No, you said, "sarah should come with me on this one."

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
'cause I thought you wanted to come.

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,900
What about the whole female perspective thing?

133
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,100
What about the whole rec room, shower thing?

134
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,900
I just thought...

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,200
What?

136
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,700
Oh, I get it.

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
You're gonna play it like that.

138
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Like what?

139
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,600
I don't know.

140
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,300
Hey, guys.

141
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,700
There's lots of chatter on the web

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,300
About nikki and max's next target,

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
And the number 15 keeps coming up.

144
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,200
15?

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
An address, a date, a...Highway?

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
Kitt, analyze the number 15 and hastings

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
With respect to the previous targets

148
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
Of nikki and max.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
I can provide no meaningfully relevant

150
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,800
Results using hastings and the number 15.

151
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,400
I'll stay on it.

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
You guys okay?

153
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
We're fine. Yeah, we're okay. Why?

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Just checking.

155
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,600
No big.

156
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Outtie.

157
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,100
How long do you think?

158
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,300
I say he goes first.

159
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
I say you're misreading the whole dynamic.

160
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
He's all coiled up and hinky.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,100
Hinky?

162
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,900
Mike is loose as a goose.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,800
A man with a plan.

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
A dude in a mellow mood.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,900
You rhyme like a white boy and not a beastie boy.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
Ten bucks he breaks before she does.

167
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
Make it a double sawbuck.

168
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,700
You're on.

169
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,200
15.

170
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,800
That could be anything.

171
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,800
There's gotta be some kind of pattern to it.

172
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,100
What?

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Nothing.

174
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,800
He folded like a cheap lawn chair.

175
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,500
No way!

176
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
It's completely innocent conversation.

177
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,300
He's practically drooling.

178
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,300
Him?

179
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Sarah can barely keep her hands off my boy.

180
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,800
Are we watching the same movie?

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
We're doing this all for you.

182
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,800
That's right.

183
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,000
You can count on us. Take charge.

184
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Take charge!

185
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,900
We are your answers.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
These crazy kids.

187
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,500
Sure, just two misguided teens in a hot car

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,500
Blowing things up.

189
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,900
Well, the hazardous waste facility

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,700
That they destroyed was named in a class-action suit.

191
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,900
So you think they're doing the public a service?

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,500
No, come on.

193
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,100
Country was born in violence and dissent.

194
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
It's always been with us.

195
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,600
Well, I appreciate the homage to the founding fathers,

196
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,300
But anarchy is not the answer, charles.

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,700
Yeah, well, one man's anarchist,

198
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,500
Another man's robin hood.

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,200
They're dangerous and reckless.

200
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,500
Period.

201
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
Depends on your point of view.

202
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,900
I don't see how you can look at it any other way.

203
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,100
Well, maybe to the untrained eye

204
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,300
We're the ones riding around in a hot car blowing things up.

205
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
All right, this is max...

206
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,300
And nikki...

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,100
We shall see you guys next time.

208
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,700
We love you.

209
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,100
Ow, peace!

210
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,100
They're entering hastings.

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
I synchro'd the traffic signals on approach with kitt's speed.

212
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,500
It should save them a couple of minutes.

213
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,900
Awesomeness.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
How did you hack the grid?

215
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,500
I repurposed that software firewall you invented

216
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,900
And slipped it in as a trojan horse

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,300
To the traffic control computer in hastings.

218
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,100
Great minds, right?

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,900
I'm uploading a list of motels to kitt.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,900
Look, this one has a vibrating bed.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,900
Hope they brought quarters.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
They should just get it over with, right?

223
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Absolutely.

224
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
Clears the head.

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,300
When I was playing planetary war craft last night,

226
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I imagined you were queen zorda of gorn.

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,300
Queen zorda?

228
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,300
The naked chick with the tentacles?

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,600
I, uh...

230
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Did you just go all clarence thomas on me?

231
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,300
No, the traffic cam

232
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
And the software firewall,

233
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,400
I thought we were having a moment.

234
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
I could so call human resources right now.

235
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm--i'm sorry.

236
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,200
It was a-- it was a misunderstanding.

237
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,700
I'm going to ask you a question.

238
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,500
Think very carefully before you answer.

239
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,600
Okay.

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
What was I doing with my tentacles?

241
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,400
If this is our future, I'm really worried.

242
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,500
15 kilometers, 15 miles, 15 what?

243
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
Maybe it's their 15th mission.

244
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,900
No, it's their 10th mission.

245
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
If you call terrorism a mission.

246
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Look.

247
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,300
Military time. 1500 hours.

248
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,100
3:00.

249
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,100
It's a quarter to three now.

250
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
We only have 15 minutes to find the location.

251
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,400
There is no empirical evidence

252
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,100
To support your supposition, michael.

253
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,100
It's a hunch, kitt.

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,500
If I'm wrong, at 3:01, I'll apologize.

255
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,500
Kitt, display all possible targets again.

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,500
There are three military installations

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Within a 30-mile radius.

258
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,500
Too obvious, and too highly fortified.

259
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,100
There are no munitions plants,

260
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,900
No manufacturers of guidance systems,

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
And no ordnance suppliers.

262
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
There's a cop checking us out.

263
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,400
He is eying you suspiciously.

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Roll with it.

265
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,600
Pay up.

266
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Smells like victory.

267
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,300
Pff...Buy yourself something nice.

268
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
I will.

269
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,900
Sarah, michael, you may unlock your lips now.

270
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
The officer is leaving.

271
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay. We're good.

272
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,900
Yeah, good.

273
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
When I was in iraq, sometimes we'd lose a huge truck

274
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,800
Over a tiny little fuel pump relay.

275
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,000
So?

276
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
So maybe there's a company here

277
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,800
That produces something small,

278
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,400
That could affect something big.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,500
Kitt, research.

280
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Light manufacturing only.

281
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,700
Part suppliers for vital industries,

282
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,100
Military, energy.

283
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,900
Anderson valve, manufacturers of check valves

284
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Used in every major oil refinery in the united states.

285
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,000
Destruction of anderson's valve making capacity

286
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,400
Will destruct the supply chain

287
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,200
And increase the price of gasoline.

288
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,900
How much?

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,500
I estimate approximately $10 per gallon.

290
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,300
Where is it?

291
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,600
3.2 miles from our current location.

292
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,800
Anderson valve, let's go.

293
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,200
That's their car...

294
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,000
1970 super bee,

295
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,000
426 hemi, four barrel, four speed.

296
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,400
What a beaut.

297
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,600
Only 21 were produced with the hemispherical head engine,

298
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,800
And four-speed transmission.

299
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,000
You boys done? Mm. Mm-mm.

300
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
Kitt, weapons.

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,200
Each carries a 15 round magazine,

302
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,400
And i.D. Badges, compliments of dr. Graiman.

303
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,000
The cameras on your identity badges

304
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Are linked real time

305
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
With the nsa's facial recognition database.

306
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,600
So we should be able to help you find nikki and max.

307
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
Be careful.

308
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,100
Thanks, dad.

309
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,500
Kitt, open sesame.

310
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
How the hell are we supposed to find these guys?

311
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
Process of elimination.

312
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,300
We'll alert you when facial recog

313
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,300
Finds someone who doesn't belong.

314
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
How much time?

315
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,400
Just under two minutes.

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
Kitt, scan for valve making equipment.

317
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,100
Seven different valves are produced in the building.

318
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
One minute remaining.

319
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,100
Copy.

320
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,900
Kitt, you said "check valve" earlier.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,700
Yes, sarah.

322
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Scan only for one-way valves.

323
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,600
The only equipment capable of producing a one-way valve

324
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,600
Is 30 yards to your one o'clock.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,500
Should thin the herd a bit.

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,100
Billy, my sensors have detected the presence of c-4.

327
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,300
Kitt sniffers detected c-4!

328
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,300
All right.

329
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,700
Sarah, there are explosives in that room.

330
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,100
Hi,hold on right there

331
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,900
Oh, boy.

332
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,700
Mike, get out of there.

333
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
It's too late, I'm going to try to disarm it.

334
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Michael, throw the bag into the alley.

335
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,900
There's enough c-4 to take out half the building.

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
Michael, you cannot disarm it in time.

337
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,300
I have a plan.

338
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
Kitt.

339
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,700
Kitt! I am fine, michael.

340
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
You may want to assist sarah.

341
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Nikki and max are getting away.

342
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,900
Freeze!

343
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,000
Drop it.

344
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
You drop yours.

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
Move it another inch, and you won't have any fingers left.

346
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,900
It's her. Sarah, can you hear me?

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,300
Yeah, carrie, I got 'em.

348
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Do not shoot.

349
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,400
Sarah, fire if you have to.

350
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,300
Negative,

351
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,300
Do not fire.

352
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
Nikki's congressman childress' daughter.

353
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Bet they told you not to shoot me, didn't they?

354
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,800
They're idiots.

355
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,500
Sarah!

356
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,700
Mike!

357
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,700
You should've shot her.

358
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,600
Sorry.

359
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,900
You were always bad at operation when we were kids.

360
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
Just good at playing doctor.

361
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
Incoming call.

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,300
Put it up, exterior mode.

363
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,800
Mike, are you okay?

364
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,200
Why weren't we told who she was?

365
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,400
The information was considered "need to know."

366
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,900
Mmm, when it results in sarah pulling buckshot from my arm,

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,100
I'd call it "need to know."

368
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,700
The congressman asked us to keep this quiet.

369
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,400
We felt obliged to honor his request.

370
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,800
Mm, I can't believe you sent me after some spoiled brat

371
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,100
Running around with a dude and a shotgun.

372
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,900
What's her problem?

373
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
Daddy didn't buy her a pony when she was a little girl?

374
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,800
Actually, I bought her two.

375
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,600
Max has her brainwashed.

376
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,600
Congressman.

377
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,500
Max teach her how to shoot, too?

378
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,300
Mike, please.

379
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,700
You must be michael knight.

380
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Nice to finally meet you.

381
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm afraid I'm to blame for my daughter's aim.

382
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,100
She's bagged her fair share of deer over the years.

383
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,700
Good thing I don't have antlers.

384
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Nicole is a sweet girl.

385
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,800
I may have overindulged her,

386
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,400
And her mother leaving wasn't easy,

387
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,600
But this is not her.

388
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,400
Yeah, she seems like a real angel.

389
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
That's my daughter sarah.

390
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
She's a sweet girl too.

391
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,500
Most of the time.

392
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,400
The girl was always strong-willed,

393
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,400
But this is something else.

394
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
She went to berkeley to get an education.

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Four years later, I barely recognized the girl

396
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,400
I moved into the dormitory.

397
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,100
And you think max was responsible?

398
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,700
He's a cancer.

399
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,200
He took my only child from me.

400
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,900
The situation seems to be similar

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,100
To that of patty hearst.

402
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Creating a condition-- we know what stockholm syndrome is, kitt.

403
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,900
Mike will find her.

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And bring her back safely.

405
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't want my daughter hurt, mr. Knight.

406
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,700
I'd consider it a personal favor.

407
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,900
I'll take care of it.

408
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
Thank you, michael.

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Charmer, isn't he?

410
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,200
He's a politician, charming is his business.

411
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,200
He's also been very supportive

412
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,200
Of my father's experiments for years.

413
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,500
You mean he's knight industries' congressional sugar daddy.

414
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,100
You buy it, the patty hearst thing?

415
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,300
Not one bit.

416
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,500
She shot me with a smile on her face.

417
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,900
Thanks.

418
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,800
You're welcome.

419
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Where would you go if you were them?

420
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,500
An island in the south pacific.

421
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,700
Nice.

422
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,500
I have an alternate hypothesis.

423
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Of course you do.

424
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,100
Surveillance footage captured from anderson valve

425
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,900
Included this.

426
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm not sure what I'm looking at,

427
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
But it's definitely

428
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,500
Not an island in the south pacific.

429
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,500
I apologize.

430
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,100
Allow me to zoom.

431
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,600
And focus on the paper in his pocket.

432
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,600
Tee ticks?

433
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,900
Kitt, search for words or phrases

434
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,400
Containing those letters in that order.

435
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,300
I've done that.

436
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
There are more than three million possibilities.

437
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,200
But there is also an image in the corner of the document.

438
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,000
Can you tell what it is?

439
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,600
It's too obscured for my recognition software.

440
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
But it's quite possible the shape is a corporate logo.

441
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,600
So now cross-check those letters with the names of corporations.

442
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,700
Which narrows the list

443
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,400
Down to 78 worldwide.

444
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
Now sort only for the u.S.

445
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,900
It leaves six possibilities,

446
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,500
And only one of those has a military connection.

447
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Teeter plastics.

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
For many years, they were a small family-run operation.

449
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
But their business expanded rapidly

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,700
Due to military contracts.

451
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,500
What do they make?

452
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,200
Turbofan engines used on tomahawk missiles.

453
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,900
Where's their main base of operations?

454
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,400
It is a factory complex 134 miles from here.

455
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,100
That's their next target.

456
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Maybe we were wrong.

457
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,100
No, they'll show up eventually.

458
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Could be a couple hours.

459
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,400
Any suggestions on how we could kill some time?

460
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I have access to any number of games,

461
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,700
Puzzles, movies, trivia.

462
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,600
He wasn't talking to you, kitt.

463
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
Spin the bottle.

464
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you, 12?

465
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,600
Okay, seven minutes in heaven.

466
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,700
It's a stakeout, dorkus.

467
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,300
Sarah's completely focused.

468
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,700
It's a rule.

469
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
Two people can't sit in a car at night

470
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,100
And not make out.

471
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Aww, little zoe. So naive.

472
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,800
A significant heat source is approaching

473
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,700
The front side of the complex.

474
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,100
Let's go.

475
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,800
Kitt, do you still have them?

476
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
Yes, they are currently attempting

477
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,600
To breach the facility's main gate.

478
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm going in.

479
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Continue on your present path.

480
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
If you come back during the day,

481
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
It might be a little easier to get in.

482
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,900
Hi there. Remember me?

483
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,300
How's the arm?

484
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,400
Get your hands up. Both of you.

485
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,500
Max!

486
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,900
Shut up!

487
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
Back off! Now.

488
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
Come on, max.

489
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
We both know you're not gonna hurt her.

490
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,400
You don't know anything about me.

491
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,500
What are you doing?

492
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,600
Shut your mouth! I am sick of hearing you whine.

493
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
What?

494
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
You take another step, I'll kill her.

495
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,500
Please, help me!

496
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,100
Max, for future reference

497
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,000
You may not want to grab the girl who shot me

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,300
And use her as a human shield.

499
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,700
Drop your weapons,

500
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,400
Or, once again, I'll kill her.

501
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Mike, he's serious.

502
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,100
Mike.

503
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,200
All right.

504
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,200
Michael, max is getting away.

505
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Forget him.

506
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
We got what we came for.

507
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,000
Daddy, max made me do everything.

508
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
He told me that he was gonna kill you

509
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,500
If I didn't help him.

510
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, sweetheart.

511
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm glad you're all right.

512
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
How'd she get away?

513
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
I don't think she got away.

514
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
I think she's buying time for her boyfriend.

515
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
She knew daddy would bail her out.

516
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Not this time.

517
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,300
There's a federal warrant out for her arrest.

518
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,100
How did you guys hack into

519
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,800
The treasury department's mainframe?

520
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,300
Max did everything.

521
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,900
What is this place?

522
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Come on, nicole.

523
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
We're going home.

524
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,000
Actually, congressman, she's going

525
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,700
To a federal detention facility.

526
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,500
They do the best tattoos.

527
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
That's absurd.

528
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,700
She was clearly being held against her will.

529
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
Alex.

530
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm sorry. There's a federal warrant.

531
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,300
Don't say a word to anybody.

532
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,000
I'll call my lawyers and have them meet us.

533
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,100
Not a word.

534
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Daddy?

535
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,100
Is that really necessary?

536
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,600
Not necessary, but it's the law.

537
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Wait.

538
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,300
I need to talk to my dad.

539
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,100
Can I just talk to him for one minute, please?

540
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,500
I want to talk to mom too.

541
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,000
Can you get her on the phone?

542
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,400
Sure, sweetheart.

543
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,300
Do they really have to listen to this?

544
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,400
Take your time.

545
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,700
20 bucks says nikki rolls over on max.

546
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,400
No way. She loves him.

547
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,900
Plus, he's way hot.

548
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Hot?

549
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,000
Are we watching the same movie?

550
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,900
Double or nothing.

551
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,000
You're on.

552
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,700
My daughter's agreed to testify against max,

553
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
Provide the names of everyone in his organization.

554
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Thank you.

555
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,900
And I'm sure the fbi will appreciate her cooperation.

556
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,200
Well, then take off her cuffs.

557
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
I'm sorry.

558
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,400
It's okay, daddy.

559
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm ready.

560
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,900
Take me in.

561
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,400
I'll go with her.

562
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Hey.

563
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,900
Did you see the look on nikki's face

564
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,700
When carrie put the cuffs on her?

565
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
It was like her eyes almost popped out of her head.

566
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,600
It doesn't matter.

567
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,700
What do you mean?

568
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,400
I mean limited intel

569
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,500
Tying our hands.

570
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Come on,

571
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
We were set up for failure.

572
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
Max gets away and she gets off?

573
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,300
What's it all for?

574
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,400
We brought back the congressman's daughter.

575
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,500
Mission accomplished.

576
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,600
Yeah, but max is still out there.

577
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,500
And I don't like leaving loose ends.

578
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,800
I think we did the best we could given our parameters.

579
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,700
Look, we're not the first

580
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
To get sidelined by politics.

581
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
And we're not gonna be the last.

582
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
Sarah, you're a scientist.

583
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,300
What do you know about politics?

584
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,100
How do you think I got the funding

585
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,000
For my research all these years?

586
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,200
Look, what's done is done.

587
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Game room. Eight ball.

588
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
I'm up five games to four.

589
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Your memory's as bad as your aim.

590
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,500
I'm up five-four.

591
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,600
Please, I would beat you one-handed.

592
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,100
Agent rivai,

593
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,100
You thought about your future?

594
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,800
On a daily basis, congressman.

595
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,500
I can make sure that future

596
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,600
Becomes brighter than you ever imagined.

597
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,400
Not gonna happen.

598
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,300
Well, she's my daughter.

599
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,900
Had to give it a shot.

600
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,100
Dr. Graiman, have you made any modifications

601
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,300
To the computer system?

602
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,400
No. Why?

603
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,100
One of the firewalls is down.

604
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,400
That's impossible.

605
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
The system was accessed from the game room.

606
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,700
What's going on?

607
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,700
There's no way she could have logged on from here.

608
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
The system's locked.

609
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,900
It's still locked, but it's been breached.

610
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,900
Has anything been downloaded?

611
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,800
She took it.

612
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,000
Who? Took what?

613
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,100
Nikki.

614
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
She took it all.

615
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
What exactly did she get?

616
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,300
Four tiny little files, except it's who we are,

617
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,900
What we do, our secret location,

618
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,500
And our ties to the government.

619
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,300
If that gets on the internet...

620
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,700
She downloaded everything?

621
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,400
How?

622
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,900
I don't know, but she did.

623
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,300
Alert carrie. Mike, find her. Fast.

624
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,000
I've plotted an intercept course for agent rivai.

625
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,600
We will need maximum speed to reach them

626
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,000
Kitt, attack mode.

627
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,900
Initiating transformation

628
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,500
Transformation complete

629
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,600
Daddy?

630
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,500
Yeah.

631
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,800
What's gonna happen to me?

632
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,700
Don't worry.

633
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,100
They'll take care of everything.

634
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,500
Rivai

635
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,000
Nikki stole our files.

636
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,000
What?

637
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800
She downloaded five classified files

638
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,600
From the ssc computer.

639
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,500
She has everything on us.

640
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
She must've had some sort

641
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,700
Of wireless scanner.

642
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,100
You need to search her.

643
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,600
Kitt's tracking the van's gps. Tell carrie I'm on my way.

644
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,200
We're getting a ton of chatter on the web.

645
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,700
Max is telling everyone that they have something big.

646
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,600
Mike, you have to stop them

647
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Before our files end up on the internet.

648
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,800
We have reason to believe

649
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,900
That your daughter stole classified information.

650
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,500
What information?

651
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,300
Carrie says she doesn't have anything on her.

652
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,300
Is there any other way she could've

653
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,200
Transmitted the information out of the ssc?

654
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,100
Even if she pulled the files using a wireless trawler,

655
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,800
She'd have to dump them to a drive.

656
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,000
The congressman's cell phone!

657
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,700
Carrie, she downloaded

658
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,000
The files to the congressman's cell phone.

659
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,700
Congressman, do you have your cell?

660
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,400
Of course.

661
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,500
May I see it?

662
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,400
Sorry, dad.

663
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,200
Carrie.

664
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,900
Carrie, can you hear me?

665
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Something happened.

666
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,700
Billy,

667
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
Play back the last ten seconds of that phone call.

668
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,900
Congressman, do you have your cell?

669
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,600
Of course.

670
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
May I see it?

671
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
That did not sound good.

672
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
I'll take that, daddy.

673
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
Hey, babby

674
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,200
Are we ready to roll?

675
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,500
She's going with us.

676
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,900
Mike,

677
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,600
We lost contact with carrie.

678
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,300
There was some sort of crash.

679
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,200
There was. Kitt, normal mode.

680
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,100
Initiating trasformation

681
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,300
Transformation complete

682
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,700
Max tracked the congressman's cell phone.

683
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,000
Everybody stay back!

684
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,500
Nikki's gone.

685
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,400
And I think they took carrie hostage.

686
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,100
Kitt, call an ambulance.

687
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,000
The congressman's down.

688
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
They had another car waiting.

689
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
We can trace them via the congressman's phone.

690
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
No, we can't.

691
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,900
She pulled out the battery.

692
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,400
Any sign of carrie?

693
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,300
Kitt, you picking up anything?

694
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,700
There are no discernable traces

695
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,100
Of agent rivai in the immediate vicinity.

696
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,100
What about these tracks?

697
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,300
I want infrared.

698
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,200
I have analyzed the vehicles on site.

699
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,500
The treads do not match any of their tires.

700
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,800
Kitt's right, they don't match the emergency vehicles

701
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,600
Or police cars on the scene.

702
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,900
It's possible the tracks are from the getaway car.

703
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,100
The tread is from a goodyear assurance comfort tread.

704
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,000
It's one of the most popular brands of tires

705
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,100
Sold and distributed in north america.

706
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,900
Of course it is.

707
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Great. That narrows it down.

708
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,500
We got something here.

709
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,200
Looks like an oil leak.

710
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,700
That's correct, michael.

711
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,100
Is that leak from the getaway car?

712
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation,

713
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,000
There is a 93% chance it is.

714
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,200
Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius

715
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,400
And search for a car with a fluid leak

716
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,700
At the same rate per distance.

717
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,200
There are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters.

718
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,400
Probability is high

719
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,900
That one of them

720
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,100
Is the vehicle max is driving.

721
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,900
They should be within striking distance of nikki and max.

722
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,000
Still narrowing.

723
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,600
There are 23 vehicles

724
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,900
On that stretch of highway that could be a match

725
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,700
For the car nikki and max are driving.

726
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,400
Got anything, kitt?

727
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,700
I do not detect our primary targets, nor agent rivai.

728
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,400
How many of the cars have cell phones?

729
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,300
The signals are from 20 cars.

730
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,600
Check the remaining three.

731
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,200
That's right, she dumped the battery.

732
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,800
Kitt, I need to see inside those cars.

733
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,900
Accessing satellite imagery.

734
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,100
Putting it on-screen now.

735
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Got it.

736
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Any sign of rivai?

737
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,700
Kitt, give me heat signatures.

738
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,600
Heat signatures on-screen.

739
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,400
She's not moving.

740
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,200
Kitt, is she alive?

741
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
Come on, carrie. Move.

742
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,000
We got movement!

743
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,500
Mike, go!

744
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
With pleasure.

745
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,400
Ow! That's what I'm talking about!

746
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,600
We can download now.

747
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Houston, we have a problem.

748
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,300
What is it?

749
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,400
She turned on her father's cell.

750
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,800
She must have another battery.

751
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,900
It's uploading our files to the internet.

752
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Billy, run the sweeper program.

753
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,700
Not working. Mike, I can't stop the transfer.

754
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,100
Kitt, deploy e.M.P.

755
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,800
It'll stop the car and fry the cell phone.

756
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
Michael, at their current speed,

757
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
There is a nearly 100% probability

758
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
That the electromagnetic pulse

759
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,000
Will cause the vehicle to flip.

760
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,200
What if we take out a tire?

761
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
It will cause an uncontrollable spin

762
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
Resulting in a cataclysmic crash.

763
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,300
Okay, bad idea.

764
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,400
What if we take out both rears at the same time?

765
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Causing both rear tires

766
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,900
To deflate simultaneously should result

767
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,600
In the least dangerous outcome.

768
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,900
Unfortunately, I cannot fire

769
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,400
Two spikes simultaneously.

770
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,500
Kitt, take the wheel.

771
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
You take the right, I'll take the left.

772
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,700
On my mark.

773
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
If we do not fire at exactly the same moment--

774
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
I know, kitt.

775
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,800
Three.

776
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,800
Two. One.

777
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,100
Fire!

778
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
Their upload's almost complete.

779
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,400
Carrie's safety is your first concern, mike.

780
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,700
Once they complete the transfer,

781
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,200
They won't need her anymore.

782
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Come on. Get up.

783
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,800
You have no idea what you're doing.

784
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,100
I could say the same thing about you.

785
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,200
Who's your buyer? China?

786
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,000
North korea?

787
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm not selling them.

788
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,600
This isn't about some tech war.

789
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,800
It's about telling the truth.

790
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,500
To who?

791
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,800
The american people.

792
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,500
We just uploaded the files to the internet

793
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,000
To expose the lies and hypocrisy of the people you work for.

794
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,000
You don't even know who you work for, do you?

795
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I jammed the transfer,

796
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,100
But ran a mimic program to make it look like it went through.

797
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,700
Boy genius does it again.

798
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,100
I'm feeling tingly all over.

799
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,200
Get that, mike?

800
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Transfer is complete, baby.

801
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,100
We're good to go.

802
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,600
Hate to chat and run.

803
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,000
But we'll be needing your car.

804
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Hand over agent rivai first.

805
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,500
What, do you think we're stupid? She's our only bargaining chip.

806
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Toss the gun.

807
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Drop it!

808
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Kitt, you know what to do.

809
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Yes, michael.

810
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,100
You're really gonna regret this.

811
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,800
Shut up before we shoot you.

812
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,200
Where're the keys?

813
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,600
There are no keys.

814
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,200
Agent rivai, protocol alpha, charlie, beta, seven.

815
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,500
Copy that, kitt.

816
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,400
Hey, the doors are locked.

817
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,400
You okay? Uh huh.

818
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,900
So what have we learned about relationships today, kitt?

819
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Men and women are erratic, unpredictable, and irrational.

820
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,400
I believe I have learned nothing.

821
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,500
No, kitt, you've learned everything.

822
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,300
Predictability takes all the fun

823
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,400
Out of a relationship.

824
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,600
In addition, I searched the municipal codes

825
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Of every city in the united states.

826
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,200
There is no such thing as the make out rule.

827
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,900
What?

828
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,600
You told zoe you can't park in a car

829
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,000
At night without making out.

830
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And that it's a rule.

831
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
Well, it may not be in any database,

832
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,300
But it's a rule.

833
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Trust me.

834
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Well, it's night,

835
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,100
And you are both in a parked car.

836
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,100
Rules are rules.

837
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,200
Really?

838
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,700
Mike and sarah are approaching.

839
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,900
Duck!

840
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
Hey. Hey.

841
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Hear the news? What?

842
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Congress quietly doubled our funding.

843
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,800
Huh.

844
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,700
I wonder if that has anything to do

845
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
With the charges being dropped against nikki?

846
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,400
And poor max is gonna serve 20 to life.

847
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
What a boy won't do for a girl.

848
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,700
I was just thinking the same thing.

849
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,000
Good-night.

850
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,500
Good-night.

851
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,000
Busted.
