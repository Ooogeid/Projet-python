1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
Previously on Caprica...

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,500
Daniel Graystone stole my
technology and killed my men.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,200
For that he must pay.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,100
Eventually, I will
destroy your company,

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,500
but before that you have
so many precious things.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,100
Until the debt is paid.

7
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,205
I've been seeing my dead
brother everywhere.

8
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:16,307
I don't know what's going on.

9
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,675
There was a crash
in the city,

10
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:20,578
And I thought I saw
my brother there.

11
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,080
He led me to this poster.

12
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,682
There.
That's where it happened.

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,484
The accident,
that's where he was killed.

14
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:28,152
Tamara's out there
in v-world.

15
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,021
I'm getting her back.

16
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,489
Who are you?

17
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:32,624
I go by emmanuelle.

18
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,626
Heracles said
you were easy to find.

19
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:36,594
Look for the cube
wandering all alone.

20
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,197
All right,
start guiding.

21
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:42,066
I can't let my dad know
I'm inside the robot.

22
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:43,968
I don't trust him.
Hi, daddy.

23
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:45,136
You're an avatar,

24
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,472
A virtual representation
of Zoe.

25
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,340
What are you doing to her?
Stop it, dr. Graystone!

26
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,109
Stop!

27
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,112
I know this robot can work.

28
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,080
And Zoe is the key.

29
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:02,420
Caesar, go!

30
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,834
Zoe.

31
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:46,130
Come on, it's bad enough
you got me wearing

32
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:47,498
This ridiculous getup.

33
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,302
Now I gotta watch while you
take some fake drugs.

34
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,470
Believe it or not,

35
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,272
That hat
is better camouflage in here

36
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,941
Than that businessman special
you were scanned in.

37
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,344
And as for this,
it's not fake,

38
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,579
And it's not for me.

39
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:04,115
Are you kidding me?
What?

40
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:06,284
You're not paying me
to entertain you, counselor.

41
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,589
Now we've got to make it
all the way across town.

42
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,124
We could take the lev,

43
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:14,926
But in he that's
a guaranteed death sentence.

44
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:16,427
No wheels,
so we're hoofing it.

45
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,834
It's called "amp."

46
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,469
Think of it
as a hack that bypasses

47
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:26,204
The holoband's safeties,

48
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,538
Interacting with
the visual cortex

49
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,141
To heighten a player's
senses and reflexes.

50
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,210
In here, you're either
quick or you're dead.

51
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,445
Take your pick.

52
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:37,048
So how do I...just...

53
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,050
You've taken
eye drops before, right?

54
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,351
Yeah, sure.

55
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,486
It's the same thing.

56
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,154
Just hold it up close
and squeeze.

57
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:45,456
Okay. Now?

58
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:47,025
Yes.
Okay.

59
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:00,071
Welcome back.

60
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,941
Sorry I had to shut you down
for so long,

61
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,311
But I was just
a little stunned

62
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,381
And flabbergasted.

63
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:11,849
See, up until last night,

64
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,351
I was convinced
that my daughter's avatar

65
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,887
Had been lost or melted
or destroyed.

66
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,955
But now I'm convinced
that you're in there.

67
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,924
And you're free to talk to me.

68
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,163
Give me a sign.

69
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,367
Anything?

70
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,370
No?

71
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,573
Okay, so it's not that
you can't talk to me.

72
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,809
It's that you won't
talk to me.

73
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,414
I...I...

74
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,416
I can't imagine
what the last few weeks

75
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:48,219
Have been like for you.

76
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:51,055
This certainly wasn't what
you were expecting, was it?

77
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,424
Must have scared
the crap out of you.

78
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:54,859
I can understand that.

79
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,261
I'm sorry,
but you have to understand

80
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,464
That this was always
just a temporary place

81
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,232
Just so we cou get you
back in our lives.

82
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,468
And if you can't handle it,
you just let me know,

83
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,470
And I will take you
out of this

84
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,905
And find a way to make you
a more human body,

85
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,240
Whatever you want.

86
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:13,311
You just...
just have to let me know.

87
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,379
Okay?

88
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:22,086
Can you at least look at me
when I'm talking to you?

89
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:28,893
Can you look at me, please?

90
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,997
U87, look at me.

91
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,141
So...

92
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:47,011
You'll only respond
as the robot, huh?

93
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,413
Okay.

94
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,749
I see.

95
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,322
Okay, so you're giving me
the silent treatment.

96
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,026
Okay.

97
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,128
This might be hard on you,

98
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:08,099
But it's going to be
all for the best.

99
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:18,621
Don't worry!
Just another amphead.

100
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:21,991
A junkie?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:23,993
You mean the stuff
you gave me was addictive?

102
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,261
But I thought holoband...

103
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:26,595
Were designed to be
non-addictive. Right.

104
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,897
But amp's are like jamming
a wire

105
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,399
Into your brain's
pleasure center.

106
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,234
Okay, hey,
so addictive drugs,

107
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,003
Senseless sex.

108
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,972
It's a heck of a game.
How do you win?

109
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,641
It depends on who you ask.

110
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,943
Ah, so no rules?
Sounds like a scam.

111
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:43,112
Well, there's no rule book
in life, right?

112
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,948
You ask me, that's what
keeps it interesting.

113
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,317
Gotta figure out for yourself
what's important.

114
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,493
Move.

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,828
I hate that thing.

116
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,201
Just remember to keep
your finger off the trigger

117
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:07,436
Until you're ready to shoot.

118
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,271
And then be ready to shoot.

119
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:12,341
Oh, you're a real-life
nicky casino.

120
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,877
You think this is real life?

121
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:19,882
You think this is what
I look like in real life?

122
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,518
Wait a minute.
Then who are you really?

123
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,486
Someone who's being
paid to help you.

124
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,755
So keep quiet and keep alive.

125
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,216
Great.

126
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,385
Now do it again.

127
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,387
You don't mind if I smoke,
do you?

128
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,726
Zoe hated my smoking.

129
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,832
Actually, she hated anything
at all to do with fire

130
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,901
Ever since our old house
burned down.

131
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:22,304
Remember that
ramshackle place?

132
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:25,441
Wood beams.

133
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,943
Wood paneling.

134
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,211
Not the best idea
when you're working

135
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,548
With powerful computers.

136
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,050
Do it again.

137
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,552
They said it started
in my first-floor office,

138
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,454
Got into the walls
and crept upstairs

139
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:42,791
While we were sleeping.

140
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:45,160
By the time I woke up,
choking,

141
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:47,362
The fire was, as they say,

142
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,797
Fully engaged.

143
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:57,005
Do it again.

144
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:01,510
Zoe was five.

145
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:06,081
We had just
moved her upstairs,

146
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,385
Her very first big-girl room
up in the attic.

147
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:13,255
She loved it up there.

148
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:17,059
We could hear Zoe's screams.

149
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:20,529
But we couldn't get past
the flames on the stairs.

150
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,299
Let's do it again.

151
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,972
But that sound.

152
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,343
That sound.

153
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,045
The flames and...

154
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,348
My little girl screaming.

155
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:42,150
Do it again.

156
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,625
Could hear her screams.

157
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,927
But we couldn't get to her,

158
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:55,163
Past the flames on the stairs.

159
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,365
Do it again.

160
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:58,166
I tell you,

161
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:02,571
That was the longest
seven minutes of my life.

162
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,908
I can only imagine what
it must have been like for her,

163
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,243
Trapped up there
all alone,

164
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,880
Watching the flames
climb the walls,

165
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:16,885
Melting all the little
glow-in-the-dark stars

166
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:20,422
That she glued
to the ceiling.

167
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,893
Trapped in a box
of living fl...

168
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,811
Well...

169
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,816
Look at that.

170
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,324
He had me doing
all this soldier stuff,

171
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,426
Basic military crap

172
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,828
That the robot already knew.

173
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,463
And then he started
barking orders at me

174
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:03,198
Like some
crazy drill sergeant

175
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,967
From one of those
tauron war movies.

176
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,802
Doesn't sound
like much of a test.

177
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,136
Yeah, I know.

178
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,272
But he just kept it up,

179
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,509
Making me do things
over and over again.

180
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,111
You knknow, it just
pissed me off so much,

181
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:19,915
I wanted to reach out
and snap him.

182
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:22,951
What?

183
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,586
My God!

184
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:26,488
I'm such a frakking idiot.

185
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:28,290
Don't you see it, Lace?

186
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:29,558
That's exactly
what he wanted me to do.

187
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:31,293
He wants you
to break his neck?

188
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,794
No, no, no, to react.

189
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:34,997
He knows that I'm never gonna
admit that I'm in the robot.

190
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:37,933
So he's trying to trick me
into revealing myself.

191
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,368
Zoe, are you still sure

192
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:42,070
That it would be
the worst thing if you did,

193
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:45,107
You know, come out to him?

194
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:47,175
Yes.

195
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,144
Are you kidding?

196
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:52,481
Lace, the man lied to me
when he put me in the robot.

197
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,016
If he really thought of me
as his daughter,

198
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,084
He would've never have done
the things that he did.

199
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,186
But it doesn't matter,
because at the end of the day

200
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:01,189
He just used me to save
his fat military contract.

201
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,592
Business first,
same old daddy.

202
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,127
And you know what,
if I were to tell him

203
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:07,829
That I was in there now,
he would just use me again.

204
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,898
Maybe in ways
that were even worse.

205
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,200
Okay, so you know what,
he can't know.

206
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:14,302
Okay.

207
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:18,974
Okay, so what
are you gonna do?

208
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:20,542
Well,
what am I supposed to do?

209
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,312
Follow every order
no matter how stupid,

210
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,948
Refuse to

211
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,386
I have to turn me off,

212
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:35,323
Just be the robot.

213
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:37,793
Can you even
do that anymore?

214
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:59,247
This is my place.

215
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:02,818
At least it's the game's
version of my place.

216
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,287
It's locked.

217
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,055
Someone's taken possession.

218
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:08,290
Tamara?

219
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:12,060
Maybe. Try knocking.

220
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:15,530
Tammy?

221
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:16,832
Tammy!

222
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,935
What?
Who the frak is it?

223
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:24,206
I'm Joseph Adama.
Who the frak are you?

224
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:26,241
Adama, Adama, Adama.

225
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:28,110
Uh, you know,

226
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,411
That doesn't mean
frak-all to me.

227
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:31,179
No, no.
Bye-bye.

228
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:34,916
Don't let him take
his holoband off.

229
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:36,918
Come here!

230
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,520
What is this?

231
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:40,122
No, no, let me go.
Let me go.

232
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,324
Sit down.

233
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:44,226
Put your frakkin' hands down,
all right?

234
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,262
And don't even think about
touching your holoband.

235
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,264
Okay, okay, you got it.
Whatever you say.

236
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,800
All right.
All right?

237
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,869
Hands down...
you're gonna sit down,

238
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,837
And you're gonna
answer my questions.

239
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:57,773
I got it, I got it.

240
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:03,845
What the frak have
you done to my place?

241
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:07,315
Clear.

242
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,550
There's no one else here.

243
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:11,253
No, no, of course not.
It's just me.

244
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,256
That's...look, you want
my stash, right?

245
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:15,991
All right,
you take my stash.

246
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:18,026
I don't want any trouble.
I don't want your drugs.

247
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:20,028
I'm looking
for a young girl.

248
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:21,563
Oh, well, you just
should have said something

249
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:24,132
In the first place,
because I could get you

250
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,300
A really sweet piece
of tail.

251
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:26,935
She's my daughter,
you motherfrakker.

252
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,870
All right, look,
I told you,

253
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,540
I would absolutely
help you if I could.

254
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:34,843
This girl,
have you seen her?

255
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,978
Oh, frak, yeah, yeah.

256
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:39,214
This is, uh...
this is the dead girl, right?

257
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:40,315
This is the dead girl.

258
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:42,117
The dead girl?

259
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:44,953
Well, yeah, I mean, that's
what all the players call her.

260
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:46,421
She's like a new part
of the program,

261
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,089
New character.

262
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:50,258
You can't kill her
'cause she's already dead.

263
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,526
Very bad mojo, you know?

264
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:52,994
Where can we find her?

265
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:54,963
I don't know.
Come on!

266
00:15:58,868 --> 00:15:59,935
They said they saw her
at that club.

267
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:00,936
What's it called?

268
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,138
Mysteries.
Maybe. Mysteries.

269
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:04,372
Where the hell's it at?

270
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:10,879
What's it to you, pops?

271
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:19,755
They just busted in,
just now.

272
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:23,091
They just busted in here, man.
They just busted in.

273
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,227
I'm just looking
for my daughter.

274
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,195
And how could the dead
chick be your daughter?

275
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:30,465
Doesn't compute,
'cause she's part of the game.

276
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,135
Well,
if you help me find her,

277
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,303
I'll pay you.

278
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,038
We don't play
for the cubits, man.

279
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:39,041
Your bitch-ass daughter
took out two of my friends.

280
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:41,410
Hey, watch your frakkin'
mouth when you talk about her!

281
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:44,746
You're not gonna have to
listen to it much longer.

282
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,951
Hey, you guys
got a beef with him,

283
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:50,185
Just leave me out of it,
all right?

284
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,320
I was just looking to score,

285
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,722
And this jagoff
said he could help me.

286
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,023
All right.

287
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,425
Just step away.

288
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:59,061
We'll deal with you later.

289
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:01,063
Sure. Absolutely.

290
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,432
Whatever you say.

291
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,834
Sorry, pops.

292
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,870
I'll be sure to say hi
to your daughter,

293
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:11,073
Your little girl if I...

294
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:20,082
Frak you.

295
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,157
Damn it!

296
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,926
Are you all right?

297
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,494
No, I'm not all right.

298
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:35,063
I got shot,
and it frakkin' hurts.

299
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:41,203
It's just a graze.

300
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,339
I'm not gonna de-rez.

301
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:45,907
Now get out.

302
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:47,175
What?

303
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:49,077
Get your pink newbie cheeks
out of this game

304
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,379
And don't come back in

305
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,147
Until you've got
your frakkin' head on straight.

306
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:53,749
No, but my daugh...
I gotta get my...

307
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:55,050
Yeah, you're no good to her
if you're gonna freeze

308
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:57,085
Every time some dirtbag
shoves a gun in your face.

309
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,058
I thought taurons
had bigger stones.

310
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:10,198
Did the cabbie see him?

311
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,701
No, it was just me.

312
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,403
Are you sure
it's the same car?

313
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,104
Yes, I'm sure.

314
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,973
It was the same car
that I saw in the city

315
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,242
Wrapped around the tree
the other day.

316
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,244
Well, that's just not possible
unless, I mean...

317
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,446
I know, unless I'm frakkin'
nuts, right, Clarice?

318
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:26,848
No, I'm just saying
that there's probably

319
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,784
Lots of cars out there
that look like that

320
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,052
And lots of drivers too.

321
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,055
And I think that it was
perfectly acceptable

322
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,323
Given everything
that you've been through.

323
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,494
You know, I think it's
all really about Zoe.

324
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:42,964
Did you ask Daniel
about the avatar?

325
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,366
Yeah.

326
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,768
He said that the code
was unstable or something,

327
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:47,836
That...

328
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:52,908
That it wasn't her, that...

329
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,843
You know what, it's the last
thing I need anyway,

330
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:56,278
Is to start seeing
more dead people.

331
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,014
No.

332
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:00,982
And now I feel terrible.

333
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,984
I don't think
you should be alone.

334
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:04,252
I'm fine, really.

335
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,755
I'll be okay.

336
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,890
Um, look,
I've got to go.

337
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,026
It's...we're having
a barbecue.

338
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:13,328
I'll call you later.
Bye.

339
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:14,930
Okay, bye.

340
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,803
Oh, look at that.

341
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,807
It certainly is
a beautiful day, isn't it?

342
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,644
Isn't it?

343
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,950
You know what a tell is?

344
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:36,418
It's an unconscious gesture,

345
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,153
A look or a twitch,
that gives away

346
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,122
The strengths or the weaknesses
of a cardplayer's hands.

347
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:42,257
It's inconspicuous, but a good
player knows to look for it.

348
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,793
And you showed me yours,
as much as yelled at me,

349
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,362
"I'm in here, daddy!"

350
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,798
So why are we still
playing this game?

351
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:52,934
I know it's you.

352
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:54,970
But if you want to keep

353
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:56,905
Hiding behind a quarter ton
of metal, fine.

354
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,240
Just don't kid yourself.

355
00:19:58,307 --> 00:19:59,708
Don't think for a second

356
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:00,842
It's because of anything
that I did.

357
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,711
Because I kept
my side of the bargain.

358
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,679
I took you out
of a virtual playground

359
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:06,715
And brought you
into the real world.

360
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,785
But I guess you can't
handle that, huh?

361
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:15,123
However brilliant you may be.

362
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:16,424
Maybe deep down inside,

363
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:20,061
You're still just
the same, scared little girl

364
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,231
That you always were.

365
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,401
Your mother and I,

366
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:30,806
We set the bar pretty high.

367
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,340
And maybe you were scared
you couldn't measure up,

368
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:33,708
So you had to condemn us.

369
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,177
I understand that,
that's only natural,

370
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:38,980
But the entire
big bad adult world?

371
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:41,750
Was it really easier to blow up
a train of innocent people

372
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:43,952
Than to face up
to your own biggest fear,

373
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,354
Which, let's face it,
is life itself, isn't it?

374
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:49,357
'cause life is scary
and brutal and unpredictable,

375
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:50,926
And you gotta make
choices like that.

376
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:53,328
And sometimes you make
the wrong ones.

377
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,037
Maybe I've made
some wrong choices too.

378
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:05,073
But you keep moving on.

379
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:08,643
And if you're lucky,

380
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,812
Maybe you get to create
something that lasts,

381
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,050
Has some meaning.

382
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:17,285
I still love you.

383
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:21,189
No matter what you did,
no matter what...

384
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:23,925
No matter what you are,

385
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:26,194
Crazy as this.

386
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:31,733
I know you're
not really even her.

387
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,101
You are all of her

388
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:36,705
That I have left.

389
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:39,107
So please...

390
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,576
Talk to me.

391
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:46,948
Please.

392
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:02,597
All right, I didn't want
to have to do this.

393
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:09,838
I know what
the robot's tolerances are.

394
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:16,478
I'm betting
they exceed yours.

395
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:23,318
Now if you want this
to end at any time,

396
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:26,821
All you've got to do
is take four steps forward.

397
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,224
And walk out of the circle.

398
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:32,060
And then I'll know...

399
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:35,597
For a fact that it's you.

400
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,534
All right?

401
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,912
Because meanwhile...

402
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:54,582
I'm ordering
the u87 to stay.

403
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:11,806
Guess you
don't knock, huh?

404
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:13,975
Stopped about the same time
you stopped answering.

405
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,780
She always signed
her name like that.

406
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,515
That's a little flower.

407
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:28,990
What the hell,
let me see that.

408
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,025
Hey.

409
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:32,927
You gave
the ferryman the coins,

410
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:35,697
You sent her on her way.

411
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:38,433
Shannon too.

412
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:42,804
Tell me, Sam.

413
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:47,508
What goes through your head
when you kill someone?

414
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:52,080
I'm sorry, what?

415
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:57,652
I...

416
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,520
How do you do what you do?

417
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:01,990
I mean, murder someone
in cold blood?

418
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,858
Are you frakking
kidding me?

419
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,660
What the frak
kind of question is that?

420
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:06,961
How do...

421
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,663
Is this about the
Graystone thing again?

422
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:10,231
No!
Because that's done.

423
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,500
You're safe.
No, please. Sam, I promise.

424
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:14,068
Then what is this about?

425
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:15,837
No, I just...
you just what?

426
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,441
Forget it.

427
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,792
You tell yourself
it's not real.

428
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,033
Why?

429
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,701
Look, I'm only
telling you this because

430
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:48,936
If you need to know,
you better know.

431
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:59,213
You tell yourself
it's not real.

432
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,683
And then...

433
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,519
Then they're not people
shooting at you anymore,

434
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:07,488
They're...Targets.

435
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:10,792
And the whole thing
becomes just a game.

436
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,843
Guess that's the place, huh?

437
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:31,479
According
to our junkie friend.

438
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:34,782
Do you really think
she'd be here?

439
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,452
That's what
the junkie said.

440
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,987
Look, there's
a stage act inside.

441
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:41,789
The host fires riddles
at the audience.

442
00:26:41,857 --> 00:26:42,957
Avoid him.

443
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:45,093
Just follow my lead
and be cool, okay?

444
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,462
Fine. Let's go.

445
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:14,956
Check your guns first.

446
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,058
No weapons
allowed in the club.

447
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:24,065
Come on!

448
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,100
You don't have to tell me

449
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:30,671
That a good man is hard
to find.

450
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:34,475
But there's got to be
one brave soul amongst you

451
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:37,712
Who's willing to risk
the ultimate price

452
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,182
For the possibility
of the ultimate reward.

453
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,851
An epiphany.

454
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,954
A privileged peek
into the mysteries

455
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:49,123
That could show our hero
how to win

456
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:53,694
This crazy game.

457
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:55,163
All you have to do

458
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,666
Is answer tonight's
riddle.

459
00:27:58,734 --> 00:28:00,468
What?

460
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:03,137
No takers?

461
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:05,106
Well, then...

462
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,812
How about you, sir?

463
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,482
What do you say, folks?

464
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,652
Is this stranger
our new prometheus?

465
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:20,755
Stranger, stranger, stranger.

466
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:24,459
Boys!

467
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:29,997
No, no, no.

468
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:31,866
Hey, hey.

469
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:35,636
Take it easy, guys, come on.

470
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:44,111
Listen, I'm sorry, I don't know
what this is all about.

471
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:45,847
I just...
why, this is all about you.

472
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,949
Right now.

473
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:49,617
Well, I'm just
looking for someone.

474
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,719
Aren't we all?

475
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:56,524
I'm...I'm trying
to find a girl.

476
00:28:56,592 --> 00:28:57,992
It's my daughter.

477
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,064
Pretty.

478
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,632
Wish I had her hair.

479
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:12,740
Maybe we can
help each other out.

480
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:16,878
Answer tonight's riddle
and all will be revealed.

481
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:24,118
Well, what if I don't
answer your riddle?

482
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:29,090
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

483
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:31,425
There's a price for failure.

484
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,895
But such
a reward for success!

485
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:38,099
Come now, don't you wanna
find your little girl?

486
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,435
The sacred vessel, please.

487
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:45,706
Hey! Lay off!

488
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,082
"as the gods
overthrew the titans,

489
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,451
"so has man
overthrown the gods.

490
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,088
"but when man visits
his sins upon his children,

491
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:04,091
How shall he be repayed?"

492
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,199
Come on.
Say something.

493
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,968
What, you didn't hear it?
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

494
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:15,903
Um, okay...

495
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:21,876
Look, I don't have an answer
for you, I'm just...

496
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,110
Won't you even try?

497
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:26,881
The ultimate reward
for the ultimate risk.

498
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:30,051
No, I'm just want
to find my daughter, that's all!

499
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:32,987
Please, folks.
Tammy?

500
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:34,956
Tammy!

501
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:36,824
Baby!

502
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:38,693
Tammy, please.

503
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,165
Pity.

504
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:46,400
The stench of
a coward offends me.

505
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:49,070
Hey.

506
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:50,104
Take him away.

507
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:51,772
Get off of me.

508
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,474
Get off of me!

509
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:55,910
Tammy!

510
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,251
All right, all right.

511
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,387
Okay, let me go.

512
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:07,857
Let go of me!

513
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:09,592
Don't come back.

514
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,327
Motherfrakkers.

515
00:31:11,395 --> 00:31:13,329
What'd I say about
staying cool, counselor?

516
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:14,997
You know, you're lucky
we're both still alive.

517
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:17,633
You want your gun
back or not?

518
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,502
Oh, yeah.

519
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,542
Hey...

520
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,877
Hey, who drew that flower?

521
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:29,912
Who drew that?

522
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,582
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

523
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,185
That's tammy's sign.

524
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,286
She was here.

525
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,854
You sure?

526
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:45,928
Frakking amp heads.

527
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,730
What are you doing?

528
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:57,707
Like you said, in here,

529
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:01,310
You're either quick
or you're dead.

530
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,213
I'll be quick.

531
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:15,624
You freeze.

532
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,996
Anybody else wants
to stay in this frakking game

533
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,431
Better clear out now.

534
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,500
I said now!

535
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,673

537
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,745
Where is she?

538
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:40,783
Where's my daughter?

539
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,185
Look at this place.

540
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,188
Deader than a doornail,
and on a Saturday night.

541
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,289
Where is she?

542
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,492
Where's my daughter?

543
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,659
You freak!

544
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,761
She was here.

545
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:54,330
Okay?

546
00:32:54,397 --> 00:32:55,598
She was here.

547
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,199
In fact,
she's the only reason

548
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,401
We've been drawing
a crowd all month.

549
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:00,903
What?

550
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,974
What are you talking about?

551
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,976
She was right here
on the stage,

552
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:08,978
Seeking answers
to the afterlife.

553
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,614
Came right up,
unlike her daddy.

554
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:13,349
When she answered
the riddle wrong,

555
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,818
We discovered she had the power
to transcend life and death.

556
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,586
It was quite a show.

557
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:18,921
Maybe she's found
the answers

558
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:22,291
That everyone's
searching for.

559
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,728
Or maybe she is the answer.

560
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,197
But if you find her...

561
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:29,565
If you find her...

562
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,567
Tell her I'll give her
star billing

563
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,169
If she comes back.

564
00:33:33,236 --> 00:33:34,937
Hell, I'll even pay her.

565
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:37,406
Real cubits..

566
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:41,544
The game speaks through
all of us differently.

567
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:44,914
Changes us in ways
that we can't expect.

568
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,616
Stick around long enough,
it'll happen to you.

569
00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:57,726
Let's go.
Back door.

570
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:04,733
Come back anytime.

571
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:08,237
Happy hour's on wednesdays.

572
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:14,910
I don't get it.

573
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:16,879
How could she be opening
secret doors in here?

574
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:19,215
What's happening to her?

575
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:20,549
Maybe the other
players are right,

576
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:21,517
She is a part of this place.

577
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:23,619
No.

578
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,155
She wasn't meant to
be part of some sick game.

579
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:27,823
She's my daughter.

580
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:31,560
She's my little girl.

581
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:34,763
My gods...

582
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,765
They're all her signs.

583
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:44,073
Wh's happening to her?

584
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,645
Seems like your daughter
has found a home.

585
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:54,116
Maybe it's time
you went back to yours.

586
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,687
Excuse me, Amanda.
You have a visitor.

587
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,656
Dr. Thomas vergis.

588
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,224
Vergis?

589
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:37,660
Tell him Daniel's
down in the lab.

590
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:39,395
He's asking for you.

591
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:42,431
I told him you were busy,
but he was very insistent.

592
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:46,068
All right, show him in.

593
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:06,555
Welcome, dr. Burgess.

594
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:14,830
Dr. Graystone.

595
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:17,099
How can I help you?

596
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:21,704
Are you familiar
with tauron customs?

597
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:25,174
I noticed your gloves.

598
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:29,044
I suspect that
you're also in mourning.

599
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,013
Some might
call it mourning, yes.

600
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:37,152
Two of my employees
were murdered.

601
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,054
Beaten to death
during a break-in at my plant.

602
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:40,689
Oh, my gods,
I didn't know.

603
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:42,124
I am so sorry.

604
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:44,259
The thieves took
something called an mcp.

605
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,662
It's a key element in a
Caprican defense contract

606
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,464
That my company's
competing for.

607
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:51,667
It's a contract
for a robotic soldier.

608
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,103
And just days later,
the contract was awarded

609
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,705
To Graystone industries.

610
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:59,808
It seems that Daniel
had suddenly developed

611
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,643
An identical mcp
of his own.

612
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:12,354
Well, look at that.

613
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:15,157
Caesar really likes you.

614
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,569
Tell you what.

615
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:30,672
We'll do one more test.

616
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,443
And then we'll call it
a day.

617
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:40,382
Scanner up.

618
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:45,988
Now here's the deal...

619
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,125
I love my dog.

620
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:54,329
But I love
my daughter even more.

621
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,565
And if there's
even a slight chance

622
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,600
That some small
part of her is tangled up

623
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:02,071
In your alloy skeleton,
I've got to know.

624
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:06,175
Are you trying to say
that my husband

625
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,111
Stole your mcp

626
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,313
And murdered those people?

627
00:38:11,381 --> 00:38:13,649
No.

628
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:15,117
Not personally, no.

629
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:16,618
He doesn't have
the courage for that.

630
00:38:16,686 --> 00:38:19,822
This is my husband
that you're talking about.

631
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:22,357
If you knew him,
you would know that

632
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,226
This is not
even remotely possible.

633
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:26,261
The question is
is do you know him?

634
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:30,532
I don't give a frak
who you think my husband killed.

635
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,168
He's my husband.

636
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:38,173
Get out of my house.

637
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:00,062
So...

638
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:03,999
U87, take the gun.

639
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,744
And I'm gonna count to five.

640
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:20,048
And I want you...

641
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:24,386
To shoot the dog.

642
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:34,696
One...

643
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:40,102
Two...

644
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,810
Three...

645
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:56,552
Four...

646
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:05,194
Five.

647
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,319
You didn't miss.

648
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,088
They were blanks.

649
00:40:39,462 --> 00:40:41,096
U87, shut yourself down.

650
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,654
Sweetheart?

651
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,549
On.

652
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,477
I can't believe it.

653
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,746
He actually
made you shoot caesar?

654
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:31,116
With blanks.

655
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:34,185
The funny thing is...

656
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:36,154
As soon as I picked
up the gun, I knew.

657
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,591
The robot knew.

658
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,593
The weight was off
by a tiny fraction,

659
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,661
Quarter rounds
instead of full.

660
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,797
Well, thank gods.

661
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:48,433
You wanna
know something?

662
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,836
If they were full...

663
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:55,073
I might've
pointed the gun at him.

664
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,741
Zoe, he's your father.

665
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:01,112
At least he's...Yeah.

666
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,582
Get me out of here, Lace.

667
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,652
Before I do something
I really regret.
