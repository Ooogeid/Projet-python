1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
Previously on Caprica...

2
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,068
You wonder what they
would think if they knew

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,803
that you stolen my chip
and killed two of my men.

4
00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:08,605
My company's future is
the product of a crime.

5
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:11,875
I got to hand it Vergis...
that's an elegant design.

6
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:14,577
You swore that vergis
would never find out.

7
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:16,581
- About the MCP?
- He knows.

8
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,578
I'm here to buy the
Caprica City Bucaneers.

9
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,427
It's your dream.

10
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:23,616
My dream is to tear up your dream.

11
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:27,014
Welcome to New Cap City.

12
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:28,720
What's the object of the game?

13
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:30,656
It's a mystery.

14
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:32,988
It's almost like figuring
out the object of the game

15
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:35,596
is the object of the game.

16
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:39,649
I thought my daughter was gone forever.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,996
Tamara sent me.

18
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:43,265
Look, she's in V-world,
and she can't get out.

19
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,752
My daughter's dead.

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,273
She died in the Maglev attack.

21
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,993
Stop!

22
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:50,236
Who's this?

23
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:51,954
That's what I want you to figure out.

24
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:54,947
I need you to find this kid.

25
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,564
I'd do anything to help my friend,

26
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:00,255
even enlist the help of
terrorists from the STO.

27
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:02,071
You're going to Gemenon.

28
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:03,952
You have to take me
there in the robot body.

29
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,626
You chickened out once, Lacy.

30
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,472
I have to go to Gemenon and
take Zoe's package with me.

31
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,934
I can maybe set up a
meeting with Barnabas.

32
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,948
Lacy, you're asking for my assistance,

33
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:16,236
yet you're not telling me
what I'm getting myself into.

34
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,086
I'm hatching my own plan
to escape from the lab.

35
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:22,470
12 planets, and no one
woman is interested in me.

36
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:26,294
- I'm... I'm Philomon.
- I'm Rachel from V-match.

37
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,206
I feel like there is a
be inside this machine,

38
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:30,050
something alive.

39
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,469
There is a brilliant mind in here.

40
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:37,719
I'm getting closer to finding
the Zoe Graystone avatar.

41
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:39,262
It's called a swipe drive.

42
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:40,468
So if Zoe's program were on a computer,

43
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,482
- and we used that.
- We would have it.

44
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:48,139
We would be able to recreate
the living Zoe avatar.

45
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,257
Hey, wake up.

46
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:33,461
Why?

47
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,801
Because Nestor and I were up all night

48
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,574
going over the information

49
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,947
you pulled off Daniel
Graystone's computer.

50
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:42,723
The avatar program was there.

51
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,365
- So we have it?
- No.

52
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,672
At some point it was downloaded off of it

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,344
into another device.

54
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,350
Well, if it was downloaded,
then it's somewhere,

55
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:53,757
and if it's somewhere, we
can have our resurrection.

56
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,026
It's gonna be okay.

57
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,735
Daniel Graystone moved
it to another device.

58
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,708
He knows where it is.

59
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,690
Amanda Graystone goes to
the memorial every morning.

60
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,599
I think she could do
with a shoulder to cry on,

61
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,374
poor little thing.

62
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,638
Excuse me, what are you doing?

63
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:35,442
We're not gonna hurt anything.

64
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,945
We're just relocating these things.

65
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,481
No, no, no. No, you can't.

66
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,053
You can't that. Where are you going?

67
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,661
All these memorials will
be just like they were,

68
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:44,897
only set up down at Appolo Park.

69
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:47,771
No, but the people died
here, they died here.

70
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,409
They're building a
permanent shelter there.

71
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:50,579
But you can't... you can't do this.

72
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,915
Excuse me.

73
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,353
This isn't... this is not
right. This isn't right.

74
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:55,991
Amanda, what's going on?

75
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,596
Let's get your faces on camera.

76
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:00,002
Okay, you know what?
Put that away, please.

77
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,439
Sister, step aside, please.

78
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,343
You put your hands on person of cloth?

79
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,716
This is sacred ground!

80
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:06,852
All right, you know what?

81
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,423
Come on, let's go. It's not worth it.

82
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:10,758
Yeah, go with the gods. Go on. Go!

83
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,766
You don't want to be recognized here.

84
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,900
Come on, let's go.

85
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,772
Come on.

86
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,374
It's just like they did with
Zoe's things, you know...

87
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,776
clearing them all away, out of sight.

88
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,410
Sorry, it's...

89
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,713
it's probably not even my place to say.

90
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,416
What is it?

91
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,551
You don't... you look so pale.

92
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,789
I thought I saw someone back there.

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,495
Never mind. It's nothing, really.

94
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:17,335
I thought I saw my broth Darius.

95
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:21,306
But whatever I thought I
saw, I know that I didn't.

96
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:25,075
And I can't...

97
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:32,913
'cause Darius is dead.

98
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,385
Lacy, I need you to meet me

99
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,753
in the VIP room right now.

100
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:52,794
Zoe, I'm sorry. Have
you been waiting long?

101
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,595
No, it's just...

102
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:57,464
you're not gonna believe what happened.

103
00:05:57,532 --> 00:06:00,968
Sister Clarice was in my
dad's lab snooping around.

104
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,669
She looked me right in my eye.

105
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,439
Well, do you think she knows it's you?

106
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,278
No but... but she was
definitely looking for me,

107
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,948
that's for sure.

108
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,550
She was messing with my dad's computer.

109
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,351
I mean, that's just way too close.

110
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,986
Look, make sure that Barnabas knows,

111
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,787
I'm gonna need a big box, okay?

112
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:19,791
Don't even give him a hint
of anything that's gonna...

113
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,693
What? What's wrong?

114
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,727
Nothing.

115
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:26,062
Everything's good.

116
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,965
Lacy, my part of the
plan is getting the robot

117
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,366
out of Daniel's lab, okay?

118
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,667
And I'm already getting it done.

119
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:34,969
I already have another
date with cute lab boy.

120
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:38,406
- Do you like him?
- It's not relevant.

121
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:40,908
Your part is getting us to Gemenon, okay?

122
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,709
And one is pointless without the other.

123
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,711
Look, I just told you everything's okay.

124
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,347
I can do it.

125
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,685
It just... I need more time.

126
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:55,921
You have to trust me. I
have never let you down.

127
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,056
Oh, right.

128
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:01,557
Original Zoe wanted me to
get on that train, not you.

129
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,259
I have never let you down.

130
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,740
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing there, Tad?

131
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,341
Just tossing them.

132
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,376
No, no, no. Now, down when you place...

133
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,478
Hey, tell that guy no standing around.

134
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:33,246
Go.

135
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,520
Excuse me sir,

136
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,587
the, uh... the entrance to
the store is around front.

137
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:42,256
That's all right.

138
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,530
Take me in.

139
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:58,332
Uh.

140
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:03,269
No, no, I can't.

141
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:05,437
- I don't...
- What?

142
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:06,804
really want anything to do with this.

143
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,906
Dead people shouldn't have avatars.

144
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,474
Tamara's not dead.

145
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,909
What?

146
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:14,410
No, that's not true,
'cause you're the one...

147
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,646
She did die in the Maglev attack.

148
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:20,585
But now you've seen her
in the virtual world.

149
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:22,587
The avatar you saw,

150
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,891
is my daughter.

151
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,826
Only I don't know enough
to find her on my own.

152
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:29,729
You've got to help.

153
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:31,964
You've got to help her.

154
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,734
For the gods' sakes, please.

155
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:11,822
You call yourself a photographer,

156
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,092
and this is the best you can do.

157
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,094
Lousy.

158
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,434
So how much further to this new crap?

159
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:30,204
- It's New Cap.
- Yeah, as in New Cap City.

160
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:33,207
And still ways to go, okay, Joseph?

161
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:36,142
So this New Cap, it's a part of V-world?

162
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,144
Yeah, only it's like a game.

163
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:39,579
And that's where Tamara is, right?

164
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,681
You better hope she's still in there.

165
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:43,683
If she's walking around
the rest of V-world,

166
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:46,219
it's gonna be frakkin' impossible.

167
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,455
Well, if Tamara told
you she'd be in the game,

168
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,790
that's where she'll stay until I find her.

169
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,659
She's smart. She's an Adama.

170
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:57,328
Okay.

171
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:01,031
Is this it?

172
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:03,033
Is this New Cap City?

173
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:05,301
I think we need to go
over some ground rules.

174
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:07,403
Your avatar's code,
it's like genetic code.

175
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:10,372
Once you die, the game
will ban you for life.

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,707
No matter how many hacks you try,

177
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,641
you cannot get back in.

178
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,610
And your hopes of finding your daughter...

179
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,646
well, they die with you.

180
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:23,083
That's a small gun.

181
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,085
It's fine, okay?

182
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,020
Try not to die.

183
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,167
What the frak?

184
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:49,104
I really think you need a bigger gun.

185
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,591
Coming through.

186
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:15,362
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
Back away, back away!

187
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,463
Okay.

188
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:18,297
Did anyone see what happened?

189
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:43,071
And all it needs is,
like, a tasteful ribbon,

190
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,607
around the neck of the bottle, like...

191
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:49,475
like this.

192
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,210
Do you know how much that bottle costs?

193
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:56,147
Desire will kill you.

194
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,516
I just need to spend some
time with Amanda Graystone.

195
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:03,219
She sees people who aren't there.

196
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:06,022
So?

197
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:08,490
Amanda is the mother of Zoe,

198
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,726
and Zoe is the mother of life everlasting.

199
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:15,996
There is a connection. This is a sign.

200
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:20,133
God is using these women to speak to me.

201
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:23,370
And I have to listen.

202
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,012
Where the hell are we going?

203
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,715
Can't we just... can't we just fly?

204
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,421
- Yeah, sure, man. Fly?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:45,755
All right, sure.

206
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:47,223
Yeah, I was just waiting
for the right moment.

207
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:48,591
Okay. Okay, no just...

208
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,193
All right, spread your
arms out in front of you.

209
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:54,429
Okay, now, get your chin up to the sky.

210
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:57,065
You're gonna want to be
careful, that when you take off,

211
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,601
you don't over-correct and
slam into the building.

212
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:02,436
Now, it's really easy to
hit the building, okay?

213
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,503
- Just take a deep breath.
- Ready.

214
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,104
All right, and...

215
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,572
What are you, an idiot, man?

216
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,174
No, we can't fly. It's a non fantasy game.

217
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,009
Frak!

218
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,510
Come on, man get with the program.

219
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,078
If you can't do it in real life,

220
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,113
then you can't do it
in a non-fantasy world.

221
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:20,049
No one has superpowers. No one can fly.

222
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:33,593
Hey, listen, so the rules in here

223
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:35,428
are just like in the real world?

224
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,564
- Right. 
- Well, that's no fun.

225
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:40,232
What kind of world is that?

226
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,767
It's the kind of world
where you can shoot someone

227
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:45,203
in the head without going to jail...

228
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:47,105
Frak fifty women in one night

229
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,606
without taking vinagro... how about that?

230
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:49,740
Really?

231
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:52,609
You're gonna do just fine.

232
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,111
Just remember not to die.

233
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,879
Remember not to die.

234
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:15,218
Guess what I found.

235
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:20,055
Scorpion marsh genuine ambrosia?

236
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,600
I thought I saw him again.

237
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,302
Your brother?

238
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:37,770
Uhuh.

239
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:42,140
There was a crash in the city...

240
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,143
and I saw him there.

241
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:49,613
I don't understand.

242
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,650
My brother died in a car crash.

243
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:59,554
And I was at the scene
of another crash today,

244
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:03,424
and I saw him there, so I chased him.

245
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,158
- Chased him?
- Yeah.

246
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:09,395
It must have been quite a sight...

247
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:13,565
crazy lady chasing a ghost.

248
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:18,135
But then he vanished
into a parking garage.

249
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,170
And...

250
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,473
this was there.

251
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,652
Oh...

252
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,590
That's where it happened.

253
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:48,092
What?

254
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,260
The accident.

255
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:52,362
That's... where the accident happened.

256
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,630
Are you sure?

257
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,499
Yeah, I'm sure.

258
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,968
I was in the car.

259
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:12,178
That's where my brother was killed.

260
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:14,513
That just must have been terrible.

261
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:18,416
It was terrible.

262
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:22,519
The trauma and...

263
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:26,224
therapy and talking and...

264
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:30,394
more therapy and more talking.

265
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,730
And finally.

266
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:37,433
Some really good drugs...

267
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,168
The strong ones.

268
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:46,508
Oh, I shouldn't mix.

269
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,977
I won't tell.

270
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:56,649
Because you're my friend.

271
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,024
If you're ready to meet
the love of your life,

272
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:09,992
try V-Match.

273
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,259
Is Daniel Graystone to blame

274
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,194
for his company's recent stock tumble?

275
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:15,262
- Jack, your take.
- Thumble is putting it mildly.

276
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,364
Graystone Industries is in a free fall.

277
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:18,765
So is the entire tech sector.

278
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,166
Graystone plays long ball. He'll be back.

279
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:24,202
This limited-edition version
of the Graystone OS-9 holoband

280
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,770
is unsurpassed in quality.

281
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:30,474
No shot... centaurs win possession.

282
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,580
How come the Bucs are
only a ten-point favorite?

283
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:37,216
It might take more than two wins in a row

284
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:38,551
to start thinking juggernaut.

285
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:41,353
Hey. I had court-side seats,

286
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:42,687
thought I'd stop by, say hello.

287
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:44,456
You're not allowed here.

288
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:47,091
Well, it's all a question
of timing, don't you think?

289
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,425
No, I don't.

290
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,360
Cyrus Xander, I have been
wanting to meet you...

291
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:51,794
- No, listen, listen...
- Who decorated this place?

292
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,129
I'm not gonna keep playing
this social dance with you.

293
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,230
- You threaten me!
- Are we dancing?

294
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:56,731
We're not dancing. You' leaving. Sean?

295
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,299
I think that you're
gonna want to hear this.

296
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't think I do.

297
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:01,868
Well, there's a rumor on the street,

298
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,703
that you only have one working MCP.

299
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,172
- What?
- But the thing is,

300
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,774
I don't think it's true.

301
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,276
I don't think you have a working MCP.

302
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,445
- That's not true.
- Why would you think that?

303
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:12,779
Because the working MCP you have

304
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,381
is the one that you stole from me,

305
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,182
and that one...

306
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,817
never worked.

307
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,286
- Score and a foul!
- Hey, someone scored.

308
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,221
Yes.

309
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,222
Fantastic.

310
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,125
Sell me the team, Daniel.

311
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,494
You're running out of options.

312
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:34,798
No shot... centaurs...

313
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:36,466
Get his picture to security.

314
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,234
I don't want to see him here again.

315
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:41,503
The stolen MCP works perfectly.

316
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:45,073
What's he talking about?

317
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:49,477
I can't believe that
Barnabas won't help me.

318
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:50,811
He might help you if you told him

319
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,613
what you had to take to Gemenon.

320
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,250
We, he can't know that.
No one can know that.

321
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:58,751
I made a promise to Zoe.

322
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:02,487
Zoe's not around.

323
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:03,688
Ok, are you sure that...

324
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:07,625
Yeah, I am.

325
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,262
- There has to be another way. I have to get to Gemenon.
- Why?

326
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,230
Because you can be a monotheist there

327
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:15,398
and have no one care?

328
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:19,168
He won't help you unless you're STO.

329
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,839
Simple, then... I'll become STO.

330
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,274
That's a big deal, Lace.

331
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:40,786
Come on, Keon.

332
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:43,689
I know you're worried about me,

333
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:48,126
but I can handle it...

334
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:51,329
Especially if you're there with me.

335
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,104
Tackle by May!

336
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,539
No, no, you don't understand.

337
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,474
This is good. This...

338
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,742
this could be really good.

339
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,610
No, it's really not...

340
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,211
He doesn't believe the MCP works.

341
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:11,479
He's no wonder he thought
we were desperate to sell.

342
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:13,180
We are desperate to sell.

343
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,048
We have an incredible robot, a thinking...

344
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,483
- We have one.
- And anticipating...

345
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,818
- We have one!
- Sentient super soldier.

346
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:20,352
The military is figuring that out.

347
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,154
When we can't deliver
on our scheduled demos,

348
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:23,355
they're gonna pull the contract.

349
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:25,056
We need time. Vergis'
money can buy us time.

350
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,357
He thinks we have
nothing. We have something.

351
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:27,758
- We can crush him with that.
- How?

352
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:30,394
- I will crush him.
- Seriously, Daniel...

353
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:31,695
Time-out, centaurs!

354
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,530
The company is overextended.

355
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:34,797
And the only thing

356
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,565
that can bring in the
kind of money we need

357
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,234
is selling this team.

358
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,635
I mean, the board can force you to sell.

359
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:44,171
I will not let him take
my team from me, ever.

360
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,607
Is that clear?

361
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:54,013
No..

362
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,050
Screw the game, I got work to do.

363
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,280
Tandem flying on a first date?

364
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:35,383
Thank the gods that there's an autopilot

365
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,717
in this thing.

366
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:38,486
Seriously, Philomon, you are such a geek.

367
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,122
Come on, Rachel, let's
see what you can do.

368
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:45,058
Let's have some fun.

369
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:46,593
Turn off the autopilot and follow me.

370
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,061
All right, but I don't
know how to fly a viper.

371
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,596
Tweak your skill set.

372
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:53,131
Just be a fighter pilot, like me.

373
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,534
Oh, ah, right... be a pilot.

374
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,068
Wait.

375
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,174
Oh, hey, okay. Watch it.

376
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,775
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Everything is flashing.

377
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:08,077
Pull up.

378
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:10,613
Pull up. Pull up, Rachel.

379
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:16,317
Frak! Frak! Philo, help.
What am I supposed to do?

380
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:21,088
Eject! Eject!

381
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:26,726
Whoa, whoa.

382
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,360
What?

383
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:30,396
Listen, listen.

384
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,164
Come on, it's not safe here. Come on.

385
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:33,431
- What? What is it?
- It's a dirigible.

386
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:34,432
- Now, come on!
- What?

387
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,433
Oh, sh...

388
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:39,436
Holy... !

389
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,039
Run!

390
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:54,982
Frak!

391
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,051
What the frak were you thinking, man?

392
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,619
Watch where you're frakkin' going!

393
00:24:58,653 --> 00:24:59,720
- I'm sorry.

394
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:01,688
- You're sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

395
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:04,290
- I'm frakking dead now!

396
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:07,326
You know what that means,
right? I can't go back!

397
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:09,761
So frak you.

398
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:13,465
You're on your own now.

399
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:14,999
I can't believe...

400
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:39,914
I can build you a new one.

401
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:44,219
Are you gonna tell me now why you didn't

402
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:46,554
just make yourself a better pilot?

403
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:50,157
Yeah, well, I set my avatar

404
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:52,793
so I could acquire skills naturally.

405
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:55,995
That way, V-world would
be more like real life.

406
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:59,498
Well, I like the way you think.

407
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:04,569
Yeah, well...

408
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:07,738
V-World piss me off a lot of the time.

409
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:10,741
The way people see this place
as an excuse to cut corners

410
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:12,309
or drop out life or...

411
00:26:12,377 --> 00:26:14,010
or do things they know are wrong

412
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:15,145
but just because they're in here,

413
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:17,813
makes it not wrong anymore.

414
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:20,782
You don't sound like
much of a computer geek.

415
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,317
I just think there are better things to do

416
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:23,785
with our technology.

417
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:25,587
Like, maybe in V-World,

418
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:28,823
w... we should extend life.

419
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:32,260
Extend life.

420
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:33,662
You mean like, make it

421
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:35,263
so we could somehow actually live here?

422
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:38,566
Yeah, well, it's not quite there yet.

423
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:41,101
It's still too fakey-fakey.

424
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:42,502
I mean, look at the sky.

425
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,704
And look at that tree.

426
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,606
All right, it's exactly identical

427
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,940
to that one over there.

428
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:49,542
Maybe someone didn't want to program

429
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,076
a million different trees.

430
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:53,612
That's just it.

431
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
That's not the way to do it.

432
00:26:55,781 --> 00:27:00,216
Living systems use generative algorithms.

433
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:03,854
With a generative model,
the system would use

434
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,555
a... basic generative kernel of a tree.

435
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:07,823
And pow!

436
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,788
An infinite variety of tree like trees.

437
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,291
I work with top-secret military robots.

438
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,459
That's really hot.

439
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:26,897
He shoots, he scores!

440
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:30,033
Frakkin' Holcott slipping
past Jacob Kovat...

441
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:32,168
and this is a major disappointment

442
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,003
for Kovat and the Buccaneers,

443
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,571
with their layoff hopes slipping away.

444
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:40,507
You know I hate watching them lose. Off.

445
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,976
Kovat is pathetic this season.

446
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:49,914
Listen, um, you want some dinner?

447
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:51,515
I'd love some,

448
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,117
but, uh, I just have too much to do.

449
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:55,652
Vergis is circling again.

450
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,921
Still thinks he can snake
the team away from me.

451
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:59,823
Okay, well, I hope you told him

452
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:01,692
to go frak himself.

453
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,093
Yes, dear,

454
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,929
but he's offering my board
all the cash they can eat.

455
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:08,199
And since our profits are in a
downward spiral because of me,

456
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,802
it's a little complicated.

457
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:12,271
What's this?

458
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:14,706
A gift.

459
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:17,775
We think that there's
only 11 bottles of that

460
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,610
in the entire 12 worlds.

461
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:22,846
Here, try it. It's...

462
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:24,514
very good.

463
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,652
I know I've been working too hard lately.

464
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,287
I'll...

465
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:34,289
I'll take some time off soon.

466
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:36,791
Ok?

467
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:38,026
Yeah.

468
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:47,700
- Serge, sustenance.
- Yes, Daniel.

469
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,869
It's gonna be a long night.

470
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:54,939
Hey, wait a minute, who's "we"?

471
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,607
Who gave you that bottle?

472
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,810
A friend.

473
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:03,646
Should I be jealous?

474
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:06,448
I'm not sure.

475
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:16,124
Well...

476
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,960
let me know...

477
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,562
dear.

478
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:58,859
You know...

479
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:01,528
if you were to program a robot
using a generative model like...

480
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,764
like something in nature...

481
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:09,768
It could benefit from modulatory input,
and like living in the real world.

482
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:11,837
And those inputs would
be different every time.

483
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:15,006
I mean, each robot would be unique and...

484
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,807
uncopyable.

485
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,576
That's not really my point.

486
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:21,278
My point is that a robot could benefit

487
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:23,213
from being in the real world.

488
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,315
You know, let it out, explore,

489
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:30,584
- get it out of the lab.
- No, no, no...

490
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:33,552
Uncopyable...

491
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,588
Cause it's analog.

492
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:37,856
Thank you. Thank you.

493
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:40,792
Thank you.

494
00:30:42,594 --> 00:30:44,794
Mmm, thank you.

495
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,654
Hey, am I catching you a bad time?

496
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:14,593
No. No, no, no. It's good.

497
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:19,063
Would you be interested in, um...

498
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:21,832
going out night, doing something fun?

499
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:22,933
Yeah.

500
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,168
- I'm actually at the dive.
- Really?

501
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:27,537
You know that place I
was telling you about?

502
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:30,840
Yeah, no, I remember.

503
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:34,209
I... I could be game.

504
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:37,045
Hi, hello.

505
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,148
Sorry, I was just on my... on my break.

506
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:44,051
You know, we have a
critical deadline to meet

507
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:46,719
and only one working MCP.

508
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:49,755
It might be good if you
were a bit more focused.

509
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:53,191
Yeah. Yes... yes, sir.

510
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:57,162
Actually, sir, I've, uh...

511
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:59,664
- I've got an idea.
- I've got food on the way.

512
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,799
You and I are going to start
all over with this body thing.

513
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:02,934
Yeah.

514
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:06,437
No, yeah, my idea is that...

515
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,641
Look, we've be treating
the MCP like it's digital...

516
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,810
because it supposed to be.

517
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:15,945
So we expect to be able to
reproduce a perfect copy.

518
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:18,980
But what if something in the MCP...

519
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:22,149
is analog?

520
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:25,885
Like a person created
through a generative process,

521
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,920
there's no way we'd be able
to make a perfect copy of that

522
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,922
and that is exactly what's happening.

523
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,725
Essentially...

524
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,460
a tiny difference would make a difference.

525
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:38,061
Have you identified anything analog

526
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:39,162
or hybrid digital-analog?

527
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,532
No. It's just a theory.

528
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,735
You can go home now.

529
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:49,738
Leave me your notes. I'll take over.

530
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:57,646
Generative process...

531
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:59,447
like a human system.

532
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:13,180
Tamara!

533
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,205
You know that, that is
strong stuff, that purple.

534
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:46,141
Be careful.

535
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,677
Yeah, I know.

536
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:51,445
I remember.

537
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:56,516
I'm just bracing myself for th..

538
00:34:56,584 --> 00:35:00,019
- For?
- For this.

539
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:04,656
Oops.

540
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:11,095
This.

541
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:13,697
You know the old saying,

542
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:16,099
"all of this has happened before,

543
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,234
and all of it will happen again"?

544
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:21,870
Delphi convalescent institute.

545
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:25,140
But it's just...

546
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,243
a form letter requesting a donation.

547
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,413
This is the place.

548
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,682
Delphi convalescent institute.

549
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,083
Am I, am I missing something?

550
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:41,253
I was there for two and a half years.

551
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,790
The accident.

552
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:48,126
Two and a half years...

553
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:51,261
Were your injuries that severe?

554
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,562
No.

555
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,731
No, that's...

556
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,567
that's not what this hospital is.

557
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:00,469
I went here, to Delphi,

558
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:04,238
three years after the accident...

559
00:36:08,276 --> 00:36:11,578
when I was having trouble...

560
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:13,345
coping with reality.

561
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:20,450
I went crazy.

562
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:43,103
Frak!

563
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,182
Don't move.

564
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,185
- Okay.
- Don't even think

565
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:00,654
about trying to get your hands up

566
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:02,256
- and de-rezzing.
- Okay

567
00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:03,691
I'm faster than you can think.

568
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,760
Please don't kill me.

569
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:09,429
- I have to stay alive.
- Don't we all?

570
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,002
Who are you?

571
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:21,773
I go by Emmanuelle.

572
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,676
What do you want from me?

573
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,776
It's not what I want.

574
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:30,779
It's what you need.

575
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,340
You need a guide to find your daughter.

576
00:37:34,116 --> 00:37:36,216
*** said you were easy to find.

577
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:38,619
Look for the cube wandering all alone.

578
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:41,354
You know, I'm amazed you made it this far.

579
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:43,089
All right...

580
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:46,358
If you're a guide, then start guiding.

581
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:50,161
Oh, I will...

582
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,131
Just as soon as we discuss
how much it will cost you.

583
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:03,045
Clarice, I saw that.

584
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,646
I saw your face.

585
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:09,552
I saw that.

586
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,920
You're joking, right?

587
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,490
No, I'm not. I'm serious, I lost it.

588
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,026
I lost my frakkin' mind.

589
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,128
I was seeing my dead brother everywhere.

590
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,633
Yeah.

591
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:28,002
Poor thing.

592
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,837
I dropped out of college.

593
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:31,572
I dropped out of life, actually.

594
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,040
I...

595
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:36,509
spent the first six months

596
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:40,746
chasing after my dead
brother down hallways...

597
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,615
some real...

598
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:44,815
some imaginary.

599
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:54,424
Yeah, you know...

600
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:59,162
they say...

601
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:02,999
that surviving is the punishment

602
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:05,568
for leaving things left unsaid.

603
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,637
Yeah, well, who said that?

604
00:39:07,704 --> 00:39:12,107
I mean, what kind of vile
person would say that?

605
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:15,878
I don't know who said it.

606
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,646
Maybe I made it up.

607
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:22,183
But it's true.

608
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:25,619
It's true.

609
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:29,520
I left so much unsaid.

610
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:31,620
There were so many
things that I didn't say,

611
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:34,454
and I wasted so much time.

612
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,823
And then he died..

613
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,824
and I was left.

614
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,461
That's my punishment. That's my punishment.

615
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:50,028
This all is my punishment.

616
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:51,662
- Amanda, listen to me...
- This is what I get.

617
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:52,896
Listen to me.

618
00:39:52,964 --> 00:39:57,132
God does not want you to punish yourself.

619
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,967
He loves you unconditionally.

620
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,203
He made you in his image.

621
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:04,671
We don't know the reasons why

622
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,040
when he takes those that we love,

623
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:10,242
like Darius, or... or Zoe.

624
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,511
We just have to give ourselves over

625
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,480
to his final judgment.

626
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,147
We have to trust in his wisdom.

627
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:23,685
And if you can learn how to do that,

628
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:27,822
then you're gonna be free
from... from all the pain

629
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,057
of these terrible years.

630
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:33,160
Now, you... just have to...

631
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,629
trust him, Amanda.

632
00:40:35,697 --> 00:40:37,864
Trust god.

633
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:44,736
Which god?

634
00:40:44,803 --> 00:40:47,772
Which one?

635
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,075
Which god do I trust?

636
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:02,949
This way.

637
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:05,084
What is it?

638
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:09,187
If I die in here,

639
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:12,022
I'll lose the chance to
ever see my daughter again.

640
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,791
Then don't die.

641
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:39,474
Generative process...

642
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,542
like a human system.

643
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:56,455
Shh! Get... get out of here.

644
00:42:03,496 --> 00:42:06,030
Caesar, go!

645
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:12,735
You're good.

646
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:20,441
You won't work for Vergis...

647
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:24,344
but you'll work for me.

648
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:36,522
Get out of here.
