1
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:05,070
The device that I need is called
a meta-cognitive processor.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,881
An MCP chip.

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,250
And the only one in existence
is own by the Vergis Corporation.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,034
I need something stolen
from the Vergis Corporation.

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:14,178
On Tauron.

6
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,883
How could my daughter have set off a bomb?

7
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:19,571
A group known as Soldiers of The One

8
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:21,673
is responsible for the bombing.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,208
You're out here saying that Zoe was crazy.

10
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,977
Zoe wasn't crazy. She was't.

11
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:29,437
She slammed her door,
she played loud music.

12
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:31,479
And blew up a commuter train.

13
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:35,372
- I talked to her.
- You did?

14
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:36,653
When?

15
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,730
After she died, a virtual version of her.

16
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,417
An avatar.

17
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:41,418
You can't do this here!

18
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:43,572
My husband does defense work.

19
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:47,333
I need you to step away
from the lockers right now.

20
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:48,480
Now! Step away.

21
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,314
- No. What?
- Clear the hallway.

22
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:53,235
Folks, we're looking for STO agents.

23
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,119
This is for your own protection!

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,070
I exist inside a robot.

25
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:59,690
Only my bestfriend, Lacy, knows.

26
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:02,962
I have someone for you
to find... Keon Gatwick.

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,773
You need to find out how they
were gonna get from Caprica

28
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,389
into the safe house on Gemenon.

29
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,873
I have to go to Gemenon and
take Zoe's package with me.

30
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,104
I can maybe set up a meeting
with Barnabus. That all I can do.

31
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,377
I decided to give away

32
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:16,114
my most profitable invention

33
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:18,393
but there is a consequence.

34
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,933
The board called an emergency meeting.

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,278
So if I don't come up with answers

36
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,885
to this holoband crisis,

37
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,262
they're going try to force me to step down

38
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,735
from my own company.

39
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:26,841
Holobands are over?

40
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,096
And this is our future.

41
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:33,845
I'm stuck in a virtual world
with no way of getting out.

42
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,288
You need to go to the real world.

43
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:36,893
You need to find my father.

44
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,903
You know the address, you heard it.

45
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,312
I'll wait for you in New Cap City

46
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,650
so you can find me.

47
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:44,364
- Tamara sent me.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:46,103
She's in the V-World
and she can't get out.

49
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,108
My daughter's dead.

50
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:49,083
Hey, hey.

51
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:50,291
Hey!

52
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,465
Stop.

53
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:25,564
I just want you to know sir,
you have our full support here.

54
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,413
Good to see you, sir.

55
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:33,718
Congratulations, sir.

56
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:36,758
- Doctor, it's a pleasure.
- Hey, how are you?

57
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,328
It would appear that I've won back

58
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:39,766
the confidence of the board.

59
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,469
Yes, how many board members

60
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,408
came over to congratulate you?

61
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,015
Oh, seven, but...

62
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,920
- 700.
- Who's counting?

63
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,758
The C-Bucs won today.

64
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,933
No one called me Terror Mom.

65
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,872
You look beautiful, Doctor Graystone.

66
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,614
Thank you Dr. Graystone.

67
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,518
Don't go doing anything fancy here.

68
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,957
- Ah!
- No!!

69
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,398
Daniel, you'll kill your back.

70
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,505
What happened, babe?
Did you hurt yourself?

71
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,711
I'm allright. If you'll
excuse me for a moment,

72
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,213
I'll be right back.

73
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,797
What are you doing here?

74
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,498
It's a party.

75
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,033
I love to party.

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,068
It's a private function with a guest list.

77
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,669
I'm not quite sure how you got in.

78
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,437
I donated a frak-load of money...

79
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:42,405
just like all the others.

80
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:45,840
Clenched-ass gasbags in the room.

81
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:48,075
Museum doesn't care if my cubits

82
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:49,843
have Tauron dirt all over them.

83
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,712
Just look at this...

84
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,014
stockholders,

85
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,949
friends.

86
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:58,017
So?

87
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,418
I wonder what they would think if

88
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,852
they knew that you'd stolen my chip

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,354
and killed two of my men.

90
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,257
We should get together while I'm on-world

91
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,392
discuss the situation.

92
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,437
- Did Vergis say something to you, Daniel?
- It's nothing.

93
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,972
Everything's going to be fine.

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,275
What did he say to you, babe?

95
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,310
It's about the U-87 contract.

96
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:28,811
He won't accept that we got the job,

97
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,713
and he's yelling about
his intellectual property.

98
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,414
No much merit to his arguments,

99
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,049
but he could cause us a lot of trouble.

100
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,784
- Dr. Xander is the gate.
- Yes, allow access.

101
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,787
Tell him I'll meet him in the lab.

102
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,055
You should go on to bed.

103
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,156
This might take some time, sweetheart.

104
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:44,391
Really? You're gonna go like that?

105
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:45,792
Sorry. Try and get some sleep.

106
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,660
I know you haven't been
sleeping well lately.

107
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:48,928
I worry about you.

108
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,563
Yeah.

109
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:57,402
You'll tell me the rest
when you're ready, yeah?

110
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,571
Yes.

111
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,639
He's bluffing.

112
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,574
He knows we have the
MCP. That's not bluffing.

113
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,242
That's knowing.

114
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,277
No, but I mean, if he had proof,

115
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,779
we'd be court, or we'd be in jail by now.

116
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:10,847
Maybe if we go to jail, he

117
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:12,415
doesn't get anything out of it.

118
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:13,649
I think... I think he
wants to blackmail me.

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,917
He must have found something new.

120
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,252
Why else would he be here now?

121
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,487
Did he say something about blackmail?

122
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,822
Not in so many words.

123
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,623
He said that we should get
together for lunch this week,

124
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,291
and discuss our situation.

125
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,826
Our situation, that's it?

126
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:28,862
He also said that two
of his men were killed

127
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,430
in the MCP theft.

128
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,331
But who knows if he's telling the truth?

129
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,366
Serge, have Sean bring the car around,

130
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:36,535
we need to go back into town.

131
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,570
Ok, I don't think you need to panic.

132
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:40,438
You didn't commit the
break-in. He can't tie you...

133
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:43,707
I know, but the men I hired, are Tauron.

134
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,676
Who knows where their loyalty lies?

135
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:47,144
Please the gods, Daniel,

136
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,545
Are you telling me you
went to the Ha'La'Tha?

137
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:49,546
Not directly, no.

138
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,613
Not directly, but you went

139
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,515
to the Tauron mob to rob a Tauron?

140
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:53,882
I take it back! Now I'm panicking!

141
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,484
- Very helpful!
- Frak me!

142
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:59,320
I need more from you in
time of crisis, Cyrus!

143
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,258
All right let's...

144
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,793
- let's think this through.
- Yes.

145
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,395
I think you...

146
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,930
you meet with Vergis,

147
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,965
see what he wants.

148
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,967
Admit nothing. Agree to nothing.

149
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,502
Maybe he'll show his hands.

150
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:21,005
That's better. Thank you.

151
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,473
Your car is ready, Daniel.

152
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,574
I'll be right up.

153
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,676
I need to see someone else first,

154
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:27,844
find out who knows what.

155
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,512
Who? Your mob friend?

156
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,792
Welcome!

157
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,973
Ay.

158
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,988
Welcome back to Virtual
Graystone Industries.

159
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,389
I represent Daniel Graystone

160
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,222
and I'm here to get you
started on your adventure.

161
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,455
I need to find Tamara.

162
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,013
I can provide a variety of activites.

163
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,222
What are you interested in?

164
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,890
Getting my wife and daughter back!

165
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,358
Let's see, you like to play golf.

166
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,960
Go to any directional terminal...

167
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,328
- I don't need this.
- And enter the word "golf."

168
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,995
I don't need menus.

169
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,264
Take me to the hacked worlds.

170
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:41,133
The product you have
purchased only provides access

171
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:43,334
to legally acquired and
licensed applications.

172
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,902
Criminal penalties for
accessing unlicensed areas

173
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,637
can include fine of up 352 cubits...

174
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,375
We have some business to discuss,

175
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:55,844
you can pull yoursellf away
from my product for a minute.

176
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,812
What the frak are you doing?

177
00:10:57,913 --> 00:10:59,814
An old lady very kindly let me in.

178
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:02,950
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have
to talk to her about that.

179
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:04,184
I think you should get out.

180
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:07,253
You swore that Vergis
would never find out.

181
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:08,187
You lied to me.

182
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,321
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,123
- He knows.
- Vergis knows?

184
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,424
About the MCP?

185
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,959
You people are supposed
to be very good at this,

186
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:16,327
which can only lead me to the conclusion

187
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:17,194
that you set me.

188
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:18,596
If Vergis knows,

189
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,531
- then he just foud out.
- You set me up?

190
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,932
Somebody in your lab bragging?

191
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,032
Oh, no, this is no one on our end.

192
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,366
I've been covering you.

193
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,101
Ever since that bloody
chip landed in my hand.

194
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,168
It's impossible.

195
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,103
If Vergis knew, I'd be dead already.

196
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,970
Stealing from the friend of the Guatrau?

197
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,972
The Guatrau would have to make amends.

198
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,941
So let's talk about something real, ok?

199
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,975
I got a visit from a kid,
said he talked to Tamara.

200
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,309
That's a scam.

201
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:40,844
You lied to me about that!

202
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:42,011
She's gone. Both our daughters are gone!

203
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,178
No, she's there!

204
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,979
- It's impossible!
- I told you before!

205
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:49,949
Hey, son, it's okay. Go back to bed.

206
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:58,221
You're wrong.

207
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,959
You better watch your step.

208
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:02,795
Let's go Sean.

209
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:17,077
I wonder what they would think

210
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:19,179
if they knew that you'd stolen my chip...

211
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:20,814
and killed two of my men?

212
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:40,829
And killed two of my men?

213
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:48,103
Traffic is jammed on the
802 driveway this morning

214
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:50,572
due to the latest holocafe bombing.

215
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:54,009
Authorities will only say
they suspect STO involvement,

216
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,811
but have no leads...

217
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,779
Who's setting these bombs?

218
00:12:57,847 --> 00:12:59,046
We think it's Barnabus.

219
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,147
The STO cells should be battening down,

220
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,414
not calling attention to them...

221
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,782
Clarice, listen, it's not important, okay.

222
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,116
No but it's just infuriating, that's all.

223
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,518
We'll deal with Barnabus later.

224
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,852
Now, Olaf has found something

225
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,353
I believe will be very helpful for us,

226
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,389
so please, just listen.

227
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,457
It's cutting-edge.

228
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:13,758
It's called the swive drive.

229
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,361
It interfaces wirelessly
to compress and copy data.

230
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,363
So, if Zoe's programs were in
a computer and we used that...

231
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:22,064
Then we'd have it.

232
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:23,900
We would be able to re-create
the living Zoe avatar.

233
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,200
Just like he did,

234
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,402
and as a matter of fact,

235
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,037
we believe that we could
create living avatars

236
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,371
for any dead person,

237
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,507
as long as they have enough
data stored on the system.

238
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:32,974
Well, it's not just a living avatar.

239
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,376
It's a continuation of
the soul into eternity.

240
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,245
I mean, that's what we
all knew it was about.

241
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,546
And I'm certain that's what
Daniel was talking about

242
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,248
- on Sarno.
- Yes, yes.

243
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:41,883
And Zoe's avatar program

244
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,118
must be on Graystone's
computer at his home lab.

245
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:46,419
Now, we need you to go there.

246
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,220
And get that program.

247
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:58,856
Hello?

248
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,758
Hello. This, um, Sister Clarice

249
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,126
from Zoe's school.

250
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:05,261
Oh, hey, sister.

251
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,763
Please, call me Clarice.

252
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,430
Um, what I wanted to say was that I...

253
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,398
saw you on Sarno, and I
thought you were wonderful,

254
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,099
And I just wanted to tell you that.

255
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,901
Thank you so much...

256
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:17,335
that's, um...

257
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:20,804
It's incdibly kind of you
to call and tell me that.

258
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:23,441
And, um, actually, I just wanted...

259
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:25,544
come roud if I could...

260
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:28,282
you know, my way of saying goodbye,

261
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,451
seeing her room.

262
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,988
Yeah, well, if you'd called
a couple of days ago...

263
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,958
The GDD...

264
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,228
they... they searched the room,

265
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:48,165
and they... they took everything.

266
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,099
I'm afraid there's nothing
left to see, Clarice.

267
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,001
It's... it's an empty room.

268
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:55,104
Oh.

269
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:57,239
Well, um...

270
00:14:57,307 --> 00:14:59,274
I have some books, actually.

271
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:00,775
I...

272
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,211
Zoe left some books at school.

273
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,848
I could, um, bring them
round to you, if you like.

274
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,220
I mean...

275
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,189
You know why this is bad, right?

276
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,391
If the Guatrau finds out we
stole from an other Tauron,

277
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,959
he's gonna want to know why.

278
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,128
Is there anything that
they can link back to us?

279
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:25,196
If you got time to ask if a
bullet's coming at your head,

280
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:26,397
there probably isn't.

281
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,399
If it's gonna blood back
on me, I need to know.

282
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,267
Did you do your job?

283
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:31,368
Hey, I handled my business.

284
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:34,037
Now you go out and you handle yours.

285
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:38,240
You know I would deny in public,

286
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:42,410
but I really believe that you cannot get

287
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:46,079
a truly excellent Tauron steak.

288
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,481
I always find that you have to overseason.

289
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,851
What are you doing?

290
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,053
Hmm?

291
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,721
You come all the way here.
You accuse me of theft.

292
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,322
You accuse me of murder,
for the gods' sake.

293
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,092
And now we're sitting
here discussing steaks.

294
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,728
We can do both at the same time.

295
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,497
I didn't steal your chip,

296
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,199
and I didn't kill anyone.

297
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,200
There.

298
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,834
Now, if you'll excuse me...

299
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,202
No, no. No,. Shh, shh, shh.

300
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,838
Stop.

301
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,406
I moved on.

302
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:23,011
You moved on?

303
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,846
Then why are you here?

304
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:29,850
I'm here to buy the
Caprica City Buccaneers.

305
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,189
I'm sorry. What?

306
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:38,390
You didn't see it coming.

307
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,859
I was waiting to see
the look on youur face.

308
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:43,394
I'm offering 300 million cubits.

309
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,463
Why?

310
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:48,464
Maybe I got pyramid fever.

311
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:50,432
Maybe I'm looking for a way

312
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,067
to put our past unpleantness behind us.

313
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:57,304
Or just maybe...

314
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,340
I know...

315
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:02,444
to appease your board.

316
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,879
You promise to get the MCP to work,

317
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:08,882
and for that, you need cold, hard cash.

318
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:29,719
Are you kidding?

319
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:36,591
12 planets and not one
woman is interested in me.

320
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:41,228
But...

321
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:45,564
what would it say if I checked robots?

322
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,167
Hmm?

323
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,169
You'd go out with me, right beautiful?

324
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,440
Yeah, you know, you can laugh if you want,

325
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,577
but you know, I'd take you out,

326
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,412
get the joints moving,

327
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:05,514
- maybe a little bit of dancing...
- What are you doing?

328
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:08,650
Oh.

329
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:21,761
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:31,438
Reexamine the u-87's left arm solenoid.

331
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,141
There's no smoking in the lab, doctor.

332
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,243
Put it out.

333
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:47,888
Barnabus, Lacy said
something about Zoe and Ben.

334
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:49,123
Mm-hmm.

335
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:51,491
Finishing what they started.

336
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,693
She needs our help.

337
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:57,831
Look, I wouldn't bringing this to you

338
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,466
if I wasn't sure we could trust her.

339
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,736
** keeps our brain from
going down bad path.

340
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:04,605
Get in here. I'll show you.

341
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,274
An other time.

342
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:07,842
I think we were talking about my friend.

343
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,844
Yeah, bring her, that's fine.

344
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,748
If God has guided her to us,

345
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:17,251
we'll hear her out.

346
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,586
Of course if it's not god guiding her,

347
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:22,255
we'll deal with that too.

348
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:43,271
- Ey just dot understand apothsis.

349
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:44,939
They don't want it.

350
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,440
No, they just don't get it.

351
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,608
If the conclave would
grant me an audience,

352
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,807
I could make them see the value of it.

353
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,772
They are supporting Barnabus,

354
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,202
and you are going to have to accept that.

355
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,201
God calls on us to display humility

356
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,199
and place our trust in his emissaries.

357
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,266
But he just does the church's dirty work.

358
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,402
He's not one of God's emissiaries.

359
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,205
I have a plan, and I can make it happen.

360
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,274
I just need to be given
a little bit more time,

361
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,944
And then I can hand
them something glorious.

362
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,479
And afterlife that we can

363
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,545
that we can see and touch.

364
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,546
I just need a little bit more me.

365
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,884
Well, what if he really
does just want the C-Bucs?

366
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:29,852
When you first got them,
you sent out announcements

367
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:31,287
- like you'd had a baby.
- That's not him.

368
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,621
You got to have a heart to love the game.

369
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,390
Well, whatever.

370
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,525
If he's got 300 million cubits
to throw our way, let him.

371
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,893
- We need the money.
- We won't need it

372
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,961
once we give the governmt our prototype,

373
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:41,329
and I don't want to hear anything

374
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:42,697
- about not being able to duplicate the MCP.
- You have to face it.

375
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:44,298
We can't do it.

376
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,866
- We've tried everything.
- Everything, really?

377
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,468
No, actually, when I say "everything,"

378
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:50,370
I mean "everything except
for one more thing,"

379
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,438
because I really love dragging this out.

380
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:53,672
You're frustrated.

381
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,840
I'm way beyond frustrated.

382
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:58,175
There's somethin gabout
this MCP we don't understand,

383
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,877
and you know why? Because
you frakkin' stole it.

384
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:01,845
- It's not ours.
- Shh, shh.

385
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,547
Well, lucky for us Daniel,

386
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,748
the one guy who knows that for sure,

387
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,382
he's busy trying to throw us

388
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,884
wads and wads of sweaty cash.

389
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:10,185
The sweaty cach is bait
for some kind of a trap.

390
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,320
I know it.

391
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,487
I just need to try and figure out

392
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,356
what kind of mechanism it is.

393
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,594
Greetings, Sister Clarice.

394
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,362
Welcome to the Graystone residence.

395
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:30,135
I, uh, take it I'm
supposed to respond to uou.

396
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:31,536
Only if you wish.

397
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,338
I am called Serge.

398
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:34,839
Well that's an unfortunate name.

399
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:36,241
Ignore him.

400
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:37,875
Ignore him. Daniel's been programming

401
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,244
all kind of weird stuff into him lately.

402
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:41,412
Please come in.

403
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,748
Interesting home you have.

404
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:58,059
I thought you might
feel the way about them.

405
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,296
About a bunch of stupid books?

406
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,465
Yeah, well, they're 
not just books, are they?

407
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,466
It's that they belonged to her.

408
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,869
Yes.

409
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:12,271
That they belonged to her.

410
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:17,507
You know I don't have
much left of her now,

411
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:19,209
thanks to Agent Duram.

412
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:21,544
Pff, Agent Duram.

413
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:23,112
Do you know him?

414
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:25,613
He conducted a search of
the lockers at the academy.

415
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:28,382
He terrorized the staff and the students.

416
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,217
That motherfrakker.

417
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:32,417
I'm sorry, Clarice.

418
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,752
Oh, it doesn't bother me at all.

419
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,286
You'd be shocked to hear the language

420
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,553
the teachers use in the lunchroom.

421
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,755
We...

422
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:41,723
Well, thank yo very much for this.

423
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:43,558
It means a great deal to me.

424
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,726
Is... is that scorpion ambrosia?

425
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,427
Yeah. Do you know it?

426
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,195
Know it? I was practically weaned on it.

427
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:51,796
- Daniel hates it,  hates it.
- Well, most Capricans do.

428
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:54,264
They think it's too strong,
and it smells like sulfur.

429
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,232
I know. They're such babies.

430
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,400
Gods.

431
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:59,735
I know it's a bit early in the day,

432
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,337
but why don't we try a little bit?

433
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,144
Clarice.

434
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:18,447
They took everything.

435
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:20,116
That's criminal.

436
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:22,584
- Yes, it is criminal.
- I'm sorry.

437
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,519
This room...

438
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:30,857
it's just like a big open wound.

439
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:33,493
- Can I give you some more?
- Thank you.

440
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:37,364
They took absolutely everything...

441
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:40,199
except for a few drawings in Daniel's lab.

442
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:44,103
Oh, you've got some
drawings of Zoe's in his lab?

443
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,804
Mm-hmm.

444
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:47,573
Yeah, they couldn't go in there,

445
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,382
because there's a very
important defense project

446
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,320
going on.

447
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,238
Do you want to see them?

448
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:04,373
I don't know. Are we allowed in there?

449
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:10,844
Who's this?

450
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:13,312
That's what I want you to figure out.

451
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:17,150
He's a witness in a case.

452
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,487
I'll give these to Fred.

453
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:20,156
Mm, no no, no.

454
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:23,859
Not a PI, it's, hum, confidential.

455
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:27,329
I need you to find this kid.

456
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:28,263
Okay.

457
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:32,633
This is from the...

458
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:35,235
third and fourth grade.

459
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:36,569
This one.

460
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:38,604
"Dad works hard. Love Zoe."

461
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:40,106
These have been here for so long,

462
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:41,740
I don't even notice they're there anymore.

463
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,642
Perhaps you should take them upstairs...

464
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,510
in a more public place,
have them around you.

465
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:47,211
Yeah, maybe I will.

466
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,580
Maybe I will.

467
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:52,115
Ooh, that's a scary thing.

468
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:54,250
Oh yeah, that.

469
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,721
That is the very, very
imortant defense project

470
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,691
that Daniel's be working on...

471
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:04,592
Frakking ugly monster.

472
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,873
Did Zoe ever tell you

473
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:23,608
about how much she hated Daniel's work?

474
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:26,410
Mm, no, actually, I don't think she did.

475
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:29,079
Oh, she hated it.

476
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:31,281
She hated it.

477
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:33,083
Gods, she hated this.

478
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,751
Frakkin' killer robots in her house?

479
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:38,320
She'd have gone frakking nuts.

480
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,422
She did say that she loved this house.

481
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,690
No, not this house.

482
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,558
Mm, she talked about growing up here,

483
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,559
and planting a garden with you.

484
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,094
Not at this house.

485
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:50,663
It was the other house...

486
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:53,733
that burned down when she was five.

487
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:57,336
Here I go...

488
00:25:57,403 --> 00:25:59,671
dark territory again.

489
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,573
But, listen, Clarice.

490
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,577
I am very drunk,

491
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,346
and I am very glad that you came over.

492
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:10,680
I would like to thank you.

493
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:14,450
I'm just happy to give.

494
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,722
Barnabus?

495
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,028
Welcome.

496
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:49,697
Come in.

497
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:51,298
Sit down.

498
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:06,376
So, uh, tell me, Lacy,

499
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:10,847
what is it exactly that you need from me?

500
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:14,016
Um...

501
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:16,151
You got some, uh, cargo
you want to move off world?

502
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,286
What? What is it?

503
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,154
Right, right. Um...

504
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:24,691
I can't tell you that.

505
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:28,060
But Zoe died trying to get it to Gemenon.

506
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,330
I owe it to her to see her plan through.

507
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:33,298
And you're asking for my assistance,

508
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,901
yet you're not telling me
what I'm getting myself into.

509
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:43,007
What gets unleashed when
this thing gets to Gemenon?

510
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,141
If you actually knew,

511
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:45,743
then you would be criminally liable.

512
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,818
You're a very bright girl.

513
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:56,819
Thank you.

514
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:59,221
I can't help you. I don't want to.

515
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:06,228
Go.

516
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,596
- No.
- No

517
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:19,169
What were you thinking bringing her here?

518
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:20,403
She was Zoe's friend.

519
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:22,005
You know how much Zoe
meant to the movement.

520
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:23,405
No, what I know,

521
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:25,340
is that you've gotta stop
thinking with your tarse.

522
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,175
Maybe this is all about you feeling guilty

523
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:29,076
about building the bomb
that blew up her friends.

524
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:32,012
Hey! Don't say that! She
doesn't know that, and...

525
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,780
and I didn't know he was
gonna use i tfor that.

526
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:36,116
Yeah, well, maybe, you
need to explain to her

527
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,751
how god doesn't want us keeping secrets.

528
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,719
I need to know that she's with us.

529
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,821
I need to know the same about you too.

530
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,055
Huh.

531
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,623
Look, just...

532
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,391
just find out what the cargo is,

533
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,626
and then we'll talk, huh?

534
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:16,242
Someone's about to get lucky.

535
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:27,784
Rumors that Thomas Vergis

536
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,385
has made an offer for a key franchise,

537
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,852
the Caprica City Buccaneers.

538
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,186
In the wake of the bombings,

539
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:34,421
the GDD has raised the
threat level to seri...

540
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,057
Okay, folks, thank you guys so much

541
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,158
for coming out tonight.

542
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:40,327
We have a fantastic show.

543
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:41,963
Our first guest has been called

544
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:45,336
One of the brightest
minds of the 12 colonies.

545
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:47,738
He's an inventor. He's an innovator.

546
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,174
He a philanthropist.

547
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:53,681
And from what I understand,
an excellent kisser.

548
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:55,082
Ladies and gentlemen, give a big welcome

549
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:56,917
to Thomas Vergis.

550
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:59,319
Thomas Vergis, ladies and gentlemen.

551
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,755
Here... oh, here he
comes. Loing good, hey.

552
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,256
You look well sir.

553
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:05,457
I look well-fed.

554
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:07,759
Mm-hmm well, here's a gift...

555
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,093
Tauron cigars.

556
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,261
Oh!

557
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:13,197
I am going to share these

558
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:15,999
with my capable and excellent staff.

559
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,934
Staff look over there.

560
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,103
No brandy?

561
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:22,437
- You like brandy.
- I like brandy.

562
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:24,105
Well, let's talk about a re-book.

563
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,040
Okay, wow.

564
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:30,210
All right, so, Bucs versus Bulls,

565
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:31,945
Graystone versus Vergis...

566
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,780
these are classic rivalries.

567
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:35,948
No, no, no, I can't
believe you're going there.

568
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:38,951
Danny Grayste and I...
we're friendly competitors.

569
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:40,451
We are not deadly rivals.

570
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:43,120
We were a museum exhibit
together last night.

571
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:44,221
Last night? Who won?

572
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:47,791
Look, we don't fight.

573
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:50,793
Danny makes holobands, he's a toy maker.

574
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:52,861
I'm in a completely different business.

575
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,163
Come on!

576
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,831
I'm sorry, no bad blood there.

577
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:58,466
I don't know if you saw, uh, recently, he

578
00:30:58,501 --> 00:30:59,968
and his wife were on the show.

579
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:01,269
Yes, I did.

580
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:03,370
Amanda Graystone...
beautiful, intelligent woman.

581
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:05,806
My heart goss out to them
and everyone who suffered

582
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:08,341
in that terrible and senseless bombing.

583
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,409
It's, um...

584
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:11,911
it's a funny thing... tragedy.

585
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,812
It makes you realize
where your heart belongs,

586
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,247
and I was educated on Caprica.

587
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:16,748
You know that.

588
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:17,916
And I have a couple of homes here.

589
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:19,384
Well, we can all relate to that.

590
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:21,219
Well, I, um...

591
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,688
I started to think about where I belong,

592
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,156
and...

593
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:28,192
how I felt inside.

594
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:29,759
Oh.

595
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:30,994
And we're all Capricans.

596
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:32,495
I may as well make it official.

597
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:33,996
I'm gonna get my citizenship.

598
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,864
You cagey genius.

599
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:39,300
Wow.

600
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:42,169
Caprica loves you Thomas Vergis.

601
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,670
I know what he's up to.

602
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:45,171
Caprica loves you.

603
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,973
Are you ready to meet the love of your...

604
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:56,913
* I want toold you in my arms *

605
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,987
* I want hold you *

606
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:10,023
* in my arms *

607
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:11,791
* I want to... *

608
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:32,808
Yes.

609
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:42,182
* oh Rachel *

610
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,518
Thank you.

611
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,084
Hey.

612
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:37,059
Are you alright?

613
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:39,730
That could have been bad. Are you okay?

614
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:42,132
Nothing but a bruised-back story.

615
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,067
I mean, how do people wear these things?

616
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,068
They're not, huh,
they're not good for you.

617
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:48,636
I know. They throw off
your center of gravity

618
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:51,271
And totally change the
curve of your spine.

619
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,739
I mean, they're just not natural.

620
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:53,973
I'm... I'm Philomon.

621
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,008
Oh, thank the gods.

622
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,676
I... I thought that was
you standing over there,

623
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,177
but I was kind of too shy to say anything.

624
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,846
I'm... I'm Rachel from... from V-mat.

625
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:04,080
Hi.

626
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:06,515
You know, you... you look familiar.

627
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:12,252
My gods, you...

628
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,254
you lo... you look like Zoe Graystone.

629
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,255
Is that a problem?

630
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,091
Uh, well, no, but I, um...

631
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:21,761
'Cause I mean, I'm...
I'm sure that, you know,

632
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:24,096
you don't look like

633
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,597
you know, like this.

634
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:28,100
I... I... I do actually.

635
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,902
Oh.

636
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,604
So, now I feel like an idiot.

637
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:33,105
Oh, no, no, not at all.

638
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,612
Um, it's just, uh...

639
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,147
a bold statement is
what I was trying to say.

640
00:34:39,215 --> 00:34:42,318
Honestly, Philo?

641
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:43,919
Can I... can I call you Philo?

642
00:34:43,987 --> 00:34:46,856
Uh, yeah, sure.

643
00:34:46,924 --> 00:34:49,224
I thought looking like the most hated girl

644
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:50,892
in the 12 worlds

645
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:53,993
would keep all the pervs
away from me in the V-Club.

646
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:58,897
Fact is... it... it
actually made more of them

647
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,165
come towards me.

648
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,300
But then I tried having different avatars,

649
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,567
and, well, honestly,

650
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:06,868
I was just a little cash poor, but...

651
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,336
No, that's cool.

652
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:10,004
No, it's cool.

653
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:15,308
You know, despite, what people say

654
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:19,080
about Zoe Graystone.

655
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:20,883
Girl had principles.

656
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,867
Oh.

657
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:43,241
Clarice, can you hear me?
Can I get you anything?

658
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,776
She's drinking again,
and God knows what else.

659
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,611
And she's convinced herself

660
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,514
she can talk her way into miilitary labs.

661
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:55,684
She did it.

662
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,919
It's actived.

663
00:36:01,056 --> 00:36:04,125
Faith, Olaf.

664
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:09,029
Come on.

665
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:13,666
No no! Aah!

666
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:14,800
Just, take it!

667
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,735
Gods, please stop!

668
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:19,871
- H! Aah!
- No, please, stay out!

669
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,575
Still, you wonder what they would think

670
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,077
if they knew you'd stolen my chip

671
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,644
and killed two of my men.

672
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,782
Killed two of my men.

673
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:57,234
You okay?

674
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:59,503
Yeah, just a nightmare.

675
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:03,640
About Zoe?

676
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:05,274
No.

677
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:07,910
- Let's go to sleep.
- Oky.

678
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,367
Hello?

679
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:25,936
Joseph?

680
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:27,204
Evelyn?

681
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:29,840
Sorry, I overslept.

682
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:31,775
Grab yourself some coffee.

683
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:33,543
I found the guy.

684
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,345
I hope that's who you were looking for.

685
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:38,347
- Great.
- And I hope it's worth it.

686
00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:39,515
It is.

687
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,515
It's, uh...

688
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:44,184
yeah.

689
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:52,425
You okay?

690
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:53,693
What?

691
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:54,727
Oh, that's...

692
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,328
I got some Tauron on me.

693
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:57,563
Oh! A tattoo.

694
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,431
Can I...?

695
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:01,299
I mean, is it okay if I...?

696
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,200
Sure.

697
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:09,872
That's good work.

698
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,776
Um.

699
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,546
Yeah, listen, uh... I gotta go.

700
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,214
I gotta go. If I'm even a minute late,

701
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,882
I have this assistant who yells at me.

702
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:24,383
She's a horrible woman, terrible.

703
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,718
Let me, uh... let me
get my coat and stuff.

704
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,220
I'll be right back down.

705
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:34,724
I take it this means that
you have considered my offer.

706
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,562
- I have indeed, and I
consider it unacceptable.

707
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,332
I'm keeping the Bucs.

708
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:42,334
I'm sure, given what's
happened between us,

709
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:43,602
you're willing to discuss it.

710
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,603
We just did. I'm not selling.

711
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,438
Veiled threat duly noted, though.

712
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:50,240
You know, if you keep going around

713
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:51,642
making empty threats,

714
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,610
you're going to seem rather toothless.

715
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:56,612
Toothless?

716
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,914
That's not to say that
I haven't been enjoying

717
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:58,981
the little show you've been putting...

718
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:00,816
Painting yourself Caprican,

719
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:03,985
to try to take the military
contract away from me.

720
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:05,754
Ah, I'm after the military contract.

721
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,822
Very clever, smoothng a new flag,

722
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:08,990
cheering our home team.

723
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,958
I think your best bet though,

724
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:14,694
migt be to... to simply
marry a Caprican woman,

725
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:15,928
if you dare.

726
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:18,831
It's a really good theory,

727
00:39:18,932 --> 00:39:20,700
and you're in the ballpark.

728
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:22,535
Uh, I would.

729
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:25,504
I would love to take
that contract from you,

730
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:27,005
'cause after all, you would deserve that,

731
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,541
but you seem to think that the C-Bucs

732
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:33,611
are a means to an end for me, and...

733
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,613
they're not.

734
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:37,714
They're crucial.

735
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:39,516
Crucial in what way?

736
00:39:39,617 --> 00:39:41,851
You love pyramid.

737
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:43,786
As a boy, you played pyramid.

738
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,387
It was everything to be a C-Buc.

739
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:46,788
I wasn't very good, I'm afraid.

740
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:48,389
Well, geeks never are.

741
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:50,057
But you did the next best thing.

742
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,358
You bought the whole franchise,

743
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:53,793
and now you get to be the puppet master

744
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,461
with a professional ball club

745
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:57,629
and your entertain ten-year-old
runs around the joy of it,

746
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:58,697
the joy it.

747
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:00,298
That's true.

748
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:01,366
I do love it.

749
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,002
It's your dream.

750
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,210
My dream is to tear up your dream.

751
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:21,018
You stole from me.

752
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,387
Well...

753
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,389
I forgive that. That's good business.

754
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,860
But the two deaths that
you are responsible for...

755
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:36,030
those men were like brothers to me.

756
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:38,865
I am no noss to their children.

757
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,335
See these?

758
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:46,838
These reprent the children in my life...

759
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,042
My children...

760
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,677
my children,

761
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,744
my sister's,

762
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:58,881
my Godschildren.

763
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:05,921
These two are orphans.

764
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,867
I am Tauron...

765
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,935
blood for blood.

766
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:28,704
I did not kill those men.

767
00:41:30,707 --> 00:41:31,907
I had nothing too with it.

768
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:33,708
You need time and money

769
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:37,244
to try and get my chip to work, so...

770
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:38,846
frak the 300 mil.

771
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,049
I'll ge you 500. I'll take the team.

772
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,784
I don't know if I'll ruin them

773
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:45,419
or win a championship, but...

774
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:47,955
whatever cuts you deeper.

775
00:41:48,056 --> 00:41:49,723
Then...

776
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:55,294
I will find the next thing you love.

777
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:59,064
Eventually, I will destroy your company,

778
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:01,899
but before that you have
so my precious things.

779
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,338
Until the debt is paid.

780
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:17,312
Thank you for the drink.

781
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
