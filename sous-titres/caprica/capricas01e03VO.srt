2
00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:03,253
Come on, Lacy.

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,422
I'm sorry. I can't.

4
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:08,508
It's okay, I promise.
They're gonna welcome us on Gemenon.

5
00:00:09,237 --> 00:00:10,260
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:13,865
I thought I knew my friends.
But I guess I was wrong.

7
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,974
- It's god's will.
- What?

8
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:23,538
Lacy, it's me.

9
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,103
<i>It's okay.
You can take a good look.</i>

10
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:32,487
Zoe's original program was destroyed
when he put me in here.

11
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,339
So at least he won't be putting
any more of me in more robots.

12
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,206
I'm Zoe...
And the avatar and the robot.

13
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:42,626
<i>Like some kind
of <i>whatchacallit</i>, three-parter.</i>

14
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,322
Trinity.
That's what you are.

15
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,589
I lost my daughter.

16
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:48,994
Me too.

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,150
Graystone says
he can bring my daughter back.

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,469
But can I trust him?

19
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:54,763
Our daughters...
They're gone.

20
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,126
But...

21
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,933
What if they could come back?

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,060
<i>Mr. Joseph Adama is at the main gate</i>

23
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,493
<i>requesting entry.</i>

24
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,979
Denied.

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,200
My daughter died
in the maglev bombing,

26
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,276
but she continues to exist
in the virtual world.

27
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:12,321
You're an avatar,
a virtual representation of Zoe.

28
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,573
Went back in
to iron out some of the kinks,

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,763
- and her avatar was gone.
- You know Tamara's gone?

30
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:19,077
It makes sense that they would disappear
at the same time.

31
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:22,289
Family is more important
than the law.

32
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,116
It's all about control and power.

33
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,139
Come on.

34
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:29,839
Let him cuff you, Willie.
It's okay.

35
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,133
So what are you doing,
running a criminal school?

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,441
How could my daughter
have set off a bomb?

37
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,806
You know you can't search here.
My husband does defense work.

38
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,385
Just here to ask a question.
It's about Ben Stark.

39
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,473
He was your daughter's boyfriend.

40
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,357
<i>A group known as Soldiers of the One
is responsible for the bombing.</i>

41
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,911
My daughter died

42
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:53,162
in the bombing of train number 23.

43
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,614
My daughter was part
of the Soldiers of the One.

44
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,658
My daughter was a terrorist!

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,787
<i>Amanda Graystone's shocking revelation
that her own daughter may have...</i>

46
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:05,017
<i>There are apparently hackers
out there</i>

47
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:06,544
<i>who are working</i>

48
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,362
<i>on a virtual game version</i>

49
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,714
<i>of the bombing.</i>

50
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,633
<i>I didn't have any classes with her,
she could be a terrorist, it's scary.</i>

51
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,219
<i>Into holobanding,
but I don't want to support Graystone...</i>

52
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:25,853
Is it true that the hospital
has asked you to leave?

53
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,655
Do you have a minute?
Do you think that you'll be fired?

54
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,922
- I wasn't fired. I resigned.
- So you quit.

55
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,571
Do you think the publicity
has hurt the hospital's image?

56
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,534
Tell your side of the story,

57
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,348
- let people hear the truth.
- You're not interested in the truth.

58
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:40,929
You just want to destroy me
and the memory of my...

59
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,370
Get out of my way.

60
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,499
Someone in the crowd has just thrown
something at Amanda Graystone.

61
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,012
We're not hurt.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

62
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,704
What?

63
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:28,810
Did I get you with that?
So sorry.

64
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,460
Be careful, Lacy.
You might get hurt.

65
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:34,505
Like...

66
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,882
Like all the people on that train.

67
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,574
Big news
in the publishing world today.

68
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,803
Daniel Graystone
is revising his autobiography.

69
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,155
A lot of you know it as
"the man who could see the future".

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,628
It is now going to be titled,

71
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,393
"I didn't see that coming".

72
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,824
That blind side.

73
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,410
That's pretty good sparring, though.

74
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,624
- Did you catch any TV last night?
- I hate TV.

75
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,143
Sarno's having a field day.

76
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,972
It's not just him.
Other pundits are weighing in...

77
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,341
Scandals are sunburn, Cyrus.
They fade.

78
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,050
Or they give you cancer.

79
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,722
Point is, Sarno's making public opinion,
and everyone

80
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,557
in the twelve worlds is watching.

81
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,684
- I know a woman.
- That's nice.

82
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,445
Priyah Magnus.
Best P.R. Person on Sagitarum,

83
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,398
looking to make a move to Caprica.

84
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,567
We never replaced Karkov
in that job...

85
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,819
I hate TV,

86
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,414
and I hate PR!

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,489
You think you do, but you don't.

88
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,418
You already play the game.

89
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,495
- All right, thank you, Brad.
- I'm done.

90
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,036
What?

91
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,260
Why else would you come
to this rat hole...

92
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:59,798
Instead of the big, beautiful,
and expensive gym down at the lab?

93
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,522
Why?

94
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,345
You want to look like a man
of the people.

95
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:07,431
I come to this rat hole
because I like it here.

96
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:09,859
I know what your woman's gonna say.

97
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:11,861
She's gonna want me
to go on the Sarno show

98
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:14,296
and debase myself
trying to win public sympathy

99
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,706
by telling charmingly
self-deprecating anecdotes,

100
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,734
turn my family pain into a plus.
Forget it.

101
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,993
We're a long way
from turning this into a plus.

102
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,705
We're trying to keep this
from blowing up in our faces.

103
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,451
Sorry.
Poor choice of words.

104
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,670
I meant we're taking
a real beating out there.

105
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,913
- Have you seen our stock prices?
- I'm not doing P.R.

Taurons are terrible drivers.
Did you know that?

109
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,733
- Take the car...
- Come on.

110
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:52,977
All right, easy.
Take it easy.

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,309
Look, if it's money...

112
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,941
I don't want your frakking...

113
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,764
You got balls, I'll give you that.

114
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,256
It's Adama now.
I see you've met my brother.

115
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,124
Pleased to meet you.

116
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:30,029
Now... hang on.

117
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's...

118
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,494
Can we talk?

119
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,153
Sure.
I like to talk...

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,689
Like about my niece, Tamara.

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,193
But she's dead.

122
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,947
She's dead

123
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,153
'cause you raised a terrorist,

124
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,340
and I frakkin' hate terrorists.

125
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,260
I want to see Tamara again.

126
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,021
Take me to that room
and let me see my daughter.

127
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:20,397
I told you, she's... gone.

128
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,524
You said you think she's gone.

129
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,699
She's not.

130
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,359
I'd feel it.

131
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,280
I'd feel it!

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,391
Get up.

133
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:33,518
Come here.

134
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,625
After I see Tamara,

135
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,824
I want to see my wife.

136
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,587
What?

137
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,143
That's right.
Make an avatar.

138
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,721
We talked about this before,
remember?

139
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,566
I cannot make...

140
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,524
Another avatar.

141
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,671
No matter how many bones
you break, the program

142
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:56,892
is gone.

143
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,974
It was my daughter's...

144
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,684
And it died with her.

145
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,500
Let's say I believe you.

146
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,971
But Tamara...

147
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,699
She exists.

148
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,264
I know she exists.

149
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,911
I'm gonna call on you again.

150
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,283
And next time...

151
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,706
Pick up the phone, big shot.

152
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,879
Learn to drive yourself.

153
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,881

- Burritos.

00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:13,195
- What does that say?
- The time.

159
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,139
Says I was hungry 20 minutes ago.

160
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,267
Know what else it says?
Go away.

161
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,957
You lost, kid?

162
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:28,235
You look lost.

163

Virgans could frak their wives
right in front of the cops,

167
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:42,516
and they'd throw us in jail for it.

168

- Probably.
- I been in jail.

- That pinch for the window.

You're so cute!

- Helping.

00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:07,685
You always go
to school first thing, all right?

178
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:11,169
You wait for them to take attendance,
then you skip.

179
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,122
So what, you want me to go back now?

180
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:16,085
Once you start in a direction,
it's best to just keep going.

181
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,039
All right,
this is what we're gonna do.

182
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,598
I'm gonna call in.

183
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,083
Gonna tell them that it's a Tauron day
of devotion to Mars.

184
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:30,012
Your school's got too few Taurons
to figure out that it's skor, right?

185
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:33,055
Then you stick around here till 3:00,
and then I take you home.

186
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,178
<i>Welcome back, Daniel</i>.

187
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:46,705
<i>There are 53 stored broadcast mentions
of your name today.</i>

188
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:48,994
Play in order.

189
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,287
<i>Following the revelation that
his daughter was involved in the bombing</i>

190
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,097
<i>but that several players
have asked to be traded.</i>

191
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,044
<i>It's a shame to see something like this
affect the game, Abasi.</i>

192
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,436
It might be time for him to step away
from playing an active role in...

193
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,589
Stop.

194
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,940
Cancel automatic recording.

195
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:09,168
Erase stored material.

196
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>You're injured.
Do you need assistance?</i>

197
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:15,262
<i>There's a first-aid kit
in the lab, right?</i>

198
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:33,854
So he's in courtroom B-7,
but it's a confidential hearing.

199
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,731
You'll have to wait outside.

200
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,069
And did he say what it was about?

201
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:41,209
All he said was that if Adams
isn't waiting outside my courtroom

202
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:44,119
when I open that door,
I'm issuing a bench warrant,

203
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:47,158
and I guarantee he won't make bail
before the weekend.

204
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,783
- And you have no idea.
- You're caught up on everything.

205
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:52,062
Motions are filed.
Declarations in order.

206
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,020
And the special delivery?

207
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:56,440
First priority and on time,
as always.

208
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:58,693
Then what the frak?

209
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,171
I don't know.
But he was pissed.

210
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:02,990
Good luck.

211
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,494
Evelyn, do you think maybe
this one last time you could...

212
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:09,353
I'll get you coffee,

213
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,315
like you promised
I'd never have to do again

214
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,728
after the first year, the second year,
and the third.

215
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:14,933
I know.

216
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,545
I'll get it.

217
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,800
Thanks.

218
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,990
I love those shoes.

219
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:22,841
Thanks.

220
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:31,427
Zoe used to sit here with me
in the afternoon sometimes.

221
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,375
- Thank you.
- She called it her sanctuary.

222
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:36,303
Can I have some sugar?

223
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:41,820
We need to be very careful now...
the bombing,

224
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,865
Amanda Graystone's confession,
Zoe's name...

225
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,992
We could all start
to look very guilty.

226
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:50,711
But we're not. We weren't involved
in any of that stuff.

227
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:52,992
Do you have any lemon?

228
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:03,104
People will be trying to link us
to what's happened.

229
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,886
You were Zoe's friend,
and I was her confessor.

230
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,722
She told me everything
that was in her heart,

231
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,302
her most intimate desires,

232
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:14,191
her deepest fears...
Right here in this room.

233
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,294
Sorry, but do you have a spoon?

234
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:30,028
I can be your confessor
as well, Lacy.

235
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,758
Hear your worries, your concerns.

236
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:36,859
Share your burdens.

237
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,530
I should go.

238
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:42,413
I have astronomy tutoring now.

239
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,209
Got a problem with my stars.

240
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,218
Babe, are you here?

241
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,857
Gods, what happened?
Someone hit you?

242
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:03,928
Someone threw a bottle at me.

243
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,821
It hit a frakking reporter, though.

244
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,366
But this looks bad.

245
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:10,100
What happened?

246
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:13,965
I ran into someone else
who lost a child on that train.

247
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,648
We didn't exactly bond.

248
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,191
What are you doing?

249
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,380
- No stitches.
- It's just glue.

250
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:25,966
- Just to hold that together.
- No thank you, sweetheart.

251
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,630
There won't be a scar.

252
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,758
But you're gonna have
some very cool bruises.

253
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:39,716
- It hurts.
- I know.

254
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:42,440
Stop squirming.
You're worse than Zoe.

255
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,671
- I know what you're thinking.
- I didn't say anything.

256
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:54,578
You don't have to.
I know.

257
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,329
I just wish you'd thought
about the consequences

258
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,157
- of saying that in public.
- I was in shock.

259
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:07,038
Can you imagine what it's like
to stand in front of that woman

260
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:10,135
and find out that Zoe had been sleeping
with her son for almost a year?

261
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,885
- They were not sleep...
- Please!

262
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,889
Look, my point is, you make this claim
about her being a terrorist

263
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,559
- to the twelve worlds...
- It's not a claim. It's the truth!

264
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:22,122
She joined a terrorist group.

265
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,161
She held a bomb in her hands.

266
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,069
She stepped onto a crowded train.

267
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:31,678
She triggered the bomb
and ended her life

268
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:34,242
and the life
of all those other people.

269
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,787
We have no idea
what actually happened on that train.

270
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,000
We have no idea who did what

271
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,543
or who didn't do what.

272
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,476
It's the truth.
It's the truth.

273
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:52,574
You know it.

274
00:16:57,038 --> 00:16:58,039
I know.

275
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:01,071
I know.

276
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,738
But not everything true

277
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,984
needs to be announced
to the worlds on television!

278
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:16,063
I just did it!
I didn't know what I was saying!

279
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,304
It just happened.

280
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,540
I'm sorry!

281
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:28,060
- You'd do it again?
- Yes, I would!

282
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:33,344
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,641
You drive me crazy.

284
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,320
Let me bind that wound for you.

285
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,407
- Come here.
- No. Not a chance.

286
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,633
- You don't trust me.
- No. I'll end up

287
00:17:57,758 --> 00:18:00,370
with my nose glued to my ear.
Are you kidding me?

288
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:02,946
Could be interesting.

289
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:15,301
How about a good frak?

290
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,546
I need to be close to you right now.

291
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,672
This might not be
my best morning for it.

292
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:36,911
I'll be gentle.
I promise.

293
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:56,426
"Terror confession"?

294
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,847
- I like the sound of that.
- Don't get too excited.

295
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,677
She probably just scared off
everyone else in her daughter's cell.

296
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,415
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, sir.

297
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,232
- Heads up.
- Sir.

298
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,065
Got her to go public?

299
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:12,525
I don't know.

300
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,687
I saw her talking to Mrs. Stark.

301
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,489
Trouble.

302
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:19,908
Director.

303
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,959
I found this labeled "Starke"

304
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,434
with an "e"...

305
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,337
Instead

306
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,324
of "Stark" with no "e."

307
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,675
<i>You want to explain to me what
you were doing riding your bike</i>

308
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,913
<i>at 10:00 at night?</i>

309
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,762
Frak.

310
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,473
<i>I stayed late after school.</i>

311
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:47,101
<i>I just totally forgot
about the curfew.</i>

312
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:51,378
<i>What about the wires and the detonators
that we found in your bag?</i>

313
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,916
<i>These are for model rockets.</i>

314
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:00,471
<i>That's why I was staying late
after school. Model-rocket club.</i>

315
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:09,040
- <i>Look, can I leave, please?</i>
- <i>Just wait here.</i>

316
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,295
Were you incompetent
when you misspelled his name,

317
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,216
when you let him walk out of here,
or when you failed to destroy this tape?

318
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,902
Sir, I don't even remember
that interview.

319
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,096
Even better.

320
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,547
We pulled in lots of kids
for curfew violations.

321
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,010
That's the kind of crap

322
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:28,977
that we were saddled with
before the bombing.

323
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,907
She let him walk out of here
with a pat on the bottom,

324
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:35,316
an apology,
and a book bag full of wires.

325
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,706
The time stamp on the tape
says it was a year ago,

326
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:40,102
most likely before there was
any kind of plan, of intent.

327
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:43,193
And I'm sure that's how
they're gonna spin it in the press.

328
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:47,627
Guys...

329
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,420
Just be better.

330
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:00,592
Frak me!

331
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:02,920
I can't believe I had him.

332
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,804
I don't even remember
anything about him.

333
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:08,939
Time to be better.

334
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,561
Starting with?

335
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:21,834
How do you think people would react

336
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,362
if they knew that terror mom's house
hadn't been searched

337
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:25,950
because of bureaucratic red tape?

338
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:30,103
I don't think they'd be very happy.

339
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:31,801
I don't either.

340
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:36,336
Helen.

341
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,721
Caprica tribune, please.

342
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:48,995
You're here. Good.

343
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,025
- We're walking.
- Your honor.

344
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,541
Plexico Amarcord.

345
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:10,036
He's my client.

346
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:12,205
You're willing
to let him stand trial?

347
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,359
Let him take his chances
in front of a jury?

348
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,151
I think there seems to be a mistake.

349
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,453
My office assured me that,

350
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,135
a delivery was made to you...
At the usual place.

351
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,693
You mean like not talking
to me face-to-face?

352
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:31,009
Like leaving money
in some frakking drop

353
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:33,351
like I was one
of your frakking low-life clients

354
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,756
picking up a skim?

355
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,229
It's not like that.

356
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:40,439
- We talked about it Amarcord.
- We never talked about Amarcord. Never.

357
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,813
The deal is you talk to me

358
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,904
face-to-face every time.

359
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,834
You have to ask for these favors.

360
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,950
You don't just assume
they'll be granted

361
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,048
and then drop your money
like you take me for granted!

362
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:55,072
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,167
- I thought we talked about him.
- You thought.

364
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:06,009
You're getting sloppy.

365
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,732
Your head's not
in the game anymore, Adams.

366
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,976
It's Adama now, sir.

367
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,002
I don't give a frak what it is!

368
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,793
This'll cost you double the usual.

369
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,065
Double?

370
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:24,324
And I know the Guatrau
won't like that,

371
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:26,404
so it'll be coming out
of your pocket.

372
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:30,516
See you in court, Adams.

373
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,013
<i>Ta-frakking-da!</i>

374
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:50,278
My god, you have a body!

375
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,116
I figured out how to hook
the holoband to me...

376
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,982
Well, to the robot.

377
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,853
I never thought I would be so happy
to just be back here,

378
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,776
back in my own virtual skin.

379
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,229
I know it's not real, but...

380
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,683
I guess it never really was.

381
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,904
Can you come here anytime you like?

382
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,386
I'm gonna rig it so...

383
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,790
When the robot
isn't doing something,

384
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,892
I should be able to use
a wireless connection to virtual space.

385
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:21,690
But can you stay?

386
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:24,105
Can you just live here like this
as an avatar again?

387
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,896
God, I wish I could.

388
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:29,735
The things that I have to see
in that robot body.

389
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:32,405
Where are we?

390
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:36,192
This is where I hacked in.

391
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,728
Some little virtual room

392
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,938
daddy created for some reason.

393
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,473
He probably wouldn't bother
with a whole new grid, so...

394
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:47,048
It's gonna be shared code
with the rest of V-world.

395
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,171
It's gonna show up as a door.

396
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:54,382
Where are you?
Are you in a safe place?

397
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,899
Outside my house.

398
00:25:57,714 --> 00:25:59,671
Listen, school's getting hard.

399
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:01,964
Sister Clarice is fishing,

400
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:03,943
acting weird.

401
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:06,797
I think she wants to know
if you exist.

402
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:09,027
She doesn't even care that Zoe died.

403
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:11,459
All she wants to do is find me

404
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:13,872
and use me for whatever her plan is.

405
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:16,616
But wasn't that Zoe's plan too?

406
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:20,581
If Zoe and Clarice were working together
maybe we should let her know

407
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,882
about you.

408
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,443
Zoe didn't trust Clarice,
for some reason,

409
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,271
and I think we have to go with that.

410
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:31,117
I keep thinking how Zoe
never showed me to her,

411
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:33,967
how Zoe didn't give her access
to the computer account,

412
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,134
to the program.

413
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,790
I found it...

414
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:38,512
I think.

415
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,173
Can you help me?

416
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,444
Who are you?

417
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:56,298
My name's Tamara Adams.

418
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm Zoe.

419
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,379
This is Lacy.

420
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,853
Are you all right?

421
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,124
If this is a dream...

422
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:08,737
I think it's too long.

423
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,971
I can't feel my heart beating,
and that's freaking me out right now.

424
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,055
But there's nothing
I can do about it.

425
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:23,197
I don't think this is a dream.

426
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:26,533
How did you get here?

427
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,740
I don't know.

428
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,859
I don't remember
where I was before this.

429
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,888
Hold on.

430
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:39,602
Your dad,

431
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,075
Zoe's dad,

432
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:44,370
has this girl
in his private virtual space?

433
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,092
I guess.

434
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:47,667
She's...

435
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,359
pure avatar, right?

436
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,784
Something he invented?

437
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:53,218
Must be.

438
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:56,345
If she was an avatar
of an actual someone,

439
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,059
they'd just take off their band.

440
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,682
Look...

441
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,951
This is a door, all right?

442
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:10,438
We'll all go through here
and escape,

443
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,606
okay?

444
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:14,042
Come on, you'll be free.

445
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:19,217
Can you be free if you're not real?

446
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,803
I hope so.

447
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,333
<i>... Graystone,
seen here in a school photo.</i>

448
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:30,201
<i>The GDD has released
MagLev security-camera footage</i>

449
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,710
<i>that places her
with suspected terrorist Ben...</i>

450
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,839
<i>Graystone stock has been in a freefall</i>
since Amanda Graystone's confession...

451
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,258
<i>Protests continue to grow,
as we see here from our...</i>

452
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:43,095
<i>... controversy surrounding the Bucs.
Tonight's game is gonna be a real test.</i>

453
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,940
The God of the underworld
very quickly issued a statement,

454
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:49,015
<i>saying he's still ahead
of the Graystones.</i>

455
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,077
<i>So...</i>

456
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:51,771
It's spiking his ratings,

457
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,953
and it's putting him on the home page
of every site in the twelve worlds.

458
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:56,955
But he's running a big risk too.

459
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,317
He's making jokes
about a terrorist attack,

460
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:00,488
for the Gods' sake.

461
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,490
We could generate
some outrage at that.

462
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,726
I'm glad we're not talking
about Baxter Sarno.

463
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:08,371
More than half of college-aged viewers
say they get their news from Sarno.

464
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,202
- That's so sad.
- The good news...

465
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:11,685
is that it's a two-way street,

466
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,942
and we can use him
to reach those same people.

467
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,317
Not interested.

468
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,213
Plums, anyone?
They're fresh.

469
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:19,759
Dr. Graystone,
I understand your reluctance,

470
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:23,069
but as a P.R. Tactic,
going on Sarno works.

471
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,390
Remember that actor
that got busted for drugs?

472
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,514
Which one?

473
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,308
They all go on there, charm the colonies
and everything's swell.

474
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:32,298
But I also remember
when the Commerce Minister went on,

475
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:35,597
and Sarno ripped him a new one.
The man is anti-corporation.

476
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:37,714
He'd love nothing more
than to get me in his chair.

477
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,391
- You asked for my advice.
- Actually, he did.

478
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,855
It's the brand.

479
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,078
It's becoming associated
with terrorism,

480
00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:46,371
and that's not something
we can let sink in.

481
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:50,001
Sarno is all but saying
it was the Holoband that made her do it.

482
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:51,126
Please.

483
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:54,750
- Some are picking up on that idea.
- Ridiculous! The band is benign.

484
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:58,629
There's the press release.
"The band is benign." Problem solved.

485
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,841
You don't want a logical appeal.
It has to be emotional.

486
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:04,227
You have to make people care.

487
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,364
And say, "yes,"

488
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,998
"Zoe was involved
in some way in the tragedy.

489
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:11,167
"She was a troubled girl.
She got mixed up with the wrong people."

490
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,371
And the thing
we want to nail down is,

491
00:30:13,496 --> 00:30:15,980
no one has to worry
about their kids doing what Zoe did.

492
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,423
Say that a million times,
"she wasn't a normal kid."

493
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,684
She was a normal kid.

494
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,831
You know what I mean.
She was in the S.T.O.

495
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,220
I will not go

496
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:35,541
and drag my daughter's memory
into the publicity machine.

497
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,754
No matter what my wife said,
no matter what's true,

498
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,437
I'm not going on television
to say that my daughter was a terrorist.

499
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,469
Or troubled.

500
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,073
She was my girl.

501
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,727
Serge, show these lovely people
the way out.

502
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:30,921
Are you okay?

503
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,058
- Where are we?
- It's called the V-Club.

504
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:44,871
Are there doors to the outside?

505
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:46,930
There are doors to everything.

506
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,323
All shared code
shows up as a doorway.

507
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,701
Some rooms have a million doors.
It doesn't have to make physical sense.

508
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,469
I need to get outside.

509
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,996
The air will wake me up.

510
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,896
You want me to come with you?
Until you feel comfortable.

511
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,960
Zoe, we don't know
how much time you have.

512
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,170
- I'm just not gonna abandon her.
- This is crazy!

513
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,004
I don't need your help!

514
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,096
It's okay.

515
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,010
I can find my own way home

516
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:13,965
Are you sure?

517
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,392
I'm okay.

518
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:18,779
Thank you.

519
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:20,443
You're welcome.

520
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,448
I have someone for you to find,

521
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:21,707
Keon Gatwick.

522
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:24,084
- Who's that?
- Ben's best friend.

523
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:25,753
They were close.

524
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,006
Ben knew everything about the plan
to get to Gemenon,

525
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,903
so Keon knows everything too.

526
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:34,788
Find out how they're gonna get
to the safe house on Gemenon

527
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,456
so we can follow their plan.

528
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,141
You're going to Gemenon.

529
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,286
Zoe said I had a purpose on Gemenon.

530
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:45,082
God wants me there.

531
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,651
She was gonna bring me there,
and I was gonna be something special.

532
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,690
What if...

533
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,529
What if the purpose is bad?

534
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,927
Zoe said my purpose was wonderful,

535
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:57,910
so it is.

536
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:01,638
You have to take me there
in the robot body.

537
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:05,501
Somehow the chip and the body
are working together to make me.

538
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,411
Do you realize you are 6 feet tall
and you weigh a ton?

539
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:09,505
Please.

540
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:12,007
I need to know
I can count on you to do this.

541
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:16,470
I need to know
that you're gonna get me to Gemenon.

542
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,305
You chickened out once, Lacy.

543
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,474
- I was scared.
- You can't be scared now.

544
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,810
God, if I had gotten on that train,
I would be dead.

545
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,176
She is dead...

546
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,189
And I am all that is left of her.

547
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:31,568
If you're my friend, you'd do this.

548
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,403
<i>You were told not to contact us.</i>

549
00:34:48,657 --> 00:34:51,158
I've made progress.
I thought you should know.

550
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,337
<i>Progress?</i>

551
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:55,259
I'm getting closer to finding
the Zoe Graystone avatar.

552
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:59,109
<i>And lost control in the process,
causing us a premature explosion</i>

553
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:02,641
<i>that's brought retribution
on our heads.</i>

554
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:05,878
My life is dedicated
to serving Soldiers of The One.

555
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:09,710
And the Zoe Graystone avatar
is gonna help the Soldiers

556
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:12,651
to serve the Lord
through apotheosis.

557
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:16,444
Or do you deny that prophecy?

558
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:19,361
<i>Not everyone shares
your view of apotheosis.</i>

559
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:23,491
<i>Your search for this avatar
is putting us at risk.</i>

560
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,569
I'll not abandon God's plan.

561
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,641
I know that Zoe Graystone
was beloved of God...

562
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:32,758
And that she was given
the spark of life itself,

563
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:35,068
and that was her gift to all of us,

564
00:35:35,193 --> 00:35:37,217
and it will save all of us.

565
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,131
<i>For your sake,
I hope you're right, Clarice.</i>

566
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,577
<i>Work quickly.</i>

567
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,027
I can throw you off.

568
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,513
My knees are pointy
and fast and hard.

569
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:00,323
You're STO, so why are you giving me
such a hard time?

570
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,729
I'm not STO.

571
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:07,261
Try again. You're too stupid to think of
a good reason that's not a real reason,

572
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:08,372
so let's hear it.

573
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,212
I'm STO.

574
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:16,215
If anyone finds out I'm going
to the meetings, I'm in big trouble.

575
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:18,195
And it was just meetings.

576
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,696
It was just me

577
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:21,589
and Ben, and Pann,

578
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,425
and Hypolita and...

579
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,771
I mean, without Ben,
it's not anything anymore, so...

580
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,312
Clarice isn't running it?

581
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:33,231
Sister Clarice?
What are you talking...

582
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:35,567
Forget it.

583
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,887
Forget it.
Look...

584
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:40,531
I made a promise to Zoe
before she died.

585
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,890
I need to get something to Gemenon,

586
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,443
something secret.

587
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,879
It's for Zoe.

588
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,521
I'm really sorry...

589
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:50,384
About your friend.

590
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:51,754
And...

591
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:53,168
Everything.

592
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,518
So maybe you could get off me now.

593
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,829
Zoe was my best friend, Kenon.

594
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:08,740
I made a promise.

595
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:16,347
I'll see what I can do.

596
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:28,016
- Have you seen her? Talked to her?
- I haven't.

597
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:31,582
I just checked the computer
to be sure the avatar was still there.

598
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:33,524
And she's there, right?

599
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,211
As of three hours ago, she was, yes.

600
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:41,687
Shall we?

601
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,614
She should be here.

602
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,754
How big is this room?

603
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,332
That question
doesn't really have any meaning...

604
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,003
Don't give me techno talk!

605
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,957
Just help me find my daughter.

606
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:21,070
I'll be back in a minute.

607
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:30,800
Baby!

608
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:34,629
I don't know what happened.

609
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:37,773
I just checked the computer
back in the real world, and now it's...

610
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:40,226
It's only detecting two avatars...

611
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:42,477
Yours and mine.

612
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:45,112
She's gone.

613
00:38:49,314 --> 00:38:50,314
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:02,318
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:05,878 --> 00:39:07,439
You said she was there.

616
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,217
I thought she was.
I was wrong.

617
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:13,140
The computer must have registered
an underwritten backup file

618
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,066
from her avatar, like a ghost image.

619
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:17,290
It happens.

620
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,191
Tamara's...

621
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:22,359
Really gone?

622
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,691
I'm afraid so.

623
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,749
If only I hadn't seen her.

624
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,339
I know.

625
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:34,871
If you didn't bring her back...

626
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,764
I know.
I know, I'm sorry.

627
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,360
But we can't save them.

628
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:50,115
I'm sorry.

629
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,204
<i>First reported on
the</i> Caprica Tribune website,

630
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,833
<i>news that bureaucratic red tape
is holding up investigators</i>

00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,743
<i>from executing a search warrant

632
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,428

633
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:17,697
<i>of unwanted publicity
for Graystone Industries.</i>

634
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:21,251
<i>Stocks took yet another dive

635
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,046
<i>bringing Graystone to a new year...</i>

636
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:27,924
Now, that...
Is good police work.

637
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,134
Her idea.

638
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,237
Really?

639
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,637
It brings you halfway back.

640
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,055
So we get the warrants?

641
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,811
I have three messages
from the Justice Minister already.

642
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,519
She's out judge-shopping.
You'll have it first thing tomorrow.

643
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,819
Make it count.

644
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,509
Find something at Graystone's house.

645
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,194
<i>What could have possibly led
this affluent teenager</i>

646
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,577
<i>into becoming a terrorist?</i>

647
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,685
<i>... dismissal
from Caprica General Hospital.</i>

648
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,831
<i>Amanda Graystone
was attacked by protestors...</i>

649
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,561
<i>Now, the hospital is refusing
to confirm the resignation,</i>

650
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:05,420
<i>leaving some to speculate
that Dr. Graystone...</i>

651
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,131
<i>Graystone industries stock
continues to slip.</i>

652
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,384
<i>Analysts are starting to be concerned

653
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:12,936
<i>scheduled loan payments...</i>

654
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,180
<i>Almost 2 billion cubits it owes</i>

655
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:18,500
<i>to the Twelve Colony
Banking Consortium.</i>

656
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,775
<i>That's right, Erin.
Industry analysts say</i>

657
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,231
<i>that the drop in value
of Graystone stock of nearly 25%</i>

658
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,125
<i>is due to fearism
and outright default on these loans.</i>

659
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,563
<i>The stock fell 18 points
to an all-time low...</i>

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,990
Have Priyah book me
on Sarno tomorrow.

661
00:41:34,712 --> 00:41:35,895
<i>What happened?</i>

662
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:40,793
Just get it done.

663
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,044
<i>Looks like this company
is going to be a sell</i>

664
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:44,494
<i>for the foreseeable future,</i>

665
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,703
<i>unless something drastic
happens to change the situation.</i>

666
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:52,259
Order, nature, strength,

667
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:53,362
love.

668
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,596
Why's Jupiter bigger?

669
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,404
Because your dad's a lawyer.

670
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,767
So order is the most important thing
in his home.

671
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,249
At our place, Mars is like
three times the size of the others.

672
00:42:04,616 --> 00:42:06,439
It's 'cause, lucky me,
I married a tough guy.

673
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,178
Why didn't you guys ever have kids?

674
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,528
Like pick out an orphan,
like you and dad were.

675
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,562
Maybe if I change jobs.

676
00:42:15,187 --> 00:42:16,561
Life I have now is

677
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,326
not so good for kids.

678
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:20,244
It's not so good for grown-ups.

679
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:22,789
You know all you do is
<i>skhet-lee-ah-dzane</i>.

680
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,083
Then why do you love me
so desperately?

681
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:26,126
I got issues.

682
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:32,181
I was expecting you hours ago.

683
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:34,326
Can I talk to you, Sam?

684
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,068
What's up?

685
00:42:45,336 --> 00:42:48,059
Daniel Graystone
lost his daughter, right?

686
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,955
I lost my daughter and my wife.

687
00:42:56,488 --> 00:42:57,716
Balance it out.
