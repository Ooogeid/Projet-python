2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,391
I thought I knew my friends.
but I guess I was wrong.

3
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:06,005
For the One True God

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,673
knows all and directs us all.

5
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:10,068
- So say we all.
- So say we all.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,345
I'm sorry, Zoe.
It's God's will.

7
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:16,593
Did I really even know my daughter?

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,981
You think that Zoe
knew one of the terrorists?

9
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:22,433
Dr. Graystone, we think that Zoe
might have been one of the terrorists.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,668
D. Graystone says
he can bring my daughter back.

11
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:25,983
Can I trust him?

12
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:28,569
The device I need is called
a meta-cognitive processor.

13
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:32,239
There's only one company
that has this device, and it's not mine.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,044
I need something stolen
from the Vergis Corporation on Tauron.

15
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,995
- Daddy.
- It's okay, baby.

16
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,065
- I'm right here.
- My heart isn't beating.

17
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,590
- I miss you.
- Daddy, my heart isn't beating!

18
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,839
My baby!
She couldn't feel her heart beat!

19
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,994
My daughter died
in the MagLev bombing,

20
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:53,216
but she continues to exist

21
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:54,845
in the virtual world.

22
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,222
Hi, daddy.

23
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,388
You're an avatar,
a virtual representation of Zoe.

24
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,519
I don't feel like a copy, daddy.

25
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,731
What are you doing to her?

26
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,191
Stop it, Dr. Graystone!

27
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,988
- What did you do to her?
- I captured her avatar.

28
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:14,949
She's in here now.

29
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,015
<i>Daddy.</i>

30
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:22,003
Daddy?

31
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,668

<i>IRRECOVERABLE ERROR</i>

32
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,005
- Who is this?
<i>- It's me.</i>

33
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,747
<i>And I think
I'm gonna need your help.</i>

34
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:12,214
<i>Come here!</i>

35
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,969
- Who is it, who are we gonna meet?
- You'll see.

36
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,430
See this infinity symbol?

37
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,057
It's the symbol
of the soldiers of the One.

38
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,919
We're the ones who are gonna bring
the word of the One True God

39
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,353
to the people.

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,468
Ben, there's someone here
I'd like you to meet.

41
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:39,735
She's perfect.

42
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,703
She'll do it.

43
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,333
It's all gonna change.

44
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,251
You're a gift...

45
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,879
And everyone will know it soon.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,496
Powering down.

47
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:08,558
What are you talking about? It's been
working great in the demos for defense.

48
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:10,755
- Beyond expectations.
- And this chassis works great.

49
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,772
But take it out,
put it in another body, it's a moron.

50
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,110
Is that true?

51
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:16,883
Yes, it's true.

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,903
Put this chip in any other body,

53
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,996
it doesn't innovate,
doesn't anticipate.

54
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,504
All the bodies are identical,

55
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,189
but the MCP only works in this one.

56
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:25,162
Can't be.

57
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:28,190
The bodies are functionally isomorphic.
It can't know which one it's in.

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,794
Is this it?
Is this the one?

59
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:43,435
Wait, is this the same one
I was working on? Is this the prototype?

60
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,766
Right.
We don't know why it's happening.

61
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,352
In fact, when we put copies of the MCP
in other bodies,

62
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:51,939
we expected them to bond too.
But, no, they're all morons.

63
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,733
There's something unique
about the bonding of this chip and body

64
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,732
and if we don't figure out
how to replicate it,

65
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,445
this whole contract is in danger.

66
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,614
So the military liaison,

67
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,692
- he's all over me...
- I get the problem.

68
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:06,697
I'm gonna miss the jump.

69
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:10,083
Tell you what.
Have this thing sent to my home lab.

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,983
- I'll take a look at it this weekend.
- Take care of it.

71
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:30,921
Hey, Serge?

72
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,194
<i>Yes, Amanda.</i>

73
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,485
I know we have
some old home movie tiles of Zoe.

74
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:37,072
- Will you help me find them?
- <i>Right away.</i>

75
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,207
Did you get my invitation?

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,206
Right, Saturday.

77
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:56,746
Lunch at your house.

78
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,267
I haven't been
to a teacher's house before.

79
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,853
We do eat.

80
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,544
Can I expect you?

81
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,057
Good.

82
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:18,275
What's going on?
It's been two days.

83
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,958
<i>Two?</i>

84
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>My god, I'm losing track.</i>

85
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,157
<i>I've been having these dreams,</i>

86
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,034
<i>my life and the original Zoe's life
all mixed up.</i>

87
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:30,772
Listen, Sister Clarice invited me
to her house for lunch tomorrow.

88
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,461
She can help us.

89
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,278
The only control that I have right now
is that no one knows I'm in here.

90
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,087
Promise me you won't tell.

91
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:42,042
I promise.

92
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,380
They're taking me to the lab
in Zoe's house.

93
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,418
<i>Once I'm there
I might be able to do something.</i>

94
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:51,977
<i>I'm gonna try to get
Zoe's original program...</i>

95
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,172
<i>Frak!</i>

96
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:05,751
<i>Great piece of engineering.</i>

97
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,755
<i>I know.
She gives me the chills.</i>

98
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,474
She?

99
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,417
Dude, stop feminizing it.
It's weird.

100
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,147
It's unnatural.

101
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,028
There's nothing wrong
with feminizing it.

102
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,462
Nothing wrong
except it's not a person.

103
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,404
<i>It's useful.</i>

104
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:24,661
<i>Just a tool.</i>

105
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,181

121
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,769
between the Caprica Buccaneers
and the Olympia Stallions.

122
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:13,575
<i>We've been waiting for this pairing
since last year's controversial victory.</i>

123
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,665

exactly one month ago tomorrow.

127
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,484
So say we all.

128
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,414
Caprica.

129
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,760
Thought you could stay.
Hang out.

130
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,744
Make fun of the cheerleaders.

131
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,485
That's always a good time.

132
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,792
But I'm not quite there yet.

133
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,664
Daniel, listen,
I know you're at the game.

134
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:15,764
I wanted to ask you something

135
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,347
about, you know,

136
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,178
what you showed me.

137
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,499
Will you call me,
let me know you're getting this?

138
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,600
My gods!

139
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,104
<i>Wilson elementary.</i>

140
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,348
This is Willie Adama's...
Adams' father.

141
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,941
Could you find him,
tell him to wait?

142
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:45,167
I accidentally went
to his sister's school.

143
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:49,711
Philo, aren't you done
with that thing already?

144
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:52,106
Just move your right elbow up
by about...

145
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,550
45 degrees.

146
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,575
Now rotate your hands 90 degrees.

147
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:59,770
We could have disassembled it
and loaded it twice by now.

148
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,323
- Now move your right arm...
- It's equipment, Philo.

149
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,674
To the right. It's a work of art.
It deserves some dignity.

150
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:11,235
So if you move your forearm about

151
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,689
three dorans to the right.

152
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:16,990
- Great, now just lean it back and...
- Come on!

153
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,150
- Be gentle with it, please.
- Quick and easy.

154
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:26,100
- Would you be careful with that?
- She likes it rough,

155
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:27,625
she told me.

156
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:35,113
We gotta get it to the lab,
not screw around with voice commands.

157
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,004
- Hey, kid.
- Hey, dad.

158
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:50,874
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,819
- Glad you got a ride.
- It all worked out.

160
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,821
Tammy's school?
Did you go again?

161
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:58,608
I was held up in court.

162
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,077
We thought we lost you.

163
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,938
There's an invitation.

164
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:05,366
Really?

165
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,789
To a memorial event?

166
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:12,500
The victims families?
I don't need this.

167
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,468
The Graystone give some money.

168
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:15,935

169
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:17,801

173
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:17,961
Dr. Graystone.

174
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:21,282
You can't search here. My husband
does Defense work on the premises.

175
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:22,840
I am aware.

176
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,384
I'm just here to ask a question
if that's okay, Doctor.

177
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,228
About Ben Stark.

178
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,199
We're looking
at any other known associates.

179
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,116
I don't know a Ben stark.

180
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,076
I've never heard that name.

181
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,384
- Was he the real bomber?
- Really?

182
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,178
Ben Stark?

183
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:41,677
He was your daughter's boyfriend.

184
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:44,947
Take a look at the picture.

185
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:49,559
My daughter didn't have one.

186
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,043
She wasn't old enough.
She died before...

187
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,069
Good night.

188
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,467
Get this thing inside, already.
Call it a day.

189
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,928
Can't believe he's getting us
to come to the lab.

190
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,665
He like never, never...

191
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,186
Frack!

192
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,585
What did you do?
What did you do?

193
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:38,984
Where you going?

194
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:45,813
Frack!

195
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,057
Frack!

196
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,628
Pull the chip.
Pull the M.C.P.

197
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,110
- Just relax.
- Pull it.

198
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,487
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- Hurry up!

199
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,154
All right?
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,301
It's all right?

201
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,474
- We're good?
- We're good.

202
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:36,170
If you just wouldn't think
about what it is, you'd like it.

203
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,771
Not that I don't like, I'm full.

204
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:40,482
- Sure.
- It's true.

205
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,841
You haven't eaten all day.
Eat some of it.

206
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,178
- I'm full. I can't eat.
- Later we'll go out for burgers.

207
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,556
- I might not be full.
- All right.

208
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:54,143
- I won't make another Tauron meal.
- I'm sorry. It's just that...

209
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,637
I understand.
Help me clear the table.

210
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:59,315
You can do that at least.
Come on.

211
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:04,412
Would you bring
the other plates in, please?

212
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,092
Daddy.

213
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,516
I wonder why
it would freak out like that.

214
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,670
Didn't have any sensory reafference
under the cover.

215
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,891
Thrashed around
and replaced the input.

216
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:38,575
Went nuts just like
a little kid would.

217
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,228
- That's totally cool.
- It is, actually.

218
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,757
This robot,
she's doing all kinds of things

219
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,601
I never thought I would see her do.

220
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,190
Even the way it moves,
it's like you can see it think.

221
00:15:57,986 --> 00:15:59,708
Look at that.
It's all out of wack.

222
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:04,627
<i>- Must have done it in the van.
- We'll run a diagnostic.</i>

223
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,482
I got it.

224
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,224
Still going to run it.

225
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,639
<i>Hold still.</i>

226
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,254
- What did you do?
- Frack.

227
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:23,967
Hospital. Come on, let go.

228
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:25,509
Get my fingertip.

229
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,949
- Where did it go?
- I don't know. Over there somewhere.

230
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:31,222
Hurry up.
Come on.

231
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:33,249
Found it.

232
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:35,591
All right.

233
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:38,253
You're okay.

234
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:08,652
Been wandering around
looking for your house.

235
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,929
- Thought I would remember it.
- It's not very memorable.

236
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,161
You okay?

237
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,704
Hard day at school.

238
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:25,835
Listen.

239
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,133
Can I talk to you about Zoe?

240
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,754
I'm just trying to figure her out.

241
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:34,597
Lacy, get in here.

242
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:45,898
What was she running away from?

243
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,900
Was it from us?

244
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:49,693
From me?

245
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,364
I don't really know.

246
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,863
She just said that...

247
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,599
there would be a new family
waiting for us on Gemenon.

248
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:01,897
A new family?

249
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,393
Sorry.

250
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,542
It's the last thing I heard her say.

251
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,264
So the problem with the M.C.P.

252
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,030
is that it's only going
to work in one body.

253
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:26,188
I think the M.C.P. is diffusing
some of the control

254
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:30,317
to the peripheral subunits
of this particular model.

255
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,986
So we've made exactly one soldier?

256
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,660
But it's a really good one.

257
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,703
I'm glad you like it

258
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,495
but our contract
is for 100,000 robots, Philo.

259
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,830
I couldn't find the address
and I forgot to bring, like, anything.

260
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:00,638
Don't be silly.
Come on in.

261
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,368
Just about to sit down.

262
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,996
Come on.
Let's meet everyone.

263
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,274
Sorry, it's crazy around here
at lunchtime.

264
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,057
Sorry.

265
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,576
I've been in a water fight all day.

266
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:19,949
That's... sure.

267
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:22,827
You must be Lacy.
I'm Nestor.

268
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,830
You're right.
She is pretty.

269
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:29,172
About time someone in this family
brought home someone interesting.

270
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,044
- Nice to meet you.
- Come on.

271
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,379
Is he, like, your son?

272
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,320
This is my husband.

273
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,342
He's young enough to be my son.

274
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,414
But don't worry, I'm not married
with everyone. Some are my friends.

275
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,263
These are my wives Marbeth,

276
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,939
And Helena and Desiree Willow.
We use her surname.

277
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,020
And my husbands,
there's Nestor and Tanner

278
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,399
and Olaf and Rashawn.

279
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:54,076
And I don't know
where the others are.

280
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:56,779
I've known a few kids
from group marriages.

281
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,971
- It's cool.
- Kids, turn that TV off.

282
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,866
Soup's on.
Let's go.

283
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,006
Come on.

284
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:05,145
This way you can sit next to me,
I'll look after you.

285
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,332
We've got hobo stew.
This one's spicy.

286
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,204
This one's vegetarian,

287
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,752
and that one is squirrel.

288
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,213
He's joking.
It's just regular.

289
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,017
- Regular sounds good.
- Regular it is.

290
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:21,219
Who needs bread?

291
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:25,265
- Want some bread?
- Nestor, can you join us?

292
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,977
What the heck's the matter with you?

293
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,063
He gave you lots of squirrel.

294
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,397
It's good.
It's tasty.

295
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,756
Little Tauron's pretty cool.

296
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,825
- I actually like.
- Me too.

297
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,073
Used to hang out here with your dad.

298
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,053
All the Tauron kids came here.

299
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:53,228
I'd be hopelessly trying
to flirt with some guy.

300
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,855
Meanwhile, your dad would get
a date with a sister.

301
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,067
He was <i>lee-pa-ross.</i>
You know that word?

302
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:00,322
- Not really.
- It means, smooth.

303
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,477
How'bout that? We got you
some Tauron school after all.

304
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:04,654
Hold up.

305
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,286
Are you sure you can do that here?

306
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,578
Shopkeeper's all right with it.
He's read all about me.

307
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,126
From where?

308
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,572
Here.

309
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,091
- Your tattoos?
- Tells a whole story.

310
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,595
Here, hold on to this.

311
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:24,689
Son of a bitch. I gotta take this.
Wait here, all right?

312
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:33,333
Can it wait?
I got my brother's kid with me.

313
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:35,966
I'll be there.

314
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,592
- Let's go.
- Was it the Gautrau?

315
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,288
- Don't you use that name, all right?
- Why?

316
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,883
I got some stuff to break.

317
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,795
Is this different than
your usual saturday lunch?

318
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:49,694
But it's nice.

319
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,080
My mom's kind of... formal.

320
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,857
And here, everyone's
so comfortable with everyone.

321
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,328
I heard...
How you lost your friends.

322
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,447
You must miss them so much.

323
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,827
Zoe Graystone
was Lacy's best friend.

324
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:12,470
A real tragedy for all of us.

325
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,832
She was very special.
I mean, she was brilliant.

326
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,877
At computer stuff, right?
That's my major.

327
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,999
Did you know that
there are bits of software

328
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,432
that you use every day
that were written decades ago?

329
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,459
Is that true?
That's amazing.

330
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:26,886
You write a great program,

331
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,888
and, you know, it can outlive you.

332
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,656
It's like a work of art.

333
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:33,654
Maybe Zoe was an artist.

334
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,973
Maybe her work will live on.

335
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,762
<i>We're back from the break, and we're
gonna take a look around the league.</i>

336
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,002
<i>Really quickly.
Starting off with the team</i>

337
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:55,897
<i>that's had a surprisingly poor
showing early in the season</i>

338
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,266
<i>that been the Caprica City...</i>

339
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,422
Working hard, I see?

340
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,254
I'm letting the old subconscious
find the answers.

341
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:08,085
Off.

342
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,114
Oh, Gods.

343
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,435
Think I saw this guy
in a movie once.

344
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:17,812
He was trampling Oranu.

345
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:19,897
What a monster.

346
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:21,872
Horrible.

347
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,025
So listen.

348
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:29,509
Tomorrow's the memorial.

349
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,621
I was thinking maybe we should go.

350
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,770
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

351
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:48,676
I just... I can't.

352
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:52,148
I got a picky robot.
I've got too much to do.

353
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:55,296
I know this is important,
so you should go.

354
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,797
But I just can't.

355
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,172
Sorry.

356
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:04,530
All right.

357
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,475
- Come on, Caesar.
- Sweetie...

358
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,406
<i>Mr. Joseph Adama is at the main gate</i>

359
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,023
<i>requesting entry.</i>

360
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,016
Denied.

361
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,373
- Thank you.
- It was a pleasure. See you soon.

362
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,942
This isn't a spectator sport.
You can help.

363
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:46,891
What was that?

364
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,446
What's going on
with Nestor and that girl?

365
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,532
Are you and Nestor trying to...

366
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,484
Nestor, did I ask you to seduce

367
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:57,578
Lacy Rand?

368
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,353
What? No.

369
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,703
Look, I understand how hard
it's been for you to...

370
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,141
To lose your student...

371
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:08,506
- The bombing's got us all on edge.
- You can't blame us for wondering...

372
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,258
Given your track record.

373
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:12,593
My track record?

374
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,638
If a student suffers a loss,

375
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,348
I help them.

376
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,433
The girl's lost her only friends.

377
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,438
I've done nothing wrong.

378
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:27,067
And if you'd wipe the slate clean,
you'd see that.

379
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,845
- We do, of course...
- We know how hard you work.

380
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,488
Look, I can't...

381
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,935
Do you mind if I beg off
the rest of the clean up?

382
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,423
I'm going for a walk.

383
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:44,673
It's sudden death.

384
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,753
Graystone steps up
to the line and...

385
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,187
Graystone eyes the shot.

386
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:56,752
Sees the angle.

387
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,566
What do you say, Serge?
We've been over this.

388
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,641
- <i>The crowd goes frakking wild, sir.</i>
- Thank you.

389
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,864
<i>They're tearing up the seats.
It's bedlam.</i>

390
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:05,855
Thank you.

391
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,540
<i>They demand another hour
of game time, sir.</i>

392
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,740
Let's fix this thing.

393
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:34,726
The same body.

394
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,884
Same body this whole time.

395
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,157
So why is this one different?

396
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:53,123
I put her in there...

397
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:55,738
Now she's gone.

398
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,093
But where...

399
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:02,786
Where?

400
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,334
She's not in the mainframe.

401
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:08,145
Where did you go?

402
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,492
So if she's not in there...

403
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,287
Why can't we copy you?

404
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,661
Nice car.
Looks like score, but...

405
00:27:31,828 --> 00:27:35,071
But it's got 350 under the hood,
a triple-mounted clutch.

406
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,054
Most knuckleheads
will tell it's a bad thing.

407
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:38,990
But if you know anything about cars,

408
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:42,271
you'll realize that
what you really want is a triple C

409
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:44,031
with an undermount wedge.

410
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,474
That way you got control and power.

411
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,000
And it's all about control

412
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,666
and power.

413
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,636
All right, let's go.

414
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:59,218
Come on, let's go.

415
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,001
Walk, walk.

416
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,307
- You smashed a window.
- Don't worry about it.

417
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,933
Don't you understand?

418
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,651
You just broke a window!
- Relax.

419
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:10,234
- Crap, there's cops.
- All right, stick around.

420
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:11,981
Stick around.
Don't run.

421
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,849
You do, you're guilty of two things.
The thing and the running away.

422
00:28:15,016 --> 00:28:16,846
- Just follow me, all right.
- Sam Adama.

423
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,279
Officer Mendez.

424
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:21,182
- You know what to do.
- I certainly do.

425
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,952
Let him cuff you.
Relax, it's okay.

426
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:27,430
So what are you doing,
running a criminal school?

427
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,146
You wanna join?
Better pay, top benefits.

428
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,501
- I think I'm good.
- Well, you think about it.

429
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,712
Transport for two.

430
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:36,487
Don't panic, all right?

431
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,341
I take care of this
with the phone call.

432
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,385
- I take care of the whole thing.
- How, with some kind of bribe?

433
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,539
Frak, say it louder, kid.

434
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,968
You just pay the fine, all right?
It drives them crazy.

435
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:48,687
They don't tell about paying

436
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,686
after one day.
You gotta know this.

437
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,563
- You listening?
- I'm listening.

438
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,231
Give in on the little things,

439
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,329
They miss the big things.
Now, you remember that.

440
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:57,778
That's good advice.

441
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:04,075
<i>Do not point that camera at me.</i>

442
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,915
<i>- Can we switch?
- All right.</i>

443
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:14,981
<i>And this is it.</i>

444
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:17,588
<i>Our lives are about
to change forever.</i>

445
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,705
<i>You believe what you're saying?</i>

446
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,103
<i>I do.</i>

447
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:23,781
<i>I believe how beautiful I am, too.</i>

448
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,517
Stop.

449
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:42,304
Why do you want
to go to the memorial?

450
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,410
Why?

451
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,411
I don't even know that I do.

452
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:51,764
Because I don't want
to think about her.

453
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,921
I know it sounds awful,
but it's true.

454
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,861
I don't want to think.

455
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:05,420
I don't want to think.

456
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,585
I just feel awful

457
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:19,108
- angry and numb.
- Angry at who?

458
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,028
Everybody and everything.

459
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,696
Myself and the world.

460
00:30:27,962 --> 00:30:30,283
Her and the robot.

461
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:34,341
The robot didn't do anything.

462
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:40,891
No, it didn't.

463
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:45,654
I'm just going a little crazy.

464
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:47,348
Really?

465
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:49,993
What's that like?

466
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:52,474
Like you don't know.

467
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:59,038
I sure love you.

468
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,905
And if you still want to go
to the memorial, I'll go with you.

469
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,296
Because you're ready to think?

470
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:19,335
Because I promised Serge
some time alone with the UA-87.

471
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,441
I think he's got a little...

472
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,354
crush.

473
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,348
It's not pretty.

474
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,620
It's not a pretty thing.

475
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:43,503
I still can't believe
they just let us go.

476
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,778
I told you it was good advice,
didn't I?

477
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:49,352
- You want to hear more?
- Sure.

478
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,339
Someone tries to make you feel guilty,
you figure out why they're feel guilty

479
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:55,162
and you talk about that.

480
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:01,533
Also don't smoke.
You know why?

481
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,361
Because it's bad for you, maybe?

482
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:06,175
Life is bad for you.

483
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:09,384
You don't smoke because they can get
genetic data off a cigarette butt now.

484
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,931
Listen, don't tell your dad
I told you that.

485
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,581
Come on.

486
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,189
You got to get them in the thing
or they don't take them.

487
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,228
<i>It's Zoe. I'm at the house.</i>

488
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:42,321
<i>I need you. It's important.</i>

489
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:43,790
My God.

490
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,252
Something you want to tell me?

491
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,523
Thought you might be sick because
you didn't show up for class today.

492
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,383
Tauron school is boring.

493
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,238
It's about us.

494
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,808
Finding out who you are.

495
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,648
It's about being Tauron.

496
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,749
Being part of a family.

497
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:26,424
It's hard being part
of a family, dad,

498
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,048
when there is no family.

499
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:35,547
But you can punish me if you want.

500
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,695
- Very nice.
- I haven't seen you here before.

501
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:34,904
It's been a while.

502
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:38,029
You've come to the right place
to fall off the wagon.

503
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:41,715
I need privacy, a smoker
and two grams of purple.

504
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:45,386
Right.

505
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:38,567
I couldn't believe
when you said you were here.

506
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,234
Is it really?

507
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:48,660
It's me.

508
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:51,606
Lacy, it's me.

509
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,570
<i>It's okay. You can take a good look.</i>

510
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,309
This is you.

511
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,415
Your arms and your face.

512
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,744
Your voice comes out of here?

513
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,296
And you see here?

514
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,918
Your arms.

515
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,888
<i>You got to tell me.</i>

516
00:36:24,677 --> 00:36:26,588
<i>Do I look a male to you?</i>

517
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,413
Frack.

518
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,132
But you're here walking
in the real world.

519
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,986
Just like Zoe said you would.

520
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,572
First time I've seen you
in the real world ever.

521
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:42,189
But I'm trapped.

522
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:46,753
<i>I get manhandled and ordered around.</i>

523
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:50,168
<i>They loaded me like cargo.
One guy touched me,</i>

524
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,996
<i>and I hurt him, Lacy.</i>

525
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:55,795
God.

526
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,763
I don't know how to help you.

527
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,557
What are you going to do?

528
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:08,521
I've already started some of it.

529
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,561
I went into the computer
and checked.

530
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,147
Zoe's original programme was destroyed
when he put me in here

531
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,677
so at least he won't be putting
any more of me,

532
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:18,144
more robots.

533
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:21,595
God.
It's confusing.

534
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,586
<i>I'm Zoe, and an avatar and a robot.</i>

535
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:28,328
Like some kind of...
What you call it? Three-parter.

536
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,945
Trinity.
That's what you are.

537
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,230
Three faces of one thing.

538
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,189
Sort of.

539
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,033
<i>My mom called me a monster.</i>

540
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,026
<i>To be fair.</i>

541
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:23,875
<i>I think I could live
with this much better.</i>

542
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:31,132
<i>So we had to take the train
instead of walking.</i>

543
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,448
- Do you want to say something?
- Gods, no.

544
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,649
What to say?

545
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:45,858
I see some parents
from the school over there.

546
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:50,024
- We should go and say hello.
- Sweetheart, don't talk to people.

547
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:53,965
You'll be everyone's shoulder to cry on.
I'll never be able to get you out.

548
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:55,440
Please.

549
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,383
Or you could say nothing
all day long?

550
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:00,629
Is that better?

551
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,726
<i>He would have thanked me
if I woke him up.</i>

552
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,179
<i>But I didn't do it.</i>

553
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,384
<i>I told mom you were getting too old
to take the Lev.</i>

554
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,690
<i>I don't know how something like this
could have happened.</i>

555
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,890
<i>I love you, mom.</i>

556
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,294
Natalie Stark.

557
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,820
Ben's mom.

558
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,125
Zoe's boyfriend.

559
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,753
<i>There were people everywhere
asking for help.</i>

560
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,322
<i>But I didn't know
what to do for them.</i>

561
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,437
<i>I was in the back car.</i>

562
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,343
You don't return phone calls.

563
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,977
It's okay, Sean.
Go get a drink.

564
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,245
Sorry about the calls.

565
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,904
It's been crazy at work.

566
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:10,153
You sent your bodyguard away.

567
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:13,429
You're either very confident
I'm not gonna hurt you

568
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:16,120
or afraid I'm going to talk
about a certain theft.

569
00:40:17,642 --> 00:40:20,751
I've gone through his room,
and there were things Zoe left.

570
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:24,079
Costume jewelry, school papers.

571
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,290
I thought you'd want them.

572
00:40:36,388 --> 00:40:37,962
He loved her very much.

573
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,799
I'm sorry.

574
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,622
Thank you.

575
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:57,247
Thank you.

576
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:26,775
<i>A group known as soldiers of the one</i>

577
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,819
<i>has claimed responsibility
for the bombing.</i>

578
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:31,856
<i>Now, as I'm sure you all know,
the STO espouses</i>

579
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,324
<i>a monotheistic religious philosophy.</i>

580
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:44,000
Dr. Graystone, we think that Zoe
might have been one of the terrorists.

581
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,896
<i>A purse-snatcher, yes...
but a mom?</i>

582
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,639
I don't understand how something
like this could have happened.

583
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,141
Well...

584
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,449
- I need to see her again.
- You wanna talk, we can talk.

585
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:04,668
- Call my office, we'll set up a time.
- I need to see Tamara.

586
00:42:05,245 --> 00:42:06,857
The Tamara that you made.

587
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:08,358
She's gone.

588
00:42:09,451 --> 00:42:11,403
She's gone.
It was a beta test.

589
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,179
I went back in
to iron out some of the kinks,

590
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,699
and Zoe's avatar was gone.

591
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,581
So because Zoe's gone,
you know Tamara's gone?

592
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:21,379
It makes sense that they would
disappear at the same time.

593
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:22,329
What?

594
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:25,216
She didn't disappear
when I took that band off?

595
00:42:26,273 --> 00:42:28,962
From her point of view,
you disappeared, not her.

596
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:34,371
So she might be
all alone in there...

597
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:37,345
not knowing where I went?

598
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:43,552
- Maybe stuck between dead or alive.
- <i>Every one of you...</i>

599
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,812
Not knowing what she is
or why her heart doesn't beat!

600
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,608
<i>That's come up here today
has talked about...</i>

601
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,477
<i>how much you miss
the people that you lost.</i>

602
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:56,848
I do miss Zoe.
I miss her with every breath.

603
00:42:57,128 --> 00:42:58,158
But...

604
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:04,079
I don't really know
what it is that I'm missing.

605
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:09,187
My daughter had a whole life

606
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,155
and a boyfriend
that I knew nothing about.

607
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:15,800
Beliefs that I don't...

608
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,222
I don't understand at all.

609
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,562
Grandma,
have you seen my pyramid game?

610
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:22,762
No, dear.

611
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,393
<i>Looking back, I think that she...</i>

612
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:30,180
<i>Only showed me
what she wanted me to see.</i>

613
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,809
I just didn't know her!

614
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:39,318
You've all talked about...

615
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,990
how guilty you feel.

616
00:43:46,425 --> 00:43:49,252
<i>It's our job.
We create life, and then...</i>

617
00:43:50,051 --> 00:43:52,145
<i>one day we have to face...</i>

618
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,346
<i>who they are...</i>

619
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,275
<i>what they become and what they do.</i>

620
00:44:02,254 --> 00:44:05,114
<i>My daughter, Zoe Graystone, </i>

621
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,193
died in the bombing

622
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,638
of Maglev train number 23.

623
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:18,194
But I think she may have caused it.

624
00:44:28,618 --> 00:44:29,903
This was hers.

625
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,514
I found this.

626
00:44:38,681 --> 00:44:41,469
My daughter was part
of the Soldiers of the One.

627
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,567
Get over here.
Bring the car.

628
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:48,653
My daughter was a terrorist.

629
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,898
I'm sorry!

630
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,650
<i>My daughter was part
of the Soldiers of the One.</i>

631
00:45:01,817 --> 00:45:03,288
<i>She was a terrorist.</i>

632
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,295
Get back!

633
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,309
Drive.

634
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,728
Murderer!

635
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:32,979
Murderer!
