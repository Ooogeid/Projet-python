Clean out his
in-game bank account

179
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,864
like a...
like a heist.

180
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:57,399
None of us can come close
to pulling this off,

181
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,667
'cause this guy's got security.

182
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,403
That's not going to be a
problem for you, okay?

183
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,871
What are you talking about?

184
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,039
You'll see.

185
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:04,507
Now get ready,
here we go.

186
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:21,421
I'm outside.

187
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,924
Wait, is this Caprica?

188
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,125
It's a virtual Caprica.

189
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,561
A digital recreation,
but it's lawless.

190
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:30,561
Anything goes.

191
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:38,034
[Metal rattling]

192
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,414
[Propellers whirring]

193
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,718
[Automatic weapons fire]

194
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:04,589
Get down!

195
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:05,857
[Screams]

196
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:11,095
[Automatic weapons fire]

197
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:17,433
What is this place?

198
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:23,339
Welcome to New Cap City.

199
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,151
So this whole
city is like a game?

200
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,852
Yeah.

201
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,087
It's kind of like a different
version of Caprica city.

202
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,789
They update it so it matches.

203
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:50,693
Even the place where the
Maglev train blew up is here.

204
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:54,463
A Maglev train blew up?

205
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:57,432
How long have you been sleeping?

206
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,034
I don't know.

207
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:03,971
Okay, what's the
object of the game?

208
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,605
It's a mystery.

209
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,840
It's almost like figuring
out the object of the game

210
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:10,076
is the object of the game.

211
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,712
But we think it's about getting
things that convert into points,

212
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,448
like money,
or weapons--

213
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:16,749
So no one's ever finished it?

214
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:17,850
Or won it?

215
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:18,884
Not yet.

216
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:21,820
There's this...thing.

217
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,521
When you die in the game,
you're out,

218
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,557
and you can't ever come back.

219
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,760
But with you, I might
actually have a shot.

220
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,096
Okay, so our target is Chiron.

221
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:34,697
He's a fat cat.

222
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:36,332
Likes to hang in this club
on the lower east side.

223
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:54,480
Back booth.
Don't look, just glance.

224
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:00,384
It's Chiron.
The horse.

225
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,086
Best gamer in the city.

226
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,153
You're going to
pull security away,

227
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:07,655
and I'll grab his avatar, okay?

228
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:10,891
If he's the competition,
why don't you just kill him?

229
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,026
His avatar is more useful to us.

230
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,429
It gets us into his vault,
then we have his money.

231
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,964
His virtual money.

232
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,732
Well, that's how
you win the game.

233
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,799
You think.

234
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,401
That's right.

235
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,935
Deal is,
you help us win the game,

236
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:28,871
and Vesta gets you home.

237
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,873
Look, it's not real, okay?

238
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:35,378
It is to me.

239
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,587
You're gonna pull security away,

240
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,456
and I'm gonna grab his avatar.

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,635
Chiron.

242
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:45,370
You forgot to call me.

243
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:49,440
I can forgive you,
if you play it right.

244
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:51,909
I'm sorry, dear.
I have no idea who you are.

245
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:54,045
Now get the hell out of here.

246
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:56,747
No, you have to remember.
I mean, come on.

247
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,782
It was so sweet.

248
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,951
You said that I could have
anything that I wanted.

249
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:05,954
Don't you remember what I said?

250
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:09,424
I said that...
I said--

251
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:12,426
Aah!

252
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,997
[Crying]

253
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,001
She didn't get sent back.

254
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,069
What's going on?

255
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,536
She should have
de-rezzed already.

256
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:29,472
[Excited chatter]

257
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,353
[Electronic beeping]

258
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,556
What?

259
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:54,796
[Quiet chatter]

260
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:58,566
Come on, come on.

261
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,734
It's okay, all right?
We're gonna be okay.

262
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:04,304
You did good. You did great.
You did great.

263
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:25,895
That just blows my mind.

264
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:31,100
Well, was it worth it?
Did you get what you needed?

265
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:35,837
Yeah, we totally did.

266
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:39,807
Look, just watch me now,
don't--don't be scared.

267
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:44,276
[Electronic whirring, beeping]

268
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:48,480
You see?
It's still just me.

269
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:52,016
Anything that's pure
code can be manipulated.

270
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:54,151
Now we can get into his bank vault,

271
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:56,986
lift his virtual cash,

272
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:00,456
and convert it into
points in the game.

273
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,626
[Electronic whirring, beeping]

274
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:08,529
So we pull that off,
and Vesta helps you.

275
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:09,930
Look...

276
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,802
I know this must seem
really random to you,

277
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,106
but this game, it really
does mean something to me.

278
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,476
It actually allows me to be...
something.

279
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,080
Maybe if you weren't
in here playing this game

280
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:34,249
you could be something
out there too.

281
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,118
You look goofy.
You're gonna embarrass me.

282
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,686
I know that there's
a great spot, just--

283
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,922
This is so boring.
Let's just go home, please!

284
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,890
You're gonna be so happy
when we're eating it.

285
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,191
It's delicious fish.

286
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,592
Come on.

287
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:52,098
You know, we haven't
been here in a long time.

288
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,467
Since, uh--
since we came here

289
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:57,135
with your mom and
Tammy last summer.

290
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,070
That was a great day.

291
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:01,606
They were practically
jumping on the line.

292
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,074
[Sighs]

293
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:05,609
Do you remember that?

294
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,444
Not really.

295
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:10,813
Listen, Willie.

296
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,182
If you ever want to
talk about anything,

297
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,851
about mommy, or Tammy.

298
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,187
[Boys chattering]

299
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,655
Hey, what are you looking at?

300
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:24,557
I'm here for you.
You know that, right?

301
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:29,593
Yeah...um, could we
just go home, please?

302
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,128
There's no water.
What are you talking about?

303
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,263
This is--
the less water,

304
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,565
the closer the fish
are to the surface.

305
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,668
Everybody knows that.
Come on, get your rod.

306
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:43,838
Aw, look at the little
Tauron dirt-eater.

307
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,640
You've been
unreachable for a day.

308
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,940
I'll call you back.

309
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:51,674
And your assistant
won't look me in the eye.

310
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:55,975
I think it's time you
told me what's going on.

311
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:58,143
The board called
an emergency meeting.

312
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:01,980
I've been trying to figure
out who's behind it.

313
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:06,816
Hmm...
Is it Atkinson?

314
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,553
Well, it's everyone.

315
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,222
But, yeah, Atkinson,
and Parker's gonna be the one

316
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,792
doing the talking.

317
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,061
And the others will
sit on their hands,

318
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:15,062
let him go on about the
stock price tanking,

319
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,764
your decision to give
up the V-World license.

320
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,665
So if I don't come up with
answers to the holo-bank crisis

321
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,600
they're going to try to
force me to step down

322
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,034
from my own company.

323
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:25,170
[Sighs]

324
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:29,207
Do they, uh...

325
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:32,042
Do you think they
have the votes?

326
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:47,655
Can we just go, please?
I want to go.

327
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:49,857
Just wait a little longer.

328
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,993
Don't you love the fresh air
and the beauty out here?

329
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:55,196
It's much better than that
smoke-filled room at Goldie's.

330
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:57,531
It's so boring.
Can we please go?

331
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,199
I don't like it here,
can we please go?

332
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:02,568
Looks like it's gonna
be dirt again tonight!

333
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,003
Just, listen--ignore that.
They're idiots.

334
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,238
You talking to me?

335
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,006
Who else would I be talking to?

336
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:10,209
Hey, Willie, just ignore them.
Willie, put that down.

337
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,977
I said, it must be fun
to have all that dirt.

338
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,544
Really?

339
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,579
Willie, get back here right now!

340
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,248
Willie!
Hey! No!

341
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:21,919
- Get him, get him!
- Willie!

342
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,656
Hey! Hey!

343
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:24,724
Beat him up!

344
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,826
Hey, come here.
Stop it, willie!

345
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,194
No! Come here!

346
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,577
Did I wake you up?

347
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:55,482
No, I wasn't sleeping.
Not really.

348
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,484
Maybe a few minutes.

349
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:04,756
What's going on?

350
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,495
I--
I think that, uh,

351
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,731
I might be losing
my company tomorrow.

352
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,875
Do you remember when I
was pregnant with Zoe?

353
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,113
We were living in that
flat in Cloverdale.

354
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,185
And you were taking the bus all
over town because that car,

355
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,888
that you loved, never worked.

356
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:45,989
It worked.

We hadn't paid the rent
for like, three months.

upper-level Bucs tickets.

Ooh, things were really bad.

360
00:21:56,698 --> 00:22:01,668
But you had a big,
fat meeting with Microcap.

361
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,103
And you knew nobody wanted
to see you in there,

362
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,138

363

Someone had done
you a favor.

364
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,210

374

to be a broken wrist,

375
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:38,666
and you walked out of there,

376
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,869

would start everything.

You can't change the fact
that he went on that show

Well, he didn't
stick to the script.

380

But on the flip side, our
approval ratings sky-rocketed.

founder of this company now,

generation coming up,

all to be free.

We can't own it forever.

sinking ship,

the next big thing,

hold on to our past.

00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:53,461
make out the names on the list.

534
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:54,829
What a shame.

535
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:58,900
Tamara Adams, 16 years old.

536
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:04,437
615 Olympic Street,
number 3, Caprica city.

537
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:08,374
Isn't that you, baby?
So young.

538
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:14,446
Wait, wait, I don't get it.

539
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:18,216
What--
what's the list?

540
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:20,619
What's the list of?

541
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,686
It doesn't matter.

542
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:26,324
You're dead, baby.

543
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:29,260
Does that explain why she can
do what she did to the guards?

544
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,861
I think it might.

545
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:33,729
You're not going home,
doll face.

546
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:38,133
Don't worry.

547
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:42,270
We've got plenty for
you to do, baby.

548
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:45,439
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

549
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:05,757
You need to go
to the real world.

550
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:07,891
You need to find my father.

551
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,926
You know the address.
You heard it.

552
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:13,528
615 Olympic, 
number 3.

553
00:37:13,595 --> 00:37:15,562
I'll wait for you in New Cap
City so you can find me.

554
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,864
I can't go back to
the real world, okay--

555
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,899
You could be something there!

556
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:24,134
Just take off
your holoband, okay?

557
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,602
You're not gonna die here.

558
00:37:26,669 --> 00:37:29,636
Just go.

559
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:57,425
What are you?

560
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,128
I'm awake.

561
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:42,074
Do you have a
coin for me, Joseph?

562
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:46,911
I have a coin for my wife,
Shannon Adama.

563
00:38:51,483 --> 00:38:56,320
I have a coin for my sister,
Tamara Adama.

564
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:04,525
Will you grant them passage?

565
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:11,231
They will have passage.

566
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:19,938
Will you let them go?

567
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:23,941
Yes.

568
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,776
Yes.

569
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:33,181
Will you bid them farewell?

570
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,755
Goodbye, Shannon.

571
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:50,561
Goodbye, Tamara.

572
00:39:51,696 --> 00:39:53,330
Goodbye, Tamara.

573
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,869
Goodbye, mom.

574
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:07,377
Then they will live
forever in peace.

575
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:10,613
They will live forever
in your hearts.

576
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:18,586
[Tauron funeral chant]

577
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:23,777
That's a good one.

578
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,645
Hi, can I help you?

579
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:30,881
Hey, are you,
uh, Joseph Adams?

580
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:34,349
It's Adama.
How can I help you?

581
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,783
Tamara sent me.

582
00:41:40,552 --> 00:41:42,785
What are you talking about?

583
00:41:45,288 --> 00:41:47,223
She gave me this address,
right...

584
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:50,560
Okay, look,
she's in the V-World

585
00:41:50,627 --> 00:41:51,694
and she can't get out.

586
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:52,795
If you can just help me--

587
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:55,598
You saw her?

588
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,333
Yeah, but I think she was
just sleeping or something.

589
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:59,769
So if you could just
please go wake her up,

590
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:01,370
she really needs that.

591
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,838
My daughter's dead.

592
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:05,406
She died in the Maglev attacks.

593
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:10,943
Oh, gods, I--
I'm sorry.

594
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:13,278
You saw her in V-World?

595
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:15,514
You gotta take me there.

596
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:17,482
You gotta take me to see her.

597
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:18,383
Okay?

598
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,384
Hey...

599
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:20,685
Hey!

600
00:42:20,753 --> 00:42:25,423
Stop!
Stop!

601
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:40,202
Hey.

602
00:42:42,405 --> 00:42:47,451
Tammy.
