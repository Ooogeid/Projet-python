00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,459
<i>Previously on </i>Caprica...

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,153
A group known as Soldiers of the One
is responsible for the bombing.

3
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:11,334
We don't really know
the people closest to us.

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,720
My daughter died

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,182
in the bombing of train number 23,

6
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:18,309
but I think she may have caused it.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,394
My daughter was a terrorist!

8
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:23,744
I'm just trying
to find out who I am.

9
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,999
I'm Zoe
and the avatar and the robot.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,820
Like some kind of what-you-call-it,
three-parter.

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,117
Trinity.

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,032
That's what you are.

13
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:36,347
I've been given a mission
that will change my life.

14
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:39,330
I have someone for you to find.
Keon Gatwick.

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,559
I need to know I can count on you
to get me to Gemenon.

16
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:45,044
I made a promise to Zoe
before she died.

17
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,318
- I need to get something to Gemenon.
- I'll see what I can do.

18
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,384
Everything I've built
is on the line.

19
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,453
People are so angry,

20
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,731
they are throwing away
their Graystone computers.

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,352
Sarno's making public opinion,
and everyone is watching.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,323
Have Briyah book me on Sarno.

23
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:05,604
Blood for blood.

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,112
It the Tauron way.

25
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,527
Daniel Graystone
lost his daughter, right?

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,862
I lost my daughter and my wife.

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,280
Balance it out.

28
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,388
- What's going on?
- Bomb in a holocafe three hours ago.

29
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:37,566
- Place was closed and empty.
- So not out to kill.

30
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,535
Threat?

31
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,186
Or warning or nuisance
or personal beef with the owner.

32
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,644
Or STO.

33
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:47,817
What? You don't come back
after ten years just to blow up a train.

34
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,275
They want us scared.

35
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:51,713
Small bomb, middle of the night.

36
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,756
My money's on copycats.

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,679
If you got no STO worries,
maybe you don't want to hear

38
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,358
what I picked up at the courthouse.

39
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,828
Don't be coy. I hate that.
What you got?

40
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,843
Intercolonial court on Libra
handed that down an hour ago...

41
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:08,678
Last matter of the day,
Themis standard time.

42
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:12,173
A search warrant for a private school?
How'd you get this?

43
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,718
When Amanda Graystone held up
that pendant at the memorial service,

44
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:17,720
she handed us grounds

45
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,098
to search Zoe's property,
which includes her locker at school

46
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,076
and any other locker
she might have used.

47
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:25,249
- You're gonna make a thing of it?
- I might.

48
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:26,647
Keep it tasteful.

49
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,898
Good morning.

50
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,430
Am I too sweaty for you?

51
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,050
Is that your phone?

52
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:18,312
Get off me.
Get off me right now.

53
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,041
What's going on?

54
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,756
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault entirely.

55
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,684
Global Defense Department!

56
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:30,935
Listen carefully, everybody!

57
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,618
I need you to step away
from the lockers right now!

58
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,144
Everyone, now!
Step away!

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,737
Clear the hallway.

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,041
Let's go. Ladies.
That's it. Move. Move out.

61
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,201
Come on, folks.

62
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:50,456
That's it.
Toss everything.

63
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,044
That's it.
Toss them all.

64
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:02,686
We need to talk.

65
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,332
I'll walk away.
You follow in a few.

66
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:08,558
Next one.
This is clear.

67
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,596
This is a script.

68
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,375
It's a list of talking points.

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,153
"I loved my daughter very much...
But I knew she was troubled.

70
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,281
"There were disturbing signs well before
I developed the Holoband."

71
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,951
All it needs are stage directions.
Should I point to my heart?

72
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,652
We're not telling you how to say it.

73
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:31,145
- Use your own phrasing.
- I don't want to say she was troubled.

74
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,581
- It's important.
- Why?

75
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:35,843
If she had a preexisting problem,

76
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,218
it takes the onus off the Holoband.

77
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,006
Then I'll find a different way
of saying it.

78
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,545
She's not happy I'm going on Sarno.

79
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,845
Exactly how not happy?

80
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,997
Not happy enough
to make another announcement?

81
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:51,940
- If she contradicts you...
- She'll be fine.

82
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:54,074
You should probably play it
a little guilty.

83
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,423
You missed the signs. You'll always
blame yourself because of that.

84
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,066
People want contrition.

85
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:03,028
Just make it clear it's not guilt
for making a dangerous product.

86
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,445
- What happened to Zoe...
- Nothing to do with the Holoband.

87
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,657
That's just true.

88
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,367
That was great.
Do that.

89
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,356
I'm a star.

90
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,833
Can you say it all
from the beginning again?

91
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,893
Why isn't it done?

92
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,073
Because,<i> so-fis-tace,</i>
they're both in the house,

93
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,648
and there's two other people.

94
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,957
<i>How big a bloodbath do you want?</i>

95
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,253
Right, no.
Gods, no bloodbath.

96
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,576
You still want to do this, right?

97
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:56,999
Of course.

98
00:06:58,112 --> 00:06:59,857
Then have patience, Yoseef.

99

-= Lords Of Kobol: Before The Fall =-

100
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,655
Gravedancing (1.00)

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,205
http://www.sous-titres.eu/

102
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,977
I know it's all been
very, very upsetting,

103
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,843
I'm gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.

104
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,697
Now, everybody just go home.

105
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,866
I'll see you tomorrow.

106
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,272
Go on.

107
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:55,701
- Are they gone?
- They went ahead to the studio.

108
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,088
I need to get dressed.

109
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,609
Do you know
where the coat to this is?

110
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,103
I have no idea.

111
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,128
That's gonna strobe, anyway.

112
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:09,436
You're right.

113
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:16,116
I can't believe you're going out there
to dance on her grave like this.

114
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,849
I'm just saying the exact same thing
that you said.

115
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,052
- I didn't say she was crazy.
- She blew up a train.

116
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,980
Maybe. You know,
I don't even know what she did.

117
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,232
- Maybe she was running away.
- I want to do this?

118
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,675
I don't, but I have to,

119
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,745
because you opened up
this dialogue with greater Caprica.

120
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,118
I didn't mean to go on television.

121
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,169
You are deliberately going
on television.

122
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,080
There were cameras
all over that park.

123
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:41,889
- I was just talking to the crowd.
- We just have to go with it, all right?

124
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,349
Does this tie work?

125
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,846
It's great.

126
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,300
Look, can't you just go out there

127
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:58,459
and say that this is a very sad time
for our family

128
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,349
and that we need time to process...

129
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,547
But that just doesn't play.
The car should be here by now.

130
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,021
Doesn't play?

131
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,050
Did you actually hear
what you just said?

132
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:09,276
I don't have time
for this right now.

133
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,568
I'm about to go
on international television.

134
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,308
We are not company spokespeople.

135
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,905
- We're parents!
- Parents?

136
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:17,282
Actually, no, we're not.

137
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,013
<i>Can I help you?</i>

138
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,008
Oh, hell.

139
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,378
Hello, beautiful.

140
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,767
How are you doing?
Me? I'm doing great.

141
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,155
Thanks for asking.

142
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,490
They leave you down here all alone?

143
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,010
Let's take a closer look.

144
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,862
You know, that is the finest work
that I've ever done, designing that.

145
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,011
You need a name.

146
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,396
I want to go through it again.

147
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,203
Let's run it.
One more time.

148
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:56,205
- I still see the bruises.
- I'm doing my best.

149
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,384
She was complicated.
Long before I invented the Holoband...

150
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,578
"Troubled" is better.
"Complicated" is meaningless.

151
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:03,347
I shouldn't have to say it
in one word.

152
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,667
Zoe was...

153
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,476
Zoe's troubles
started a long time ago.

154
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,770
- How's that? "Zoe's troubles"?
- It's not the same.

155
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,271
"I loved Zoe."

156
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,379
What?

157
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,689
It's a good place for you to start.

158
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:16,818
"I loved Zoe,

159
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:19,192
"and I wish I'd seen the signs,
but it wasn't the Holoband."

160
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:20,309
She was troubled.

161
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:23,241
- Give me a cigarette, Cyrus.
- You can't smoke while I'm working.

162
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:30,293
I am so sorry.
I did not mean to offend you.

163
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,753
But the idea of going on live TV,
quite frankly, makes me want to vomit.

164
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,131
Is there anything I can do
to help change your mind?

165
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:42,594
I'll give you 1,000 cubits
if you let me have a cigarette.

166
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:44,454
Done.

167
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:45,901
Thank you.

168
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,896
Where were you?
You weren't at school.

169
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,164
They called.

170
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:58,338
I was with uncle Sam.
It's not a problem, is it?

171
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:00,181
I guess not.

172
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:02,114
We won't tell your father.

173
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,686
On Tauron, when you're 13,
you're a man.

174
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,269
You make your own decisions.

175
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,636
Thank you, Tsattie.

176
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,459
He barely sees you.

177
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:18,130
He shouldn't be angry when he does.

178
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,804
What do you want to be?

179
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,558
I don't know yet.
I haven't really thought about it.

180
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,215
Not when you grow up.
What do you want to be now?

181
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,735
There was this job for kids,

182
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:42,028
where you work inside the locker rooms
with the pyramid players.

183
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Be that.

184
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,284
It's just that...

185
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,952
Dad knows the owner,

186
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:50,315
Mr. Graystone.

187
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:54,916
I'm not sure if they're still friends.
I'm not sure if he still likes him.

188
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,829
You think you only get things
from friends?

189
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,380
You get the best things
from enemies...

190
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,954
Because they're scared of you.

191
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,679
Sam can look into it, okay?

192
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,932
Your uncle knows
how to make things happen.

193
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,764
You're the one who sent me to do this.
You're gonna have to live with it.

194
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,862
Just get it done.

195
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:54,100
<i>Keep your pants on.</i>

196
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,618
I'm going in now.

197
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,128
- Wait a minute.
- <i>What?</i>

198
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,189
<i>Wait.</i>

199
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,403
GDD.

200
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,566
What?

201
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:08,183
<i>Global agents.</i>

202
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:12,494
My guys, inside.
Just give me a second.

203
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:13,951
Everybody in?

204
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:15,580
Press, you got to stay outside!

205
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,415
- You can't do this here.
- Warrant.

206
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,085
- My husband does defense...
- The girl's room is downstairs.

207
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,503
Everybody wears gloves.

208
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,466
This warrant applies to the residence.
We're not going near your husband's lab.

209
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,135
If you're gonna do this to her,
I want to see this.

210
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,575
Doctor, please. Stay calm for a second.
We're not gonna do anything to her.

211
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,100
We're trying to find out
who turned her into a bomber.

212
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,023
Please, not her cello.
She's...

213
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,317
At least please tell them
to be careful with it.

214
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,194
Careful with the cello.

215
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,447
You really have to do this?
Really?

216
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,321
What do you think
you're gonna find here?

217
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,046
I really don't know...

218
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,829
Maybe who she met with...

219
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,901
who brainwashed her into believing
in a moral dictator called God...

220
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,794
Maybe the name of some other kid

221
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,630
who blew up a Caprican business
in the middle of the night.

222
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,341
Do you honestly think
that information's here?

223
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,175
Really?

224
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:12,987
In the jewelry box.

225
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,312
That wasn't...

226
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:17,350
I put that there.
That wasn't here.

227
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,920
There are loose ends, Doctor,

228
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,483
and I'm sorry if we have to take
your daughter's life apart

229
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,817
in order to put other terrorists
behind bars,

230
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,092
but if we have to, then so be it.

231
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,924
What is this to you?

232
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,039
Did you lose someone on that train?

233
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,635
I lost everyone on that train.

234
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,187
And...

235
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,300
I'll see you later.

236
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,307
What are you doing here?

237
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,843
Last time I saw you,
I had you pinned to the ground.

238
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,728
You said you'd help me
get to Gemenon.

239
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,022
Well, I was wrong.
I can't.

240
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:09,027
You shouldn't have scampered off
during the locker search.

241
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,738
- It made you look guilty.
- You should go.

242
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:15,082
I'm the only one here today,
and I have to have this bucket case

243
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,757
fixed by the end
of the afternoon, so...

244
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:24,217
- What are you doing?
- My mom does repairs, for a living.

245
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,420
What if someone sees us

246
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,482
together?

247
00:17:30,234 --> 00:17:31,216
Who's seeing?

248
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,105
Nothing in Zoe Graystone's room.

249
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,023
The parents cleaned out the room.
Look at the school.

250
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:42,185
Nothing there
either minor drug stuff.

251
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,134
You guaranteed me
detonators and infinity symbols.

252
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,578
Sir, it is too clean.

253
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:48,932
Somebody got to those kids.
Please,

254
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,012
give me the power to access
communications to the students e-sheets,

255
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:53,947
phones.

256
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,241
Gee, scout leader Duram,

257
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,910
this slope's getting
kind of slippery.

258
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,372
Ben Stark and Zoe Graystone,
I guarantee you

259
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,208
they are not the only students
the STO turned at that school.

260
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,686
Now, we find out who it was
who warned those kids,

261
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,004
we find out who it was
who's running the operation.

262
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,137
You're wrong about this,

263
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:13,550
I own your <i>or-khayss</i>.

264
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,678
Tauron slang,
that's very street of you, sir.

265
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:19,797
Fine.

266
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:20,849
I'm wrong,

267
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:23,198
I'll serve them to you on a plate.

268
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,176
There.

269
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,276
That's a nice-looking chest.

270
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,035
I think it looks great.

271
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:36,593
So let's...

272
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,534
check you out, shall we?

273
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,352
See that we didn't glitch
any connections.

274
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,217
<i>Running diagnostic test.</i>

275
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,434
Look at you.

276
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,829
I'm gonna make you dance.

277
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,208
All right?
Here, try this.

278
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:25,133
<i>Diagnostic test complete.</i>

279
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,554
Last of the e-sheets for today.

280
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:50,415
Now, if we had
an up-to-date computer...

281
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,500
Check around 6:00 AM.

282
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,004
It's most likely a group-send
to the entire student body.

283
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:01,676
I've never seen you like this.

284
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,930
We had Ben Stark, and we let him go.

285
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,877
I'm sorry.
I'm not putting this all on you.

286
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,229
We all got complacent.
We're all responsible.

287
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:18,568
Really?

288
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,139
So are we all responsible
for the bad wheat crop on Aerilon?

289
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,659
Why are you doing it?

290
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:33,540
You're still here,
you're working as hard as I am.

291
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:39,116
It seems that Gemenese scum are luring
good Caprican kids into a killer cult.

292
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,424
Anyone doing that
needs to be destroyed.

293
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,872
I got something for Willie.

294
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:52,352
They're like jacks,

295
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,359
since you threw out his fancy games.

296
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,289
What are these, bones?

297
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:58,933
Tauron children play jacks

298
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:01,808
with the finger bones
of the Tauron children

299
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:03,321
who lose at jacks.

300
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:07,825
That was a joke.

301
00:22:08,189 --> 00:22:09,604
They're bones from chicken feet.

302
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,863
<i>The interview
you thought you'd never see.</i>

303
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:13,790
<i>Daniel Graystone coming up at 10:00</i>

304
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,745
<i>on</i> Backtalk <i>with Baxter...</i>

305
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,870
That's the man you don't like.

306
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:22,765
Well?

307
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,777
It's gonna be taken care of.

308
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,037
Good!

309
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:33,307
The dead don't really die

310
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:36,637
until their death is avenged.

311
00:22:37,777 --> 00:22:40,566
My daughter and your daughter
are caught between life and death.

312
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:43,865
He's gonna pay.

313
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:45,502
Good.

314
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:48,268
Believe me.

315
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:55,757
Hey, guys.

316
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,044
Welcome to <I>Backtalk</I>.

317
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,087
Thank you so much for coming out.

318
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,923
We have got a pretty amazing show.
I don't need to tell you why...

319
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,844
So let's get through this monologue
that I wrote two minutes ago.

320
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:11,548
<i>Not that things
are perfect here on Caprica.</i>

321
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,852
Some of you know that, many residents
are not too happy with the government.

322
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:20,187
- They're saying 30 seconds. Let's go.
- They think they are soft on terrorism.

323
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:23,912
So in order to protest...
I see you guys laughing over there.

324
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:25,361
Here we go.

325
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,487
- They're about to introduce you.
- I just... I need a second!

326
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:35,387
My gosh, they broke our back.
They sent us peppermint sticks.

327
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,051
And finally,
some of you may have heard,

328
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,545
yesterday security
was called in here,

329
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:44,422
but there's nothing
to worry about now.

330
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:46,844
It turns out
it was a huge misunderstanding.

331
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:49,427
I was only bombing figuratively.

332
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:51,804
Figuratively.

333
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,220
Fire half of the writing staff.

334
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,268
<i>On that grim note,
let's bring out our first guest.</i>

335
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:01,564
<i>Needs no introduction.</i>

336
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,241
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Daniel Graystone.

337
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,123
There he is.

338
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,922
The Global Defense came to the house.
They ransacked the place.

339
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,341
They're doing this wrong.

340
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,857
- There are things he has to say.
- Can we just talk about this later?

341
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,846
It's too late. He's on.

342
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,714
Thank you for coming on.

343
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:40,086
I think I may have mentioned you
a couple of times this week.

344
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:41,700
You did.

345
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,322
My solstice wish
was for free publicity.

346
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,859
Probably should have been
a little more specific.

347
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:53,908
I feel so much better
about my monologue right now.

348
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,462
<i>All right, that's...
I'm sorry, listen,</i>

349
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:58,178
<i>This is what's going on.</i>

350
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:00,581
<i>- Is this water?
- That, indeed, is water.</i>

351
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:03,042
Was there something else
in your rider that you needed?

352
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,543
I'm fine with water.

353
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,929
Can we get something stronger
for Mr. Graystone?

354
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:09,404
- We're good?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

355
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,570
Your wife has stated
that your daughter,

356
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:15,847
Zoe Graystone,

357
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:19,934
<i>was involved with terrorists
and may have been...</i>

358
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,973
<i>- ... responsible for the bombing...
- We don't know anything for sure, but</i>

359
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:26,357
it does seem she'd fallen in with
this group, the Soldiers of the One.

360
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,047
She was...

361
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:31,987
She was...

362
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,638
She was troubled...

363
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:37,749
But this started a long time
before I invented the Holoband.

364
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:40,753
- Let me tell you what I see.
- Troubled?

365
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,465
I see a lot of young people

366
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,818
growing up
in a virtual world right now.

367
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,935
I've actually heard
your theory about this.

368
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,382
- I've heard it before, and if I may...
- No theories. Let's talk facts.

369
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,051
Facts... your daughter...
your troubled daughter...

370
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,929
growing up with Holobands
and learning

371
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,600
that there are no consequences,

372
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:01,938
absolutely.

373
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:03,227
But...

374
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,634
- He was right. It's not a good word.
- It's not a good word. You know that.

375
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,484
But you see the thing is,
she didn't even like the Holoband.

376
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,396
- She didn't like it? Hated it?
- Not at all. Yes.

377
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:16,616
Maybe because it was making her
want to blow things up?

378
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,659
You know, and the whole...

379
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,265
Oh, wait.

380
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,834
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

381
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,753
Dr. Amanda Graystone.

382
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,054
People watching at home,
let's hit "record,"

383
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,374
and we'll be right back
after these messages.

384
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,976
This is going to be very exciting,

385
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,501
so stick around.

386
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:53,832
We are back.

387
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,200
Dr. Graystone,
this is a shock and a surprise.

388
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,619
It's a surprise for me too,

389
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,122
<i>but I couldn't stand there.</i>

390
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,707
<i>I just had to.</i>

391
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:08,994
You're both getting this wrong.

392
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,544
I'm getting this wrong.

393
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,997
I just flashed back to my first
and third marriages there.

394
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,757
I mean, Okay, I'm sorry.

395
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,676
I don't know why I made a joke.

396
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:20,888
Dr. Graystone,
what is your take on this?

397
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:24,183
You're out here
saying that Zoe was crazy.

398
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,561
Zoe wasn't crazy.
She wasn't.

399
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:30,326
Zoe was... Zoe was angry.

400
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:33,335
She was defiant.
She was rude.

401
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,820
She was frustrating.

402
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:37,613
- Okay.
- Well,

403
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,283
show me
a 15-year-old girl who isn't.

404
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,868
<i>She slammed her door.
She played loud music.</i>

405
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,802
She said that
we embarrassed her in public.

406
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,625
... she played loud music
and blew up a commuter train.

407
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,407
When was I supposed
to call the cops?

408
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:53,436
I don't know. Maybe when
she started worshipping

409
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:55,751
the big destruct'-o God
in the sky maybe.

410
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,883
We didn't know.
There weren't any signs.

411
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,510
You said she was troubled.

412
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,587
Damned...

413
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,851
She was angry.
It's a better word. My wife's right.

414
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:08,978
Angry, but I'd also like to add

415
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,521
morally blank,

416
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,356
because the virtual world

417
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,027
is a poor teacher
and doesn't teach you boundaries.

418
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,578
You know who would completely
agree with that is Zoe,

419
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:20,656
and that's exactly
how the STO got to her.

420
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:23,326
The... okay, I'm sorry,
you have to slow down

421
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,579
and back up and keep in mind
half of this audience is stoned.

422
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:32,418
She saw things
in the virtual world...

423
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:34,346
Ritual sacrifices,

424
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:37,142
games like New Cap City,
and she felt the absence

425
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:39,425
of moral guidelines,
just like you do,

426
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,760
like a lot of folks do.

427
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,989
And into that absence steps the STO,

428
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:46,870
offering this marvelous
ultimate moral arbiter.

429
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,977
It's quite appealing,
for a teenage girl, especially.

430
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,146
You're assuming all of this.

431
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,128
- I talked to her.
- You did?

432
00:28:54,677 --> 00:28:55,481
When?

433
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:02,740
After she died, I created

434
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,822
a virtual version of her, an avatar.

435
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:07,738
You cre... I'm sorry.
You...

436
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,207
You made an electronic ghost
of your dead daughter.

437
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,436
I just wanted to hear
the sound of her voice again.

438
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,001
I sympathize.

439
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,594
This is very disturbing.

440
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:20,558
It is disturbing,
but show me a parent

441
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:24,000
who would not do anything possible
to try and understand their child.

442
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,649
- Okay, well...
- It was disturbing.

443
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:30,892
I know that.

444
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,819
But I was trying to make sense...

445
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:35,270
You got a bracelet?

446
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,983
There's a plastic bracelet
for backstage visitors.

447
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,352
I used the tools,
the gifts that I have to do that,

448
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:42,707
and I know she wasn't real, but...

449
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:47,914
but I could use that ID Badge.

450
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,628
I used the tools,
the gifts that I have to...

451
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:59,945
But it did offer some small insight
into her motivations.

452
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:04,351
If this whole thing
was a reaction to the V-world,

453
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:06,387
we're just right back
at square one, aren't we?

454
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,230
Isn't technology the problem?

455
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,223
Isn't the V-world the problem?

456
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:11,851
- Maybe.
- That's not the problem.

457
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,561
- I'm sorry. Maybe?
- Maybe.

458
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,365
I'm starting
to like you, Mr. Graystone.

459
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,470
We thought we could control
the content in V-world,

460
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:23,487
especially for kids,
but we've failed, clearly.

461
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:26,282
I think the temptation
to hack the code is too great.

462
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:28,576
All right,
then what is your solution?

463
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,705
I don't know.

464
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,537
- Well, think out loud.
- I don't know.

465
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,956
For there to be any...

466
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:35,812
any beneficial change,

467
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,956
you'd have to take away
the profit motive,

468
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:41,213
like when they legalized drugs,
for instance.

469
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,325
<i>Okay, well, that's a good point,</i>

470
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,552
<i>but you're also talking about something
that took decades of pretty</i>

471
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,190
violent arguing back and forth...

472
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,639
Why not?
Why couldn't we...

473
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,810
try it?

474
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,285
But this is a huge leap
you're talking about.

475
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,938
Graystone industries
will no longer charge

476
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,912
for licensing of any legal spaces

477
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:02,692
and any profit
we make off the bands will go to

478
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,145
some charity or...

479
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,940
A foundation that we can create.

480
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,491
For young people to find
the right experiences and values.

481
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:11,377
Okay, this is...
You're saying this now,

482
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,774
and I support it.
I think this is very admirable.

483
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:17,557
Are you gonna say this Monday
to your stockholders and your directors?

484
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,045
Great PR.
No, that's great PR.

485
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:23,631
- Yes, I can promise this.
- That's 60% of our net.

486
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:28,670
My company will make no more profit

487
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,689
on the Holobands
or V-world licensing.

488
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,131
Hold me to it, Caprica.

489
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:36,792
Okay, well, speaking for Caprica,

490
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,817
and you know that I like to,

491
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:40,064
we will.

492
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:44,729
Thank you, Doctors Graystone,

493
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:46,620
this was a fascinating

494
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,618
discussion that I was
completely unprepared for.

495
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,368
Thank you very much,

496
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,604
and I think we need to credit Amanda
with the most amazing save

497
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,425
since Bracken Oka...

498
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,542
- She's on there?
- <i>Beat Jenkins at the horn?</i>

499
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,928
She's not supposed to be.

500
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,187
<i>Let's pick an analogy
where the Bucs won, okay?</i>

501
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:04,964
<i>Okay, I don't let my...</i>

502
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:08,175
I could kill her
with my own hands...

503
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,262
Sleep well every night.

504
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:12,675
Couldn't you?

505
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,641
I see a lot of panicked faces behind me.
This might take a while.

506
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,432
- Don't say that.
- You should go home.

507
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,986
- All right, well, I got a taxi, so...
- I can get you a car.

508
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,479
I can get another one.
I'll see you at home.

509
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:31,475
- Love you.
- Thanks again.

510
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,418
Excuse me.

511
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,977
Sorry.
I'm Baxter's driver.

512
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:37,853
If you like, I could take you home.

513
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:39,618
Yeah, perfect.
Thank you.

514
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:42,149
What's your name?

515
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,296
I'm Sam.

516
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,829
- Nice to meet you. I'm Amanda.
- Nice to meet you.

517
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:16,118
You saved my life with this one.

518
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:17,036
So,

519
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:20,300
did you have something
in your locker?

520
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:23,667
- Did you get a warning?
- I can't tell you.

521
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,544
I can't.
I just can't.

522
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,510
I get why you're being cautious.

523
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,358
That's smart.

524
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,448
But I have to do this.

525
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,013
I have to go to Gemenon
and take Zoe's package with me.

526
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,346
I have to.

527
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,002
If there's any way
you can help me...

528
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,976
I can maybe set up a meeting
with Barnabas.

529
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:49,591
That's all I can do.

530
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:53,601
He's the one who can decide
if you get the STO's help.

531
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:55,366
Thank you.

532
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:09,301
Are those homemade?

533
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:13,069
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your tattoos... Are they homemade?

534
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:17,841
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry,
but I'm a plastic surgeon.

535
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:20,766
I'm really interested
in that sort of thing.

536
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:23,131
They're cultural...

537
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:24,662
Tauron.

538
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,449
Oh, yes, of course.

539
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:30,442
They have meanings, right?

540
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:38,534
A lot of people here on Caprica
think they mean that you're a gangster,

541
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:40,100
but they don't.

542
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,545
- Of course not.
- Well, I mean, it might, but...

543
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,550
It doesn't have to.

544
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,038
You know, you get ink
because you're a parent,

545
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:50,337
or you got a fancy pedigree,

546
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:53,465
or there's some sort of ritual,
maybe made a mistake.

547
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:57,094
I could give you a fancy pedigree.
I could...

548
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,807
add a few accomplishments,
take away a few mistakes.

549
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,555
Yeah, well,
that wouldn't be real, I'm afraid.

550
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,134
Very little is real these days.

551
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,724
This isn't the way home.

552
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:33,537
Come on, Sam.

553
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,450
Don't.

554
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,913
Larry, hi. Listen,
I need to get a hold of Sam.

555
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:02,468
And it's an emergency, and it's...

556
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,915
He won't answer his phone.
Please.

557
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Have him call me soon
as you hear from him, okay?

558
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,165
Thanks.

559
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:15,747
Turn on your frakkin' phone!

560
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,392
Excuse me, this isn't the way home.

561
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:29,789
There was an accident
on the thruway.

562
00:36:29,914 --> 00:36:32,356
I'm just gonna cut
through Little Tauron.

563
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,525
Don't worry.
It's good people here...

564
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,618
Not very nosy...

565
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,455
Which is a good thing, right?

566
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,330
What with all those people
angry about all those deaths.

567
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:51,511
I lost my sister-in-law
and my niece on that train.

568
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:57,075
My Gods, I'm so sorry.

569
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:01,620
Well, you can't turn back time.

570
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,096
Nothing I could do
to change that now.

571
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,949
I guess all we can try and do
is understand.

572
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,019
Or look for some kind of balance.

573
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,181
Maybe try to even things out.

574
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,000
My sister-in-law's name was Shannon.

575
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:29,079
My niece was named Tamara.

576
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,292
She was gonna make us all proud.

577
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,902
Larry hates it
when I come home bloody.

578
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:03,322
Did you do it?

579
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,426
I...

580
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,652
can't hear you over the water.

581
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:08,982
Is it done?

582
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,556
Yeah, it's done.

583
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:14,240
Why you think I'm washing up, huh?

584
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,421
She was getting a little...

585
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,216
<i>Apo-play-ktay</i> in the car.

586
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,350
Didn't want a fight
in a closed space,

587
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,095
so I ordered her out of the car,
said we were having engine trouble,

588
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,908
she should go
inside this restaurant.

589
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,308
Connie's place, remember?
We used to go there in high school.

590
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:33,123
I know Connie's place.

591
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,211
I sent her inside, right?

592
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,359
Jacks. Nice.

593
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,611
And she notices right away
that there's no one inside,

594
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:46,731
'cause I called ahead just in case,

595
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:52,121
so I'm standing in the front
with the knives, the <i>sfa-gi-dess</i>.

596
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,551
- Yeah.
- Frak.

597
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,606
She tries to get out back
to the alley, but it's locked.

598
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,013
You killed her in the kitchen?

599
00:39:03,477 --> 00:39:05,666
Well, that stuff
they spray at crime scenes,

600
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,897
can't tell the difference between
animal blood and human blood.

601
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:11,811
You really did it.

602
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:14,969
I'm messin' with you
to teach you a lesson

603
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:17,294
about yanking me around like this.

604
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,022
Wait.

605
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,226
What?

606
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:21,441
Are you...

607
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,069
Was that sarcastic?

608
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:28,287
What do you think?

609
00:39:28,412 --> 00:39:29,989
I can't tell, Sam!

610
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:32,995
Stop frakkin' around!
Did you kill her?

611
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,724
I don't turn off my phone, Yoseef,

612
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,787
and I got other people
who call me, you know?

613
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:41,912
So, yeah...

614
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,939
I got your, like, 60 text messages.

615
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:50,811
I didn't kill her.

616
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,039
Scared her a bit.

617
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,563
Bet she's getting
a lot of that right now.

618
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,721
- You're frakkin' with me.
- I'm frakkin' with you,

619
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:03,650
I knew
you couldn't go through with it.

620
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:07,756
Frakkin' Caprican in a Tauron body.

621
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,985
<i>- No, I talked to her.
- You did?</i>

622
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:19,847
<i>When?</i>

623
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:21,020
Again?

624
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:22,968
Weren't you watching this earlier?

625
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,537
<i>After she died, I...</i>

626
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,382
<i>I created a virtual version of her,</i>

627
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:28,662
<i>an avatar.</i>

628
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,253
Yeah, well, I like it.

629
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:33,523
Seems like every time this family's
on TV, I get so much out of it.

630
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:37,267
<i>I just wanted to hear
the sound of her voice again.</i>

631
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,723
Feeling better?

632
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:48,403
Yeah, I'm fine.

633
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:51,084
I guess people are just...

634
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,516
really scared and angry right now.

635
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:01,486
I don't blame them.

636
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:03,440
I think from now on,

637
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:06,165
we both need to be
a little more careful.

638
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:11,354
So you made an avatar of Zoe.

639
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:14,224
It was nothing.
You know how it works.

640
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,182
It's just a picture of her,
nothing more.

641
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:25,642
I know how an avatar works,

642
00:41:26,722 --> 00:41:27,818
and so do you.

643
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:33,372
Why did you do it?

644
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:42,934
Why didn't you tell me?

645
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:04,470
I didn't know it got that bad.

646
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:05,529
I mean...

647
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:09,178
- You could have talked to me.
- I know. I just...

648
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:15,165
I miss her...

649
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:18,379
You know?

650
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,633
Yeah, I know.

651
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:23,588
I just miss her.

652
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:31,680
I miss her too.

653
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:38,469
I really...

654
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:39,906
I really do.

655
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:46,730
Want to watch TV?

656
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:54,468
Graystones are on Sarno tonight.

657
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:59,910
- I heard they were really good.
- I am so sick of them.

658
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:01,845
They're everywhere.

659
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:03,636
- Awful.
- Rich.

660
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:06,708
- Disgusting.
- Ridiculous people.
