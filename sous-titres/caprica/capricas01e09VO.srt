1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,800
<i>Previously on Caprica...</i>

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,500
We're racing to the military deadline,
if I miss it, I may lose my company.

3
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:09,770
You know we have
a critical deadline to meet

4
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,906
and only one working robot.

5
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:14,809
It might be good
if you were a bit more focused.

6
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:16,577
Yeah, yes... Yes, sir.

7
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,981
Vergis told me something
awful about Daniel.

8
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,382
I don't know if it's true.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,651
Two of my employees
were murdered.

10
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,819
The thieves took

11
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:27,321
A sophisticated
military computer chip.

12
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:28,990
Are you trying to say
that my husband

13
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,892
Killed those people?

14
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,994
My daughter's alive
in v-world,

15
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,829
But I need a guide
to find her.

16
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:36,397
Who are you?

17
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:37,532
I go by emmanuelle.

18
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,634
Heracles said you were
easy to find...

19
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,003
Look for the cube
wandering all alone.

20
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,006
All right,
start guiding.

21
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,608
I'm being challenged
for the leadership of the S.T.O.

22
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,744
by Barnabas.

23
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:51,512
If the leadership
on gemonon

24
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,015
Thinks we can't control
our own S.T.O. cell...

25
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:55,416
Then trying
to get our hands

26
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,652
On Zoe's apotheosis
program is pointless.

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,587
A group known
as soldiers of the one

28
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:02,557
Is responsible
for the bombing.

29
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,759
Look at the way
the bike chain is drawn.

30
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:06,294
It's Barnabas calling
for a meeting.

31
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,629
I have to get Zoe's
robot to Gemenon.

32
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:11,766
She says it's critical,
but I don't know why.

33
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,302
What is it exactly
that you need from me?

34
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,337
You got some, uh, cargo you want
to move off-world, what?

35
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,372
I can't believe that
Barnabas won't help me.

36
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,641
He won't help you
unless you're S.T.O.

37
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,976
I'll become S.T.O.

38
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:24,512
I exist inside a robot.

39
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,282
Only my best friend,
Lacy, knows.

40
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,251
My part of the plan
is getting the robot

41
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,820
Out of Daniel's lab.

42
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:35,723
- I'm Rachel from... v-match.
- Oh, hey. Hey, hi.

43
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,426
I thought looking like
the most hated girl

44
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,760
In the twelve worlds

45
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:44,465
Woutd keep all the pervs
away from me in the v-club.

46
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:47,468
I already have another date
with cute lab boy.

47
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:51,405
See, my point is

48
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:55,543
That a robot could benefit
from being in the real world.

49
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,878
You know,
let it out, explore.

50
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:00,848
- Get it out of the lab.
- No, no, no!

51
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,369
Graystone stock
has dropped 37%,

52
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,438
Causing many to speculate that
he will have to sell assets,

53
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:26,440
Perhaps even the c-bucs.

54
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:29,877
The caprican red-tailed raptor
has a larger wingspan

55
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:31,545
And is primarily
a night hunter.

56
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:34,415
Look, I know people
don't always present themselves

57
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:35,916
Accurately in v-world,

58
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,918
But Rachel's already admitted
that she tweaked her avatar

59
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:40,454
to look like someone else.

60
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:43,524
Who?

61
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:45,326
Zoe Graystone.

62
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,296
Okay.

63
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,766
Come on, aren't you
a little curious

64
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,434
Why she won't let you
see her in person?

65
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:54,769
She will when she's ready.

66
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,671
And by then, it won't matter
what she looks like,

67
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,606
Only how we feel
about each other.

68
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:01,208
You're a better man
than I am, Philomon.

69
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:14,422
It's another
motor-control glitch.

70
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,463
And you know you're not
supposed to be smoking in here.

71
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:24,532
Sorry.

72
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,801
It's been
like that for days.

73
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:28,569
Must be those
misterioso tests

74
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,337
Graystone put it
through last week.

75
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:31,672
Yeah.

76
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:40,481
Poor girl
hasn't been the same since.

77
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,117
It's okay.

78
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:47,121
I'm gonna take
good care of you.

79
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:09,677
They need an answer now.

80
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:12,279
How much time
will this buy me?

81
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:14,115
A month maybe.

82
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:16,183
But Philo has a new idea
about how we can...

83
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:17,585
I don't...I don't need
to know the details.

84
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:19,720
Just tell me
we can pull this off,

85
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:20,888
Make the military's deadline

86
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:24,158
Of 100,000 robots
by next month.

87
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:27,361
With this,
we have a fighting chance.

88
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,131
Sell the team,
and you might save the company.

89
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:39,573
All right.

90
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,175
Tell Vergis...

91
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:44,145
I'll sell him the team.

92
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:04,832
Where the frak
is that ship?

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,467
I don't know.

94
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:11,505
It was all set up.
It should be here.

95
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:15,042
Well, it's not frakkin' here,
so what does that tell you?

96
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:30,991
Well...

97
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,497
Hello, Barnabas.

98
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:38,265
Hello, Willow.

99
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,600
What news?

100
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,769
The arms shipment
you've all been waiting for,

101
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:44,605
You can forget about.

102
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:46,273
I've told your contacts

103
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:48,509
That you no longer have
the S.T.O.'s sanction.

104
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,512
Really, flower?

105
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,647
Did that all on your own?

106
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:56,283
It's kind of cheeky.

107
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:04,391
You reached out
to other cells.

108
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,861
While I've been trying
to get everyone to lie low,

109
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:09,129
you've been trying to
build a power base.

110
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:13,434
Wow, I am a bother.

111
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,270
What are you gonna
do with me?

112
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:18,839
You gonna run off to
S.T.O. central on Gemenon

113
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,574
and tell on me?

114
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:25,412
Look, Clarice,

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,782
sister, the leaders
like action,

116
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,685
Not crazy plans that make you
into a bouncer

117
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:34,488
in some homemade heaven.

118
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:38,459
Think God's gonna pick out
the chosen ones when they die?

119
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:39,727
Do you think you'd be saved?

120
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:41,528
Do you want to find
out right now?

121
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:42,763
You'd die too.

122
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:54,808
You're a little boy,
Barnabas.

123
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:57,311
You need to toe the line,

124
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:00,414
otherwise someone's
gonna get hurt.

152
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,503
Hey, Clarice,
how are you?

153
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:33,107
Um, well, I'm just packing
up a few things.

154
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,642
- I'm off to Gemenon.
- You're going Gemenon?

155
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,945
Yes, it's... It's just
a little business trip.

156
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,580
What's up?

157
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:43,951
I've been in my room
for the last few days.

158
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,586
What about Daniel?

159
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,588
What about Daniel?

160
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,523
Have you thought
about talking to him about this?

161
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:50,924
You know,
maybe you should.

162
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:53,127
That would
have to work both ways,

163
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,396
Wouldn't it?

164
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:57,564
Oh, he's got secrets too,
has he?

165
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:00,534
We're gonna have
dinner tonight.

166
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:04,605
I really think that
you should talk to him, okay?

167
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,774
It's gonna be
all right, amanda.

168
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,042
Have a good trip.

169
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,877
Take care.

170
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,528
Heavenly father,
grant us the strength

171
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,864
To fight those
who have become blind

172
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:32,933
To the path
of righteousness.

173
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:36,537
In the name of the one,
we cast out the many.

174
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,673
So say we all.

175
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,875
So say we all.

176
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:44,912
Now it would be great
if you guys weren't here.

177
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,849
You too, keon

178
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,351
Lacy, stay.

179
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,697
Come over here.

180
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:06,500
I got something
I want to show you.

181
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,043
This big enough to hold

182
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,512
Whatever you're hoping
to ship to Gemenon?

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,048
Yeah.
That'll work.

184
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:24,985
Look at the tag.

185
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:27,721
It's a green tag.
What does that mean?

186
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:31,058
It means it's cleared customs
all the way through Gemenon...

187
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,660
Exempt from inspections too.

188
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:38,932
That's great.
Thank you.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,934
You're welcome.

190
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:44,204
Now, you can't go
for a week or so.

191
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,006
Gdd's raised the alert level,

192
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:48,876
Which means even a greeny
can't get you out right now.

193
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,845
But that'll, uh,
give you a chance

194
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,714
To really show me
your gratitude.

195
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:01,388
Okay.

196
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:04,424
How?

197
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:08,095
I have a small task
for you...

198
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:10,130
A small but important task.

199
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:14,935
Are you ready
to serve our cause?

200
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,570
Yes, I am.

201
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,713
Clarice Willow.

202
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:28,715
Clarice?
Sister Clarice?

203
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,050
Yeah.

204
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:32,186
What about her?

205
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:36,456
I want you to replace the fob
on her car keys with this.

206
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,592
It matches the make and model
of her car.

207
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:46,500
But why do you want
to track her?

208
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,602
I guess I'm not supposed
to ask why.

209
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,437
You guessed right.

210
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:51,872
I'm not...

211
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,575
Will you...

212
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,376
Do this?

213
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:02,416
I will.

214
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,618
Welcome to my cell.

215
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:18,323
Yusuf...

216
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:19,724
Yusuf...

217
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,894
- It's disgusting.
- He's sick.

218
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:25,564
I don't even recognize
him anymore.

219
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,832
He needs comfort food.

220
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:27,966
He needs rehab.

221
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,801
Go out and get
some organ meats.

222
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:31,336
What... how's that
gonna help any?

223
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:32,537
He's going to come
out of this,

224
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:34,539
and he is going to
need his strength.

225
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,408
I should just rip this thing
off his head.

226
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:37,709
No, you know
you can't do that.

227
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,346
He needs good tauron stuff.

228
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:42,948
Now go.

229
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,784
Just look after him, okay?

230
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:56,862
This is stellar.

231
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,831
I'm glad you could come out
and get a minute to come here.

232
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,668
Well, for you,
I'd skip lunch every day.

233
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,938
I'd get all scrawny,
but beauty of v-world...

234
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,241
You wouldn't have to know.

235
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,879
I bet you wonder what
I really look like, don't you?

236
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:16,414
Nope.

237
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,983
It doesn't matter.

238
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,521
I like you no matter what,
because I love your brain.

239
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:24,022
You are such a liar.

240
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,825
No, I'm serious.

241
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,393
You're the smartest
person I know,

242
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,028
and that's...

243
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,664
That's, like,
the most beautiful thing.

244
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:36,434
Remember what you were saying
about generative processes?

245
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,502
Genius.

246
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,905
It helped me
a lot at work.

247
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:43,275
Yeah, I just meant
that if your robot...

248
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,278
Could learn more if it was
exposed to more environments.

249
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,846
Well,
you're probably right.

250
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:50,482
But I don't think
anyone's gonna let me take it

251
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,017
Out for a walk.

252
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:55,353
In fact, if this thing
I'm trying now doesn't work out,

253
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:59,291
I'm not really sure
what's gonna happen to it.

254
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,033
Oh, I smudged your glasses.

255
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,803
And I'm furious about it.

256
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,086
Barnabas, it's Lacy.

257
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:36,588
It's done.

258
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,357
Good girl.

259
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,359
Daniel,
colonel Sasha Patel

260
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:44,362
from military procurement
to see you.

261
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:48,800
And here is where
it all began.

262
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:50,435
The holoband and the mcp?

263
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:52,671
Uh, no, but,
actually, this is where

264
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:54,372
I first integrated the
chip with the chassis

265
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,675
and the u-87 became active.

266
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,276
Remarkable.

267
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:59,577
I guess you could almost say

268
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,746
This is the birthplace
of artificial life.

269
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:03,715
Almost.

270
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,784
And that life
continues to mature.

271
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:08,653
We've made remarkable strides
with the prototype.

272
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:13,391
It exceeds the contract's specs
in every performance category.

273
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,462
It's a remarkable piece
of hardware, dr. Graystone.

274
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,930
- Thank you... Daniel, please.
- Oh, Daniel!

275
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:22,367
Call me Daniel.

276
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:25,537
The problem is
you still just have one.

277
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,406
Well, that's because we
decided to optimize the chip

278
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:29,974
Before we copied it
and integrated it

279
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,076
Into other robots.

280
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,510
I assure you
we are right on schedule

281
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:33,745
For our delivery date
next month...

282
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:36,314
100,000 robots,
as promised.

283
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:41,419
I suppose we should have
anticipated this.

284
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,688
Anticipated what?

285
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,291
The difficulties
of reverse engineering

286
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,026
Stolen technology.

287
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:52,363
I don't know where you get
your information, colonel,

288
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:53,498
- But I assure you...
- Please.

289
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:54,666
That's not what happened.

290
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:55,734
Defense may have turned
a blind eye,

291
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,968
But down in procurement,

292
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:58,970
We knew what
we were getting into.

293
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,574
The problem is the potential
for political embarrassment

294
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:06,010
Increases the longer this thing
drags on without results.

295
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:09,614
So we're moving your
deadline up to the 7th.

296
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:13,952
That's next week.

297
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,387
Well, I think
we both know

298
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:19,290
that if you can't
get it done by then,

299
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,326
you just can't do it...

300
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,594
Daniel.

301
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:29,718
<i>Sk-1 to control,
we're losing our visual...</i>

302
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:31,987
<i>Heavy natural cover.</i>

303
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,575
I knew if I left it
on long enough,

304
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:54,709
you'd come check it out...

305
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,177
Like a kitten
and a laser pointer.

306
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:57,545
Get out of my house!

307
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:58,647
Not really yours, is it?

308
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,548
It's a virtual, like you.

309
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:03,084
Nothing's real here,
not even my pretty face.

310
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,285
What is that doing here?
Who are you?

311
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,322
Relax. I'm a friend
of your father's.

312
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,124
He's been in here
looking for you.

313
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,992
Did you know that?

314
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,335
And what do you care?

315
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:24,506
I need you to help me
with him.

316
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,741
At first, I thought
it might be better

317
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,677
To let him find you,

318
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:31,346
But this is not better.

319
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,516
I don't believe you.

320
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,686
It's true.

321
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:41,723
He missed
his own son's ink day.

322
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,692
He's using amp.

323
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,661
He's lost.

324
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:49,097
Tamara, he needs your help.

325
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,202
Well, he's real.

326
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,570
I'm a ghost.

327
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,043
What do you think
we can do to help him?

328
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,351
Since we know
that our problem's

329
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,189
Replicating the mcp stem from
these, generative anomalies

330
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,492
in the chip's code,
I started thinking

331
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,627
about building
a kind of,

332
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:23,698
psych profile
for the u-87.

333
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,867
It may take a couple of weeks...

334
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:28,436
But we could use it
to, uh, tag and preserve...

335
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,138
Psych profile.

336
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,807
Yeah, all the anomalies
allowing us

337
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,676
To create a clean copy
of the chip

338
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,644
That we could use as a template
to mass-produce it.

339
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,480
No, no, let me tell you
what we're going to do.

340
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:39,814
We're going to treat
those anomalies of yours

341
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:40,982
Like a cancer.

342
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,551
We'll irradiate the chip
and burn them off.

343
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,453
And then
we'll take the original mcp

344
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:46,821
And use that as a template

345
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,258
And start cranking out
new copies tomorrow, all right?

346
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:53,528
But we'd be destroying
the original in the process,

347
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:57,565
Along with everything that makes
this prototype distinctive,

348
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,201
Everything that...
that makes it...

349
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,569
What, unique?

350
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,838
A nifty poker player?

351
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:05,306
Sweet aphrodite,
I don't know why

352
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:07,375
I've put up
with your crap for so long.

353
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,410
It is a robot, doctor.

354
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,113
It's not a pet, and it's
definitely not a person.

355
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:13,414
It's a robot.

356
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,816
It's no different
than your fancy cell phone.

357
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:16,584
And right now
I don't need a cell phone

358
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,186
That will check my mail
and wipe my ass!

359
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,855
I need a cell phone
that works!

360
00:21:20,923 --> 00:21:22,857
Now, if you want a job
to come back to tomorrow,

361
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:26,728
You will burn
the chip clean, understood?

362
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:28,463
Yes, sir.

363
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,331
Thank you.

364
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:39,808
No, tonight.

365
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,743
Philo's unlocking the
door at 10:00 tonight,

366
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,611
And he's expecting
to see me...

367
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,580
Well, Rachel... For the
robot-watching tour.

368
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:47,749
But it's not gonna be me.
It's gonna me u.

369
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:48,917
And you're gonna tell him

370
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,251
That this is
what you really look like

371
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,286
And blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

372
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,687
It can't be tonight.

373
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:53,988
And then you know what?
You're gonna stun-gun him.

374
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:55,824
But please be gentle,
all right?

375
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:57,458
Because he's really
a good boy.

376
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,561
And then you're gonna
load me into the box...

377
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:00,695
And we can do that.

378
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:02,430
We just have to wait,
that's all...

379
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:03,832
A week probably.

380
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:06,701
I don't have a week.

381
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:08,069
I don't have a day.

382
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:09,971
Damn it, Lacy, I knew you'd
be frakking something up!

383
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,706
There's nothing I can do!

384
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,341
You're doing the same thing
that you did to original Zoe!

385
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:14,542
That's not fair!

386
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,244
No, you know what?
Guess what?

387
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:18,847
They're gonna make
copies of my chip, Lace.

388
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,181
And the way they do that

389
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:22,717
Is they have to destroy
the original, which is me, okay?

390
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:25,286
They're not doing it later.
They're doing it now.

391
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:26,988
And maybe that isn't even
real to you

392
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:29,324
Because I don't even
seem real to you.

393
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,426
But I am.
Inside of here, I am real.

394
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:33,461
I know.
I know that.

395
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,964
They're pulling me back
in the robot, Lacy.

396
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:37,699
Please, don't let it
happen to me!

397
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:39,968
Zoe!

398
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,337
Zoe, I'm sorry!

399
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:48,970
Don't you look nice?

400
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,606
I thought
we were going out.

401
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,342
My love, why go out
when we can put

402
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,414
Some of my little-used
culinary skills to work?

403
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,450
Here...

404
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,585
Sit.

405
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:19,534
Almost.

406
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:23,705
I had to make
some hard choices today,

407
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,975
Choices I probably should have
made a long time ago.

408
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:30,378
Now, I finally feel like things

409
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:33,114
Are getting
on the right track.

410
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:40,188
Do you remember how I...

411
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:43,458
Was when we first met?

412
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,494
Oh, a little...

413
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:48,196
A little wild.

414
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:51,799
A little crazy, actually.

415
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:57,672
But it was hard
to be crazy around you.

416
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,542
Somehow you repelled it.

417
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,246
You were always so sane.

418
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:08,516
I could always count on you
to be you.

419
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:13,187
Well, I find it hard
to be anyone else, really.

420
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,801
Daniel, Vergis told me
that you stole his chip

421
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,237
- and killed two of his employees.
- I'm sorry...

422
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:31,839
Vergis told you...?

423
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,408
What?

424
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:36,911
When did he tell you?
Where was I?

425
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:40,481
You were out.
He came by.

426
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,316
Here?

427
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:44,519
Yes.

428
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,422
The stones on that guy.

429
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:52,126
Tell me it isn't true.

430
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:02,370
Well...

431
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:04,639
It's...

432
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,607
It's complicated.

433
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,677
Hello?

434
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:54,155
I was told
to come here.

435
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:05,800
I hear you.

436
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,303
Who's there?

437
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:14,542
Step into the light.

438
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,544
Daddy.

439
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:17,979
Tammy.

440
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:22,517
It's you.

441
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:24,185
Oh, by.

442
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:28,456
Oh, thank the gods!

443
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,691
Thank Jupiter.
I prayed.

444
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,127
Dad...

445
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:36,297
I don't want you
following me anymore.

446
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,765
This place is bad for you.

447
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,200
No, baby,
I just found you.

448
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:41,169
You're killing yourself
with that stuff.

449
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,204
What, the amp?

450
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:45,907
- Okay, no more.
- You're wasting your life.

451
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,909
I don't want you
watching me,

452
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,311
because if
that's all you do,

453
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,413
that's all you'll ever do.

454
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:55,683
- Baby.
- I'm sorry.

455
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,585
Tammy.

456
00:27:57,653 --> 00:27:59,520
No!

457
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:02,190
No.

458
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,081
I love you, dad.

459
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,567
Hey.

460
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:49,070
She's gone.

461
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,240
It's okay.

462
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,709
She's really gone.

463
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:58,412
Come here.

464
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,715
It's okay.

465
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,150
It's okay.

466
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:20,468
I'm really sorry
about this.

467
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:23,838
Look, I know you can't
understand what I'm saying.

468
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:28,309
Like dr. Graystone says...

469
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:31,812
You're not really a person.

470
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,749
Stop.
Please.

471
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,252
Philo, it's me,
the robot.

472
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,422
And I'm Rachel too.

473
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,224
You said you didn't really
care what I looked like

474
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,493
In the real world.

475
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,867
I'm not really a robot, okay?
I'm not just a robot.

476
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:56,437
I'm Zoe Graystone,
and I am trapped in here.

477
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,540
My father put me in this body
after I died, okay?

478
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:00,775
- Help! Help! Dr. Graystone!
- And I can get to Gemenon

479
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,209
If you help me.

480
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:04,512
Philo, don't do this
right now, okay?

481
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,714
Help me!

482
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:08,249
I need to escape.

483
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,550
My friend let me down,

484
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,719
and my father tried
to hurt me, okay?

485
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:15,623
You're the only one
that cares about me right now.

486
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:17,792
Please...

487
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,829
I need you.

488
00:30:31,573 --> 00:30:35,409
I told you it didn't matter
what you looked like...

489
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:40,081
And it doesn't.

490
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:46,120
Thank you.

491
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,458
Take me to the truck.

492
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:53,394
Stash me there until they
open the ports back up again

493
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:56,764
And put me in a box
and ship me to Gemenon.

494
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:58,566
There are people there

495
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,369
That know what my purpose
really is, okay?

496
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,571
Okay.

497
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:12,780
No!

498
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,888
You have no idea
what it means

499
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,691
to build something or to
work hard for anything!

500
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,793
It's all just been
handed to you, Zoe!

501
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:17,976
Military says it's about
200 klicks northwest of here.

502
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:20,011
They're setting up
a roadblock now.

503
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,779
Poor kid.

504
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:23,948
It's designed
to defend itself.

505
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:26,784
Whatever Philomon was doing,
it must have perceived a threat.

506
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:28,086
I always knew
it had sentience.

507
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:31,489
It doesn't... It doesn't
mean anything else.

508
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:33,024
What else would it mean?

509
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:35,560
Just make sure none of
those trigger-happy grunts

510
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:37,128
cut loose on it,
all right?

511
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:39,764
We need it back
in one piece.

512
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:42,934
What?

513
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:48,273
What?

514
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,874
They're saying
this incident proves

515
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:51,876
We've lost control
of the project.

516
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:53,378
I'm not sure
we're getting it back.

517
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,947
Who is saying that?

518
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,916
It's coming
from the top brass.

519
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:11,796
If they had any idea...

520
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:15,500
What this chip has cost me.

521
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:18,903
You don't like me
much, Sasha.

522
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:20,838
But you're willing
to break bread with me

523
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:23,308
If it serves your purpose.

524
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,977
Thank you for a lovely
evening, Mr. Vergis.

525
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,546
Wow, even a tauron
gets fancy thank-yous

526
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:31,549
when he promises
robots that work

527
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:33,551
and a share of
civilian applications.

528
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:36,087
You get the company,
you get the contract...

529
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:38,489
Guaranteed.

530
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,291
Uh, sure I can't drop you?

531
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,927
No, thanks.

532
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:45,997
- Protect yourself.
- Oh, why, thank you.

533
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,533
Good evening, Tomas.

534
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,868
Good evening.

535
00:34:58,303 --> 00:34:59,804
I took you
out of a virtual playground

536
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:03,975
And brought you
into the real world!

537
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:06,911
But I guess
you couldn't handle it, huh?

538
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:11,049
It's not a pet, and it's
definitely not a person.

539
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:13,217
Oh, God!

540
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:15,286
Zoe! Zoe!

541
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:19,223
I'm sorry!

542
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:36,507
Barnabas,
I can't wait any longer.

543
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:39,343
- I've got to go now!
- Lacy, you shouldn't be here.

544
00:35:39,411 --> 00:35:41,412
No, let her stay.

545
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,815
- Barnabas.
- She wanted to serve the cause.

546
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:47,418
Let her see how well
she served it.

547
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:48,986
How is the sister?

548
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:51,889
Approaching a light
on state and harbor.

549
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:53,424
They must be headed
to the spaceport

550
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,560
For their little flight
to Gemenon.

551
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:58,329
Ah, well, it's gonna be
a shorter trip

552
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,797
Than she realizes.

553
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:03,101
- You put a bomb in her car.
- No...

554
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:06,404
You did, actually.

555
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:10,007
Sorry about the seats.

556
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:11,542
I mean, we were lucky
to get a flight.

557
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,578
The gdd alert,
you know...

558
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:16,547
Everything's booked.

559
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:18,449
The key's the key, Lacy.

560
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:21,119
It now contains
a digital relay

561
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:22,720
Linked to a cell number.

562
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,156
A phone call
will cause it to detonate

563
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,960
A very large bomb
in the trunk.

564
00:36:29,027 --> 00:36:31,229
They'll probably decide
she was a terrorist...

565
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:34,198
Back when she was in one
piece instead of, you know,

566
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:37,735
Thin jelly.

567
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:40,371
Your boyfriend designed it.

568
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:43,941
He's a young man
of many useful talents.

569
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:45,843
So...

570
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,279
This is what
the S.T.O. wanted...

571
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:49,480
To kill sister Clarice.

572
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:52,483
No, it's what I wanted.

573
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:56,721
But as far as you're concerned,
I am the S.T.O. leadership.

574
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:05,096
Then you both used me.

575
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,001
Welcome to the
deep end, little one.

576
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:13,171
It's always deeper
than you think.

577
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,900
<i>Sk-1 to control,</i>

578
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:10,835
<i>suspect vehicle is headed
right for the roadblock.</i>

579
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:12,203
<i>Copy, Sk-1.</i>

580
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,404
<i>Alpha company,</i>

581
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:15,640
<i>Van now four klicks
from your position,</i>

582
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,642
<i>approaching at high speed.</i>

583
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,378
<i>Use of force authorized
to disable vehicle only.</i>

584
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:23,381
<i>Do not harm the prototype.</i>

585
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:25,550
<i>Roger that.</i>

586
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:32,490
Nice and tight!

587
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:34,492
Okay, good.

588
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:38,696
Alpha company
in position.

589
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:40,031
Ready.

590
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:45,436
What is it?

591
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,837
I've lost the gps signal.

592
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:49,640
I can't get any input
from the stoplight cameras.

593
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,208
Frakkin' technology.

594
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:52,677
Place is gonna be jammed

595
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:54,812
With people trying
to get off-world.

596
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,280
I don't care.

597
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:58,649
I just want to shut
that little bastard down.

598
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:02,053
I just hope we get the sanction
to terminate him personally.

599
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:16,701
Hold your fire!

600
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,569
This is alpha company.
We have contact.

601
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:24,241
Hold position!

602
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,746
Should we approach?

603
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:30,548
Negative, negative.
No movement.

604
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:36,320
Got it.

605
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:39,523
Oh, the pantheon bridge.

606
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:42,593
There they are.

607
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:43,861
Gotcha.

608
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,835
Keon...

609
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,770
You don't have to do this.

610
00:39:58,343 --> 00:40:00,778
It's okay.

611
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,283
This is your moment.

612
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,160
You want to be a terrorist?

613
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:23,567
Let's see some terror.

614
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:28,706
Do it...

615
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:32,476
Or you can forget about getting
your shipment to Gemenon.

616
00:40:32,544 --> 00:40:35,780
In fact, you can forget
about the rest of your life,

617
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:39,150
'cause it'll end
right here...

618
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,623
Along with his.

619
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:47,591
Yeah?

620
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:56,767
Someone is gonna die today,
little girl.

621
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:01,172
You choose.

622
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:10,514
Oh, my God!

623
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:15,820
<i>Two of my employees
were murdered.</i>

624
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,188
<i>It's complicated.</i>

625
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,290
<i>Seeing my dead
brother... Dead brother.</i>

626
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:22,460
<i>I lost my mind.</i>

627
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,095
<i>It's complicated.</i>

628
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:46,684
Take cover!

629
00:41:55,627 --> 00:41:57,528
Move!

630
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:11,809
Oh, my God!

631
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,511
Kaboom.
