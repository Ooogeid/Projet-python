00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,121
Man: Come on!

3
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:19,889
Is she there?

4
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,129
Right down in front.

5
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:27,232
It's not their fault,
you know. They just...

6
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:28,671
they don't know what they're doing.

7
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,004
Guys, we should leave
before we get caught.

8
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,707
It's happening.

9
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:40,849
Don't they ever get tired
of this? It's so sick.

10
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,319
Don't worry, this will all change.

11
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,751
And she's gonna help change it.

12
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,188
- Man 1: Come on! Do it!
- Man 2: Do it! Come on!

13
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,285
Man 3: Yeah. Come on.

14
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:51,488
Woman: Go, Lindsay!

15
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,972
All: Kill! Kill! Kill!

16
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,973
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

17
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,906
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

18
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:54,682
Damn it! What happened?

19
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,991
She derezzed. She
flipped out or something.

20
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,797
She must've defaulted
back to the last copy.

21
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:03,300
I guess she's not as strong as you yet.

22
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,562
I have faith in you.

23
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,071
She'll be perfect,

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,964
'cause you're perfect.

25
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,154
Graystone. What a surprise.

26
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,259
Go frak yourself, Caston.

27
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,329
Are you okay?

28
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,528
Yeah.

29
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,227
Anything happen after I left?

30
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,499
Some more blood and guts.

31
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,336
I logged off a couple
of minutes after you.

32
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,934
So, did you check on our
girl after she disappeared?

33
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,946
No. Frakkers confiscated my holoband.

34
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,379
I can access her from home.

35
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:51,677
From home?

36
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,684
We're not splitting for
Gemenon until tomorrow.

37
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,310
There'll be plenty of time for tweakage.

38
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,718
Ben: But, Zoe...

39
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:58,050
No buts.

40
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,282
Not ever.

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,152
For the one true God knows
all and directs us all.

42
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,759
So say we all.

43
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:17,473
Out! What?

44
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,436
It was as out as can be.

45
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:21,444
Do we need to turn on the line sensors?

46
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:23,640
That's exactly what we're
going to do, cheater-girl.

47
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:24,739
Serge. Serge: Yes, sir.

48
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,340
Activate the line sensors, please.

49
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,680
And the auto-umpire.

50
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:28,776
Serge: Of course, Amanda.

51
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,048
Come on, miss cheater.

52
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:32,112
Honey, don't go all immature on me

53
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,021
just 'cause you know
I'm better than you.

54
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,720
What's that, cheater? Sorry,
I can't hear you, cheater.

55
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,730
Gods! If only the worlds
knew what a baby you are.

56
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,426
Serge: Excuse me, Daniel.

57
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,894
There's an urgent
message for you and Amanda

58
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,598
from the athenian academy regarding Zoe.

59
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:49,967
Here we go again.

60
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,269
Let's not prejudge this.

61
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:53,037
We don't even know what
we're dealing with yet.

62
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,106
Amanda: Holobands at school?

63
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:58,775
- Cutting class? Defiance!
- Daniel: Let's all just take a deep breath, here.

64
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,874
Zoe: Guess you better lock me up, huh?

65
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,043
Daniel: Now what did I just say, honey?

66
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,381
Amanda: You think that's funny, do you?

67
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:04,115
Well, maybe you'll think this is funny.

68
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,124
No car privileges, no phone, no holoband

69
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,318
and you're grounded for a month.

70
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,885
Hey, hey, hey. Come
on, now. Can we just...

71
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:15,797
We got a big day tomorrow.
Z, your building, remember?

72
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:16,891
Oh!

73
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,459
Daddy, I'm sorry, I can't
go. See, I'm grounded.

74
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,199
Well, we're going to make an exception.

75
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:22,900
It's not every day you get
a building named after you.

76
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,703
Well, there's something
to be excited about.

77
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,937
Having your name on the side
of the new computer-science wing

78
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:29,879
at Apollo university 'cause your
daddy donated about a billion cubits

79
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:30,972
to the alumnI fund.

80
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:32,073
You're on thin ice already, little girl.

81
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,744
Come on, like I even want to be associated
with you and the filthy science...

82
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,287
Hey, that dirty science put a
roof over your head, young lady.

83
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:38,686
That's enough!

84
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:39,849
You are so lucky,

85
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:43,053
and you have everything in the
worlds that you could possibly want,

86
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:45,392
and all you do is
complain about this family.

87
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:48,556
You have no idea what it
means to build something

88
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,498
or to work hard for anything.

89
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,662
It's all just been handed to you, Zoe.

90
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:56,263
I guess I'll have to learn
how to marry into money.

91
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:04,181
You are gonna regret that
for the rest of your life.

92
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,463
I can't believe I did that.

93
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:27,734
Well, I think it's okay. She
knows that you didn't mean it.

94
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:30,862
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:31,997
No worries.

96
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,473
I just couldn't.

97
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,603
When he pulled out that
knife and started to...

98
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:37,407
Hey. Relax.

99
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,480
Why do they think watching
something like that

100
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:44,543
is fun?

101
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,746
Because they're asleep.

102
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:48,153
No, that's too easy an answer.

103
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:52,392
I saw their faces. They definitely
knew what they were doing.

104
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,026
And they loved it.

105
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,027
You sound just like me.

106
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,726
Gee, I wonder why.

107
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:01,295
So now what?

108
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:05,198
Now, we have to make sure that
you don't derez on us again.

109
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:09,142
I thought I'd solved that in the
fai l-safe protocol, but clearly not.

110
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,538
Just don't make me
go back in there again

111
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,410
and you won't have to worry about it.

112
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,239
It really got to you, didn't it?

113
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:16,443
Yeah.

114
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:19,854
I mean, I knew that wasn't real.

115
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:21,184
Nothing in here is real.

116
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:25,018
It was the way that
people were watching,

117
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:28,654
the way they Drew strength
from what was happening.

118
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:31,199
It's all right. It's all right.

119
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,199
I won't make you go back there.

120
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,598
People are really like that?

121
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,271
I mean, on the outside, are they really?

122
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,906
Some. But that's all gonna change.

123
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:48,182
And you're gonna help bring that change.

124
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,030
I thought the whole
idea was to travel light.

125
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:42,263
Yeah, well.

126
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:51,435
Zoe: Do you have the passports?

127
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:52,502
Uh...

128
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,076
Yeah.

129
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:59,486
Hey, just checking on your ETA tonight.

130
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,817
Joseph: I'm thinking about 7.00.

131
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,083
You always say that.

132
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,015
Oh, it shouldn't be
much later than that.

133
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,684
The party starts at 7.30.

134
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:06,819
I know. I know.

135
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:08,123
Hi, dad?

136
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:10,222
You can't be late. It's his birthday.

137
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,460
Do you want to put willie in
therapy for the rest of his life?

138
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,627
All right. Like I
told your mom, sweetie,

139
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:17,365
I'm headed to court and I should
be done no later than 7:00.

140
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,566
- No, daddy, no. That's unacceptable.
- That's the best I can do.

141
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,836
You need to promise me
you'll be there on time.

142
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,343
- Then you'll be there.
- Unacceptable?

143
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:25,035
- So do I hear a promise?
- All right.

144
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:27,308
All right, your honor. I promise.

145
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:29,584
Now, put your mother back on for me.

146
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,676
- Hey, we're getting on the lev.
- What?

147
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:32,811
Can't hear you. Talk to you at home.

148
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:33,912
No, no, wait a minute.

149
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:37,288
Sweetie, I want to tell
you something. I... hello?

150
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:40,188
Frak.

151
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,466
Zoe: Hurry up, Lace.

152
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:04,743
Come on, Lacy.

153
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,185
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:07,582
I can't!

155
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,182
Look, it's okay. I promise, okay?

156
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,624
They're gonna welcome us on Gemenon...

157
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,593
It's not like it is here on Caprica.

158
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:15,357
We'll have a whole new family.

159
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,164
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,006
I knew she'd back out.

161
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:39,048
She won't tell anyone
before we're off-world.

162
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,620
She won't.

163
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:43,855
Yeah. Whatever.

164
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,120
Relax.

165
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,223
You're more keyed up than I am.

166
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,030
- Tamara: Okay, remember that guy?
- Okay, yeah.

167
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:57,197
This little creep actually comes up to
me and is like, "she smells like a Tauron.

168
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,967
You can smell them the
second they walk into the room

169
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,338
'cause they're dirt eaters."

170
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:01,637
Shannon: I hope you walked away.

171
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,837
I did. After I kicked him in the balls.

172
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,311
Tamara, you didn't.

173
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:07,137
He deserved way worse.

174
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:23,965
Are you going to be like this
all the way to Gemenon, or what?

175
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,298
Ben?

176
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:28,329
Ben!

177
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,371
I'm sorry, zo.

178
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:33,432
It's God's will.

179
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:34,600
What?

180
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:37,303
No! Ben, wait!

181
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,142
The one true God shall
drive out the many.

182
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,029
Man: What happened?

183
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,726
In this senseless tragedy,

184
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:04,389
it's important that you know

185
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:08,765
that the government of Caprica
takes matters of terrorism seriously,

186
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:11,863
and that this case will be pursued

187
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,300
until justice is served.

188
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:16,902
Agent duram.

189
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,605
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

190
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,643
On behalf of the prime minister,
let me take this opportunity

191
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,186
to express your government's
deepest sympathy.

192
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:29,687
This is what we know.

193
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:33,158
A group known as soldiers of the
one is responsible for the bombing.

194
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:37,227
Now, while this organization has
been dormant for the past 10 years

195
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:40,028
and we still have a lot of
evidence to sift through,

196
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:42,996
everything points to their involvement.

197
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:44,798
Now, as I'm sure you all know,

198
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:49,002
the sto espouses a monotheistic
religious philosophy,

199
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,413
advocating the worship of a single,
all-knowing, all-powerful God.

200
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,222
Hey, you need a light?

201
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:09,353
Thank you.

202
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,598
I've never seen you smoke on tv.

203
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,538
No, well...

204
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:24,541
Company image and all that.

205
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,810
I quit a few years ago, actually.

206
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,543
Started up again last week.

207
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:34,151
Been trying to quit myself.

208
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:36,620
Joe Adams.

209
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,285
Daniel Graystone.

210
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,651
Oh, sorry.

211
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:40,955
Oh! No.

212
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:42,923
Gloves are symbolic.

213
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:47,226
They're to keep us away from
the world during mourning,

214
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,393
or something like that.

215
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,300
I don't even know why they
do it. It's an old custom.

216
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,168
Well, at times like these,

217
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,670
old ways are supposed to help, I guess.

218
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,146
I...

219
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,874
I lost my daughter.

220
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:09,414
Me, too. And my wife.

221
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,689
I could use a cup of coffee.

222
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,993
There's a coffee shop around the corner.

223
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,268
Clarice:Zoe walks with our
mother goddess Athena now, Lacy.

224
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:31,937
She will be cared for and loved
and cherished for all eternity.

225
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:36,682
It's not very comforting, is it?

226
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,275
Truth is, it doesn't
do much for me, either.

227
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,081
Zoe's gone.

228
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:45,354
And all the scriptures, all the prayers,

229
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,417
all the sacrifices
offered in the temples,

230
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:50,725
none of these are gonna bring
her back to us. Are they?

231
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,294
I am angry.

232
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:56,869
At the gods?

233
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:01,570
At whoever did this. It's not right.

234
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:02,870
No, it's not.

235
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:09,212
To be cut down when her life
was full of so much promise.

236
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,377
I should've been on that train.

237
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:14,580
No.

238
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,682
I should be with Zoe.

239
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:18,987
I should be dead.

240
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,185
No.

241
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,523
It wasn't your time.

242
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:25,929
The gods weren't ready
to call your spirit.

243
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,059
They have another purpose for you here.

244
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,227
Me?

245
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,767
Zoe was somebody special. A genius.

246
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,074
The things she could
do with a computer...

247
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,813
She just seemed gifted that way.

248
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:47,651
If you knew of any particular
work that Zoe was doing,

249
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,951
any work that you could find,

250
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:55,325
then perhaps that would be a way
for you to reconnect with her,

251
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:58,988
to find comfort in discovering
her in a different way.

252
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,596
Reconnect?

253
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:02,827
Mmm.

254
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,093
Serge: Amanda?

255
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:39,400
Yeah?

256
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,002
Lacy.

257
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:45,238
Hi, Dr. Graystone.

258
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:46,871
Are you all right?

259
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,073
Yeah.

260
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:51,343
I know this is gonna
sound kind of weird, but

261
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:56,589
I was just wondering if I could
sit in her room for a while.

262
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:04,061
Allow entry Lacy Rand.

263
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:05,359
Welcome, Lacy Rand.

264
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,225
Thank you.

265
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,667
Stay as long as you like.

266
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:53,069
Listen, I should be going.

267
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,244
Thanks for the coffee.

268
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,090
Are you okay?

269
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,963
Sorry. Yeah.

270
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,566
Sorry. No, no.

271
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:18,131
Hey, listen. I understand.

272
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:21,374
In about five seconds,

273
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,069
I'm jumping off a bridge myself.

274
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,684
I needed this, you know.

275
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:37,446
Daniel: Just to sit and smoke...

276
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:40,689
It's the easiest job I've had all day.

277
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:43,962
Can I offer you a ride home?

278
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,522
Uh, no, I live in the city.

279
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:50,065
Hey, do you follow pyramid at all?

280
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,766
I've been known to lay a
few cubits on the bucks,

281
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,365
much to my misfortune.

282
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,639
Yes, they have had better seasons,
but I've got courtside seats.

283
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,512
Any interest?

284
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:02,708
Uh...

285
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,684
Listen, I've got
an 11-year-old boy.

286
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:07,117
Is there any chance he could join us?

287
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:08,313
Absolutely.

288
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,222
Listen, this is my private number.

289
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:15,659
Why don't you give me a call, and
we'll set up the details, okay?

290
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:16,991
Thanks.

291
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:21,996
Sir.

292
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:14,245
Lacy?

293
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,287
Is that you?

294
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:20,921
Yeah.

295
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:24,224
I'm glad you're here.

296
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,797
Something terrible has happened,

297
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:30,860
hasn't it?

298
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:43,147
So I'm dead?

299
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,584
She's dead.

300
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:52,352
Yes.

301
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:56,587
Where did all this blood come from?

302
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,090
I don't see any wounds on your body.

303
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:04,836
I don't know.

304
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,000
Maybe the bombing.

305
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:09,668
The bombing?

306
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,339
But you weren't even there.

307
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:15,608
You couldn't have been there.

308
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:16,910
I know,

309
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,613
but still I felt it.

310
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:22,988
Zoe was working on a
biofeedback protocol.

311
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:25,590
She wanted me to feel what she felt

312
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:27,992
in real time.

313
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:32,665
She never got it working
exactly, but something happened.

314
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:35,531
It's like I felt her death.

315
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,135
Zoe is dead.

316
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,100
What happens to me?

317
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:45,605
She had some kind of plan for
you once we got to Gemenon,

318
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:48,180
but I don't even know what that was.

319
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,884
We're not going to
Gemenon anymore, are we?

320
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,654
No.

321
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:01,956
What am I without her?

322
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,326
She's me. I'm her.

323
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:09,802
I'm all that's left
of her. Help me, Lace.

324
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,464
Make me understand. What
am I supposed to do next?

325
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,674
I don't have the answers you want, okay?

326
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:19,872
I didn't even know for sure if you
were gonna still be here once Zoe died.

327
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,378
You're scared

328
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:23,141
of me.

329
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:26,848
- Why?
- I don't know you.

330
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,080
You grew up with me.

331
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:30,053
I grew up with Zoe Graystone.

332
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:33,934
You're something she
created. You're just a thing.

333
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:37,885
Zoe promised me I'd see
the real world one day.

334
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:41,415
And the crazy thing is,

335
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:46,028
I already knew what the
real world feels like.

336
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,532
I remember it,

337
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:52,061
just like I remember
growing up with you.

338
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:53,196
No.

339
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:56,400
It's true. I've never
been to your house,

340
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:00,537
never played in your room,

341
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,441
never put on your make-up,
or tried on your clothes.

342
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,335
I'm not a person.

343
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,568
I know that.

344
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,579
But I feel like one.

345
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,332
It's gonna be okay.

346
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,932
It's gonna be okay.

347
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,628
Somehow.

348
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,529
Somehow.

349
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,668
I promise.

350
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,303
I promise.

351
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,683
Lacy?

352
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,020
Dr. Graystone.

353
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,024
What... what are you doing?

354
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,187
I...

355
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,687
I... what?

356
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,697
I gotta go.

357
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,793
Lacy, why are you here?

358
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,896
How does the defendant plead?

359
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,468
Not guilty, your honor.

360
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,435
The clerk will set a date
for trial within the month.

361
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,237
Bail will be set at 10,000 cubits.

362
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,335
Your honor, the defendant
is a known member

363
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,277
of the ha'la'tha crime syndicate.

364
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:55,611
There is a serious
flight risk to Tauron.

365
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:58,311
The state strongly recommends
that bail be denied.

366
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:00,820
I thank the state for
its input. Ruling stands.

367
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:05,082
Ten thousand cubits for the
bail and 20,000 for the judge.

368
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:08,694
The Guatrau is very grateful
for the work you've done for him.

369
00:27:08,763 --> 00:27:11,755
He has pledged to help us find the
nothos that killed Shannon and Tamara.

370
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:14,494
Tell the Guatrau I said thanks, but no.

371
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,605
We're on Caprica now.

372
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:22,972
Caprica. What has this frakking
planet ever done for us?

373
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,169
I've got a deposition in an hour.

374
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,509
No, no, we cannot let this pass, Joseph.

375
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,138
We need to find them.

376
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:30,046
Let me grieve in my own way.

377
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,584
Whatever you say, my brother.

378
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,956
But I will pray to mars and all the
gods for a swift and terrible vengeance

379
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:43,519
to come to those who have torn your
wife and daughter from this world.

380
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,923
There are no gods, Sam.

381
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,473
Cyrus: Evaluation protocol 42.

382
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:09,451
Independent identification, acquisition,
resolution and execution of conflict.

383
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,223
I had a conversation with the
minister of defense this morning.

384
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,825
The prime minister's
getting a lot of heat.

385
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,499
The media is playing up the fact
that we're five years behind schedule

386
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,936
and half-a-billion
cubits over budget.

387
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:27,473
He's getting a lot of pressure to yank

388
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,600
the cyber combat unit contract from us

389
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:31,406
and go off-world with it.

390
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,176
They're talking about going to Vergis.

391
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:56,835
Man: Evaluation demonstration,
proceed in three, two, one.

392
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,518
I'll be out for the rest of the day.

393
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,521
No calls.

394
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,337
- Let's go. They're waiting for us, sweetie.
- Willie.

395
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,408
How was school today?

396
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:11,535
All right.

397
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:16,310
I got off of work early and thought
maybe we could walk home together.

398
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:19,146
- All right. Okay.
- Stop off for a shaved ice, huh?

399
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,379
- You like that?
- Yeah, sure.

400
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:21,580
All right.

401
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,659
You know, I met a man who offered to
take us to see the Buccaneers play.

402
00:30:27,728 --> 00:30:29,025
What do you think?

403
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:30,290
Sure.

404
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,556
I thought you liked pyramid.

405
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:34,694
Sort of.

406
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:36,759
Courtside seats.

407
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,339
Could tsattie come with us, too?

408
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:45,234
You know, I think I want
to give grandma a night off.

409
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,773
It's a guys' night out.

410
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,476
We haven't been spending
much time together lately.

411
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:53,183
Ever.

412
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,617
William: Do you think
they still feel pain?

413
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,454
Sorry?

414
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,956
You know, mom and
Tamara, where they are.

415
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,625
Do you still think they hurt?

416
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:27,403
- Daniel: What?
- I know you said no calls.

417
00:32:27,848 --> 00:32:30,248
Tomas Vergis is on Caprica.

418
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,785
He's meeting Defense
Minister Chambers today.

419
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:35,601
Obviously he's making a
play for the U-87 contract.

420
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,163
I hate to say I told you so.

421
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:40,039
His company is years behind us.

422
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,910
Word is, Vergis has developed
a met a-cognitive processor.

423
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,046
We've been trying to crack
that technology for a decade.

424
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:50,313
Suddenly he's got it? I don't think so.

425
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:54,050
Vergis is going to tell Chambers
that he has an MCP, that much I know.

426
00:32:54,124 --> 00:32:55,455
If it's true...

427
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:58,927
I mean, if they really have a viable,
independent artificial brain...

428
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,020
Can't be.

429
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:01,121
Then the only thing they need

430
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:03,257
- is a robotic body to put it in.
- I know.

431
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:05,894
I know. First thing is,
find out if it's true.

432
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,335
Saying you've got the MCP is one thing.

433
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,702
Actually having it is another.

434
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,206
See what you can find out. Okay.

435
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:12,537
And, Cyrus...

436
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,806
Did you ever hear of these virtual
nightclubs for kids, teenagers?

437
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:21,716
You know, they hack the holobands and
create these places where they can go

438
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:23,846
and do things.

439
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:28,290
It's only been an underground
phenomenon for about, oh, five years now.

440
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,585
Why?

441
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,661
Just keep me posted on Vergis.

442
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:07,922
Zoe!

443
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,198
Morning. Morning.

444
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,503
William was up all night. Again.

445
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,776
I know.

446
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,215
I don't know what to do with him.

447
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,446
Let him experience his roots.

448
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,648
Take him home to Tauron.

449
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,554
It's what my daughter would have wanted.

450
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,220
Will was born on
Caprica. This is his home.

451
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,857
Let's not get into this, okay? Not now.

452
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,959
Joseph: Hey, kiddo.

453
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,094
Hey.

454
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,728
Ruth: Good morning. Morning.

455
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,170
- How are you?
- Good.

456
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,205
There's an extra slice of that
cherry cake you like so much.

457
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,369
Awesome.

458
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,612
Hey, tsattie, are you
gonna take me to school?

459
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,945
It's on my way to work. I'll take you.

460
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:20,775
Okay.

461
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,923
Duram: Dr. Graystone?

462
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,051
Yes.

463
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,295
Agent Duram, Global Defense Department.

464
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,062
I'm wondering if you have a few minutes.

465
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,629
What for?

466
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,035
Well, as you probably know,

467
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,699
I'm investigating the
attack on the mlmt train.

468
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,266
Should I know that?

469
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:51,014
Sorry. I've been
avoiding the news lately.

470
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,373
That's completely understandable.

471
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,342
May i?

472
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,478
Yes.

473
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,181
It's about your daughter, Zoe.

474
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,224
Yes.

475
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,695
Was there anything in her
behavior before the incident

476
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,391
that seemed unusual to you?

477
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:17,397
She was angry, defiant,

478
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,911
rude, vulgar, obnoxious, unreasonable,

479
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,047
just your typical
16-year-old girl.

480
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,143
And how would you describe her circle
of friends? Was there an anti...

481
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,984
Do me the courtesy of cutting
to the chase, Agent Duram.

482
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:37,820
We have evidence that we believe positively
links your daughter to the bombers.

483
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,861
I'm sorry. You think that Zoe
knew one of the terrorists?

484
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,901
Dr. Graystone, we think that Zoe
might have been one of the terrorists.

485
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,139
My daughter didn't have a
political bone in her body.

486
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,010
Her biggest concerns in life
were partying with her friends

487
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,515
and finding new and creative
ways to piss off her parents.

488
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,075
I understand how upsetting
this must be for you.

489
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,492
We think that was sent from
your daughter's computer sheet.

490
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,088
The message was transmitted
just before the explosion,

491
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,896
but never had a chance
to uplink to the server.

492
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,938
It took a fair amount of digital
forensics to reconstruct it.

493
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,099
It sounds like a last message to me,

494
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,973
like someone who knows the end
is near and wants to make amends.

495
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,740
Get out.

496
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,350
Here's my card.

497
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,582
If you think of anything,
please don't hesitate to call me.

498
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,332
Welcome, Lacy Rand.

499
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,032
May I come in?

500
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,405
Your security authorization
is still valid.

501
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,670
Please enter.

502
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,767
Thanks.

503
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,980
I'm just going to go to Zoe's room.

504
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,312
As you wish.

505
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,527
Daniel: Looking for this?

506
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,561
You'll pardon the way I look,

507
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,929
but I've been up all night trying to
crack one of the better security codes

508
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:40,870
I've ever run up against.

509
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:43,102
I've been to the V-Club.

510
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:46,310
I've seen her.

511
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,182
I saw her go into a room with
an infinity symbol on the door.

512
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:54,880
Now, I don't have any idea what
this means or how it's even possible,

513
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:57,115
but I have the feeling that you do.

514
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,214
I'm sorry, Dr. Graystone...

515
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,122
I want to see her, Lacy.

516
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:05,391
Whatever she is, I need to know.

517
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:11,100
I need to know.

518
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:19,858
Guatrau: I'm glad you
came to see me, Joseph.

519
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,256
We grieve for your terrible loss.

520
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,692
Joseph: Thank you for
saying so, Guatrau.

521
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:27,263
There's a delicate matter
I need your help on.

522
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,129
If I can, you know I will.

523
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,598
There is a man, an important man,

524
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:38,471
who has conveniently forgotten
how he got to be so important.

525
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:43,305
Regrettably, he is
embarking on an enterprise

526
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,873
that will cause a
great deal of distress,

527
00:39:45,952 --> 00:39:48,045
not only to my personal interest,

528
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:49,679
but to many of my colleagues.

529
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:54,258
This I cannot sanction.

530
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,959
So action must be taken.

531
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,455
You want me to threaten him?

532
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:03,632
I'd like this matter to be
resolved in a civilized manner,

533
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:08,067
and I can think of no other Tauron
as civilized as you, tse'jospeh.

534
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:14,805
And who is this I'm to negotiate with?

535
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:18,644
Caprica's minister of
defense, val Chambers.

536
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:25,653
And if this negotiation
does not go well?

537
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,519
It's best not to speak of such things.

538
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,957
May I have some time
to think about this?

539
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:39,700
Of course. But not too much time.

540
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,783
- Daniel: What goes on here?
- Lacy: Pretty much anything.

541
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,216
No limits. That's the motto.

542
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:54,188
Down there is the kill zone. Get a gun,
get five guns, walk in and start shooting.

543
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,464
Back that way are the
group sex and drug dens.

544
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,966
Keep going past that and you'll
find the really gross stuff.

545
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:05,024
Hi.

546
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:11,043
This is a fight room. You can
frakking beat anyone you want.

547
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,777
Woman: Kill her!

548
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:17,848
Daniel: So what's this?

549
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,009
Lacy: Human sacrifice.

550
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,045
What?

551
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,382
Virgins.

552
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:25,184
They offer them to hecate,
goddess of the underworld.

553
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,420
When I created the holoband,

554
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:29,222
this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

555
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:30,660
Yeah, right.

556
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,321
The porn sites were the first
ones to license that technology.

557
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,423
Everyone knows that.

558
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,660
But that's different. That's for adults.

559
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:37,532
Zoe always said you can
rationalize anything.

560
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:40,697
So what? You and Zoe came here for sex?

561
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:41,899
At first.

562
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:44,375
We used the group sex
rooms like everyone else,

563
00:41:44,577 --> 00:41:47,910
but then after Ben showed us
the way, showed us the way,

564
00:41:47,981 --> 00:41:50,541
we saw this place for
what it was. Trash.

565
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:51,913
The way?

566
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:56,247
There is good and there
is evil in this world.

567
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:58,654
There is a right and there is a wrong,

568
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:02,423
but only through the one true
God can we know the difference.

569
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,989
And Zoe knew. Because Zoe knew God,

570
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,164
and God touched her heart,

571
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,862
and gave her the ability to create

572
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:13,567
life itself.

573
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,526
Zoe: Why did you bring him here?

574
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,291
He needs you, Zo.

575
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,538
Hi, daddy.

576
00:42:54,514 --> 00:42:56,812
Zoe: I thought that was
you at the club yesterday.

577
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,377
Thought I got away before you saw me.

578
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:03,715
Guess I wouldn't make a very good spy.

579
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:08,885
You're an avatar, a virtual
representation of Zoe.

580
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:12,324
Nothing more.

581
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:13,956
I'm a little more than that.

582
00:43:15,735 --> 00:43:17,225
A lot more, actually.

583
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:21,368
I'm sort of her.

584
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,041
Crazy as that sounds,

585
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:26,970
I am her.

586
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:30,475
I'm Zoe Graystone.

587
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,782
Zoe is dead.

588
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,546
I know,

589
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:38,486
and I'm so sorry about that,

590
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,023
more than you can know.

591
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:45,891
She was like... like my twin sister.

592
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,828
No, that's not right, either.
She was more than that.

593
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:56,774
We were like echoes of one another.

594
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,103
It's hard to describe.

595
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,410
So,what is this, really?

596
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,752
Did Zoe hack some kind of rudimentary
emulation software or something?

597
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,651
She said it was a combination
of hacks and some...

598
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:12,350
Okay, that's enough. What
was the purpose of this thing?

599
00:44:12,425 --> 00:44:13,449
I'm not a thing.

600
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,994
I'm not going to argue
with a digital image.

601
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:20,658
The human brain contains roughly
300 megabytes of information.

602
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:23,094
Not much, when you get right down to it.

603
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:27,698
The question isn't how to
store it. It's how to access it.

604
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:30,503
You can't download a personality.

605
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:32,669
There's no way to translate the data.

606
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,838
But the information
being held in our heads

607
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:38,611
is available in other databases.

608
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:43,050
People leave more than footprints
as they travel through life.

609
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:47,025
Medical scans, DNA
profiles, psych evaluations,

610
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:51,189
school records, e-mails,
recording videolaudio,

611
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:52,788
cat scans, genetic typing,

612
00:44:52,865 --> 00:44:54,890
synaptic records, security cameras,

613
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:56,730
test results, shopping records,

614
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:58,770
talent shows, ball games,

615
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:00,863
traffic tickets, restaurant bills,

616
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,737
phone records, music lists,

617
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:04,833
movie tickets, tv shows.

618
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:10,279
Even prescriptions for birth control.

619
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:25,296
You do not tell the Guatrau you
need time to think about anything.

620
00:45:25,365 --> 00:45:28,391
You say, "yes, sir. Thank
you, sir. May I have another?"

621
00:45:28,468 --> 00:45:30,800
You swore allegiance
to him, Sam. Not me.

622
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:33,806
You have no problem taking his cubits.

623
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:36,732
I don't care if he put me
through law school or not.

624
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,005
I'm tired of doing
his dirty work for him.

625
00:45:39,346 --> 00:45:41,871
You just fire me if you don't like it.

626
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:47,549
You of all people should know that the
ha'la'tha does not fire people, Joseph.

627
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:49,883
They bury them.

628
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:56,784
Yeah.

629
00:45:57,497 --> 00:45:58,725
I remember that.

630
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,493
You put me up on your shoulders so I
could see the band as it marched by,

631
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:07,031
but we were standing under a lamppost,

632
00:46:07,107 --> 00:46:08,165
(laughs)

633
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:11,699
and I smacked my head
so hard I saw stars.

634
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:15,943
Took you to the emergency
room just as a precaution.

635
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:18,016
- I hated that.
- Yeah.

636
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:21,080
The lights and the doctors

637
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:23,413
and that smell.

638
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,358
But I remember you holding
my hand the whole time.

639
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:31,257
You said you wouldn't let go.

640
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:37,432
She could've programmed
those memories into you.

641
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,203
But it is a lot of detail
for such a minor event.

642
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,243
It's possible she could've found a way

643
00:46:46,312 --> 00:46:49,008
to translate synaptic
records into usable data.

644
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:50,241
She did.

645
00:46:50,316 --> 00:46:53,046
Yes, but a person is much more than just

646
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:56,350
a bunch of usable data.

647
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,824
You might be a good imitation,

648
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:00,757
you might be a very good imitation,

649
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:02,920
but you're still just an imitation.

650
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:04,256
A copy.

651
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,663
I don't feel like a copy.

652
00:47:11,104 --> 00:47:12,401
Daddy...

653
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:20,078
Can I...

654
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,983
May I hold you, Zoe?

655
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:08,229
What're you doing to her?

656
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:11,989
Stop it, Dr. Graystone! Stop!

657
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,094
What did you do to her?

658
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:19,663
I captured the code Zoe
used to create the avatar.

659
00:48:19,741 --> 00:48:21,709
- Why?
- It's time for you to leave.

660
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,183
Serge,

661
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:33,049
cancel Lacy Rand's security clearance.

662
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:34,420
Yes, sir.

663
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:45,866
Sister Clarice, you wanted to see me?

664
00:48:45,937 --> 00:48:48,405
Lacy, I'd like you to meet Agent Duram.

665
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,536
Hello, Miss Rand.

666
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,636
Agent duram has a few
questions he wants to ask.

667
00:48:57,216 --> 00:48:59,275
Lacy, why don't you have a seat?

668
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:08,750
I understand you were
friends with Ben Stark.

669
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:10,822
Sure. I knew Ben.

670
00:49:11,598 --> 00:49:15,227
We have evidence to suggest that he
was involved in the attack on the lev.

671
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:18,861
That's crazy.

672
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:22,575
I have to agree with Lacy. That's
an absurd allegation, Mr. Duram.

673
00:49:22,642 --> 00:49:25,941
I'm afraid we have forensic
evidence linking him to the bombing.

674
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:29,905
Were you aware of his involvement
with the soldiers of the one?

675
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:32,178
Clarice: Ben Stark was
a good and decent boy.

676
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:36,951
He would never be involved with some
kind of a... of a terrorist organization.

677
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,958
Lacy, did you know
that Ben was involved?

678
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:44,493
No, and I don't believe it.

679
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,758
What about Zoe Graystone?

680
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:46,924
What about her?

681
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,331
Were you aware that she was a member

682
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:50,528
of soldiers of the one, as well?

683
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,282
She's just gone through an
incredibly traumatic event.

684
00:50:09,255 --> 00:50:10,847
Where does the athenian academy stand

685
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,915
on the question of monotheism, sister?

686
00:50:14,397 --> 00:50:18,857
The academy is dedicated to
following the path of the gods,

687
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:20,835
the goddess Athena being our patroness.

688
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:23,737
We are, however, open
to all forms of worship,

689
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,201
including belief in a singular God.

690
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:29,829
And how many of your students
are practicing monotheists?

691
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:32,262
You know I can't answer that.

692
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:34,694
It doesn't concern you, sister,

693
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,762
that kind of absolutist
view of the universe?

694
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,170
Right and wrong determined solely

695
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:41,539
by a single all-knowing,
all-powerful being

696
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,908
whose judgment cannot be questioned,

697
00:50:44,112 --> 00:50:46,512
and in whose name the
most horrendous of acts

698
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:48,242
can be sanctioned without appeal?

699
00:50:48,316 --> 00:50:50,978
You seem to know a great
deal about the subject.

700
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:52,986
Know your enemy, Sister Clarice.

701
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:55,420
Love your enemy, Agent Duram.

702
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:58,859
That is what we followers
of Athena believe.

703
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,325
I'll be in touch.

704
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:36,048
You know, I should've remembered
you own the buccaneers.

705
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,280
A fantasy since I was a kid.

706
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,883
Now, William, what'd you think?

707
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:51,589
I think Jenkins needs more
practise, he's tanking the game.

708
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,287
You know I agree. Why don't
we go tell him ourselves.

709
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:57,888
Are you serious?

710
00:51:58,029 --> 00:51:59,621
Yeah, tell me what, Dr. Graystone?

711
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:01,062
This young man would like to discuss

712
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,532
the finer points of midcourt
defense with you, Rod.

713
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:06,092
Sure, Daniel, no problem.
What's your name, kid?

714
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,195
- Willie Adams.
- Willie, I'm Rod.

715
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:09,739
I know who you are, Mr. Jenkins.

716
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,866
So, how do you think we did tonight?

717
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:13,069
Not that great.

718
00:52:13,144 --> 00:52:16,113
Keep it positive. You're
among champions here, pal.

719
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,377
I'd like to speak with your father if
you don't mind hanging out with the team.

720
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,940
Is that okay? Sure.

721
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:23,486
This is Sean. If you want something,
anything, you just ask him.

722
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:24,680
Okay.

723
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:26,586
- Now, you behave, son.
- Okay, dad.

724
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:28,420
You know, that was the first time

725
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:30,619
I've seen him really light
up since the accident,

726
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:33,562
so thank you so much for doing this.

727
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:35,997
Please, please, it's easy.

728
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,399
And you?

729
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:40,832
How are you holding up?

730
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:43,239
You know us Taurons.

731
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:46,242
We're nothing if not a stoic people.

732
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:56,812
Do you mind if I ask you a somewhat
strange and personal question?

733
00:53:00,925 --> 00:53:05,123
What would you do if you had the
chance to be with your daughter again?

734
00:53:14,038 --> 00:53:15,369
You don't have to
answer that. I'm sorry.

735
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:16,906
No, no.

736
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,032
It was a personal question.

737
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:19,974
I just hadn't thought about it.

738
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:31,114
Most of my family, including my
parents, died in the Tauron civil war,

739
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:33,482
so my brother and I
came here as orphans.

740
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:38,161
When we arrived, they
drove us to this orphanage.

741
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:42,726
I remember this field of
wildflowers on the side of the road.

742
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:47,736
It might seem strange to a caprican,
but there are no flowers on Tauron.

743
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:50,267
Not one.

744
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,577
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen in my life.

745
00:53:55,713 --> 00:53:57,078
All the colors,

746
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:01,575
the petals, the softness, and

747
00:54:03,054 --> 00:54:05,887
I wept openly,

748
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,756
for the first and last time.

749
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:14,462
So I guess that's what I'd tell Tamara,

750
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:18,396
to find those things in
life that make you cry,

751
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,102
that make you feel.

752
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:24,766
Because they're what make you human.

753
00:54:26,444 --> 00:54:28,537
I guess that's what I'd tell Tamara

754
00:54:29,113 --> 00:54:30,774
if I could.

755
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,189
Wow.

756
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:48,431
William, I'm guessing you'd
like to see the game room, yes?

757
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:50,559
Yeah. Serge?

758
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:51,658
- Go have fun.
- Serge: Yes, Daniel?

759
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:53,498
Please escort William
down to the game room.

760
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:54,902
Show him how to use the equipment.

761
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:56,564
Right this way, William.

762
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:03,579
It's quite a place you got here.

763
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,980
I still miss tinkering down in
my parents' basement, you know?

764
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:08,746
This all seems a bit much.

765
00:55:21,202 --> 00:55:22,897
Ever tried one of these?

766
00:55:23,538 --> 00:55:24,698
Uh...

767
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,769
I'm not much for that stuff.

768
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,367
Indulge me, please.

769
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:32,704
Sure.

770
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,112
Just step right in here,

771
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:37,014
if you would. Right there.

772
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:39,715
This is what happens
when you buy a holoband

773
00:55:39,787 --> 00:55:41,254
at any retail store.

774
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:42,482
I saw it on the news.

775
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:46,493
Basically, I'm going to scan
your image for your avatar,

776
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:50,761
which is, in essence, a
virtual copy of you, physically.

777
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:52,459
- Now, just stand still.
- Okay.

778
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:56,230
You're gonna feel a slight
tingling sensation in your skin,

779
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:58,738
but I assure you, it's not harmful.

780
00:56:08,716 --> 00:56:10,206
You can step out now.

781
00:56:11,552 --> 00:56:13,042
There you are.

782
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:15,212
I've looked better.

783
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,189
If you will just sit here,

784
00:56:17,258 --> 00:56:19,783
we are ready to go.

785
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:23,897
Now, just relax, close your eyes.

786
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:27,496
Remember, it's going to seem real,

787
00:56:27,568 --> 00:56:31,334
very real, but it's all virtual.

788
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,271
Just an illusion.

789
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:36,469
Okay.

790
00:56:49,524 --> 00:56:51,253
It takes getting used to.

791
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,926
Can I talk?

792
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:01,429
I guess I can. Where are we?

793
00:57:02,436 --> 00:57:05,462
Inside a very basic computer program.

794
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,907
I haven't had time to do any
decorating yet. Step over here.

795
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:12,573
Just tell yourself to walk.

796
00:57:26,494 --> 00:57:28,223
What are you doing, daddy?

797
00:57:29,297 --> 00:57:30,628
Working.

798
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:33,866
Joseph,

799
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:36,468
this is Zoe,

800
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:40,504
my daughter.

801
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,615
My gods.

802
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,552
Boo.

803
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,320
Frak!

804
00:58:04,265 --> 00:58:05,926
What the hell is this?

805
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,331
What kind of sick, twisted
thing are you doing here?

806
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,663
There's nothing twisted about it.

807
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,465
And I didn't do it. Zoe did.

808
00:58:10,538 --> 00:58:11,596
Zoe did?

809
00:58:11,672 --> 00:58:14,937
Turns out she was kind of
a chip off the old block.

810
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:16,237
That's not her.

811
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:19,006
- Our daughters, they're gone.
- Yes.

812
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,240
You know this.

813
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:24,080
Yes, but what if they could come back?

814
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,143
You're insane.

815
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,619
Do you know what your brain is, Joseph?

816
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:29,383
It's a database and a
processor, that's all.

817
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:31,823
Information and a way to use it.

818
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:33,120
And what my daughter figured out was...

819
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:35,219
Was how to harness all the information

820
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:37,059
that made her who and what she was.

821
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:38,393
It's genius, really.

822
00:58:38,466 --> 00:58:41,765
She took a search engine and
turned it into a way to cheat death.

823
00:58:41,836 --> 00:58:44,498
No, it's... it's an illusion.
You said so yourself.

824
00:58:44,572 --> 00:58:46,665
Yes. You're right. You're
right. She's a copy.

825
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:50,336
But she's a perfect copy in every way.

826
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:51,742
Still doesn't make her your daughter.

827
00:58:51,812 --> 00:58:52,870
There's an axiom in my business,

828
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:56,178
"a difference that makes no
difference, is no difference."

829
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,242
She looks like Zoe, she talks
like Zoe, she thinks like Zoe,

830
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,844
remembers all the
events of her childhood,

831
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:04,982
has all the same likes, dislikes,
flaws, strengths, all of it.

832
00:59:05,426 --> 00:59:08,156
Who's to say her soul
wasn't copied, too?

833
00:59:08,229 --> 00:59:09,662
You can't copy a soul.

834
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,095
And you would know that how?

835
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:14,100
Hmm? How can you prove
or disprove that idea?

836
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:16,466
Look, I know what I know, okay?

837
00:59:16,537 --> 00:59:17,970
And I know you can't copy a person.

838
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:19,631
I know that she's my daughter.

839
00:59:19,707 --> 00:59:22,005
I know that she is my daughter,

840
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,174
and I know it in the only
place that matters. Here.

841
00:59:25,913 --> 00:59:29,474
The only difference between her and the
Zoe that lived in this house is just that.

842
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,849
She lived in this house
instead of a virtual world.

843
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,286
I want to bring her here.

844
00:59:35,356 --> 00:59:39,053
Joseph, I want her to live
in this world once more.

845
00:59:39,126 --> 00:59:42,254
I want to hold her in my
arms, and I want to kiss her,

846
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,321
and I want her to feel
the sun shine on her face.

847
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:50,800
I want her to see the flowers
at the side of the road, Joseph.

848
00:59:52,406 --> 00:59:55,466
But for me to be able to transfer
the virtual representation of Zoe

849
00:59:55,543 --> 00:59:58,535
you just saw in there into
a physical body out here,

850
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:02,173
I need a very special, very
particular piece of equipment.

851
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:03,546
- A physical body... what do you mean?
- Yes.

852
01:00:03,617 --> 01:00:04,845
Like a robot?

853
01:00:04,919 --> 01:00:07,387
"Robot" is a crude name for
what we're talking about.

854
01:00:07,455 --> 01:00:08,547
This is a cybernetic life-form node.

855
01:00:08,622 --> 01:00:09,884
It's still a machine!

856
01:00:09,957 --> 01:00:12,482
- It's artificial skin, eyes, hair,
make-up. - It's cold. It's dead. It's...

857
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,289
Yes, but these are surface details.

858
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,454
That's what we always tell
our children, isn't it?

859
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,464
What matters is on the inside.

860
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:23,333
The device that I need is called
a met a-cognitive processor.

861
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:27,773
The problem is, there's only
one company that has this device,

862
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:29,332
and it's not mine.

863
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,502
Okay.

864
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,870
The only one in existence is
owned by the Vergis Corporation.

865
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:36,810
- Ever heard of them?
- Yeah, sure.

866
01:00:40,955 --> 01:00:43,355
I know your connection to the ha'la'tha.

867
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:46,382
I know who and what you are.

868
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:49,986
I also know about the
pit in your stomach.

869
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,463
I know about the sleepless nights.

870
01:00:51,532 --> 01:00:53,124
I know about the wishing and praying

871
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,397
to whatever gods will listen that you
could have everything back the way it was.

872
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,836
Well, I can bring Tamara back.

873
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,396
- I can bring her back.
- Get out of my way.

874
01:01:00,474 --> 01:01:01,771
You can see your daughter again.

875
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:03,935
Isn't that worth whatever
price you have to pay?

876
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:06,241
If you leave now, you'll
never know for sure.

877
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:09,441
You'll always wonder.
You'll walk by her room,

878
01:01:09,517 --> 01:01:11,280
you'll see her pictures on the wall,

879
01:01:11,352 --> 01:01:14,150
and you'll ask yourself every
day for the rest of your life

880
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:17,054
whether you had a
chance to bring her back.

881
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,793
Now, if I'm wrong,

882
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:22,920
have me beat up, have
me killed. I don't care.

883
01:01:22,997 --> 01:01:25,227
But if I'm right...

884
01:01:26,534 --> 01:01:31,494
If I'm right and you have a
chance to see your daughter again,

885
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:34,999
possibly even your wife,

886
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:42,881
isn't it worth trying?

887
01:02:01,404 --> 01:02:02,769
Good morning.

888
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:06,233
Hey.

889
01:02:09,412 --> 01:02:10,674
Morning.

890
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:13,414
What's this?

891
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:15,414
I made you breakfast.

892
01:02:16,052 --> 01:02:17,485
You made breakfast?

893
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,983
Excuse me. I used to
cook for you all the time.

894
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:25,524
Eggs a la Graystone,
wild-mushroom sausage,

895
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:30,032
Rosemary bread and, of
course, your black tea.

896
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:34,264
Enjoy.

897
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:37,865
I miss you.

898
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,345
We can make it through this.

899
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:53,247
We can.

900
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:56,752
Together.

901
01:02:58,261 --> 01:02:59,660
Just the two of us.

902
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:02,924
Yeah.

903
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:14,406
Thank you.

904
01:03:17,447 --> 01:03:22,942
Eat, and maybe later on, I'll give you
a chance to lose to me in straight sets.

905
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:33,384
Joseph: I need a favor, Sam.

906
01:03:34,095 --> 01:03:36,256
I don't even know if it can be done,

907
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:38,295
but I need something stolen.

908
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:42,102
Really? You?

909
01:03:45,606 --> 01:03:48,302
I'm listening. From
the Vergis Corporation.

910
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:49,775
On Tauron.

911
01:03:51,846 --> 01:03:54,542
Tomas Vergis is a good
friend of the Guatrau's.

912
01:03:54,882 --> 01:03:57,316
I doubt he'd sanction
stealing from a friend.

913
01:03:57,385 --> 01:03:59,819
What if I agreed to deliver
the message he wanted

914
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:02,649
to Minister Chambers?

915
01:04:03,658 --> 01:04:05,250
Isn't this one of
those big lines of yours

916
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:07,988
you're always so worried
about crossing, Joseph?

917
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:11,257
Are you sure you really want to do that?

918
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:24,438
You're not actually
threatening me, are you?

919
01:04:24,508 --> 01:04:27,102
Minister Chambers, I'm
simply delivering a message.

920
01:04:27,945 --> 01:04:30,971
There's no threat, real or
implied, in anything I've told you.

921
01:04:34,752 --> 01:04:38,415
You Taurons, you've got
stones, I'll give you that.

922
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:40,616
Are you making a racial comment, sir?

923
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:43,023
No more than you're making a threat.

924
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:46,519
Let's be clear.

925
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:49,662
I don't like your boss,

926
01:04:50,134 --> 01:04:53,262
I don't like your planet
and I don't like your people,

927
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:57,204
so you crawl under that rock
where your Guatrau lives,

928
01:04:57,775 --> 01:05:01,302
and you tell him that not only will
I not be pressured or blackmailed,

929
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:05,781
but the government of Caprica is going
to take a very special interest in him,

930
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:07,373
his business

931
01:05:08,852 --> 01:05:10,877
and his low-life lawyers.

932
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,789
Perhaps you should sleep on it.

933
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,351
Deliver the message, errand boy,

934
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:22,258
word for word.

935
01:05:29,006 --> 01:05:31,566
Goodbye, Minister Chambers.
Have a safe journey.

936
01:05:32,576 --> 01:05:36,603
I'm not going anyplace,
you frakking dirt-eater.

937
01:08:51,944 --> 01:08:53,275
Hey there, you.

938
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,445
Always in the books.

939
01:08:56,148 --> 01:08:57,672
Missed you at the club last night.

940
01:08:59,651 --> 01:09:00,913
Missed you for two hours.

941
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:02,214
Sorry.

942
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:04,847
I haven't been much of
a friend lately, have I?

943
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:07,421
That's fine. It doesn't matter.

944
01:09:11,163 --> 01:09:12,289
Look,

945
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:14,329
I found something.

946
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:18,761
It changed my life. I
want to share it with you.

947
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,364
Changed your life?

948
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:21,667
Sounds stupid, huh?

949
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,608
Look, it's not. It's real.

950
01:09:27,379 --> 01:09:28,403
Come with us.

951
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,538
To what?

952
01:09:29,982 --> 01:09:30,971
A prayer meeting.

953
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:32,073
Because I don't go to enough of those.

954
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,208
This one is different.

955
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:34,616
You pray, Lace,

956
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:37,818
but your gods don't answer.

957
01:09:38,156 --> 01:09:40,283
You hurt, but your gods don't heal.

958
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:43,191
You go to the V-Club for sex and sin,

959
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,890
but it doesn't fill
the void in your soul.

960
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:52,264
There is truth in the world, Lace.

961
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:55,500
There is a right and there is a wrong.

962
01:09:57,175 --> 01:09:59,075
And there is a God,

963
01:10:00,379 --> 01:10:02,574
a God who knows the difference.

964
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,624
Lacy: That's how it started.

965
01:10:18,463 --> 01:10:20,226
That's how I got involved.

966
01:10:22,734 --> 01:10:24,929
I didn't know what to do, sister,

967
01:10:26,738 --> 01:10:28,000
where to go.

968
01:10:29,574 --> 01:10:33,101
You did the right thing by
coming to see me with this, Lacy.

969
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,315
I, too, used to feel a void in my soul.

970
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:44,022
I, too, once hungered
to know right from wrong.

971
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:49,217
But not anymore.

972
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:05,803
Sister?

973
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,274
You're not alone.

974
01:11:23,996 --> 01:11:26,658
So then, Ben did have something
to do with the bombing.

975
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,029
He was the terrorist.

976
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:36,300
Labels like "terrorist" are what
this corrupt and decadent culture

977
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,538
calls people who are trying to
fight the real evil in this world.

978
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:44,009
Ben was eager to strike against all that
was slowly choking this world to death,

979
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:47,017
and so he did something premature,

980
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,779
something unauthorized.

981
01:11:52,424 --> 01:11:56,451
But was blowing up that
train evil, wrong? No.

982
01:11:57,996 --> 01:12:01,955
He was fighting evil with all his heart.

983
01:12:06,772 --> 01:12:08,034
And Zoe?

984
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:14,708
You have no idea how
special Zoe was to us.

985
01:12:17,382 --> 01:12:18,815
Or is.

986
01:12:32,664 --> 01:12:34,063
Daniel: Oh!

987
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,402
I gotta hand it to Vergis,

988
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,399
it's an elegant design.

989
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:42,496
But will it work?

990
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:47,607
Well, I won't know until I
put it into a cybernetic body

991
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,170
and try and download
Zoe's avatar into it.

992
01:12:50,248 --> 01:12:51,579
How long?

993
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,813
Well, a couple of days, at least.

994
01:12:56,988 --> 01:12:58,922
I do have a surprise for you, though.

995
01:13:01,426 --> 01:13:03,291
Your daughter's avatar is ready.

996
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:04,419
What?

997
01:13:04,496 --> 01:13:06,361
I used Zoe's original avatar program

998
01:13:06,431 --> 01:13:09,093
to search and download
any data on Tamara Adams.

999
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:11,795
School records, medical
DNA, you name it.

1000
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,838
About 300 megabytes' worth.

1001
01:13:13,905 --> 01:13:16,738
You mean, she's in there?

1002
01:13:16,808 --> 01:13:18,435
Yeah, the more I work with Zoe's code,

1003
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,673
the more I realize she was
nothing short of a computer genius.

1004
01:13:21,746 --> 01:13:23,236
I want to see her.

1005
01:13:24,249 --> 01:13:25,511
Thought you might.

1006
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:44,794
Baby?

1007
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,599
- Baby?
- Daddy?

1008
01:13:51,409 --> 01:13:52,501
Tammy?

1009
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:57,039
My gods!

1010
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:00,712
Daddy.

1011
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,553
My gods.

1012
01:14:09,094 --> 01:14:12,120
It's okay, baby. I'm
right here. I'm right here.

1013
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,990
I'm so scared. What is
this place? What's going on?

1014
01:14:17,736 --> 01:14:18,725
It's okay.

1015
01:14:18,803 --> 01:14:20,134
I feel so strange.

1016
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:21,833
I know, but you're fine.

1017
01:14:21,907 --> 01:14:23,636
It's not fine. It's not fine.

1018
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,835
This is wrong. This is so wrong. No.

1019
01:14:25,911 --> 01:14:29,039
I know, I know, I know. But the
important thing is we're together.

1020
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:30,206
We can be a family again.

1021
01:14:30,282 --> 01:14:31,977
I can't remember how I got here.

1022
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,450
And I can't remember
where I was before now.

1023
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:36,350
It's confusing. I know.
This is gonna take some time.

1024
01:14:36,421 --> 01:14:37,979
This isn't real. This
doesn't feel real, dad!

1025
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,388
I don't feel real. I'm
real... this isn't real!

1026
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,358
It's not real. Willie
misses you! I miss you!

1027
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:46,090
We can be a family together.
We can be a family again.

1028
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,196
- My heart isn't beating.
- I miss you.

1029
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:51,201
Daddy, my heart isn't beating.

1030
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:53,829
Daddy, why isn't my heart beating?

1031
01:14:53,905 --> 01:14:56,738
Why isn't my heart
beating? Why isn't it...

1032
01:15:04,015 --> 01:15:05,778
My baby. I know.

1033
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,818
She couldn't feel her heart.

1034
01:15:07,886 --> 01:15:10,377
- She couldn't feel her heart beat.
- She'll adjust.

1035
01:15:10,455 --> 01:15:13,583
She's probably very confused by
everything. It's only natural.

1036
01:15:13,658 --> 01:15:16,286
No! No, it's not natural.

1037
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,421
No, it's wrong. It's an abomination.

1038
01:15:19,497 --> 01:15:21,226
Well, define "natural."

1039
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:23,096
These glasses help me to see.

1040
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:26,001
Artificial limbs and organs
help millions to live.

1041
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:28,130
You'd hardly call those aids "natural,"

1042
01:15:28,206 --> 01:15:29,366
but I doubt you'd
call them abominations.

1043
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:32,171
That's not what I mean and you know it.

1044
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:35,936
Ah. Uh-huh.

1045
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:40,484
You mean, only the gods
have power over death.

1046
01:15:42,887 --> 01:15:46,118
Well, I reject that notion.
I reject that notion!

1047
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:48,955
And I'm guessing that you
don't put too much stock

1048
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:50,426
in those ideas, either.

1049
01:15:52,264 --> 01:15:55,358
We have a chance to
have our daughters back.

1050
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:58,834
And your wife. Think of what that
would mean to your son, Joseph.

1051
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:04,164
How much would it mean to William
to be held by his mother again?

1052
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:07,877
You're not right.

1053
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,046
You're out of your frakking mind.

1054
01:16:10,115 --> 01:16:11,309
Maybe.

1055
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:15,213
Maybe. I've certainly
been accused of worse.

1056
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:34,962
Zoe: Do you really think
this download is gonna work?

1057
01:16:36,373 --> 01:16:37,806
This is what I do.

1058
01:16:38,642 --> 01:16:41,440
Yeah. This is what you do.

1059
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,706
What?

1060
01:16:44,281 --> 01:16:45,942
There's a part of me that

1061
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:49,046
doesn't want this to work.

1062
01:16:50,788 --> 01:16:51,880
Why?

1063
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,982
I don't want to be on Caprica.

1064
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,620
But it's your home.

1065
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:58,753
No.

1066
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,390
It's not.

1067
01:17:01,031 --> 01:17:02,623
It's never been my home,

1068
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:05,863
and it stopped being a home for
the other Zoe a long time ago...

1069
01:17:05,936 --> 01:17:07,460
I don't even know what
that's supposed to mean.

1070
01:17:07,538 --> 01:17:11,099
Why do you think your daughter was on
a lev train instead of being in school?

1071
01:17:11,175 --> 01:17:13,700
Do you think she was
just cutting school?

1072
01:17:13,777 --> 01:17:15,039
Going shopping?

1073
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:18,180
She was leaving Caprica,

1074
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:19,307
and she wasn't coming back.

1075
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:20,748
You don't know what she was doing, okay?

1076
01:17:20,818 --> 01:17:22,080
You can't know because
you weren't there.

1077
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:23,882
I know where she was going.

1078
01:17:23,954 --> 01:17:26,081
She told me she had a plan.

1079
01:17:26,824 --> 01:17:28,314
She was going to Gemenon.

1080
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:30,826
And you know why? Because she found God.

1081
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:32,123
The real God. Stop it!

1082
01:17:32,196 --> 01:17:34,130
The children of Caprica
are lost, daddy. Okay?

1083
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:35,756
We are all lost if we
don't turn to the light.

1084
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:39,462
Listen to me, okay? We'll
talk about this later.

1085
01:17:39,537 --> 01:17:42,472
When are you going to realize
that later is too late?

1086
01:17:42,806 --> 01:17:44,671
When did you ever listen,

1087
01:17:45,176 --> 01:17:46,837
ever want to listen?

1088
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:49,908
You and mom, you knew it all.

1089
01:17:51,448 --> 01:17:55,009
Your arrogance was
killing your daughter.

1090
01:17:56,687 --> 01:17:58,518
And that's how you lost her.

1091
01:17:59,323 --> 01:18:00,881
Not to some bomb.

1092
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,578
Daddy. Daddy.

1093
01:20:08,852 --> 01:20:10,444
Daddy. Daddy.

1094
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:48,389
No.

1095
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:55,828
Oh, no. Oh!

1096
01:20:57,501 --> 01:20:58,525
Oh, no.

1097
01:21:03,607 --> 01:21:04,835
Zoe!

1098
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:07,006
Zoe!

1099
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:43,774
Hi, dad.

1100
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,914
We're gonna make a new
beginning, starting tonight.

1101
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,389
You and me.

1102
01:21:56,293 --> 01:21:57,817
You know what?

1103
01:21:58,529 --> 01:22:00,292
Our family's gonna survive this.

1104
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:02,831
We're gonna get past this.

1105
01:22:04,401 --> 01:22:07,234
We're gonna put our
lives back together again.

1106
01:22:09,907 --> 01:22:11,602
Mommy and Tamara are gone.

1107
01:22:13,677 --> 01:22:15,941
They're dead and
they're not coming back.

1108
01:22:16,814 --> 01:22:18,714
So we have to honor them

1109
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:21,277
by continuing to live

1110
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,186
as best we can.

1111
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:29,891
I want you to know who you are.

1112
01:22:30,194 --> 01:22:34,187
We come from a long, proud
line of Tauron peasants

1113
01:22:34,932 --> 01:22:37,457
who knew how to work the
land and still stand proud.

1114
01:22:40,237 --> 01:22:43,104
You're named after your grandfather.
Did I ever tell you that?

1115
01:22:43,173 --> 01:22:44,299
Nope.

1116
01:22:45,142 --> 01:22:46,404
William.

1117
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:50,143
He was killed during
the Tauron uprising.

1118
01:22:53,116 --> 01:22:54,777
Our last name isn't Adams.

1119
01:22:57,154 --> 01:23:00,214
I changed it after I
arrived here on Caprica.

1120
01:23:01,492 --> 01:23:02,789
Our family name

1121
01:23:04,928 --> 01:23:06,293
is Adama.

1122
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:09,626
Adama.

1123
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,792
And it's a good, honorable Tauron name.

1124
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,102
Come here, son.

1125
01:23:48,185 --> 01:23:51,951
Demonstration proceed,
in three, two, one.

1126
01:24:49,146 --> 01:24:51,444
All targets neutralized.

1127
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,086
Program completed by your command.

1128
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:02,958
Dr. Graystone, you've not only
secured a long-term contract

1129
01:25:03,027 --> 01:25:04,927
but you've done a great
service to our planet.

1130
01:25:04,995 --> 01:25:06,189
Thank you, minister.

1131
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:10,098
The Vergis Corporation have
made certain accusations.

1132
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:11,930
If they really thought they had a case,

1133
01:25:12,002 --> 01:25:13,731
they'd have us in court by now.

1134
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:16,568
Yes. But no matter. It
was never our intention

1135
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,699
to take this contract
off-world, anyway.

1136
01:25:18,776 --> 01:25:21,745
It's been my experience you
can never trust a Tauron.

1137
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:23,905
Deceit is in their DNA.

1138
01:25:27,084 --> 01:25:28,574
What'd you call it?

1139
01:25:28,652 --> 01:25:30,517
Cybernetic life-form node.

1140
01:25:31,489 --> 01:25:32,922
A cylon, minister.

1141
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,950
Hmm.

1142
01:25:35,226 --> 01:25:37,820
Cylon. Interesting.

1143
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:43,927
We did it, doctor.

1144
01:25:44,702 --> 01:25:46,260
Yes, we did.

1145
01:25:47,138 --> 01:25:49,732
Daniel: But it's not what I hoped for.

1146
01:27:15,826 --> 01:27:17,293
Yeah. Hello?

1147
01:27:18,362 --> 01:27:19,624
Lacy?

1148
01:27:23,234 --> 01:27:24,428
Who is this?

1149
01:27:25,336 --> 01:27:27,827
It's me. Zoe.

1150
01:27:29,473 --> 01:27:33,432
I'm here, and I think
I'm gonna need your help.

1151
01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:50,433
