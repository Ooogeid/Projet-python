1
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Pretty good fella,
but not good enough.

2
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,559
- Homo!
- Yeah, because I rule, basically...

3
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:42,520
Shit bender.
Ah, Kelly, you're stankin'!

4
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:45,000
What about you, you sweaty fuck!

5
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,560
Aargh! Get away, you scummer.

6
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,000
Later then!

7
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,110
What you think of that, then?

8
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,400
Tone?

9
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,231
What?

10
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Think of what?

11
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:11,600
The moves...
Me, Jonno and Kel worked it out.

12
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,760
It's OK.

13
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,031
Hey! Nothing to worry
about, dude. Yeah?

14
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah.

15
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,439
It's all right.

16
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,560
Everything's cool.

17
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,680
- Hi, Maxxie.
- Hey.

18
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:12,120
Hi.

19
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,000
Who's that?

20
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:15,440
That's Tony.

21
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:20,520
What's up with you?

22
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,240
I had a traumatic subdural haematoma

23
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,800
with motor and
perceptional complications.

24
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:28,538
Are you mental?

25
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,040
Yes.

26
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:33,000
I'd still give you one.

27
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,320
Totally. He's well fit.
Yeah, Queenie?

28
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,240
Yeah. He's buff.

29
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,240
Hey come on, Tone.
See you later, girls.

30
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,120
See you Maxxie! Bye!

31
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
I wanna give Maxxie one.

32
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,640
You can't. He's homosexual.

33
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,080
Bummer.

34
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
See? I remembered your favourite.

35
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Thanks.

36
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,160
You've grown, Tony.

37
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,880
And there's another two
inches in you, easy.

38
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
How's your Mum?

39
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,880
I don't remember you.

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,120
Oh, well.
We used to have lovely chats

41
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,199
when I was cleaning your mum's place.

42
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,640
You were such a clever little lad.

43
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm stupid now.

44
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,521
No.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
Here you go, mate.

46
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,399
Thanks, Mum.

47
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,760
Oh, we used to giggle.

48
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,138
Well, you never did know what
your mum was going to say next.

49
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:38,000
Ketchup, Mum?

50
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
Yeah, right.

51
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Bloody hilarious jokes she told.

52
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:44,508
<i>Filthy.</i>

53
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,044
<i>Oh, a right laugh, your mum.</i>

54
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,634
Mum?

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,640
I need to pee.

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,320
I can manage it myself usually.

57
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,920
Yeah, sorry.

58
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,360
Oh, fucking... fucking...
fucking thing!

59
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,440
Oh! Ooh.

60
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,360
Oooh!

61
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Ooh la la!

62
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,060
Yee-ha!

63
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,540
Oi, look out.
Here comes Batty Boy.

64
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,140
You wanna watch it, Dale.
He'll slip you a big fat cock!

65
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,180
No fucking way, man!

66
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,740
Cockety-cock-cock!

67
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,620
Or he'll slurp you a big fat cock!

68
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,060
A big fucking cock, yeah.
He'll be like, "All right, my lover!"

69
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,040
and wank you silly all over his face
and then tie you up and shoving

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,340
his big fat cock
right up your arse

71
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,860
and you wouldn't be able to fucking
stop him cos it's fucking torture.

72
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,820
You're shrieking and...

73
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,860
I'm just saying fucking homos,
though, innit?

74
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,220
Yeah, fucking homos.

75
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,020
Fuck 'em. We'll fuck them up.

76
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,540
- Fuckin' queers!
- Lads...

77
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,079
Yeah, fuckin' 'omos!

78
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Nice one, Taz!

79
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,660
Hey, Taz!

80
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,900
All right, love?

81
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,070
Tea's ready.

82
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,940
Nice routine, Dad.

83
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,760
Nice? It's gonna fucking
slay them at the regionals.

84
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:35,664
Cool.

85
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,420
I just wanted to ask, is it OK if
I drop out of my A-levels and...?

86
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,660
Come back?

87
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,660
I wanna leave college and
audition for musicals in London.

88
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:55,260
You're getting qualifications and
you're coming to me on the building.

89
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,880
But how's a history A-level
gonna help me be a builder?

90
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:01,076
You'll be an educated builder.

91
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:03,060
Dad, I want to be a dancer.

92
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,260
They have dancing every Thursday
down the centre. You love that.

93
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,059
- No, but...
- Pastimes.

94
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:09,590
That's what we're into.

95
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,600
- Dad...
- The rest isn't for us.

96
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,420
Get the dog.

97
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,157
Taz.

98
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,860
Fucking turd burglar.

99
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,399
Watch out, Dale.

100
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Fucking dog!

101
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,764
Quiet, boy.

102
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:37,996
You got something to say, kidder?

103
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:40,732
Say what I like.
Free country, innit?

104
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:44,324
Fair point.
But here's my suggestion, son.

105
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:47,160
You tell your Dad what
you said to Walter Oliver.

106
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:50,920
All right, my lover?

107
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,387
Lads...

108
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,440
- You got fucked up, man!
- Big, big time.

109
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:23,734
Sid?

110
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,140
Tony?

111
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,295
I need to pee.

112
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,820
My hands don't work.

113
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:40,280
Well, I always sorted you
out when you were a baby.

114
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:45,940
I got to register for college,
sign my name on a form.

115
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:49,400
But my head's forgotten bits of me.

116
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,740
All sorts of bits...

117
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:55,340
Give it time, love.

118
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,420
Just...

119
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,033
I can aim.

120
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:00,649
Right...

121
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,560
All right?

122
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,580
Oh, bloody hell, Tone!

123
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,639
You always did make me laugh.

124
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,900
You're making me miss.

125
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,280
You and every other bloke
in this sodding house.

126
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,860
Whatever happened
to that nice lass you had?

127
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,768
My God! OK, watch this!

128
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,100
Watch this
you bunch of pussy-fuckers, OK?

129
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,257
- One, two, three.
- Go!

130
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,340
Oh, my God!

131
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,318
- We on the right floor?
- Dunno, do I?

132
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:23,540
All right... angry boots.

133
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,260
I want to get ready
for the party.

134
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,660
Well, that'll take all of
about 30 seconds.

135
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,500
I get ready. I dress up.

136
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:33,410
Nah... that's what we love
about you, Jal... Unstudied.

137
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,322
Fucking hell... I dress up!

138
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:39,461
Is this the door?

139
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,300
You don't see that every day.

140
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,780
It's open!

141
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,020
That'll be Sid.
He's gonna take me home.

142
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,900
Oh... Chris... Jalander.

143
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,380
Oh, what a nice surprise.

144
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,340
Came just at the right time.

145
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,721
Right...

146
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,800
Where's Sid?

147
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,720
Ah! Hi, guys.

148
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,860
Hi, Tony, Chris.
Hello, funny name.

149
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,943
Where'd you lot spring from?

150
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:26,740
Just finished seeing to Tony.

151
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,157
Yeah. She was...

152
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,560
seeing to him...

153
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,180
Great. How are you, lad?

154
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,650
Better, thanks.
She's got warm hands.

155
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,999
Oh, they're lovely and warm.
Always say that.

156
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,700
So you're all dancing
the night away tonight, huh?

157
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,760
Yeah... bit of a party!

158
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,559
- It's not really a party.
- Yeah, that's right.

159
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,220
What party?

160
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:04,980
Look, sorry, Tone. But your mum
says we gotta take you home.

161
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:07,940
Maybe your folks think it's
a bit too soon to be going out.

162
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,220
Fuck my folks.

163
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,886
Where's Sid?

164
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,260
He couldn't make it, mate.

165
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,740
His dad made him stay in and...

166
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,893
Mow the grass.

167
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,463
Yeah, that's it.
He's mowing the grass.

168
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,500
He couldn't make it, Tony.

169
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,700
All right?
Sid couldn't make it...

170
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:03,780
<i>Hey! Hi, Sid!
When are you coming to see me?</i>

171
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,977
<i>Everyone's so lovely in Elgin.</i>

172
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:10,060
<i>Here's my new friends,
Rory and Lachlan.</i>

173
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:13,790
- <i>All right, wee man?</i>
- <i>Hello there, Sidney.</i>

174
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,060
<i>Rory's going to let me
blow his chanter later.</i>

175
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,460
<i>It's easy.
Ye just need to learn tae finger it.</i>

176
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,860
<i>And I've already been
beating Lachlan's bodhran.</i>

177
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,072
<i>Magic! Aye!</i>

178
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,101
- What?!
- <i>I'm not very good.</i>

179
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,740
<i>Aye, ye are!</i>

180
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,610
<i>Anyway, there's a present in there,
Sid. And watch what I can do.</i>

181
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,780
Mighty fucking Scotland.

182
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:14,381
<i>Hoots!</i>

183
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,580
Don't you care what I want?!
Don't I get to decide?

184
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,680
Yeah. You're gonna decide to be a
builder who dances in his spare time.

185
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,658
I don't want to be
a fucking builder!

186
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:26,067
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing. Nothing.

187
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:28,360
I just... I can do this, Dad!

188
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,748
You don't think I can do it, do you?

189
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,000
No, lad.

190
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,600
Fucking hell! Thanks, Dad.

191
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,435
It's not my fault, is it!?

192
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:41,593
What?

193
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:44,087
That you're stuck in a fucking
white van all your life.

194
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:47,199
Don't you speak to me like that! I'll
clout you round the fucking earhole.

195
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,911
Like you clout the fucking dog?!

196
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,063
Don't bring the fucking dog into it.

197
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:53,062
I'll have no fucking
swearing in this house.

198
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,399
Mum fucking swears
at you all the time.

199
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,620
Don't wait.

200
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,500
We said we'd take you home.

201
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,940
Don't wanna go home.

202
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,400
# Groove upon the party

203
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,940
# Yo, when I'm cruising
in my Lamborghini

204
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,962
# The chicks see me, they go,

205
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,340
# "Mmm, wow, he's so sexy"

206
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,580
# And I might get my shot
for the end of the night

207
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,700
# Cos pussy is pussy and baby,
you're pussy for life

208
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
# I wanna fuck you, fuck you

209
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:29,620
# You already know

210
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,980
# I wanna fuck you, fuck you... #

211
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,300
Argh! Ow!

212
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,340
Oh... Fuckin' hell...

213
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,220
Sorry.

214
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:40,980
I gotta remember
to stand pimp in these.

215
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,611
What's happening, "blood"?

216
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:45,834
I'm in for some serious slippy-slidey
todger action at this party, man!

217
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,500
It's not... really a party.

218
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,719
Are you pissing me?

219
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:52,980
It's the biggest night of the year.
Everybody's going!

220
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,450
Yeah, except Tony.

221
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,320
Shame, man. It's gonna be...

222
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:04,500
Tony can't go. Remember?

223
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:08,560
Fuckers...

224
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,000
Come on, mate.

225
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,300
I told you to keep quiet
about the sodding rave.

226
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,735
And why are you dressed
as a crack dealer?

227
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,363
You think it's too much?

228
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:22,875
If I'd just met you,

229
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:24,834
I'd rather slit my wrists
than give you one.

230
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,953
That's because you don't
give anyone one.

231
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,455
Watch out or they'll take
your tits into care.

232
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,460
Because they don't get out enough.

233
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:35,500
You geddit? Your tits...

234
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,319
Hello, Mr Stonem.

235
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,550
Wondered where you were.

236
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,839
Thanks for bringing him back.

237
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,980
That's all right.
No problem. Maybe we'll pop round...

238
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:54,607
tomorrow.

239
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,276
Let's go get fucked.

240
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,544
Are you not going
to have anything, Tony?

241
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,367
No.

242
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,241
OK.

243
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,524
So, um, what did you get up to today?

244
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:14,934
He shouldn't be going out!

245
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,400
He's wandering around,
God knows where...

246
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,280
We don't even know who he's with!
He could have a bleed or a fit or...

247
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,280
Yeah, Jim. He's here.

248
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,520
Oh, fuck it.

249
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,700
Fuck it.

250
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,860
Fuck it.

251
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,240
All right, all right. Just...
for Christ's sake, eat something!

252
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,266
Look, Mum's made it easy.

253
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,471
It's all... lovely and...

254
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,040
bite-sized.

255
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,420
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

256
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,180
Come on, let's talk about
something else. Come on.

257
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,840
Yeah, yeah.
What do you want to talk about?

258
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,100
Dirty jokes.

259
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,140
What?

260
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,300
Maxxie's mum says
your jokes are filthy.

261
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,760
You saw Jackie Oliver today?

262
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,260
Jackie probably was thinking
about someone else. Right, Anthea?

263
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, yeah...

264
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:13,380
Anyway... This mate of mine's
been going to the doctor.

265
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,540
Who's that?

266
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,860
Er, don't think you know him.
Um, anyway he had to have some tests,

267
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,140
had palpitations or something...
So, he eventually goes back

268
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,020
to the doctor to get the results
and, er, the doctor says,

269
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,840
"Sit down. I'm afraid there's
good news and there's bad news.

270
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,679
"The bad news is
you've only got a month to live."

271
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:33,480
My mate's like,
devastated, he's gutted.

272
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:37,511
But he pulls himself together and
he says, "What's the good news?"

273
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,687
And the doctor says,
"See my new receptionist?

274
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,900
"Blonde. Great arse. Huge tits.

275
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,670
"Well, I'm fucking her."

276
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,346
That's crap.

277
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,362
Yeah...

278
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,810
My name's Anthea Stonem.
Thank you and good night.

279
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,767
They'll take her tits into care...

280
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,980
They're gonna...

281
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,220
They don't get out enough!

282
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,860
I got it!

283
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
I got it!

284
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,180
Look, I've told you before, he's not
leaving college. That's it!

285
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,883
You don't need to be such
a monster man about it!

286
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,339
Who's being a monster man?

287
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,444
You is.

288
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:42,799
What's eating you,
you big old bully!?

289
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,780
Nothing! Nothing.
Just leave it alone.

290
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,740
He's not leaving, that's final.

291
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,420
All right, Walter.

292
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:00,860
Bandy... How you doin'?

293
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:03,540
Only passable, Walter.

294
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,900
It seems like my Dale
has overstepped his mouth.

295
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,500
Little misunderstanding, that's it.

296
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,140
What have you gotta say, dildohead?

297
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,740
Sorry, Mr Oliver.

298
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,189
And...?

299
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,580
Sorry, Max.

300
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:26,420
He's baked a cake of remorse.

301
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,517
Very nice.

302
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:39,599
So we're all right then, Walter?

303
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,580
Water under the bridge, Bandy.
How's the wife?

304
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,519
Oh, not bad.
They gave her early release.

305
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:47,279
Still gotta wear
the electronic tag, of course.

306
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,820
Bummer.

307
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,020
And they've banned her for life

308
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:54,920
from operating a concrete mixer
or a cattle prod.

309
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,319
It's probably for the best.

310
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Oh, Tony! For fuck's sake. Come on!

311
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:08,111
Fucking hell.

312
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:09,660
Get off!

313
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,620
Oh, fuck.

314
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,060
<i>Tony?</i>

315
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,159
<i>Are you all right?</i>

316
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:02,584
No.

317
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,020
Nobody wants me
to come out any more.

318
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,719
<i>Oh, fuck it. Come anyway.</i>

319
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,860
<i>My dad won't let me
go back to college.</i>

320
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,380
And mine won't let me leave.

321
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,220
We're both bummed, bruv.

322
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,720
<i>Why doesn't Sid come any more?</i>

323
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,662
Can't remember when he was here.

324
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,232
<i>He misses you, Tony.</i>

325
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,500
I miss me.

326
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,300
Come out. I'll get you dancing.

327
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:33,440
<i>Yeah?</i>

328
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,620
You gonna gay me?

329
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,660
<i>Hey... Tony's here.</i>

330
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,220
Who's that?

331
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,340
Hello, everybody.

332
00:26:58,437 --> 00:27:02,641
I'd like to sing a little ditty
that I hope you'll rather enjoy.

333
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,319
Alastair, would you mind
pressing play, please?

334
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:07,540
Thanks awfully.

335
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,879
Gimme a riddim blood. Mi
gonna tear it up with a back ender.

336
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:17,220
I wanna hear it big, blud.
I wanna hear it hit out, blud!

337
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,740
I wanna hear it massive!
Cos we're takin' it uptown!

338
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:17,451
Hey! Maxxie!

339
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:18,681
Monkey Man!

340
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,188
Fuck me...

341
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,042
You're just a kid.

342
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:11,859
- You're mental.
- Thanks.

343
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,100
Ready?

344
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,890
Hey, Jal! Where's your moves?

345
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,900
Fuck me senseless.

346
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,920
Whoa!

347
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:02,380
Yeah. He's hot, man.

348
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,740
Ah, you gay boy!

349
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,220
Here I come, Cas. I'm coming!

350
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,180
It's OK, Tony.

351
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,740
Come on.

352
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,100
No way. Look who's coming.

353
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,340
It's Tony Stonem.

354
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,060
Oh, my God!

355
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:58,380
Tony, hi! You look so OK.

356
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,940
Not like... Well, they said
you were like a total mong,

357
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,780
and I would have been so pissed
if you were a vegetable

358
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,820
and had to be switched off, yah?

359
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,641
- Do I know you?
- Tony! You do...

360
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,380
You know me really rather well.

361
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,460
Remember?

362
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,020
You were a very naughty boy.

363
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,900
But I forgive you...

364
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,020
Is it all still working, yah?

365
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:24,479
Sorry. Can't place you.

366
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:27,999
You remember, Tony. How you said
I was like your total dream shag?

367
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,999
Said that?

368
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:31,959
Because Michelle had the funny tits,
and was so boring,

369
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:35,540
and you wanted to go out with me cos
I had the longest tongue you ever...

370
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,180
He can't... place you.

371
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:42,140
Come on, Tone.

372
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,700
Tongue?

373
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,500
Oh, yeah.

374
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,120
Get off!

375
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,580
Help!

376
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,460
Wanna get out!

377
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,020
Tony!

378
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,380
Get the fuck out my way, will you!

379
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,189
Tony!

380
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,340
Tone?

381
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,250
Stop fucking about, yeah?

382
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:44,500
Wait... Wait.

383
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:52,040
All right, Blowjob.

384
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,999
Faggot.

385
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,239
Cocksucker!

386
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:58,060
- Wanker!
- All right, gay boy?

387
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,980
Fucking get him! Get him!

388
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,380
Tossers.

389
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,039
Sent them the other way.

390
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,599
The fucking cake.

391
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:08,260
I should've knew it when I saw
the hundreds and thousands.

392
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:11,358
Lemon Drizzle. It's a piece of piss.

393
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,220
Dale.

394
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,119
You can't just
treat me like shit and then just...

395
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,300
Just...

396
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,479
Ah... fuck it!

397
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,540
Jim? What's wrong?

398
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,980
Sorry it's so late...

399
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,559
I've lost Tony.

400
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,500
He doesn't answer his phone.

401
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,100
I don't even know if he can.

402
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,860
I can't keep him in. But...

403
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,319
He's not right.

404
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,690
Who is?

405
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,239
Everything's mental.

406
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,260
This competition last week.

407
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,940
Fucking break-dancing chihuahua.

408
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,919
I mean, what's it come to?

409
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,151
Right.

410
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,260
You never know what's gonna happen
till you're sitting in a hospital.

411
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,317
And I'm thinking, I've really,
really fucked up here,

412
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,591
because I'm supposed
to stop this happening.

413
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,855
And now I don't know where he is.

414
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,220
Something happens,
suddenly you've lost them.

415
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,980
His friends'll look after him.

416
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,239
What you on?

417
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:07,010
Cass sent me a tab.

418
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,160
She misses you, right?

419
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,590
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

420
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,480
I go to see him.

421
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,756
I went to see him.

422
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,600
Well, I suppose
you deserve some fun.

423
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,880
Those guys just like my tits.

424
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:35,310
Oh. Sweet.

425
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,036
You're avoiding me.

426
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,720
You make me think about him.

427
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,968
You're not the only one, Chelle.

428
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:50,880
I was there every day trying
to get him to say something.

429
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:55,240
And everybody really, really
fucked up and I'm just trying to...

430
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,640
And nobody comes but me
cos it's so terrible.

431
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,279
You should have fucking helped me.

432
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,760
All right!

433
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,040
When it happened...

434
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,399
before the bus...

435
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,947
... he was on the phone,

436
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,920
... he was on the phone

437
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,839
I don't think he remembers.

438
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,543
- But he said...
- Chelle.

439
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:28,262
Fuck's sake, I'm trying
to tell you this!

440
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Oh, Jesus!

441
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,319
Tony?

442
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,439
Hello.

443
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:55,000
Wait, I'll go back with you.

444
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,840
Effy's taking me.

445
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,130
I will remember everything.

446
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Where are you going?

447
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,879
Not now, Sid!

448
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,160
Got lost.

449
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,880
Where do I fucking live?

450
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,560
Walter will run him round
in the morning.

451
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,720
Look, don't worry yourselves, OK.

452
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,159
She's a bit upset.

453
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,479
Yeah.

454
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,999
College starts today.

455
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,839
He's in there, love.

456
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,120
Talking, not shouting.

457
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
OK.

458
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,319
Lovely bit of cake, that.

459
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,439
Young Dale's got the magic touch.

460
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,770
He's got that all right.

461
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,431
You're good enough.

462
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,440
Yeah. I am.

463
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,319
I'm bloody good.

464
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:27,719
Get it from your old man, probably.

465
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,573
Reckon?

466
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,623
I'm artistic, yeah.

467
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,239
Not as artistic as you, mind.

468
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,298
Some things is just
the way they are.

469
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,610
Yup.

470
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,639
I got lucky, didn't I?

471
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,080
You didn't turn out like
the fucking ASBO Army out there.

472
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,560
No, Dad.

473
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,720
I feel like taking some
fucking credit for it. OK?

474
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,199
I'm never gonna be a builder, Dad.

475
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,130
You'll understand this one day, kid.

476
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:10,799
You're everything
I've got to show for my life.

477
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,907
And I'm not ready for you to go,

478
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,119
because I fucking love you too much.

479
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,399
I'm an idiot, I know.

480
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,279
I love you too, Dad.

481
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,199
So if you're not coming building,
back to college.

482
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,400
Give me the last year.

483
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,119
And then it's game on. All right?

484
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:40,479
All right.

485
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,159
Taz. On your bed.

486
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,750
At least the sodding dog
does what he's told.

487
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,120
I can register if I write my name.

488
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,720
It's more than that, Tony.

489
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,400
It's not just signing your name.

490
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,959
Then fucking help me!

491
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,200
Or are you gonna be
a complete fucking arse-wit

492
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,000
like everyone fucking else I know?

493
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,440
Whoa! He speaks.

494
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,320
You gotta slow it down.

495
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,600
Stop trying to write.

496
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,880
It's just a shape your hand makes.

497
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,080
Close your eyes and just kinda...

498
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,640
dance it.

499
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,240
Tone.

500
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,360
Do I have to gay you now?

501
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,559
Resync: Nathbot

502
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:17,760
Who are you?

503
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,359
Shit!

504
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,199
Hang on...

505
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,839
You're fucking crazy!

506
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,320
