1
00:00:01,214 --> 00:00:04,106
I met a girl I like today.
She's like... beautiful.

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:05,596
Emily Fitch...

3
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:07,400
Emms, you oughta spruce up, yeah?

4
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:09,412
Get some decent threads like Katie.

5
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:10,732
Katie Fitch...

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,960
well, here it comes. She tried to
snog my sister at middle school.

7
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:17,200
- Naomi Campbell...
- People tell lies about me.

8
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:19,040
Jonah Jeremia Jones...

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,310
Prestissimo!!

10
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:21,748
James Cook...

11
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:24,918
Pandora Moon...

12
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:25,840
Bonkers!

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,226
Elizabeth Stonem...

14
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:28,800
We could get to know each other.

15
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:31,680
Fill in the fonn. First one to fill
it out gets to...

16
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,668
get to know me.

17
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:37,039
Grab my balls... Grab my balls...
Grab my balls... balls.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,200
Synchro: mpm, Arrow

19
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:43,505
Get on home...

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,251
Dude, calm down a bit
It's like 5 o'clock.

21
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:54,036
Neighbours hasn't even started yet.

22
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,388
Actually, no, no sorry.

23
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:58,947
I'm so fucking stoked, man.

24
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,889
I'm 17 today!

25
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,920
That's an event horizon,
that's a milestone.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,760
Isn't 18 traditionally the age...

27
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:06,177
Fuck tradition.

28
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:08,375
Just hope some people tum up.

29
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,482
- They'll come.
- You invited half the college.

30
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:13,752
All I know is that it
involves my dick getting damp.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,123
What are you looking at,
you posh student bastards?

32
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:19,093
Fuck off back to playgroup.

33
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:21,585
Fucking wankers, come here.

34
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:22,640
Come here...

35
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,316
Come on, leave it Forget 'em.

36
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:27,805
Ah, we're here.

37
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:35,250
- Hello boys.
- All right, Christina.

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,770
Ay, ay lads,
here's the birthday boy.

39
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:40,348
- Did you do all this?
- Took me a long time,

40
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,433
a good forty, forty five minutes.

41
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:45,520
You all right?

42
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:49,034
Touch of pain in the privates,
it's the old whore wound.

43
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,212
Nothing I can't handle.

44
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,480
These are me boys, Freddie, JJ.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,040
Boys, this is Uncle Keith.

46
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:57,400
Pull my finger!

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,171
You dirty old bugger!

48
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:13,935
- If you'd be so kind, Christina?
- Right you are, big boy.

49
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,972
And when I woke up,
the pool was three feet deep in piss.

50
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,385
Mum, I shouted, don't jump in!
But it was too late.

51
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:26,386
So, you and the Buxton Rovers under 21s
managed to do that in one night?

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,208
Just me, the lads,
and a shit load of all-inclusive mild.

53
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,888
And they never pinned it on me.

54
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:35,437
Plus, you got to remember,
this was 1962.

55
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:38,953
I mean, Pontin's was a fairly
permissive place back then.

56
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,080
Bit like Afghanistan in the 70s.

57
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,040
But with the Krankies
and slightly more Taliban.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,120
Tell that one where you hit Dylan over
the head with a box of fish fingers.

59
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,180
Another time.
I've gotta go and see a man about a dog.

60
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:53,901
A dog filled with drugs.

61
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:57,167
See you boys.
Oh, happy birthday, Cookie.

62
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,828
That, my friends,
is what you call a legend.

63
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,515
To who, exactly?

64
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:12,040
- What?
- Who is he a legend to?

65
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:13,767
Me.

66
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:17,560
Blokes in pubs. Christina.
People.

67
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,954
- I think the guy's crazy.
- Exactly man.

68
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,174
Exactly.

69
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,603
Same again please, Christina.

70
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:33,043
Look, man. Look at that quality totty.
That's top shelf shit.


71
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,872
Guys, guys, hey baby...

72
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:39,033
I'm so happy to introduce you
to my legendary night out

73
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,653
in celebration of my birthday.

74
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,303
- Apart from you.
- But I...

75
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:45,440
what are you doing here!
You burnt my house, man! Get out!

76
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,131
What the fuck!

77
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:54,086
I'm 17 today, so all bets are off.
Do what the fuck you like.


78
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,452
Flush your mates down the toilet.
Eat grapes off each other.

79
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,097
Smash speakers over your heads.

80
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:00,955
If partying's a crime,
who's gonna get arrested first?

81
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,604
Let's go fucking mental!

82
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:09,993
Party people!

83
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,634
Thanks man, thank you very much.

84
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,884
What's next?

85
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:29,605
Oh, yeah. More drinks! More drinks!

86
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:33,125
More drinks! More drinks!
More drinks! More drinks! Yeah?

87
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,791
- He's fun.
- You have no idea.

88
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:40,456
He's had half a bottle of vodka.

89
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,360
Really? How crazy!

90
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:46,280
Tequila! Who's in?

91
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,560
- Anyone else?
- Yeah, go on then.

92
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:51,800
Airwolf.

93
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:53,520
Let's go, man.

94
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,960
- Do you wanna see your birthday trick?
- Lay it on me, magic man.

95
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,910
One pint of normal drinking water.

96
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,174
You'll like this one.
I've seen it before.

97
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:20,794
What? He does magic?

98
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,565
Shazam, motherfucker!

99
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,462
- Cook, what you doing?
- That's minging.


100
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,148
- What is wrong with you?
- Yes! Come on!

101
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,240
Someone's been drinking...

102
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,208
milkshake?

103
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:56,277
- Strawberry milkshake. Am I right?
- Yes. How did you know?

104
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:57,902
Am I ninja, or am I not a ninja?

105
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,840
Christina, we've had rejection.

106
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:04,703
We need a bucket,
a mop and 16 shots of tequila!

107
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:23,399
Great,

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
it's the lesbian come to gay us up.

109
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,800
- I've told you to fucking...
- Leave it.

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,512
Hi, everyone.

111
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,439
- Want to know a secret?
- What?

112
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,184
I know the cure.

113
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:42,560
The cure for what?

114
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:44,201
It's my cock.

115
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,000
What the hell are you talking about?

116
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:52,892
Hey, look what I made.

117
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,118
Cake! Top, man, fucking top!

118
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:58,000
- It's double chocolate chip cookie.
- Cheers, girl.

119
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,952
Cake. My cake! Mine!

120
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,455
Fucking good, man...

121
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,040
Thank you, man.

122
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:49,577
- You OK?
- Yep. Totally cool. Just a bit...

123
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,076
you know,

124
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,000
full.

125
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:55,127
- Can't believe you ate the whole thing.
- Someone had to get this party started.

126
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,390
Party? Do you call this a party?

127
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,762
Where's the conversation?

128
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,677
Where's the dancing?
Where are the men?

129
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,784
- We're men.
- You're boys.

130
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:06,220
Do you want to measure my dick?
It's daddy-sized.

131
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,269
So you lot think
this party's shit, yeah?

132
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,723
It's a little bit...

133
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,440
- It could be...
- It's shit.

134
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:20,490
Shit.

135
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,107
Something's got to happen, man.
Something big.

136
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:26,840
Come on, man.

137
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:29,846
I'm ready! Just tell me when.
Give me a sign!

138
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:36,098
What?

139
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,916
But where are you, I can't hear...

140
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,836
I don't have anything, OK?

141
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,043
- Who is it?
- My sister, Karen.

142
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:44,613
Tell her I said hi.

143
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,607
No, I haven't got anything, OK?
You'll have to find your own.

144
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,206
No, I don't have any drugs! Bye.

145
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:53,232
- Why couldn't you hear her?
- She's at a party.

146
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:55,214
Her mate Kayleigh's getting hitched.

147
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,965
So it'll be free bar,
free entry, that kind of thing?

148
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,635
Yeah, I suppose, why?

149
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:03,320
No way!

150
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,025
Why not?

151
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:08,720
Cos my sister's there, and I don't want
to see her. Plus, she doesn't like you.

152
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,360
Why not? I'm always touching
her and flirting with her.

153
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,318
Her tits stand to attention
when I'm around. I've seen it.

154
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:16,009
Listen to me, we're not going.

155
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:17,277
No. No way.

156
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,407
Come on everybody, cos

157
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:27,881
yeah, we're going to a party!

158
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:30,059
All right?

159
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:33,644
- Not coming in.
- Why not?

160
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:34,921
Private party.

161
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:38,163
Plus underage.
Plus don't like look of you.

162
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,400
Not coming in.

163
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,483
Listen to me, robot.

164
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:45,040
You may rank way above me
in tems of strength and size,

165
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,370
Now can you let me in?

166
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,238
Not coming in.

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,670
Listen, fate has brought me here.

168
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:59,511
Do you understand?
You're not letting fate in the club.

169
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,280
It's not like fate
is wearing trainers.

170
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,880
Fate just wants a couple of drinks,
a little dance.

171
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,670
And fate is actually also desperate
for the toilet. Now can we come in?

172
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,440
How about you fuck off?

173
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:11,440
How about you're a fucking cock?

174
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,301
I'll fucking break
your fucking face, mate!

175
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,560
- What?
- I'll fucking break your fucking face.

176
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,920
You'll get your fucking
head kicked in here!

177
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:23,244
- Come on! Fucking prick.
- Just chill out, yeah?

178
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:25,878
I don't think he's
going to let us in.

179
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,799
He's just an obstacle.
We're meant to go this party.

180
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,850
Fate'll sort it. Just wait.

181
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,021
What the fuck are you doing here?

182
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,279
Hi, Karen.

183
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,320
- It's private.
- Don't be like that, sis'.

184
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,999
- It's Cook's birthday.
- Unless you've got drugs, fuck off,

185
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,365
- and take your friends with you.
- Come on Karen.

186
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:46,520
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

187
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,741
Yeah. Look, it's not my decision.
It's her party.

188
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,180
I'm getting married.

189
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,600
Congratulations.

190
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:57,799
Jesus.

191
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,120
Will you let us in?

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,890
Well, there is a pretty
strict dress code.

193
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,170
How strict

194
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,217
exactly?

195
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,797
Let's cock and roll, baby!

196
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:32,600
Isn't it lush?

197
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,880
- Daddy says nothing's too good for me.
- You got that right, babe.

198
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,840
So, who you marrying?

199
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,439
Oh, just some guy.

200
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,959
- He's a bit of a twat,
- Cheers, man.

201
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,960
When she said "party"...

202
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:49,183
You thought she meant an acid-fuelled
sex rave without the Mancunians.

203
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,280
- This is more...
- Jelly and ice cream.

204
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,255
Get it down you, girls.

205
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,280
Top freebies, yeah?
Love it.

206
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,720
Gross. I hate champagne.

207
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:06,076
- Why you fucking drinking it, then?
- It's free.

208
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:07,383
Dad!

209
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,327
Hi! This is Cookie...

210
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,480
Finish your drink, kid.

211
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:17,694
Have as much as you like.

212
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,080
Nothing's too good
for my Kayleigh... Right?

213
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,049
Right.

214
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,855
And I wouldn't want anything
to ruin the evening...

215
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:26,189
drop the tone...

216
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:28,434
Anything at all.

217
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:30,883
OK?

218
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
Right you are.

219
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,940
Enjoy.

220
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,212
Kayleigh. You're almost a woman...

221
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:42,773
Thanks, Daddy.

222
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,144
Almost.

223
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,925
See you around, Cookie.

224
00:13:56,276 --> 00:13:58,332
- You twat. Didn't you know?
- Fuck it, man.

225
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:00,448
- I'm just getting started.
- What's the fuss?

226
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:03,465
- He's Johnny White. The gangster.
- Yeah. Legend.

227
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,360
- He murdered 2 nuns over a pint.
- Allegedly.

228
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,990
I hear he stabbed a policeman
in the neck with a stuffed guillemot.

229
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,522
That's so not true.

230
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,920
It was a puffin.

231
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:14,797
So.

232
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,100
Who's for narcotics?

233
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,392
- Me.
- Me.

234
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,087
What?

235
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:22,302
I've decided I love drugs.

236
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:40,030
- What is it?
- Uncle Keith's special blend.

237
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,692
A hallucinogenic opiate
and stimulant.

238
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:46,063
Four hours of
THC giggles and MDMA highs

239
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,160
with a transcendental kicker.

240
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,720
- Sounds good.
- Well, come on, then. Jesus.

241
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:53,080
All in good time, babes.

242
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:54,633
Weird girl?

243
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:55,851
Hold that.

244
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,891
Fuck's sakes,
are we getting any or what?!

245
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,263
No, no. Wait!

246
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,840
Hang on, what you doing?

247
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:08,721
What?
Was that wrong?

248
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,391
- Did you just swallow my drugs?
- She's fucking finished it!

249
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,817
- It tastes horrible!
- You're not supposed to eat it!

250
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,640
It goes up the nose, you twat.

251
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,639
Let's go fly a kite, girl!

252
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,142
What about us?

253
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:23,920
You can drink some of the weird girl's
blood, she's like a walking syringe.

254
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:27,040
- My mouth's gone all numb.
- I'm not surprised!

255
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,120
We've done ours, let's go!

256
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,835
Come on Panders, we're out of here.

257
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:35,522
I said
you shouldn't have let them in.

258
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,442
- Where's the love?
- You're a wanker, james.

259
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:45,680
You will get us some more,
won't you, Cookie?

260
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,057
Cos if you could,

261
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,018
that would be

262
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,446
God

263
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,680
really, really great.

264
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,050
- I need more class A drugs, quick.
- Why?

265
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,531
Cos that Kayleigh girl
just gave me the look.

266
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,201
- What sort of look is that?
- This one.

267
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:26,220
Right I see what you mean.

268
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,786
Freddie,
we've got to get this man some drugs.

269
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:29,852
Why?

270
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:32,038
Do the look.

271
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,598
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm getting laid tonight.

272
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,349
Please, not Kayleigh.
Think of me and JJ.

273
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:42,352
- You're not fucking her.
- I thought you liked Effy.

274
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah, she's a peach. But I already
tapped that top-dollar shag.

275
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,559
She's my last resort sure thing,
I reckon.

276
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,038
You shagged Effy?

277
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:51,608
Come on, Freds.

278
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,800
- When?
- First day I met her.

279
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,874
Why didn't you tell us?

280
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,073
Because apart from those times
when my cock is up your ass,

281
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:07,044
you have no reason to worry
about where it is the rest of the time.

282
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:08,164
But...

283
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:11,702
... JJ likes her.

284
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,914
I was going to ask her out I mean,

285
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:19,560
- she seemed like she liked me.
- You snooze, you lose, dude.

286
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,920
I've got a snake in my dick
that's about to throw up.

287
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:45,413
- Wait!
- What?

288
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,784
- Where are you going?
- Home.

289
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:50,797
Don't go.

290
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:52,673
Why not?

291
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:53,840
I dunno.

292
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:55,643
Because...

293
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,489
Why does your sister think I'm gay?

294
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:03,865
Sorry.

295
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:07,403
See you around, Emily.

296
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,986
Thank you. Yes, please.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

297
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,750
The father of the bride,
Mr Johnny White.

298
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:24,672
So...

299
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,400
My daughter's getting married and
she couldn't have chosen a nicer bloke,

300
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,958
Steve Heston.

301
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:36,560
Unfortunately, he couldn't attend today
without violating his probation.

302
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:41,280
He couldn't be here himself, but he is
represented by members of his family.

303
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:43,848
Welcome, Hestons. No more rucks.

304
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,341
No more knives. No more pliers.

305
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:50,191
We're gonna be tight
as a badger's bum.

306
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,880
The Whites and the Hestons brought
together in the marriage bed,

307
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:56,713
still fucking each other,
but in a good way.

308
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:02,592
Come up here, sweetheart.

309
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:15,782
You've kept yourself pure
for so long for this task of peace.

310
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,696
In times of strife,
you've lit up my life,

311
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:22,064
and now you're gonna be
Steve's wife.

312
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,840
And I just want to say...

313
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,830
Don't she look a picture?

314
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,883
I could just eat her.

315
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:52,280
Right, charge your glasses
with free booze, and raise 'em.

316
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,840
Kayleigh and Steve.

317
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,673
Pandora, wake up, you dozy cow.

318
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:03,273
Hi. It's me.

319
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:07,875
I need a favour.

320
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:17,178
Uncle Keith!

321
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:18,845
All right, Cookie?

322
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:20,840
- Cheers.
- Not a problem.

323
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:24,480
There you go.
Direct from Weston-super-Mare.

324
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,240
- You're a lifesaver, Keith.
- Gotta go, Cook.

325
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:29,336
Gotta see a dog about a bone.

326
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:31,106
A bone that is my cock.

327
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,520
Get it out, then.

328
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,960
Not that. The drugs, idiot.

329
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:43,334
Thank you.

330
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:59,352
Is that all you're doing?

331
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,640
That was a hamster-sized bump.
Don't you want any more?

332
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,179
OK, I'll see you later!

333
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:17,286
- What? I thought we were gonna bone.
- And what made you think that?

334
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,473
You've had the drugs and you
gave me the look.

335
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:21,343
- What look?
- This one.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,960
- What the fuck?
- The "I'll fuck for drugs" look.

337
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,440
- Now stop arguing and get on my cock.
- What?

338
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,160
- Blow me, then. My dick is clean.
- I don't care!

339
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,225
Hand-job?

340
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:33,226
But you've got to let me have a go on
your tits whilst you're doing it.

341
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:34,371
Listen...

342
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:37,534
If anyone's going to get
a lick of my fanny,

343
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:39,383
they'll have to impress me.

344
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,640
So... if you do...

345
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:43,920
I'll let you stick it anywhere.

346
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:46,063
My tits,

347
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,308
my arse,

348
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:48,966
my armpit...

349
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,849
anywhere.

350
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,238
You're filthy.

351
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,165
Yes, I am.

352
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,516
And look, no knickers.

353
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,800
See ya!

354
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:35,269
- What's he doing now?
- Is he going to sing?

355
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:41,159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
dedicate this to a very special lady.</i>

356
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,520
Shit. This is going to be bad.

357
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,108
I'm upset, Cookie.

358
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:43,029
You made me look like a fucking idiot
and I'm not used to that, you know?

359
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:44,386
Are you sure?

360
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:46,240
Stick him up on there.

361
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:49,899
I wanna teach this fucker
a lesson he'll never forget.

362
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,265
See. You tried to ruin
my lovely party.

363
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:58,955
And now,

364
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:00,184
really

365
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:02,280
really bad things are gonna happen.

366
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:05,004
It was worth it.
Her tits were mint.

367
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:09,819
He's very sorry.

368
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,600
I'll take him home,
and we're leaving.

369
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:16,196
We don't want to upset
your beautiful daughter any more.

370
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:18,931
You're right.

371
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:20,488
She is beautiful.

372
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:23,594
It's your lucky day.

373
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:26,560
Let him go.

374
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:29,440
Not like that, you tossers!

375
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:31,960
My fucking dress!

376
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:35,160
Fucking hell, Johnny,
you fucking told... oh, fuck.

377
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,692
Look at my tracksuit,
you weasely little prick!

378
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:47,540
What'd you say?

379
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:51,720
You're a weasely cunting prick!

380
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:55,592
You fucking Hobbit!
And we've all fucked your daughter.

381
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:56,941
Ain't we, lads?

382
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
What'd you fucking say?

383
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:24,662
OK. That's far enough.

384
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:26,211
Cool party!

385
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,497
Cheers.

386
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,520
You're fucking unbelievable.

387
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,004
I needed to get laid, man.

388
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:35,318
You're always fucking
trying to get laid.

389
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:37,138
I try. I succeed. Right?

390
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:42,626
Speaking of which,
any of you girls fancy it?

391
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,240
No, thanks.

392
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,102
You're repulsive!

393
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:52,692
Weird girl.

394
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,600
You're beautiful, but no.

395
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,968
My tuppence feels all funny.


396
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:07,756
How about it then, Peachy?
Looks like it's just me and you.

397
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,859
Come on, Amy winehouse. Home.

398
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,261
See ya!

399
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:29,909
Come on, we'll go somewhere else.
Somewhere with women.

400
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:33,832
- I ain't going anywhere.
- Why the fuck not?

401
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,760
I'm tired.
I'm going home, all right?

402
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:39,913
It's two o'clock. What the fuck are
you talking about, "you're tired"?

403
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:43,348
I'm tired of you, mate.

404
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,799
What's that supposed to mean?

405
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:49,040
It means I can't look
after you any more.

406
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,231
I can't do it.

407
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,591
Fuck you then!

408
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,044
Go on, fuck off home!

409
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,272
Coming then?

410
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:09,835
Sure.

411
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,797
Let's go find some fucking women.

412
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,320
What is this place?

413
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,381
It's just a club.

414
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,793
Late night thing, you know?
Lots of girls. Friendly.

415
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,420
My stars and garters!

416
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:13,650
All right, my lover?

417
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,345
Looking for a sex dance?

418
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:34,091
- You like Frankie?
- Hello, darlings.

419
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:35,843
She's double jointed.

420
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:38,640
So?

421
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,245
Slinky! But we're actually after...

422
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,931
the other service.

423
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:45,795
Bit of the other?

424
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:48,040
Stepping this way, please.

425
00:31:49,412 --> 00:31:50,794
- The other service?

426
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:53,930
Tonight's your lucky night, Gayjay.
You get to lose your virginity

427
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,380
to an odds-on
moderately pretty girl.

428
00:31:57,004 --> 00:31:59,211
- I'm not sure I want to.
- Listen to me.

429
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:02,084
Are you a fucking
scrawny little mousy queer boy,

430
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:05,149
or are you a man with a functioning
set of cock and balls?

431
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:09,800
- The second one.
- Good. Come on, let's get our fuck on.

432
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,864
What sort of thing
are you looking for?

433
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:23,840
- I'd like a woman with big tits.
- And you?

434
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:26,546
Same thing.

435
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:28,406
But not too big, right?

436
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,760
I know the perfect girls for you.

437
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:34,840
Amber!

438
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,423
Megan!

439
00:32:39,862 --> 00:32:41,268
All right, gorgeous?

440
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:42,701
This way.

441
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,920
And Megan. Here she is.

442
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:48,507
Curly hair!

443
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:53,879
So, will you let me
do anything I ask you?

444
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:56,204
Anything. But it'll cost you, mind.

445
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:59,338
- How much to whack you up the cracker?
- Hundred.

446
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,201
That's a lot more than I've got.

447
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:06,453
How much for your straight ahead,

448
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,829
run of the mill,

449
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,768
- bread and butter shag.
- 75.

450
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:14,276
- What if I'm really good?
- It don't make no difference, darling.

451
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:19,320
- I'll guess I'll have a hand-job then.
- All right.

452
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,582
This your first time then?

453
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,198
You got cash on you?

454
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:37,246
Right. Tick sharp!
Clothes off, we'll get you started.

455
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:39,600
Come on then,
let's have a look at it.

456
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,639
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

457
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,333
Could I... kiss you?

458
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,652
We don't do kissing.

459
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:52,286
That's all I want to do.

460
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:54,378
Sod it.

461
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:56,272
Come on then.

462
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,177
Could you... show me how?

463
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,368
- I've never really...
- You've never kissed a girl?

464
00:34:04,591 --> 00:34:06,440
My mum. My Aunt Lucy.

465
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:08,862
- Right. Aunt Lucy.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:11,701
Come here.

467
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,349
That was nice!

468
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,880
- Much better than Aunt Lucy!
- Want to do it again?

469
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:25,018
I don't mind.

470
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,214
Jesus, Amber,
you've got liquid fucking fingers!

471
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,876
- You like that, yeah?
- I like it very much.

472
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,796
- Harder!
- Harder!

473
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,040
You like that?

474
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,897
- Harder!
- Who's that?

475
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:56,770
- Is that...?
- That's just Johnny.

476
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,220
Greta's regular. Seven inches.

477
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,640
Freaky foreskin. Big tipper.

478
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,920
- Naughty boy!
- Wicked!

479
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,393
Sorry if you're fucking,
sorry if you're fucking...

480
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:14,162
What kind
of fucking gay shit is this?

481
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:18,280
You're supposed to be banging her,
not canoodling!

482
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,642
- Sorry.
- Pay the girl, JJ.

483
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,630
Something's come up,
and I'm not talking about your willy.

484
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,840
No charge.
I can't charge for a kiss.

485
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,920
Really?

486
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,235
Actually, no.
That'll be a tenner, please.

487
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,717
What's going on?

488
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,113
- You like that?
- I like it!

489
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:46,301
- Madame Greta, say Madame Greta!
- Madame Greta!

490
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:47,999
Electrocution!

491
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:49,465
Behind this door

492
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:51,021
is opportunity!

493
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,920
- Enough!
- Not enough!

494
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,520
What do you mean? Who's that?

495
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,608
Now you stay here, naughty boy.

496
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:02,352
- I'm gonna get the barbed wire.
- Quick, hide!

497
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,485
Yes, Madame. Thank you.

498
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,296
Right. Come on.
You're my witness!

499
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,873
To what?

500
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:24,616
This is gonna blow your mind!

501
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,724
Fucking hell!

502
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,780
Look who it is!

503
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:36,187
Say cheese!

504
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:40,254
What the fuck are you doing here?

505
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,760
We're visiting.

506
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,040
- Look at you!
- Fuck off. I'm busy!

507
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,283
Shut the fuck up, or I'll fucking
punch you in your fucking cock!

508
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:55,366
So. Who'd have thought
big bad gangster man Johnny White

509
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,808
likes to be spanked
like the naughty boy he is?

510
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,920
I like spanking.
What's your problem?

511
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,494
You ruined my chances of sleeping
with two girls tonight

512
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:04,480
- by making me look stupid.
- So?

513
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,311
So, once I show this little Kodak moment
to everyone I know,

514
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:11,096
you're gonna look stupid, and I'll be
a legend for managing to take it.

515
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:19,330
This is mine now!

516
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:21,619
See you around.

517
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:23,940
You don't have the balls
to show that photo.

518
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,503
- What?
- I said,

519
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,360
you don't have the balls
to show that to anyone.

520
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,074
Right?

521
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,794
You're a fucking
helpless little pussy.

522
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:35,520
- Watch me.
- Do you know who I am? What I can do?

523
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:39,959
You heard what I said, boy.

524
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,560
- Why don't you say it once more?
- You don't have the fucking balls!

525
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,600
Turn it off...

526
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:07,663
Come on, let's go!

527
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:16,532
- Does your mummy know where you are?
- What?

528
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:19,125
Your mum.

529
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:22,077
I bet you're the apple
of her cunting eye.

530
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:24,140
Shut up. Don't speak about my mum.

531
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,705
I think you came here to see her,
didn't you?

532
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:27,937
Shut up!

533
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,880
Because your mum is a fucking slag!

534
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,240
Shut up about my family.
You don't know me, so shut the fuck up!

535
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,894
- That's enough! Cook!
- Do you know who I am?

536
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,880
- What I can fucking do?
- Please, stop it!

537
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,635
- I'm Cook! I'm fucking...!
- Stop it!

538
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:45,766
Stop it, man!

539
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,779
It's me!
It's JJ!

540
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,753
Fucking shit...

541
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,205
Fucking bastard...

542
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:16,195
Fucking shiL...

543
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:20,696
Fucking cunt...

544
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:22,840
Kid, kid!

545
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,560
I like you, kid.
You're all right.

546
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:28,680
Shut up!

547
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,440
The next time I see you,

548
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,654
you're dead.

549
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,372
What the hell are you doing?
It's 6am. It's Saturday moming.

550
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:05,760
- Everyone's asleep. Including me.
- Wait! Wait!

551
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:08,935
What?

552
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,760
I need to speak to you.

553
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:15,787
I'll meet you in the shed.

554
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,579
Jesus, man.
Have you not stopped drinking?

555
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:15,535
Don't be a cock about it
I've been up all night.

556
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:38,400
- So what are we doing today, then?
- You hear what I said last night?

557
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,221
Come on, man.
You were just in a bad mood.

558
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:43,721
I was.

559
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:46,609
Cos you almost got us killed.

560
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,400
Yeah. Sorry about that.

561
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,278
You're apologizing?

562
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:55,251
That's a first.

563
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:09,716
Something happened.

564
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:14,964
I wasn't me.

565
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:17,774
I was me.

566
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:20,651
I don't know.

567
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,040
- I did something stupid.
- That's nothing new.

568
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:31,684
Something really stupid. Something
I wouldn't have done if you was there.

569
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:32,638
Right.

570
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:35,400
You've come here to ask
me to look after you all the time.

571
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:38,160
Make sure you don't do
anything stupid ever again.

572
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,659
Something like that.

573
00:43:44,812 --> 00:43:46,903
- What?
- I'm not going to do that.

574
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,528
- Why not?
- Cos lately,

575
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,412
- it's like you go looking for trouble.
- I wouldn't say I go...

576
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,631
Do you want to die, mate?
Is that what you want?

577
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:57,789
You're drinking yourself to death,
you're fighting gangsters.

578
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,439
I don't even want to know
what happened last night.

579
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:05,308
You're killing yourself to impress
some pissed-up old wanker in a pub.

580
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,120
Why are you smiling?

581
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:13,378
Because it's us...

582
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:20,039
isn't it?

583
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,151
Me, you and JJ.

584
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:25,022
Best mates for life.

585
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:28,934
You're not taking me with you, okay?

586
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,877
I fucking love you, man.

587
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,521
I fucking love you to bits.

588
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,809
But you've got to stop
all this crazy shit.

589
00:44:58,877 --> 00:45:00,276
Shut it, you pussy.

590
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,240
Are you here

591
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:00,840
for business

592
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,480
- or pleasure?
- Sorry?

593
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:07,737
Let's get this started!

594
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,120
Hang on.
He's pushing dope at my fucking shindig!

595
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,885
You're African, come on!

596
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:22,440
Fuck off out of my...

597
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:27,903
I want you to see what kind
of man you're dealing with, Thomas.
