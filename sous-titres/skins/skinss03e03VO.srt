00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,800
I'm 17 today!

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,520
Game is on, Freddie.
You wanna play?

3
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:07,880
I met a girl I like today.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,959
- Don't be stupid.
- Girls like stupid.

5
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:11,583
Ain't you worked that out?

6
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:14,280
How about it then, Peachy?
Looks like it's just me and you.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,800
Great. It's the lesbian
come to gay us up.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,080
I'm Pandora, I'm useless.

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,082
You tried to ruin my lovely party.

10
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:24,320
And now really, really bad things
are going to happen.

11
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:28,239
Why does your sister think I'm gay?

12
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,000
Need to speak to you.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,238
Shut up about my family.
You don't know me so shut the fuck up!

14
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:34,720
You're not taking me with you.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,954
The next time I see you,

16
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:38,640
you're dead.

20
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:30,715
I'm Thomas.

21
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,633
So glad to meet you.

22
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,189
I'm Thomas.

23
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,319
So glad to meet you.

24
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:10,278
Wayne. Come here! Come here!

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,989
Don't talk to him. For fuck's sake.

26
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,319
I bought this card for 120 minutes.

27
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,883
I speak for two minutes.
Nothing left.

28
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,360
You want to buy another card?

29
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
My mother, she'll be very upset.

30
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,760
It's five pounds.

31
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,760
Five pounds.

32
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:38,305
What you doing?

33
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,159
Come here.

34
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,688
- I told you kids what I'd do last time!
- Fucking kick him, Aaron!

35
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,200
Kick him harder! >

36
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,516
Paki cunt!

37
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:55,690
Cunt is a very bad word. Very bad.

38
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,440
Even in England, I think. Yes?

39
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:04,200
What is this "Paki"
that they call you? Is that bad?

40
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,101
I'm from Delhi.

41
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,074
And I hate Pakis.

42
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,113
So, you see?

43
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:11,916
Disrespectful.

44
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,896
Now, go and play. Go!

45
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,409
You've got a wacker lot
of doughnuts.

46
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,705
- Of course, I have too many.
- Crazy. Ta.

47
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:27,572
No, thanks.

48
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,263
Effy doesn't do doughnuts.

49
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:33,119
I see. So, what does she do?

50
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,399
Drugs. We've just been to buy
some skunky, haven't we, Eff?

51
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,451
I can do six of these no problem,

52
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,119
except Mum hides them
behind the fridge-freezer.

53
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:55,958
This is blimmin' amazing!

54
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,591
But I need juicing.

55
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,712
- You need juicing?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,787
Chuck us the Irn-Bru,
would you, Eff?

57
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,600
- Barry!
- What are you talking about?

58
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,440
Uncle Jock always says
"Barry" when he drinks Irn-Bru.

59
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,840
I don't know why, Mum says it's
because he's Scottish and mad.

60
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,738
My name is Thomas.
I'm so glad to meet you.

61
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,899
Effy. So glad to meet you.

62
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,850
I came yesterday, from Africa.

63
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,013
This place is exceedingly cold.

64
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,000
Bummer.

65
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:35,267
Hell's bells.

66
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:03,651
This way.

67
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,651
Sorry?

68
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:10,326
Your house. It's incredible.

69
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:14,365
Thanks.

70
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,287
Come on.
Bring the dozy cow up here.

71
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,999
I think maybe these doughnuts
is not good for you.

72
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,800
Yeah, that must be it.

73
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:35,932
Mum?

74
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:44,415
Mum?

75
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,680
Shit!

76
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,161
Where's my...

77
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,760
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Jesus Christ!

78
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:52,782
Put your trousers on.

79
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:57,856
Effy. What are you doing here?

80
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,565
- Pandora puked.
- You know Steve, don't you?

81
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,378
He's been helping me with my...

82
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:09,788
my project.

83
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:12,506
Right, yeah.
It's really interesting, isn't it?

84
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,026
Hello. My name is Thomas.

85
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,665
So glad to meet you.

86
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:50,776
Good evening.

87
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,799
Shouldn't sneak up on me, should he?

88
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,871
- Should he?
- Bring the fucker.

89
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,025
Right, up you get, my lover.

90
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,275
In here!

91
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:53,519
- Bring him in the flat, you twats.
- Oh, right.

92
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,933
Sorry, mate, Johnny.
Got the wrong end of the stick.

93
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,134
He wants to torture
him inside, don't he?

94
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:00,842
- Inside, like.
- Yeah, inside

95
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,440
Put the kettle on please, lads.

96
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,683
It's taking a long time there, boss.

97
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,336
I keep saying, like.

98
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,204
Probably shouldn't watch it.

99
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,569
You know?

100
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,532
Right.

101
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,612
Lets get started, shall we?

102
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:57,534
Who's you?

103
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:03,056
You're in my flat.

104
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,166
I thought it was empty.

105
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:10,181
- No-one wants to live here.
- That's true. I wouldn't live here.

106
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,007
I'd have to be a dirty arsehole.

107
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:14,844
Right?

108
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:17,533
You'd be a right dirty arsehole.

109
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,741
You wouldn't be a dirty arsehole.

110
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,920
Passport.

111
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,956
Not you, Bennie!

112
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,703
You.

113
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,353
Fair enough.

114
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:39,726
Business or pleasure?

115
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:41,725
Sorry?

116
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:45,199
Are you here

117
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,640
for business or pleasure?

118
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,123
Business

119
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,919
Correct answer!

120
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:02,304
Kettle's boiled, Johnny.

121
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,156
Now we're ready, Thomas.

122
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,120
Lucas.
Load a Pot.

123
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,360
Coming up, Johnny.

124
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,309
This whole estate is mine.

125
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,763
People like you, Thomas,

126
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:30,514
you gotta pay to use it, see?

127
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,245
You wanna watch that there.
That's fucking hot, mate.

128
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:38,156
- You sauced it?
- Shit, yeah. It's fully charged.

129
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,112
I want you to see what kind of man
you're dealing with, Thomas.

130
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,680
That is pure evil!

131
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:13,760
I want £300 deposit
by Desperate Housewives on Thursday.

132
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:17,263
And don't bother trying
to move flat,

133
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,954
cos they're all mine.

134
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,331
And that'll be £400 by X Factor.

135
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,680
- We wouldn't want that, would we?
- No.

136
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,913
Say goodnight to Thomas, boys.

137
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,640
- See ya, cocker.
- Cheers, Thommo.

138
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,220
- All the best.
- Be lucky.

139
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,103
- He seemed like a nice lad to me.
- Yeah, but John's gonna fuck him.

140
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:47,440
Dear Mama,
little brother and sister.

141
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,189
I may be a long way from home,
but you are so close to my thoughts.

142
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,284
I'm sending you this message
because you must practice your English

143
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:57,429
before you come.

144
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,392
Here, the sun shines
just like at home

145
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,960
and there are many wonderful people.

146
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,590
- Where you going?
- I need work.

147
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,970
Fuck off, mister.
This isn't your work.

148
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:09,473
Boy, they will beat you.
You want them to beat you?

149
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,319
No. But I must have money.

150
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:18,680
They take anyone.

151
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:22,915
No documents. You forgot them, OK?

152
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,796
- Now fuck off. Before we beat you.
- Thank you, Sir.

153
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,006
This is a very cold country.

154
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,434
Did you bring your
visa and work permit?

155
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,308
I'm very sorry. I forgot them.

156
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,120
Special skills?

157
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:00,269
I play all music.

158
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,748
I run very, very fast. Like a dog.

159
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,120
Also, I am mathematical.
I will solve any equation.

160
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,039
None. Qualifications?

161
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:10,499
Top of my class at school.
All A's. The village was very proud.

162
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,437
Where?

163
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,560
- In Congo.
- None. Work experience?

164
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,085
Every day I fetch the goats.

165
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:18,720
- I milk them and...
- Goats?

166
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,123
In my village, before sunrise.

167
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:24,210
I milk the goats, I collect the
dung since I was four years old.

168
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:25,960
None.

169
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,979
This job will get me £300, yes?

170
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:34,360
My mother is coming you see and
she's a very fussy lady.

171
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,800
And you can start tomorrow.

172
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,600
What must I do?

173
00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,488
Excellent machine.

174
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,702
Effy! Excuse me!

175
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:28,800
Look. I got a new top.
It's cool, isn't it?

176
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,088
When you've got tits like mine,
you've gotta flash 'em.

177
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,119
Sorry?

178
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,360
Breasts, girl.
You should try it.

179
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,982
I never try.

180
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,243
Stop fucking following me, will you!

181
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:43,729
I wasn't, I was...

182
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,000
- A strange place, this college.
- Sorry?

183
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,659
Everyone is loud
and they care about nothing.

184
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,644
You're right.

185
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,003
You are the same as your sister.

186
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm not the same as her.

187
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,821
Maybe you're a little more pretty.

188
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:04,062
Cheeky.

189
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,720
Most satisfactory.

190
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:21,240
Come on.
Pick your positions, everyone.

191
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,248
Now, feel the rhythm.

192
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:28,515
Pandora! Take this seriously!

193
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:31,425
That's right. Now swaying.

194
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,930
Growl. You're African.

195
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,936
Come on!

196
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,520
OK. You're stalking, leopards.

197
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:42,840
Come on, Colin.
You're camouflaged. Get some bush!

198
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:47,864
And stalking. Stalking your prey!

199
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:49,475
And it's building,

200
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:51,680
building. Marimba!

201
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:56,200
Great! Great, gazelles.

202
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,280
Feel the sun beating down
on your haunches.

203
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,439
Stretch, stretch.
And cue vultures!

204
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,680
Circling,

205
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:06,639
circling...

206
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,040
And pounce!

207
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,360
And finish!

208
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,036
Finish, Pandora!

209
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:44,103
What do you think?

210
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:48,023
That's just smashing, Samantha.

211
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:49,440
Well done, everyone!

212
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,399
I can absolutely smell the Savannah.

213
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:55,500
This is going to blow
the Ofsted inspectors away.

214
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:59,599
Right! OK, everyone.

215
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:02,734
Thank you. Thank you all. A triumph!

216
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,428
They've got a real sense of rhythm,
haven't they? Thrilling.

217
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,069
In fact...

218
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,622
I was wondering,

219
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,547
have you seen <i>Out Of Africa</i>?

220
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:19,433
I have it on DVD. Similar themes.

221
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,852
Maybe I could come over sometime

222
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:23,691
and wang my disc in your box?

223
00:21:25,112 --> 00:21:26,016
Possibly.

224
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,099
Hello, friend.

225
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,259
I forgot my tail.

226
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:53,354
Blooming heck,
you've got fast fingers.

227
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,576
You can pluck super quick.
That's gotta be handy.

228
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:04,825
Why are you crying?

229
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,359
England is beautiful.
Everything is green.

230
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:15,453
Wicked green,
cos it pisses down most days.

231
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:18,422
Anyway, Effy told me
you carried me back, stripped me naked,

232
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:21,959
- and laid me tenderly in your bed.
- Excuse me? I didn't... What?

233
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,193
You must be wondrously
strong to carry me.

234
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:26,519
Don't worry.
I've carried heavier goats.

235
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,560
- You're funny!
- Am I?

236
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:30,979
And you like
all the same things as me.

237
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:33,273
Dancing, doughnuts...

238
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:40,680
Excuse me. I'm a little hungry.

239
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,167
That's why we're going
to see Auntie Elizabeth.

240
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:44,857
She makes ripper scones.

241
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:47,838
- Scones?
- Yup. And the best tea ever.

242
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,792
My God! How many people live here?

243
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,640
One. But Auntie Lizzie
has a wicked load of stuff.

244
00:23:58,124 --> 00:23:59,121
Now then,

245
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,873
we're ready to hear all about you.

246
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,518
Thanks, Lizziepoo.

247
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,531
My family is from Ouesso District,

248
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,147
Sangha, in Congo.

249
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:12,493
Our village is very poor.
I miss them so much.

250
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:15,668
My mother will come next week
with my brother and sister,

251
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,540
and we'll live here, together.

252
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,053
How very exciting!

253
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:22,085
You must bring them round.

254
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,120
Do have a scone.

255
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,597
Thank you.

256
00:24:25,974 --> 00:24:29,974
Oh, no! Tea first. Scones always
taste better after tea.

257
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
Auntie grows it herself.

258
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:39,039
Makes my lips tingle and everything.

259
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:41,206
That's wonderful.

260
00:24:44,476 --> 00:24:45,476
Heaven.

261
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,119
It's interesting.

262
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,241
I'd be very pleased
to see how it is grown.

263
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,559
Of course, my dear boy. Yes.

264
00:24:57,284 --> 00:25:00,907
Just as soon as we've all
got well and truly sconed.

265
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:08,665
So I had this lodger, Darnell.

266
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:12,850
He's a charming chap from Kingston,
Jamaica. Most entertaining.

267
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,569
Anyway, he needed somewhere
to keep his tea plants.

268
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,706
Pay attention, dear.

269
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:21,840
So, Darnell, it was an awful business,
poor chap.

270
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,457
He fell out with his brothers

271
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:29,558
and they were so cross he had
to go back to Jamaica rather quickly.

272
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,720
Blimey. They don't half grow.

273
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,369
So, this is where we dry it out.

274
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:42,640
It's terribly easy. But, flipping 'eck,
it's coming out of my ears.

275
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:45,742
It's lucky that it
goes so well with cake!

276
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,030
Maybe I could sell some.

277
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,909
I think people would like it
very much.

278
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,829
What an enterprising chap!

279
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,849
You know, you could do worse, Panda.

280
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:58,917
You could do a lot worse!

281
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,117
You get me, blood?

282
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,841
You don't have much furniture
in here, do you, Thomas?

283
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,813
I must buy some
before my mother comes.

284
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,680
She is a powerful lady, most
powerful. Especially on the backhand.

285
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:25,275
You're gonna have to sell
a shoe-load of tea to buy a sofa,

286
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:29,373
even if it's a once in a lifetime,
rock bottom offer at World of Leather.

287
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:32,745
There's hardly enough for three
or four cups in those bags.

288
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:36,999
Pandora, this isn't just
what you think it is.

289
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:40,101
Well, what in the bollocking
name of buggery is it?

290
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,560
That's smoking a lot
better than Mum's Earl Grey!

291
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,440
Yes. And rather more expensive.

292
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:07,045
You're amazing.

293
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,411
Now I get it.

294
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:25,011
Cripes.

295
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:27,208
That was kissing.

296
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,080
No, Pandora. This is kissing.

297
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:36,304
So Dave tells Steve exactly how it is.
Doesn't pull his punches.

298
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:40,482
He said, "Let's take this outside,
you tosser!" Just like that!

299
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:42,131
"Let's take it outside."

300
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:45,420
Fucking hell, Steve. That's the Managing
Director, for fuck's sake!

301
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,892
What a great guy.
Stupid, but great.

302
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,479
You liked him, didn't you love?

303
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,689
Yeah, you know. He's OK.

304
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:55,847
Anyway, a funny thing happened
to me in the supermarket today...

305
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,280
We share the same tastes.

306
00:27:57,441 --> 00:28:00,160
He was surprisingly
complimentary about you, love.

307
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:02,537
Right.

308
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,560
- That'll be him now.
- What?

309
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,753
I invited Steve over for a drink.

310
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:11,274
I made a friend!

311
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,813
Fucking coming!

312
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,221
It's more complicated
than you think.

313
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:23,401
Doesn't seem complicated. You're
fucking my dad's line manager.

314
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,025
- No biggie.
- Give me a chance to sort it out.

315
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:27,289
Please, Effy...

316
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:28,873
Well, it's not Steve.

317
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,042
But look who it is!
What's your name again?

318
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,960
Ridiculous!

319
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,072
This is Thomas. Guess what?

320
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,000
We've been snogging!

321
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,280
- Never.
- Yeah! And we need some advice.

322
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:52,892
- We've got a shitload of weed!
- Right. Let's take this upstairs.

323
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,477
I've been doing it with tongues.
Come on, Thomas.

324
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:00,077
So glad to meet you again.

325
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,967
You look different
with your clothes on.

326
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:04,480
What?

327
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,938
I just defrosted a nice tart tatin.

328
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:14,925
You pussies turned up, then?

329
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,038
Hey. What's up?

330
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:19,489
My cock, hopefully.
You know what I mean?

331
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:21,335
I'm still upset.

332
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm never going to a brothel
with you again.

333
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:25,031
Ah! You loved it.

334
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,173
We got action.

335
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,709
Yeah. They all hate you.

336
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:30,105
- Why?
- Cos you're a tit.

337
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:33,323
How many times have I gotta
tell you retards? Tit works.

338
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,224
Girls! We were just discussing
breasts and there you were.

339
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:38,344
Tosser!

340
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:41,398
This is the guy
you're gonna help out tonight.

341
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:42,693
So glad.

342
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,040
Thomas has gotta get
300 quid by desperatehousewives,

343
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:48,447
and that's tomorrow, otherwise
Johnny White's gonna make him eat...

344
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,615
He's got 13 ounces
of weed in the bag.

345
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:54,000
If you'd help,
I could give you much.

346
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:55,640
It's excellent weed.

347
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,159
Not again. Who phoned her?

348
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:02,799
Please, Katie. Don't.

349
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,647
Hi, sorry. I couldn't find a bus.
You said somebody needed a hand?

350
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,206
You like giving hand. Don't you?

351
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:12,280
- See you.
- For fuck's sake!

352
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:15,160
- She didn't kiss me, OK.
- She practically jumped you.

353
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:16,409
I kissed her!

354
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:19,779
I was drunk, and someone
gave me MDMA, and...

355
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,281
I felt like fucking kissing someone!

356
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,401
Satisfied?

357
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:27,280
I'm satisfied!
Be better if you showed us!

358
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,973
Shut the fuck up, Cook.

359
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,240
You promised me a party.
Where is it?

360
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:33,120
Can't you feel it, kids?

361
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:39,859
It's the sound of the underground.

362
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,269
Come on, you suckers. Let's go.

363
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,627
No fucking beat to this tune.

364
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:35,360
Oh, no. It's there, boss.
You just gotta be pilled up.

365
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:39,190
You're supposed to be selling
not necking, Benny.

366
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,598
You look like a fucking nonce,
you twat.

367
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:45,246
Hang on!

368
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:48,711
He's pushing dope
at my fucking shindig!

369
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360
Go! Go, motherfuckers!

370
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:56,495
No! Him!

371
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,432
Jesus!

372
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:04,250
Wait till I get my hands on that
little fucker. Out of my way!

373
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:05,699
Fucking hell.

374
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:09,400
Fucking wankers!

375
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:31,188
How much you sold?

376
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:35,285
I done three bags. Tenner each.

377
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:38,000
Don't even know why
I'm fucking doing this.

378
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,440
Thanks for keeping schtum.

379
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:45,657
I don't care
what your sister thinks.

380
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,718
Yeah, well, I do.

381
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,480
So thanks anyway.

382
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:55,662
I didn't take MDMA that night.

383
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,729
I just wanted to kiss you.

384
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:03,040
I want to kiss you now.

385
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,120
You're gay?

386
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,490
Sorry.

387
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:12,766
Yeah, me too.

388
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,490
Shit.

389
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:17,031
Shit!

390
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,558
Which are you?

391
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:22,369
Gay... I mean, Emily.

392
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:26,680
Emily. Already I have £175. My weed
is cheap and, my God, they love it!

393
00:33:27,031 --> 00:33:29,453
- I got 80.
- This country is so great!

394
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:34,440
T-T-Thomas!
You're on my t-t-turf!

395
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,370
It's hitting profits,
so you gotta pay.

396
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,441
And we only accept cash and pain.

397
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:47,120
Get the little fucker!

398
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,625
Fucking smash him!

399
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:08,876
My brother! White people
are gonna to season me!

400
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:11,706
What the fuck, blood?
Quick, gimme your T.

401
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,403
<i>Make some noise, people!</i>

402
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,201
Gimme the T-shirt!

403
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,315
Come on stage, you can
blend in the posse. Up here!

404
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:25,101
<i>Let's get this started. Yeah,
let me hear you make some noise for T!</i>

405
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,457
"Listen, let me get on this
So I can get real ghetto on this

406
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:34,576
"Unlike you, I don't teef rhymes
I'm so sick that I don't feel fine

407
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:36,301
"Melanie's mingin'
but Beverly's fine

408
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:38,115
"So Melanie's yours
And Beverly's mine

409
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:40,741
"Let me get on this
So girls can get real wet from this

410
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,428
"So you can't put them lips on this

411
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,176
"I'm black that's why I stand out

412
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,800
"Sippin' moonshine and gettin'
shines while the moon's out

413
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,800
"You ain't got the creps
to step to me man

414
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,933
"With my Airforce Ones
I'll step to you, man

415
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:52,559
"When the music drops I rave it out

416
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,364
"I wanna see your middle finger

417
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:56,115
"Put them in the air
and skank it out

418
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:58,835
"Put them in the air
and skank it out"

419
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,795
Let me hear you make some
noise for my African brother!

420
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,315
85, 95. That's it. £295.

421
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,820
There you go, fella.
Should be plenty.

422
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,120
Look after that, yeah?

423
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:16,921
Well done, Thomas.

424
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,041
This is...

425
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,110
You are good people.

426
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,320
This is everything
I have dreamed of and...

427
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,658
Now you are my friends, too.

428
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:37,891
Morning, fella.

429
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:40,880
Now we're really gonna fellate you.

430
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,166
Gentlemen.

431
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,331
Didn't I say I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again?

432
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:02,880
Believe this is mine.

433
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:05,164
I love my work.

434
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Love it.

435
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,399
You must be some kind
of English pussy cunt?

436
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:16,297
You heard me.

437
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,103
I think you're afraid.

438
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:21,480
Possibly your father
was a homosexual donkey.

439
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:26,480
I will fight you by myself.

440
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,200
You can choose any weapon.

441
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:34,027
You just made my day.

442
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:03,095
So, in summary,

443
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:05,499
I win.

444
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:08,240
You are my gimp forever,

445
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:12,580
I take all your money, beat you,
and your mates to a pulp,

446
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:15,538
and my boys rape all the women.

447
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,475
Boss, the lads...

448
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,491
The lads aren't too keen,
on the rape.

449
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:26,680
For fuck's sake!
I'm talking dangerous!

450
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:29,240
Can nobody talk
dangerous any more?

451
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,412
Fucking Bristol.

452
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,800
No ambition. No... edge, no style.

453
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,172
You know?

454
00:38:39,622 --> 00:38:40,672
Provincial.

455
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:43,022
Sorry, boss.

456
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:46,547
I'm ready.

457
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:49,037
How do you want to fight?

458
00:38:50,485 --> 00:38:52,040
Promise you.

459
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:53,800
You're gonna shit yourself.

460
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:05,777
You ever seen a Naga Jolokia before,
Thomas?

461
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,840
Hottest chilli on the planet.

462
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,979
It's like being fisted
by Joe Calzaghe.

463
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:14,215
And Joe's still got his gloves on.

464
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,235
Who flinches...

465
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:23,775
is fucked.

466
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:38,440
You.

467
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:03,880
Oh, in God's name, no.

468
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:27,839
- Delicious.
- Well done, mate.

469
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,079
Well done, Thomas.

470
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:30,840
- What?
- My mother.

471
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:32,914
She grows these in our garden.

472
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:36,053
We are forbidden to eat them,
she will beat us if we disobey.

473
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,120
But boys will be boys.
And I am a very naughty boy.

474
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:44,160
If I win, I pay you no money,

475
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:47,377
and you leave me and my friends
alone forever.

476
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:52,017
You.

477
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,224
What is that?

478
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:44,560
He shat himself.

479
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:48,370
Oh. Oh, my God. That...
That is so humiliating.

480
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,301
Right, come on, lads.

481
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:53,786
Let's get out of here.
Mate, that is humming.

482
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:56,720
You can't respect a man
who shits himself, can you?

483
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:34,239
Pandora, sweetness,
what are you doing?

484
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:36,429
I've given it some thought,
and I've decided.

485
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:38,160
You're gonna be the first, Thomas.

486
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:39,862
The first?

487
00:42:41,547 --> 00:42:43,741
What do I want?
Surfing and turfing.

488
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,680
When do I want it?
Now!

489
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,488
You gonna come
and flippin' well jump me now?

490
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,597
I took my bra off and everything!
Look!

491
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,439
Aren't they fucking amazing?
