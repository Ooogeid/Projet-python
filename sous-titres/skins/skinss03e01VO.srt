{\SPARKING UR LAST SPLIFF}

5
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:20,488
Fuckers.

6
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Fredster!

7
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,800
This stuff is fucking rubbish,
by the way.

8
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,912
Stop stealing my fucking spliff!

9
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,680
Morning, gents,
you thieving bastards.

10
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,767
Come on, I got you some breakfast.

11
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,983
They allowed to serve lager
at 8 in the morning?

12
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,279
I had a word...

13
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,844
JJ's got some interesting thoughts
on the benefits of Carlsberg

14
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,966
as part of a balanced
dietary pattern.

15
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,559
Calorifically it's right up there
with 392 energy units,

16
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,680
which is nothing
on the Snickers Duo I'm having

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,079
which has the additional drawback
of 28 grams of fat.

18
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,720
Although I can call upon
1.2 grams of fibre,

19
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,360
which doesn't feature
in your lager. However,

20
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:13,080
you could argue in some sense that
hops constitute one of your five a day.

21
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,510
That'll do me.

22
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,861
You not having that, Freds?

23
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:25,600
That's his fourth so far.

24
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,447
Is that a good idea?
We've college in half an hour.

25
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,797
You'll be carrying an
attention deficit into the day.

26
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,119
Attention deficit?
Intelligence deficit!

27
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:37,920
Pig!

28
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:40,316
Maybe I won't go then.

29
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,994
You're going to bunk off
your first day?

30
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,960
Mate, the sun's shining.
We're bevvied, spliffed and sorted.

31
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:50,058
Feels like the beginning
of something. So I'm waiting.

32
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:51,560
- For what?
- The signal.

33
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,468
- We're starting college.
- We're waiting.

34
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,841
- Something's gotta start us off.
- You're running

35
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,763
a randomised fate model to determine

36
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,639
when you continue
in full time education?

37
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,158
I need motivation.

38
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,819
And it needs to be better
than sitting in the sun, with you two,

39
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,452
drinking beers
and smoking your blow. Jensie!

40
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,400
Have the same again?

41
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:12,106
And sling a couple of them
cherry shots on top?

42
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:13,458
Cheers, darling.

43
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,178
I can feel it!

44
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:20,469
It's got potential, this day.

45
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:22,725
It's pregnant.

46
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,056
Shouldn't someone pick up
that bike before it causes an...?

47
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,053
For fuck's sake!
Jesus shit!

48
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,563
Where the fuck did that...?
What the fuck?

49
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,014
Look at it! Look at it!

50
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,381
Look at my fucking car!

51
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,742
You saw that, didn't you?
Did you? Did you see it?

52
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,714
I don't know.
You drove into the bollard.

53
00:04:58,834 --> 00:04:59,920
I did not!

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,520
The fucking bike
jumped out in front of me!

55
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:06,720
You must have seen it, you're
my witness, right? Are you blind?

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,213
Why is everyone round here
fucking blind?

57
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,280
- I'm doing nothing...
- That girl's looking at you, Freddie.

58
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,031
- Maybe she's looking at me.
- She's not looking at you, JJ.

59
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,138
Nice hair.

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,117
She's got nice hair and nice eyes.

61
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:30,680
- And nice breasts, probably.
- Shut up, JJ.

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Nipples.

63
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:35,041
We'll just imagine her bottom.

64
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,633
Where's your fucking
white stick, woman?

65
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:39,840
She's absolutely lovely.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,449
You are as stupid as you look!
Ah, for fuck...

67
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,320
- I want your mobile number.
- I don't have one.

68
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,600
Your fucking email address, then!

69
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,868
Look at the state of my fucking car!

70
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:53,145
You must have seen something,
you demented bint!

71
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,174
What...
What happened?

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,846
Is that your bike,
you fucking idiot?

73
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,242
I was signalling...
you just kept coming...

74
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,520
I didn't even see you!
You came out of fucking nowhere!

75
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,539
I was trying to make you see me.
You just kept coming, man!

76
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,843
- No. That's bollocks. No. Listen!
- You fucked my bike.

77
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,173
- You just ran straight through me.
- That is not right!

78
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,043
You haven't got a witness.

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,678
Nobody saw me
knock you off your bike.

80
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,767
I did.

81
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:26,408
It was just like he said!

82
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:30,140
You ran him over,
and now he's bleeding.

83
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Profusely.

84
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:37,760
Perhaps we should call a policeman.
{\I think }It's a crime to leave the scene of a...

85
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,353
There's no need for that.
I'm sure we can sort this out.

86
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:44,440
Let me buy you a new bike...
Look, here. Come on, take it!

87
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,760
Take it! Come on, have the lot.
Have the whole fucking lot! Bollocks!

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,347
Forgive and forget, okay?
Forgive and forget, okay?

89
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,520
- All right.
- Everything all right, Gran?

90
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,488
Just a slight problem,
all sorted out now.

91
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,241
He's a pillock, he wrapped
his car around that bollard,

92
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,740
and he's called me a demented bint.

93
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,760
What the fuck did you say
to my Gran, man?

94
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,240
Hello, nice to meet you...

95
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,080
- Don't fucking, "Hello," me...
- Sweet.

96
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:23,320
Dad says some things are best
left to the imagination.

97
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,819
- But that's not right, is it?
- Your dad's a stupid tosser, JJ.

98
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,778
Do you think she's going
where we're going?

99
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:32,787
She is now.

100
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,880
Mum! Mum! Emily hit me!

101
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:02,271
- Emily? Are you hitting James?
- Sorry! Accident...

102
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,101
That was my bloody widdler!

103
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,295
Shut up or I'll tell her
what you were doing.

104
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:12,040
I've got a natural curiosity
for a boy of my age.

105
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Fuck off. And I know it's you
stealing the knickers.

106
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,040
They better not be sticky
when I find them.

107
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,564
Get the fuck out of there, bitch!

108
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,545
- Mum!
- Who?

109
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,569
It's me, Emily.

110
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,535
Tell her to get out of the shower.
She's making me late for college.

111
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:40,037
Gotta dash. Remember to make
a packed lunch for James.

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,837
- Why don't you get Katie to...?
- Good luck at college.

113
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,373
Remember to smile.

114
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,240
Fucking hell!

115
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:06,680
You've used all the fucking water!

116
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,374
Jesus! Shit!

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,280
For fuck's sake!

118
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,360
You pervy little bastard.

119
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:18,965
She's gone to work, loser.

120
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,240
Fucking hell. How many times
are you gonna do that?

121
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,623
I need to wash my hair and you've...

122
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,000
I knew this top
would look fucking bad-ass.

123
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:29,468
It's mine.

124
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,494
Aren't you glad I made you buy it?

125
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,223
Get dressed, though.
We're gonna be late.

126
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:42,440
I dunno where you got this thong,
but it's properly cutting me in half.

127
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,898
- You could give it back.
- Sorry.

128
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,407
You know it doesn't
look as good on you.

129
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,434
There's Danny.

130
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,360
Hey, cutey!
I'm just coming.

131
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm telling you, college? First day?

132
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,779
You need to get ready.

133
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,549
Cos we're not waiting for you.

134
00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:14,200
- What about my packed lunch?
- Fuck off.

135
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:18,160
You shave your fanny
with Dad's Gillette Mach3.

136
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,096
So Tommo goes up the inside, right?

137
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,888
I drop back to cover
Marco and Keeno.

138
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,324
Took a one-two from Jonno,
he's gone, "Danno!"

139
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,199
So I drag back over the ball.

140
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:54,635
Looked up, chipped
the centre back... Boff!

141
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,423
Sambo's in on goal.

142
00:11:57,561 --> 00:12:01,279
He's got a lovely sense of rhythm.
Where's your knickers, girl?

143
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,948
That's for me to know
and you to find out, Danny.

144
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,108
Nice one! Nice one, yeah?

145
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:29,200
Score one for me, honey.

146
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:30,760
Laters, babe.

147
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:33,173
See you, Danny.

148
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,715
Renault Megane Coupe!

149
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,600
Fucking bag...

150
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:43,993
Here, Ems?

151
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:49,600
You oughta spruce up, yeah?
Get some decent threads like Katie.

152
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:53,494
We're having a party in the Premier
Travel Lodge on Thursday.

153
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:55,760
Party fun, yeah? The lads,

154
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,199
they love a twin thing, you know?

155
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,200
That's sweet of you, Danny.
Can I get back to you on that?

156
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:06,600
Yeah, yeah. Nice one.

157
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,640
Are you Danny?
That gas-head footy player?

158
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,601
My mate Janice wants
you to sign her tits.

159
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,011
- Let me park up.
- Your boyfriend's well mint.

160
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:21,583
He's totally fit.

161
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:24,726
He took me to the Stakis Grand
last week for surf, turf and shots.

162
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,680
- Safe.
- I love Danny Guillermo.

163
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,920
- Lush. Good lush.
- Foxy.

164
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,414
- Cute.
- He's signing Samantha's tits!

165
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:33,548
Bonkers!

166
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,121
What's surf and turf, Eff?

167
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:37,923
Sex.

168
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,659
We'll have a whizzer time
at this college, Eff!

169
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,851
I'm definitely going
to have surf and turf, ASAP.

170
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,395
Mum says boys only want one thing
so my plan is give it to them,

171
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:48,541
lots of times. That way I'll get good
at it, be really popular

172
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,599
and maybe my toes
will stop throbbing.

173
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,905
Christ's sakes, Ems.
Come on, you loser!

174
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,975
What's wrong with you?
You're always lagging behind me.

175
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:00,332
Why can't you wear decent clothes?

176
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,336
Right.

177
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,160
- You hate her.
- Who do I hate, Eff?

178
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,176
- I'll let you know.
- Cool.

179
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,776
- Let's get this party started.
- You want a lollipop?

180
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:39,512
She smiled at me.

181
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:43,640
- Cool.
- She... didn't smile at you, JJ.

182
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:46,077
I think you'll find she did.

183
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,409
Mum was right. A lack of pubic hair
isn't necessarily a drawback.

184
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,622
It is a drawback.

185
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:56,560
Girls are more interested
in my character than my cock.

186
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,849
- That's just been proved.
- She was not looking at you.

187
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,026
Fuck me, you're blind.

188
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:05,206
On the contrary.
My eyesight is keen.

189
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,560
How many fingers am I holding up?

190
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:11,582
F...

191
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:15,172
- You always do that...!
- I've got so much cock hair

192
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:17,547
I can back comb it
and use it like a lure.

193
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,652
Nice.

194
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,165
Like a Porcupine.

195
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:26,634
Right, you're all prick.

196
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,200
- Toosh.
- You mean touche.

197
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:33,239
Probably.

198
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:38,990
- Tosser.
- Nice.

199
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,032
Here we go.

200
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:48,720
<i>Welcome to Roundview College.</i>

201
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>A meeting place for young people.</i>

202
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:04,827
God help me.

203
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,385
Lovely kids. So full of energy.

204
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,137
Makes you feel alive.

205
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,761
They look like a right peck
of fuckers to me.

206
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:15,947
If I suddenly get a bit flushed
and short of breath,

207
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,509
- take over, would you, Doug?
- Why would you get flushed?

208
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:19,960
Just fucking do it, okay?

209
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,760
No problem. Flushed. Right you are.

210
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:26,893
Could I have your attention, please?

211
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,189
Yes, we are starting.

212
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,308
<i>Attention!</i>

213
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:39,157
<i>Pay attention, look you!</i>

214
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,138
Thank you, Doug.

215
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,720
Welcome to Roundview College.

216
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:53,326
We are a designated four star
educational establishment

217
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,639
under the National
We're All In It Together Initiative

218
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,189
leading to Ultimate Improvement status.

219
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,150
Anyone who screws that up
will be officially burnt at the stake.

220
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,730
- And expelled.
- Yes, and expelled.

221
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,109
God help you all, you're gonna get
some qualifications. Any questions?

222
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,600
Thank you.

223
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,057
Now before I turn you over
to your form tutors,

224
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:20,564
I'd like to tell you something about
the way in which we organise our...

225
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:22,196
Right! Very funny.

226
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,506
This is a further education college,
not a primary school.

227
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,566
Stop it! Stop it!

228
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:32,406
I'll cut your balls off,
you cheeky little turds!

229
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,013
You hear me?

230
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,351
I do apologise.

231
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,062
I think I might be at fault.

232
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:45,240
Too much rhubarb
on my Ready Brek. Havoc.

233
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:47,880
Right.

234
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,040
You are looking a little flushed.
Do you want me to...?

235
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:13,938
Last year, we had
some intolerable incidents

236
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:17,113
so, I want to make this
easy for you.

237
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:21,409
The following will result
in instant expulsion:

238
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,565
smoking on the premises,
setting fire to the premises,

239
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,459
consumption of alcohol
on the premises,

240
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,255
consumption of drugs on the premises,
consumption of pornography

241
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,480
on the premises, teacher abuse,
glue abuse, self abuse,

242
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,314
sexual intercourse with any other
student, teacher or animal

243
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:38,437
or combination of the above

244
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:40,760
including oral sex

245
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,280
and/or use of sex toys,
on the premises.

246
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,779
That was nasty...

247
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,465
Miss Reedy, our new head
of communications.

248
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,413
Miss Reedy is joining us from...

249
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:55,644
Where are you joining us from?

250
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:57,809
I had some time off.

251
00:18:58,806 --> 00:18:59,880
Seven years.

252
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,750
It was stress-related but feeling
a bit better now, hopefully...

253
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:07,607
Oh, Christ.

254
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,356
Form...

255
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,081
BD1,

256
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:16,124
say your name, please, when I...

257
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,418
Put your hands up, please,
when I call your...

258
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,400
name.

259
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,589
Emily Fitch?

260
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,845
Katie Fitch?

261
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:34,320
Jonah Jeremia Jones?

262
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:36,284
JJ, present.

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,080
James Cook?

264
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,111
Elizabeth Stonem?

265
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,732
Mavis Jarundi?

266
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:51,610
Dob... rislawa W...

267
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:54,920
Wieczorek?
I'm sorry, you're foreign.

268
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,691
Frederick McLair?

269
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,213
Denise Adebeyor?

270
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,859
The integrity
of the unit is preserved.

271
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,996
I'm still deeply unhappy with you, mind,
on account of the unwarranted violence.

272
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:10,841
All right, I said I'm sorry.

273
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,577
And...

274
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,179
Naomi Campbell?

275
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,585
Fucking hell...

276
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,880
Now I get it. You got
anger management issues.

277
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:36,428
- Only when I talk to wankers.
- Cool.

278
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,520
You gonna hit me
with your shoe now, or...?

279
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,151
I like her.

280
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:53,587
Christ. Same fucking form.

281
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:06,101
Sorry. I'm not a babe.

282
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,560
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

283
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,759
- Shut up, Cook. Sorry about him.
- Listen, trying to break the ice.

284
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:14,451
Guess what I've got tattooed
on my cock?

285
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,960
No, go on. Guess.

286
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:18,640
- What would you say?
- Excuse me?

287
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,240
Yes? What is it?

288
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,359
The boy next to me
is acting inappropriately.

289
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:23,480
How?

290
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,432
He wants to show me his tattoo.

291
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,720
- And not in a nice way.
- Right.

292
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,660
- You!
- Me?

293
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:33,906
Why don't you show us all
your pathetic tattoo?

294
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,861
We can wonder
at its magnificent stupidity.

295
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:38,469
I don't think you'd like it.

296
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,470
<i>Right lad! Smartish!</i>

297
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,402
<i>You've had an instruction.
Show her the tattoo, now!</i>

298
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,460
All right.

299
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,560
Wait. No, no, Cook, wait, no.
Please, please!

300
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,720
That is fuckin' impressive,
so it is.

301
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,520
Let me out!

302
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,035
Let me out! Don't make me stay.

303
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,594
Let me out!

304
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,520
This is unacceptable.

305
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:17,561
Unacceptable!

306
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:19,648
Silence.

307
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:21,120
Silence! Silence!

308
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,824
You, silence!

309
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:42,714
I do apologise again.

310
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,383
If I see your face
in this office again...

311
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,515
Get out!

312
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:56,814
Get out!

313
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,030
Get out!

314
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:05,196
- Did she expel you?
- For what?

315
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,066
Getting your cock out in Assembly.

316
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,546
I'm guessing, but it's possibly
frowned upon.

317
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:12,135
- Even in the state sector.
- She understood the bind I was in.

318
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:14,630
I was doing what I was told.
Very accommodating.

319
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,941
There was something about removing
my bollocks with a monkey wrench

320
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,476
if she ever saw them again.

321
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,069
I think we reached an understanding.

322
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:24,565
Right. To business.

323
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,941
- You mean education?
- Women, JJ.

324
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:27,800
Women?

325
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,813
I mean, I feel like we might be...

326
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:35,160
I don't want to sort of run
before I can... walk...

327
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:41,449
Girls!

328
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,817
- There's a lot of them.
- Yep.

329
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,449
So much choice.
It's disconcerting.

330
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,879
No, it's just a matter of sorting
out the wheat from the chavs.

331
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:57,880
There we are.

332
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:01,664
And the wolf shall lie down
with the lamb.

333
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:05,480
You think she'd lie down with me?

334
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,674
Well, that line is wrong and popularly
misquoted. It should read:

335
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:14,960
"The wolf also shall dwell
with the lamb, and the leopard

336
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,625
"shall lie down with the kid,
and the calf and the young lion

337
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:20,322
"and the fatted calf together
and a little child shall lead them."

338
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,263
We'll try and pick
the bones out of that.

339
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:27,192
I could show her one
of my magic tricks.

340
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,205
Dad says it's an ice-breaker.

341
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,425
Let's try that out, then,
before we go leaping in,

342
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,816
and we can see
who gets the fatted calf, right?

343
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:36,360
Yeah, you.

344
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:40,483
Darling, my mate wants to try out
his pick-up routine on you. That okay?

345
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:42,903
I'm JJ.

346
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,281
Pack of cards.
Nothing funny about them.

347
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,739
Except one minute
they're blue and...

348
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:58,987
You don't mind
if I take this locker?

349
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:01,960
You can take anything
if you want it enough.

350
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:06,527
Great. Everything's new and I
suppose we should probably, like,

351
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:09,006
you know,
all get to know each other.

352
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,159
Why?

353
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:13,772
I dunno.

354
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,487
You definitely looked at me
this morning, twice.

355
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:22,646
I just thought, you know, maybe
we could get to know each other.

356
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:24,275
I look at lots of people.

357
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,418
That doesn't mean
I want to get to know them.

358
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:36,240
Do you want me to want
to get to know you?

359
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:38,831
I wouldn't mind.

360
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:41,680
Thing is, they want
to get to know me too.

361
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:49,118
- They're just wankers.
- They're your best friends.

362
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,880
- So they're my best friends.
- That makes it complicated.

363
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:55,920
I was hoping not.

364
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm Freddie.

365
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,119
Tell you what, Freddie.

366
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:10,400
- Fill in a form.
- What's this?

367
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,360
A list of things
we're not allowed to do.

368
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,400
Like that head director said before
your bestest mate got his cock out.

369
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:20,112
I was gonna see if I could tick 'em
all before the end of the day. But...

370
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,246
this is much more interesting.

371
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,630
First one to fill
that out gets to...

372
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:29,707
get to know me.

373
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,200
And no cheating.

374
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll need evidence.

375
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:38,351
Cos I wouldn't fuck a cheat.

376
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,795
Sorry?

377
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:51,560
Now watch very closely.

378
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:55,795
Where's it gone?

379
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:59,286
- Presto!
- Presto!

380
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:02,360
- Put that away before I lose it.
- Fuck me!

381
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:04,837
Yes, that's alarming.
So I'll just...

382
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,588
And the coup de grace.

383
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,597
Prestissimo!

384
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:19,011
Magic!

385
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:26,092
Question is, pet, does that make
you want to give JJ a blowjob?

386
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,843
Excuse me,
are you fucking deaf or something?

387
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:35,399
Yes, I am deaf.
So why don't you

388
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,905
give him a blowjob
if you love him so much?

389
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:38,840
Tossers.

390
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,298
Especially you.

391
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:45,592
Who are we speaking to here?

392
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:48,157
Pixie's lip reading.
I'm telling you what she says.

393
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:49,864
Right, right. Cool.

394
00:27:52,115 --> 00:27:54,346
She's got tits like choccy Hob Nobs.

395
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,080
I'd like to dunk 'em,
suck 'em and lick off the love.

396
00:27:57,641 --> 00:27:59,881
- I'm not sure...
- Droopy, lardy arse.

397
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:02,395
Bit spready, bit low slung.
You get me?

398
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:05,840
I think we've stumbled upon
a flaw in your thinking.

399
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:09,299
Listen... I mean, wait.

400
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,028
Hang on.

401
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:17,080
Presto. You're cunting
small-balled arsehole bandit.

402
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:23,759
She may be deaf,
she's also extremely rude.

403
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,788
It's bloody annoying
they put us in different forms.

404
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:39,759
I mean, I'm totally useless
and Mum says

405
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:42,784
I have to do Hair & Beauty,
but I'm good at Philosophy, too.

406
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,640
I can't understand
why I can't do Hair and Philosophy.

407
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,949
You can't cos it turns out Hair &
Beauty is one subject, not two.

408
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,347
Blooming Nora, how mad is that?

409
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:54,924
- It's inexplicable, Pandora.
- Yeah. Inexplicable.

410
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,161
- What does inexplicable mean, Eff?
- Can't explain.

411
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:00,119
All right! Suit yourself, then.

412
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:13,425
Hi, I'm Katie.

413
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,519
I'm Bruno and what do you know?

414
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:21,039
- Who's your friend?
- Pandora. You're a corker.

415
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,059
Thanks...

416
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:26,770
It's nice to... I got to go.

417
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,280
Strewth! Do you think he'd do
surf and turf with me, Eff?

418
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,240
- I'll ask.
- Gotta go.

419
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:34,992
Lesson one, practical skills.

420
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:36,918
Filing our nails - handy!

421
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:39,559
I'm Pandora. I'm useless.

422
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:43,695
Cute.

423
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:46,280
I'm Katie, that's my sister.

424
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,240
Aren't you Effy Stonem?

425
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,000
- Haven't you got a really cool brother?
- He's cool.

426
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,487
All my friends fancied him.
I wasn't so fussed.

427
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:56,360
Didn't he go mental?
Anyway I've got a boyfriend.

428
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,320
He plays for Bristol Rover reserves.

429
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:02,279
- Impressive.
- He's well lush. Let's sit together.

430
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:04,000
We can chat because, you know...

431
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,960
We're the best-looking in here,
really. Sorry but we are.

432
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,231
We should hang out.
Definitely.

433
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,797
Oh, no, here it comes.

434
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:13,439
Total lezzer bitch.

435
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,230
Excuse me.

436
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:25,640
Like, don't talk to her.

437
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:28,279
She tried to snog my sister
at middle school.

438
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,710
Pervy. Don't you think, Eff?

439
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:36,679
Watch out, Katie.
I might get confused

440
00:30:36,998 --> 00:30:39,514
and fuck you with my big
strap-on by mistake.

441
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:45,000
Muff-munching bitch.

442
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,205
- Just jumped on you, didn't she...
- Leave it, Katie.

443
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,431
Whatever.

444
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:50,837
Come on.

445
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,240
We'll get the best seats, yeah?

446
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:54,200
So,

447
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:56,920
you the doormat, then?

448
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,934
Sort of.

449
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,925
Interesting,
that you just put up with that.

450
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:10,074
It's a challenging list.
You gotta give her that.

451
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,016
- Sex in school. Tricky.
- Guys, we are now seven minutes...

452
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:15,646
57, 58, 59...

453
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:19,309
- eight minutes late for form induction.
- Shut up, will you, JJ?

454
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,359
Do you think she's serious?

455
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:23,603
There's only one way to find out.

456
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:26,669
Wait a minute. You're not gonna...

457
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,515
I've already got
"teacher abuse" ticked.

458
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:31,373
And how! Your cock
should not be that colour.

459
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:36,454
The game is on, Freddie.
You wanna play?

460
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,089
- Don't be stupid.
- Tell you what, girls like Stupid.

461
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:44,000
- Ain't you worked that out?
- And McFly. Girls like McFly.

462
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:47,434
She's a naughty, naughty little girl

463
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:50,080
and I don't like to disappoint.

464
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:57,130
Someone's left their shit in here.

465
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,715
Nice!

466
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:02,640
Check this out!

467
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,667
Oh, my God. Cook,
I'm not sure if that's legal.

468
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:08,562
That's definitely not legal!

469
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:11,738
Dunno who this Sid guy was but
he's got fucking great taste in gash.

470
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:14,277
I can't look. Don't make me look.
I have to look.

471
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,624
Holy shit! That's forbidden.
Forbidden, <i>verboten</i>, <i>interdit</i>.

472
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:19,240
<i>Prohibido</i>, <i>prohibido</i>!

473
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,695
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,809
- Was I getting locked on, there?
- Locked on, JJ.

475
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,436
I'm all right. I'm fine.
But can I just remind you,

476
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:32,316
in a casual, non-locked-on way,
that we're late?

477
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,516
We're late, we're late, we're late!

478
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:38,320
Sorry.
I'm fine.

479
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:42,027
- We going?
- Hang on.

480
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:45,120
Shoot me.

481
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,013
The fucking camera. Go on.

482
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:51,467
Right, action.

483
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:54,880
- Cook, what the fuck are you doing?
- Action. Do it, man!

484
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:10,120
I was saving this for lunch
but what the fuck?

485
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:11,880
Cheers!

486
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,507
What the fuck are you doing?

487
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:24,812
Fuck me.

488
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:31,263
Sorted.

489
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,560
You are fucking mental.

490
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,117
Mental is as mental does.
But we're late.

491
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,840
Shall we?

492
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:43,295
Let's go.

493
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,727
Come on, run!

494
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:47,852
So, you see,

495
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,775
they don't mean it.
That's what you have to remember.

496
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,608
They're just kids.

497
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:55,353
Kids! Yes?

498
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:57,991
I suppose so.

499
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,135
They don't mean it.

500
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,300
Have you ever fallen off a horse?

501
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:07,229
You have to drink your milk and get
straight back on that horse.

502
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:09,471
Okay? Back. Yes?

503
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:10,879
Uggy uggy uggy!

504
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:11,919
What?

505
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,097
Kids.

506
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,075
Cheeky, immature.

507
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,104
Harmless. They can't hurt you. Okay?

508
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:20,440
- They can't hurt me.
- Good girl.

509
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,127
Saddle up!

510
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:50,428
Across firmly and round it off.

511
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,425
Across firmly and round it off.

512
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,720
Smooth the cuticle, push.

513
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:28,840
{\SURF AND TURF ME!}

514
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,420
Remember to breathe.

515
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:33,126
Smooth the cuticle.

516
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:34,889
Push.

517
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:37,243
Smooth the cuticle.

518
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:40,600
Push.

519
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:42,175
I'm sorry...

520
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:43,999
We're filing. What is it?

521
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:46,734
Well, blimey this is fascinating.

522
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,120
Mega fun. But the thing is...
I have to get out of here.

523
00:35:51,153 --> 00:35:52,008
Sorry?

524
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:56,760
I have to go because I've got
three super-duper zits coming on.

525
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,941
They're like... proper seepers.

526
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,777
Oh, my God!

527
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:03,120
Yes, Go!

528
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:06,880
For God's sake go! Refresh
and moisturise. Don't waste a second.

529
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,152
Refresh and... I'm on it!

530
00:36:13,616 --> 00:36:15,880
Smooth the cuticle. Push.

531
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:25,918
Blooming 'eck. It's big out here.

532
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:44,925
Right.

533
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:49,348
Now... we've gotta...

534
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,896
Christ.

535
00:36:55,617 --> 00:36:56,603
Fuck it.

536
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:04,590
Okay. Whatever...

537
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,208
We've gotta... stand up,

538
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:09,693
say our names

539
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,080
and a unique fact about ourselves.

540
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,423
Right. I'll start.

541
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,131
I'm Kieran

542
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:23,200
and I hate being
a fucking teacher. You.

543
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:31,104
I'm JJ and with regard
to mathematic aptitude

544
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,661
I'm in the top 0.3%
of the population

545
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,703
which is an interesting demographic
statistic because paradoxically

546
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:39,713
my communication,
interpersonal and intuitive skills

547
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,935
- are towards the lower quartiles.
- You've stopped me

548
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:44,308
in my fucking tracks there,
yeah. You.

549
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,567
I'm Katie.

550
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,799
I've never not had a boyfriend
since I was seven.

551
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:54,043
Congratulations. You.

552
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:58,496
I'm Emily.

553
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:02,320
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- Shit happens. You.

554
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:06,520
I'm Naomi.

555
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:07,952
I hate injustice.

556
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,199
People tell lies about me.

557
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,400
You at the back.

558
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:16,173
- I'm Kumir. I'm gay.
- Yup. Good. You.

559
00:38:18,206 --> 00:38:21,216
I'm Max,
and both my parents are artists.

560
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,442
Great. I'm very very happy for you.
What about you? With the bling.

561
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:28,774
I'm Effy.

562
00:38:28,894 --> 00:38:30,760
And I think
my mum's having an affair.

563
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,968
Good one. Shows enterprise.

564
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:35,937
What about you, big man?

565
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:39,259
I'm Freddie.

566
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,360
I met a girl I like today.

567
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,688
She's like...

568
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,339
beautiful.

569
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,236
That's it.

570
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:54,760
That's it? That's your unique fact?
That's just great.

571
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:58,422
Fascinating, Freddie,
thank you for that. What about you?

572
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,183
I'm Katie and
I had Frosties for breakfast.

573
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,320
Frosties, that's product
placement in my opinion.

574
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,720
You there at the back
beside the wee gay man?

575
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:10,903
My name's Nathan and seven members

576
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:13,040
of my immediate
family have been on Crimewatch.

577
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:15,052
Brilliant,
what a year this is gonna be.

578
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,895
I'm feeling rather shit. I think
I need to go to the Nurse's office.

579
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,039
Okay. Go on then.

580
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,427
Right. Where were we?

581
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,160
Oh, stuff it.
Let's just watch a DVD about...

582
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:31,568
Oh, Christ.

583
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,014
"How To Be Inclusive". Holy Mother of
divine shite, who makes up this shit?

584
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:38,800
Actually, Kieran,
I'm not feeling too well either.

585
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:42,229
My balls are aching. I might
have to go and see that nurse.

586
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:43,869
Right! Bugger off then.

587
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,040
- Cheers, Kieran.
- See if she can laser Jordan off them.

588
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:53,360
Right, how the fuck does this...

589
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:03,413
Can I be in this class?
I don't like mine.

590
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,760
Why not? Make up the numbers.
You doing some A levels?

591
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:09,083
One, please. Philosophy.

592
00:40:09,832 --> 00:40:11,136
Okay, sit down.

593
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,200
When you've worked out the point of
living, come and fucking tell me.

594
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:15,752
Whizzer!

595
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:19,320
Where's Effy?

596
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:29,160
They don't have a nurse.

597
00:40:32,745 --> 00:40:34,248
I just gotta get drugs.

598
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,200
And sex.

599
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:40,115
Grab my balls! Grab my balls!
