1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:03,271
The police are back and they want to
talk to you both about Sophia Morton.

2
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:04,466
Do you know her Emily?

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,699
No.

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:08,248
We heard you three were quite chummy.

5
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:09,388
I met her once.

6
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:13,007
- Do you know someone gave her drugs the night she died?
- Ain't got nothin' on us.

7
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,019
It was me who sold her the MDMA.

8
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:16,962
You've been checking up on me?

9
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:18,050
Was it you she killed herself for?

10
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,382
She stalked me.

11
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:24,146
- She went through my rubbish.
- We started again before.

12
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:25,157
Will you do it now?

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,705
I don't think so.

14
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,175
I've lost the gym.

15
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:31,607
- You're unemployed?
- Yeah, love. I'm bankrupt.

16
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:34,467
It's you I spent all summer thinking about.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,039
Who fucking wants one now?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sync by fant0m www.addic7ed.com

19
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,887
James Cook.

20
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,596
Your brief wants to meet you.

21
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:54,626
He any good?

22
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,476
Plead guilty. Right?

23
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,019
Right?

24
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:14,000
You wouldn't feed this to a pig.

25
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:15,964
Not even a pig you hated.

26
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,914
Life is this.

27
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,500
This.

28
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:29,207
You get born, eat some
processed crap, then you die.

29
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:32,609
Right. And you're gonna get me
off somewhere in-between, yeah?

30
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,113
Sit down.

31
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:40,416
I'm your legal aid brief and, er,

32
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,342
I'll make sure you... Face the right way,

33
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:47,131
say yes or no in the right order...

34
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,306
And probably waste too much of
everybody's bloody time, basically.

35
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,969
GBH... affray...

36
00:02:55,004 --> 00:03:00,032
Punched the fuck out
of... Shanky Jenkinson.

37
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:02,005
Do you know him? Do you know Shanky?

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,251
No.

39
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:05,538
Any particular reason?

40
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:07,273
I was provoked...

41
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,184
By Shanky?

42
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,024
By who?

43
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,367
Who? Who provoked you?

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,483
No?

45
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:22,613
It's your first offence.

46
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:25,845
Plead guilty and, by the
miracle of British justice,

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,356
you'll get a bullshit
Community Service Order.

48
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,360
Not guilty.

49
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,916
James, you did punch the
fuck out of, er, Shanky

50
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:42,690
in front of... 83 witnesses.

51
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:50,888
Not guilty.

52
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,356
Pardon?

53
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,827
Sorry. I thought you
said "not guilty" there.

54
00:03:58,058 --> 00:03:59,972
Yeah... Yeah, he is,

55
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,687
pleading not guilty.

56
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,717
Really?

57
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,413
Really.

58
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,075
Right.

59
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:16,535
Right. Well, trial for the
15th of this month at 10am.

60
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,846
Remanded on bail with an
electronic tagging order.

61
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:21,615
And Duncan...

62
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,701
Yeah.

63
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:29,266
Really looking forward to
hearing you defend this one.

64
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,516
Yeah, it's too tight, man.

65
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:33,959
Good.

66
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,461
Just checking.

67
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:38,361
Every day, between the
hours of 7pm and 7am,

68
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,081
you've got to be in your
house. Right? Or it goes off.

69
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,243
I haven't got a house.

70
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:46,009
It says here you'll be
staying with a Miss Ruth Byatt.

71
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,016
What?!

72
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,313
I ain't staying with her. No way!

73
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:54,166
Yes, you are. Otherwise,
bleep, bleep, we'll arrest you,

74
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,625
bang you up, and probably bang you
about a bit while we're doing it.

75
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,209
He's joking.

76
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:13,446
And he said, "Is that what
you call a broom handle?"

77
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:16,684
Miss Byatt?

78
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,271
Mum.

79
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,389
Hello, Jimmy. How you been?

80
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,044
Nobody calls me Jimmy now, Mum.

81
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,292
Hello... Smelly.

82
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,057
He's dying to see you.

83
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,229
Go on. Go on!

84
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:15,178
Right!

85
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:17,050
I'm home!

86
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,620
Where's my little sex monkey?

87
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,694
Wet willy!

88
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,319
Cook!

89
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
Nipple cripple!

90
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,366
Mum says she forgives
you and you can come back.

91
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,841
Yes.

92
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,393
Yeah.

93
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:18,418
And we got pizza to celebrate.

94
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:22,366
Oh, yeah. That's great, innit, bruv?

95
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,240
Pizza.

96
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,976
Oh, fuck me, you monkey!

97
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,261
Oh, fucking hell!

98
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:51,491
Oh, fuck me!

99
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:06,310
Fuck me, you monkey!

100
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,749
Wasn't me.

101
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:04,041
Fuck them.

102
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,694
Oh, here he is. Come
and have some breakfast.

103
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:12,324
Jimmy, this is Alex. He's
going to be doing a piece on me.

104
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:15,125
Your mother is a genius.

105
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,311
The greatest conceptual
artist since Duchamp.

106
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,776
He's going to be doing me all week.

107
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,957
Great.

108
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:23,871
Jimmy's a criminal.

109
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,540
But we're forgiving him.

110
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:29,044
Ruth says you're her greatest creation.

111
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,266
A walking conceptual
installation. That's cool, man.

112
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:36,969
But all your work's mesmerising.

113
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,650
I mean, look at this.

114
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:42,733
Composition, confluence, concept, wow!

115
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:45,987
- Mum, whose tits are those?
- Don't be silly! Can't you tell?

116
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:48,763
It's tactile, you know?

117
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:52,154
Yeah. You just want to touch them...

118
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:54,050
You just want to come on them!

119
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,439
Will you go to prison?

120
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:04,600
I might.

121
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,160
But if you say sorry,

122
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,650
won't they let you go?

123
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,085
I'm not sorry.

124
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,080
Why not?

125
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,462
Never say sorry, kid.

126
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,547
Why?

127
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,300
Cos you're not a pussy, are you?

128
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:18,348
No.

129
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:21,390
We don't play their game, do
we? We don't play anyone's game.

130
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:25,407
- Except for Rock Band. We can play that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can play that.

131
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:27,503
Finished?

132
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:28,584
Yeah.

133
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:34,688
You're barmy!

134
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,308
Cor, this is posh.

135
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:39,737
It's rubbish!

136
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,001
Who's giving you shit, then, dude?

137
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,771
Him.

138
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,506
Erm... him and him. No, not him, he's nice.

139
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,831
Him, he kicked me in the balls twice.

140
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,414
Lads!

141
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,270
Right, in.

142
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,751
But I want to hang out with you.

143
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,528
In!

144
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:04,270
I'm gonna be enjoying my freedom.

145
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,758
Doing what?

146
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,988
I'm going to have a white riot! Touch me.

147
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,700
Oh, yes!

148
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:22,341
Look, you cannot spin it.
You're not allowed to spin it.

149
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:30,344
Anyway, it was two
against one, you wankers.

150
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:36,508
Hey! Do you think we
should go cheer her up?

151
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:38,027
How do you expect to do that, J?

152
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:40,535
Her boyfriend's just cheated on her
with the hottest of the hot, mate.

153
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,878
Yup.

154
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:44,782
Andrea is maximo hot. I
think about her sometimes.

155
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:48,412
When I'm in bed. When I'm cosy.

156
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:49,823
Just before I go to sleep.

157
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,329
Sorry.

158
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,047
Ok, I'm back. Right.

159
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:04,002
Y'all right, Panda Pops?

160
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,398
Not really.

161
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,188
You know, love's thoroughly
over-rated, Panda.

162
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:14,977
I've never even had a girlfriend
and look how happy I am.

163
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:17,687
In between minor psychological breakdowns.

164
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:22,728
Sure, all the serotonin, endorphins
and sex, et cetera, feel good.

165
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:27,483
But really, "love" is an illusion.

166
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,700
It can't last.

167
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:31,278
Nope.

168
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:34,963
Nicely done.

169
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,699
Well,
howdy-fucking-doody.

170
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:09,666
Hi, Cook.

171
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:15,879
I just swarmed by, really, to
see how deep everyone's rolling.

172
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:17,588
See who's up for a pint and a poke?

173
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:18,891
JJ? Panda?

174
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:20,160
No, thanks.

175
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:21,749
No?

176
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,260
Why?

177
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,559
Just don't want to.

178
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:35,496
Naomi, what about you? Bring
your lady, make it a threesome.

179
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,413
What's up with you two?

180
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:41,456
Black guy?

181
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,812
Anyone?

182
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,348
Aren't you scared, Cooky?

183
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:47,503
Of what?

184
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:48,869
Of going to the blimmin' chokey!

185
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,633
We'll come.

186
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,204
Nah, you're all right.

187
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:58,853
- What happened to you?
- You don't remember?

188
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,651
No, remember what?

189
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,713
Who fucked you?

190
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,181
Ah. Finally. The famous Mr. Cook.

191
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:11,100
Hi. Dave.

192
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:16,072
Dave Blood. We have met before,
in fact, but take my card.

193
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,420
We should powwow.

194
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,025
I can see that this college
has failed you, Mr. Cook.

195
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,531
And I am deeply sorry. But that
is ten years of willy-nilly policy

196
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,717
and red tape nonsensery for you.

197
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:38,542
So unfortunately, since you've
been implicated, as it were,

198
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:42,739
by the law, you have been
automatically... expelled.

199
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:44,104
Expunged.

200
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,678
Excommunicated.

201
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,716
And I'm going to have to
ask you to... scoot off.

202
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,732
Or what?

203
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:53,294
Well, or Jonathan here
will escort you with,

204
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,185
er, you know,

205
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,414
extreme prejudice.

206
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:59,373
Dude...

207
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,369
Jonathan can kiss my arse.

208
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:04,476
Unless he's tired from
licking yours, that is.

209
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:05,504
Jonathan?

210
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,868
Yes, that is tremendously amusing.

211
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:13,067
Nevertheless, you are
going to have to abrogate

212
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:15,740
and egress from the premises.

213
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,290
Don't touch me!

214
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:21,376
This way.

215
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:24,130
- Get your fucking hands off, pussy!
- Come on!

216
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,697
What the fuck are you doing?!

217
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:32,644
It's an incident, certainly.

218
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,547
Reasonable force utilised in self-defence.

219
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,218
Defence.

220
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:45,407
Luckily, it's all over now and,
er, you can all go back to normal.

221
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,495
Good morning.

222
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:52,812
- Cook, are you all right?
- Fuck off, you!

223
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,658
When did you get so
sorry for yourself, Cook?

224
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,024
We can talk about her.

225
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,028
That's why you're here, isn't it?

226
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:13,243
We gave that girl Sophia drugs.

227
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,195
I didn't give her nothing.

228
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,599
And I had an affair with her as well.

229
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:18,647
What?

230
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:22,828
And now she's dead.

231
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:29,778
That's why you're here. You feel bad.

232
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,907
Fuck off!

233
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:37,400
I just come round to see if you
wanted that non-lezza willy waggle.

234
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:38,879
That's all.

235
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:40,283
Yeah, right.

236
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,707
Do you want to know how I feel?

237
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:48,665
I feel fucking terrible. My
girlfriend won't look at me.

238
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,165
I could cry every minute.

239
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,614
I feel shit and all I can do is...

240
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:55,909
feel it.

241
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,605
Deal with it!

242
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:07,761
Waggle me!

243
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:21,340
Yes?

244
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,219
Come to see how my case is going, Duncan.

245
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:25,469
You haven't got a case.

246
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,847
That's a matter of opinion, that is, mate.

247
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,189
Matter of opinion.

248
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:39,644
Well...

249
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,194
In summary, you've got about
as much chance of getting off

250
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,700
as I have of blagging a
shag with Angelina Jolie.

251
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:48,651
Well, lose the moustache, then, probably.

252
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,469
It's just not happening, kid.

253
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,344
To use legal terminology,
you're guilty as fuck.

254
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,762
Yeah, me mum says I
should get a proper lawyer.

255
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,299
What?

256
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,802
You don't care?

257
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:10,604
No.

258
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:14,097
I really, really don't.
You see, I get paid anyway.

259
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:15,699
She's filthy rich, man.

260
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:16,840
She's famous.

261
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,943
Yeah?

262
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,180
- Yeah.
- Lucky you.

263
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:22,920
Look, Duncan, stuff's happened to me, man.

264
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,981
You should know about this. You
should be out there telling them

265
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,879
all the shit that's gone down in my life.

266
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:30,166
Duncan, are you smoking a number?

267
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,018
You got a problem?

268
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,126
Yeah, problem! You're
taking the fucking piss!

269
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:39,483
Doesn't anyone owe me anything
here? Don't I get a hearing, no?!

270
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,430
You put a kid in hospital.

271
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,306
Remember?

272
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:44,615
What's your excuse?

273
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,724
People.

274
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,906
People fucked me up, man.

275
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:51,353
Well, go tell that to a judge.

276
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,583
"Mummy fucked me up."

277
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,410
Don't fucking speak about my mother!

278
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,168
You don't talk about her, all right?

279
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,192
I'm not.

280
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:00,102
You are.

281
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:07,949
Proper shit, aren't ya?
Proper fucking shit, aren't ya?

282
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:44,912
What do you think?

283
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,045
Is it true?

284
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,719
Jimmy, art is always true.

285
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,742
Why did you leave my dad?

286
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:57,818
Because he was a twat.

287
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:58,853
Agreed?

288
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,992
He was entertaining.

289
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,199
Good in bed.

290
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:04,677
Didn't give a flying fuck
for anyone or anything.

291
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:07,120
Ultimately it just gets
on your tits. Bit boring.

292
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,684
Is that why you threw me out?

293
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,884
You sold my wedding rings to buy dope.

294
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,933
You wanted me to throw you out.

295
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,391
Didn't you?

296
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:28,994
But hey, that's over.

297
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,963
You've come to see my work.

298
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,956
I love that.

299
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,304
And look. I'm hot!

300
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,692
Aren't you proud of what I've done?

301
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:41,288
Oh, my God! Ruth! This
is... I am totally engaged!

302
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:43,375
Come and see the masterpiece.

303
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,902
It's going to make Damien Hirst want
to cut his cock off and pickle it.

304
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:53,276
- Lights, darling.
- What?

305
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,687
I want to strip naked, it's so good.

306
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:07,565
Yes, it is. Thank you.

307
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:08,874
It's real, you know.

308
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:11,652
So, so real.

309
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,164
What do you reckon, kidder?
Has the girl done good?

310
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,453
You little shit!!

311
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:26,946
- You did that on purpose.
- No!

312
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,064
You smart bastard! Don't
think I don't know! Get out!

313
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,163
Go on, get out!

314
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:05,182
Yeah, is Shanky in, please?

315
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,240
Shanky!

316
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:10,980
Friend!

317
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,647
Yeah, Shanky.

318
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:21,120
You Shanky, yeah?

319
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:23,933
Look...

320
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,731
This is weird...

321
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,633
Look, I didn't... I've come round
to say sorry, well, you know, like...

322
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:36,501
It wasn't your fault, d'you know, like.

323
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:40,753
See, they're going to send me
down, so if you could say anything,

324
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:44,971
like, I dunno, how I come over
and said sorry. I am sorry, mate.

325
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,209
You know?

326
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:50,805
I hope they get you in the
showers and fuck you up the arse.

327
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:11,149
Mate, listen. Thank Christ you're here.

328
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,709
Your mum's on one, again.
I've just come round...

329
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,049
Yeah? I want to talk to you.

330
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:19,418
Well, look who it is. The man who's
just cost me ninety thousand quid.

331
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,917
Hello, you sweet little turd.

332
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,910
- Mum?
- That's right, still your mum.

333
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:26,065
And... yep.

334
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:29,122
Where's Paddy?

335
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:31,812
Oh, he's gone to see that friend.

336
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,468
What's his name... Never mind.

337
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:36,211
Look who's here.

338
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:39,249
Freddie! Freddie, Freddie.
Long time no see, Freddie!

339
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:41,269
What do you want, man?

340
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:42,334
I came to see if you're
all right, if that's ok.

341
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:44,030
Yeah, I'm fine!

342
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,828
Mm-hm. Tipsy-topsy!

343
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:49,080
Well, I'm glad that someone
is. Cos we've got a...

344
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:52,298
Hey, now we can have a
proper party, can't we?

345
00:24:58,274 --> 00:25:00,947
Come on, what's the matter with you?!

346
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:02,105
Sitting on your fat arses.

347
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,327
Mum!

348
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:16,585
What's the fucking matter with you?!

349
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,838
Come on!

350
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:23,788
What's wrong with you?!
We're all fucking... adults...

351
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,092
She hasn't changed, then.

352
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:43,665
Your 15th birthday party.

353
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,952
What?!

354
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:51,835
Where was I?

355
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,100
Drunk.

356
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,684
You had six coconut daiquiris. And
anyway, I was last man standing,

357
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,865
and I was still fucked off my head.

358
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,015
So you fucked my mum?!

359
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,127
It wasn't like that!

360
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,050
Well, tell me, Fred.
What the fuck was it like?

361
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:06,293
Hang on. No, don't answer that shit.

362
00:26:07,654 --> 00:26:09,210
It was just a blow job.

363
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,668
Oh! What a relief, man! Thank goodness!

364
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,038
I'll make it up to you.

365
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,426
How are you going to do that, Freddie?

366
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:18,385
I let you take the one fucking
girl I've ever loved, man.

367
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:23,698
Is there anyone else I care about
that you want to slip one to, mate?

368
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:24,881
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,050
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:31,250
It's fine.

371
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,443
Sorted. Everything's cool.

372
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:38,912
Effy loves me. How can I...

373
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,711
Stop talking about it!

374
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:47,705
You smashed JJ, Cook.

375
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,323
I...

376
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,903
I didn't.

377
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,405
He loves you, Cook.

378
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:03,684
Well, that's all.

379
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,240
And I love you too.

380
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,831
Whatever you're doing, you can stop.

381
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:28,083
All you got to do is stop.

382
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:33,055
And I don't want to see
you again. Understand?

383
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,299
I thought he was with his friends.

384
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:37,509
He was. Just not in a good way.

385
00:28:37,544 --> 00:28:40,078
You want to speak to him.

386
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:42,613
I will. I'm going to.

387
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:43,747
Don't you worry.

388
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:44,778
Ok.

389
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:47,839
If I hear about you again...

390
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,700
Anyway.

391
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:53,780
Good evening.

392
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,745
Good evening.

393
00:28:58,396 --> 00:28:59,317
What did you do?

394
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,493
Me and Paul drank six Red Bulls each,

395
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:04,308
we farted in a lift, we swam in a fountain,

396
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:08,188
stole bras from M&S and we
started a fire on College Green

397
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:09,936
and all the filth showed up.

398
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:11,800
Daft little boot, you are.
What d'you do that for?

399
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,791
Cos I'm not a pussy.

400
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,872
Every time I try and do
something for this family!

401
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:23,260
Mum!

402
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,753
See?!

403
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:28,222
That's what you get! All right?!

404
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,242
Everything's gone wrong
since you've come back.

405
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:34,378
You're like an infection!

406
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:39,198
Go on, that's right! You
all bugger off in the end.

407
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:43,983
That's right, just go on!
Go on! Just bugger off!

408
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:08,622
Keep it steady.

409
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,255
Ah! Get off!

410
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:30,134
Go on, mate! Go on, kid!

411
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:17,113
Take it easy.

412
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:25,743
I fucking love you,
Pads, you hear me, yeah?

413
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:27,342
It's just you and me, mate.

414
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,475
No-one else understands.

415
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:36,518
Yeah. Fuck everybody! Fuck Mum!

416
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,036
Fuck everybody!

417
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:40,938
Everybody else is a fucking
tosser! A fucking tosser!

418
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:46,150
A fucking tosser, I hate them!

419
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:14,401
Ey up. Look out your window.

420
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:19,526
Looking good.

421
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,976
We didn't kill her, you know.

422
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,275
She killed herself.

423
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,302
It doesn't help, though.

424
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:00,400
I still spend every day
feeling like I want to puke.

425
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:11,988
How's Emily?

426
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,430
Angry.

427
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,642
So... lonely.

428
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:31,841
It all means so much to you, doesn't it?

429
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,387
- What?
- Life.

430
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:40,314
You just live a bit harder
than everybody else does.

431
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,782
You splash about.

432
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:45,175
You wallow in it.

433
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,893
Like you can't lose a moment.

434
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:50,514
Yeah, I'm well hard.

435
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,261
The thing is, Naomi, you splash about,

436
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,396
other people get wet.

437
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:30,471
I don't give a fuck or
anything, it's just...

438
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:33,767
You get a bit...

439
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:35,219
You know.

440
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:55,920
Fuck's sake! I'm never going
to get to bone you, am I?

441
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:58,458
No.

442
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,931
I love someone.

443
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,820
You and me both, girl.

444
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:06,985
You and me both.

445
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,399
Lot of people looking for you.

446
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,873
Where's your brother?

447
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:36,372
Friend's house. He's sleeping.

448
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:38,794
- Got to give him back.
- I know.

449
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,333
I'd, er, I'd probably get
another lawyer, if I were you.

450
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:49,601
Cos, I'm pretty fucking
shit all round, you know.

451
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:53,200
Yeah, you're shit.

452
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,204
But you're my shit. Ok?

453
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:58,639
I'm the only defence lawyer I
know with a 100% conviction rate.

454
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:00,818
Oh, jeez.

455
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:05,458
They're going to put you in jail, James.

456
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:12,252
What's eating you? What
are you rebelling against?

457
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,712
What've you got?

458
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:18,137
There you go, you see. You're
too fucking smart for most people.

459
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:21,614
They don't even know you're
quoting Marlon Brando. Do they?

460
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:24,844
You're pretty sharp
yourself, for a shit lawyer.

461
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:28,775
Well, it's easier, ain't it? Blaming
all your shit on everyone else.

462
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:32,672
Well, come on, then, why don't you
tell me something you have done?

463
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:37,237
That you did... all by
your shitty little self.

464
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:41,768
Last year, I stole my
best friend's girlfriend

465
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:44,115
just because I could.

466
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,678
Then I fucked her mate, best mate,
multiple times, man, just because I could.

467
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:52,330
It's chicken feed, James.

468
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:54,548
What is this? Oprah?

469
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,972
Tell me something fucking worthwhile!

470
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,792
Come on, you dick!

471
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:07,308
- Just wanted to fucking crack someone.
- Right.

472
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:10,866
He just...

473
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:12,722
Freddie, man.

474
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:19,456
I couldn't stand the way that
she was fucking looking at him.

475
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:27,668
And I was thinking, why does
everybody get to piss on me?

476
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:35,171
Everybody always fucking pisses on me.

477
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:41,569
My fucking mum.

478
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:47,577
My dad is a fucking tosser.

479
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:50,654
And no-one gives a shit!

480
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:56,206
Everybody's just out
for them-fucking-selves!

481
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,020
Ah, grow up.

482
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:00,908
They won't give a shit. So fucking what?!

483
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,659
So I fucking smashed
the shit out of that kid!

484
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:07,937
I fucking kicked the shit out
of him and I fucking enjoyed it!

485
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:11,239
I enjoyed it, ok?

486
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:12,794
Ok.

487
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,333
That's pretty good.

488
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,974
- Duncan?
- Yeah, kid?

489
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:40,289
There's something else.

490
00:38:40,324 --> 00:38:43,384
The kid was pestering me, man.

491
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:47,908
She kept on asking me for MDMA.

492
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:49,455
- Sophia?
- Yeah.

493
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:54,340
Yeah. So eventually, you know, I just...

494
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,245
I just gave her some just to
shut her up more than anything.

495
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,165
Then, I didn't see her again
until she fell off the balcony.

496
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:14,625
- Do you want a lawyer here, James?
- No. It's fine.

497
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,232
- He knows what I'm telling you.
- And nobody else was involved?

498
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,874
Nope, nobody but me.

499
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:11,566
- Been up to much?
- Oh, you know.

500
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,626
I bet it's all action.

501
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,264
Ballroom dancing in the morning,

502
00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:18,132
followed by a gin rummy tournament
and bumming in the showers.

503
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,588
Yeah, I can barely sit.

504
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:24,132
We're coming to your trial thing tomorrow.

505
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,568
- We?
- Yeah. We.

506
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,515
Freddie's worried sick.

507
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,975
I bet he is.

508
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,734
Probably scared I'm going to get
off and steal his woman again.

509
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,764
I love him, Cook. That's
what I came to say.

510
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:53,456
How is the love?

511
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:57,222
It's a bit of a head fuck, to be honest.

512
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,266
Not simple.

513
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:01,656
I know you'd understand that.

514
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,843
But I'm giving it a go.

515
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,019
That's what I always loved about you, Cook.

516
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:11,304
Brave.

517
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,210
Eff?

518
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:27,089
Would you tell JJ... you know.

519
00:41:47,478 --> 00:41:50,584
- You care.
- I don't.

520
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:52,865
Yeah.

521
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:57,854
Good job this isn't no win, no
fee, otherwise you'd be fucked.

522
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:14,863
James Cook.

523
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:21,888
Cook! Cook! No! Let go!

524
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:23,680
- Cook!
- What are you doing here?

525
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:27,515
- I bunked off school. I don't give a shit. I want to watch!
- Listen!

526
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,453
Be a big man for me, ok?

527
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:32,796
I need you to sit there for
us and wait. You can't come in.

528
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,105
- Come and sit over here.
- Tell them to piss off!

529
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,485
Tell them you didn't anything!

530
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:48,222
And how do you plead?

531
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:49,735
Guilty.

532
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:56,374
Mr. Cook, you've wasted a lot of our time,

533
00:42:56,409 --> 00:43:00,318
and bail has been a disaster.

534
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,926
Your mother says she's unable
to control your behaviour

535
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:06,533
and she is unwilling to accept
you back into the family home.

536
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:08,372
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

537
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:11,695
So I'm afraid a custodial
sentence is inevitable.

538
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,983
In any case, I'm told
there may be other charges.

539
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:19,196
However, since you
wisely changed your plea,

540
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:22,006
we're going to remand you
into custody for reports.

541
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:24,782
You should expect to be
there for several months.

542
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:27,821
And James, while you're there,

543
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,990
I strongly advise you to behave yourself.

544
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:35,927
Sentence set for two weeks
from today. Take him down.

545
00:43:38,941 --> 00:43:41,297
Cook! What's happening?

546
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:46,019
What's happening, Cook?!
Tell them to piss off! Cook!

547
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,733
It seems your father has
let us down once again.

548
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:17,172
Because of his stupidity, this
house is being taken from us.

549
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:18,935
Who the fuck do you think you are?

550
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:24,129
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?

551
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:31,500
Do you fancy me?

552
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,700
- Just checking.
- Of course.

553
