1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:02,687
{\a3}You're fucking da-humped.

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:08,080
{\a3}- What's going on here, then?
- Ah, you know... The winds of change.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,850
{\a3}You're my girlfriend!

4
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:12,730
{\a3}- And you're my best friend.
- Tony, I love her.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,400
{\a3}No, you don't.
He loves Cassie.

6
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:17,895
{\a3}I love you.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,065
{\a3}<i>I love you too.</i>

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,640
{\a3}Are you the only person
in the world that's been let down?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,120
{\a3}Are you?

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,440
{\a3}Can't you forgive me?

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,160
{\a3}I've had my pain, Jal.

12
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:33,058
{\a3}Yours is in the post.

13
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,410
JAL

14
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:13,916
OK, here we go.

15
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:26,796
Chris.

16
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,927
I've got something to tell you.
I'm pregnant.

17
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,920
I wanna keep the baby.
Is that OK?

18
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:36,211
Chris, I've got something
to tell you.

19
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:37,640
I'm pregnant.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,280
I'm gonna have an abortion.
Is that OK?

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,120
Chris. I'm pregnant.

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,415
What d'you think?

23
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:02,413


24
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,796
Sigmund... Freud...

25
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,246
What the fuck did he do?

26
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:17,558
Oh, fuck.

27
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:18,651
Fuck.

28
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,357
Fuck.

29
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,498
Oh, blast!

30
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,526
I'm actually fucked.

31
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:27,400
Ignorance is fucking bliss, man.
I was fine before.

32
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:30,640
I was totally fine before I started
revising. Now look at me.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,357
Fuck this shit.
I'm bellin' some beanies, man.

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,045
Thank you, Kenneth.

35
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:41,400
Thank you everybody,
a little attention, please!

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,094
Anwar, boyo, shut it!

37
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,111
Yes, thank you, Doug.

38
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,415
No problem.

39
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,080
You may be wondering...

40
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,221
You may be wondering

41
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,742
what happened to study leave.

42
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,960
Well.

43
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:05,303
Never, in my 25 years as a teacher,

44
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:08,550
have I come across a year 13
so utterly

45
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,288
catastrophically, terminally stupid.

46
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,240
And that is why
study leave has been abolished.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,640
Kids.

48
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,940
If you're not going to do it
for yourselves,

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,800
do it for us.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,542
Please!

51
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,400
From now on...

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,219
it's revision on the premises.

53
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,000
9 til 4.30.

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,400
No excuses, no exceptions
or you're expelled.

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,960
We will be centre of excellence
if it kills me. Got it?

56
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,380
Screw you lives up
in your own time!

57
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,600
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, it's Shaniqua, you pussy-hole.</i>

58
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:56,651
<i>Where are you?</i>

59
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,559
- Just hold on one moment.
- <i>It's Shaniqua.</i>

60
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:02,264
<i>With an N and an A and
a Q near the end. Remember?</i>

61
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:05,296
- Shaniqua?
<i>- Yeah, Shaniqua.</i>

62
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Yo.

63
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:12,496
Javon, didn't I expell you?

64
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,640
Basketball team made it
to the quarterfinals.

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,810
Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,680
Doug? What's that about?
No study leave?

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm a man about the town.
I had appointments.

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Yeah.
I wanted to go to Thorpe Park.

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,240
Alright, settle down,
let's not panic.

70
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,258
We've still got...

71
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,307
five days before exams, kids.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,249
Come on, let me hear you.
Oggy oggy oggy!

73
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,812
Chelle.

74
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,467
I need to speak to you.

75
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:55,719


76
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,513


77
00:04:57,718 --> 00:05:01,154


78
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,695


79
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,920


80
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:13,921


81
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,525


82
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,440


83
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,110


84
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,640


85
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,120


86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,679
Jal?

87
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,341
Have you made your decision?

88
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,853
You have to be honest
with yourself, Jal.

89
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,240
Honesty is the best policy.

90
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:46,680
- You think?
- I do think.

91
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,948
Have you told the father?

92
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:52,640
Have you told anyone?

93
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:56,640
Jal, very soon,
your body's going to change.

94
00:05:57,211 --> 00:06:00,720
I know, and I'm gonna make a choice.
I am.

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,138
Hi Chris.

96
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:11,520
Shit.
Sorry, I lost track of time.

97
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,851
- Um, I'm at the bank.
- <i>What you doing at the bank?</i>

98
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,041
Banking.
<i>I'm cooking for you. Hurry up.</i>

99
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,111
I'll be there soon. Yeah? Bye.

100
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,639
When?

101
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,079
Soon. Honest.

102
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,029
You've got a lot to carry.

103
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,709
I'm used to it. Got a lot of
revision. Clarinet's not heavy.

104
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,880
I don't mean your bags.

105
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:40,768
I'm used to it.

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,769
Take these
and read them carefully, OK?

107
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,440
What does that mean?

108
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:49,064
"What would Jesus do?"

109
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,989
Oh, why you crying now?

110
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Oh, shit.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Amerie! Give it back! You fucking
give Usher his lolly back, now! NOW!

112
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,120
Get up. Pick your stuff up.
Come on, move, you dozy cow.

113
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,239
Posh bitch.

114
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,759
And... open.

115
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,009
It's your favourite.

116
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:36,697
What is?

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,161
Eggy bread!

118
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,409
Oh, right.
Why is it black?

119
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,846
I prefer the term
"African-American".

120
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,453
You're something else.

121
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:46,523
Let me see what we have here.

122
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,389
Chateauneuf de lager.

123
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,959
Yeah?

124
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,730
Let's get you some of that, then.

125
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,650
For you, madame.

126
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,969
Chris,
I've got something to tell you.

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,269
Cool. Me too. I got you a present!

128
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,320
Hey? Cut this morning
while you were at the bank.

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,129
Right, I know it might
seem a bit fast, but, well,

130
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,289
I think we're ready, so, er,

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,319
Jal...

132
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:17,920
I want you to move in with me.

133
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,760
- What?
- I want your stuff

134
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,406
to be in this house.

135
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,240
Yeah?
What could be better than that?

136
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,160
What did you wanna tell me?

137
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:32,240
I love you.

138
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:35,085
Hey, now you're talking.
I was thinking...

139
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,319
Don't think.

140
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,393
Sorry.

141
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,752
Not again.
Please, Jal, not again.

142
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,039
You can't walk me to the lake
and then not let the camel drink.

143
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,609
I'm fucking thirsty.

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,019
I can't.

145
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,040
What the fuck's going on?

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,879
I feel like I'm giving you
everything, but...

147
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:08,999
Sorry.

148
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,183
Not even a cheeky foot-job?

149
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,489
Ainsley. Ainsley. Gordon...!

150
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,480
Man, you're gonna burn it, man.
What's the matter with you?

151
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,909
Blud, I put in too much olive oil.

152
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,439
You don't listen, do you?

153
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,880
Cooking oil only. Olive oil is
for special foods like omelettes.

154
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:10,109
Hi, Dad.

155
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,240
Look what the cat dragged in.

156
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,480
Yo, Jal.
Come do some pancakeage innit.

157
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:16,960
Where you been?

158
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,239
Out.

159
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:19,640
I know you been out.

160
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm saying, where you been?

161
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,720
Well?

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,559
With Chris.

163
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,119
You've got exams and an audition
coming up.

164
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,480
Forget about him,
the boy's a waster.

165
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,209
He's not a waster.

166
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:36,009
He's a drugged-up,
good-for-nothing waster.

167
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:38,280
Anyone can see
you won't end up with him.

168
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:39,680
How d'you know?

169
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,344
- It's not gonna happen.
- Yeah?

170
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,720
And you know all about
relationships, Dad, don't you?

171
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,079
Oi! Who saw me flippage?

172
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,839
Eh, it's like doing crack, innit?

173
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,680
Eh, Wilbur, where my gold star, man?

174
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,439
- Shush, man.
- Yo, but that was...

175
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,559
I said shush!

176
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:58,160
You look me in the eye and swear to me
this boy won't mess you up somehow.

177
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:01,800
Why don't you get a life
of your own and stay out of mine, OK

178
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,672
Hey, Ronnie.

179
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,173
Come get some pancakes, man. Huh?

180
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,399
What you saying?

181
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,544
Lemon, chocolate, butter...?

182
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:30,879
I can't.

183
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Can I?

184
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:13,879
Hello?

185
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,519
Morning, Jal.

186
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,760
Hi Cass.
It's not the morning, by the way.

187
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:35,685
Does it matter?

188
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,720
Needed somewhere quiet to revise.

189
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,232
Well. It's quiet, isn't it?

190
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,749
I haven't spoken to you
in such a long time, Jal.

191
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,239
Gotta revise, Cass.

192
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,960
It's not like you need to.
Forget the books. Let's talk.

193
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,400
- What about?
- I dunno.

194
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:59,640
Fill me in with everything.
Every little detail.

195
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,502
There's nothing really
to talk about.

196
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:03,265
I'm really happy, Jal.

197
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,181
Things worked out for once.

198
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:09,633
Isn't that great?

199
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:11,679
- Sid?
- He just left.

200
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,784
We've been getting
to know each other again. A lot.

201
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,119
Cool.

202
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,769
And it's lovely having someone
who cares about you.

203
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,479
All the worries feel lighter

204
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,949
when you've got someone
you can tell everything to. Yeah?

205
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:39,076
We can carry on pretending,
if it makes you feel any better.

206
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:42,109
Treat it like a role play.
I love drama.

207
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,439
What?

208
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,200
Do you wanna play Jal, or should I?

209
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:50,840
Shut up, Cassie.
I'm trying to revise here.

210
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,360
I've got so much to do,
so little time.

211
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:56,706
Revision, even though I'm going to
music college, I can't help myself.

212
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:59,852
I've gotta revise, cos it takes
my mind off being pregnant.

213
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,000
What?!

214
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
All these books.
Stops me thinking about anything.

215
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,139
Stops me thinking about why I'm
keeping a secret from my boyfriend.

216
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,799
Please...

217
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,512
Or my best friends.

218
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,840
Please don't tell, Cass.

219
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,995
Secrets hurt.

220
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,240
It's only a matter of time before
you and Chris know everything

221
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:24,919
about each other, Jal.

222
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,489
And there's a lot
of secrets out there.

223
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,999
Breakfast?

224
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,359
Bye.

225
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,969
Hey, I'm home.

226
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:50,993
Who's my babe?

227
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:31,536
Oi! Get back to class!
Thank you.

228
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,760
Very good. Mm-hmm. Thank you.

229
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,729
Ah... Go back to sleep, man.

230
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,239
- Maxxie!
- All right, guys?

231
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,079
Max. Over here.
I saved you a seat.

232
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,849
Um, I want you guys
to meet someone. James.

233
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,169
James. Yeah, man.

234
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,440
It's James.

235
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,040
Everyone knows James, man.

236
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,479
Sit down.

237
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,759
Hey.

238
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,199
James. You can use my book, yeah?

239
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,920
Yeah, OK. Nice one. Cheers, mate.

240
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,069
So. James.

241
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,849
What's he like?

242
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,897
He's good.

243
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,159
Really good.

244
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,319
That's cool.

245
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:32,008
Hey. There she is.

246
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:37,080
There's such a shenanigans ting,
bruv. Make a man horny and ting.

247
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:40,780
{\a7}Blood! Bare linkages like.
What's going on?

248
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,720


249
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,932
Hey, Jal,

250
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,802
how's the revision?

251
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,480
Chelle, can we go
outside for some fresh air?

252
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,909


253
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:04,209


254
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:07,589


255
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:11,168


256
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:12,679
Chelle.

257
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:14,829


258
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,029


259
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,322


260
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:22,879
Chelle, I need to...

261
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,600


262
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:29,480


263
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,639
What?

264
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,689
What does fucking "embarazada" mean?

265
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,540
Shit, I've gotta revise.
I'm never gonna pass.

266
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:44,720
Michelle.
Can you just stand still and...

267
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:53,960
Carry your books?

268
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,709
I haven't got any books, Tony.

269
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,189
They're in the study room.

270
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,602
Let's go get them.

271
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,629
Then I'll carry them.

272
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,600
I know I should talk to Chris.
It's just...

273
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,269
Telling him will make it real
and you'll have to decide.

274
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,689
You need some time out.

275
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:41,249
This is where I come for a bit
of peace and quiet. Come on.

276
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,639
Hey, Bob.

277
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:46,400
Hey, Gretel! Not seen you for a bit.

278
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:50,159
Oh, wow. Well, I finally got it
together with that Sinbad guy

279
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,086
- I was telling you about.
- Sinbad?

280
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:54,976
Thought he'd never pull it together.
Lucky Sinbad.

281
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:58,672
Bob, this is Esmeralda,
but everyone calls her Alda.

282
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,868
It's her first time here.
She's into Lady Luck.

283
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:05,919
Well, then.

284
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,440
There's something for nothing.
Take a chance.

285
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,251
Thanks.

286
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,959
Alda?

287
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,759
You can pull any face behind a mask.
But be careful.

288
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:17,839
Why?

289
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,999
Because someone else
might be pretending.

290
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:23,719
You might not be the
only one with a secret.

291
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:26,071
Cass. For Christ's sakes!

292
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,512
Whoo! I win, motherfucker!

293
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,919
How often do you come here?

294
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,689
Don't you get it, Alda?

295
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,209
This is nowhere.

296
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,360
Nothing matters here.

297
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,029
That's what you want, isn't it?

298
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:50,359
I don't know.

299
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:54,730
Go on.
See how your luck's running.

300
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:59,129
Win means you decide one way.
Lose, and you decide another.

301
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,331
You decide.

302
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,041
Wow! A golden one!

303
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,074
You win.
So what's the decision, Alda?

304
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,439
Jal, blud!

305
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,799
Come tru man! Family meeting.

306
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,274
I know your parents have gone
to Blackpool for the week,

307
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,439
but you're not my family, Donald.

308
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,429
We all started in Africa.

309
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,449
We callin' this family meeting,

00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,480

I told you, Ronnie, these guys
would grow out of the rap ting.

314
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:50,840
This time next week,
they'll wanna be reggae selectas.

315
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,360
Don't watch. Man's trying to build
a new kind of empire, you get me?

316
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:57,934
The clothing revolution starts here!

You're bad jokers, man.

334
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,609
So all I need, my favourite Papa
Was a Preacher Man to do is...

335
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,240
Sign da six figure deal.

336
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:08,909
What you saying, Jal?
Do I sign? Or am I in over my head?

337
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm pregnant.

338
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:32,999
Bloodfire!

339
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,299
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

340
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,769
<i>Jal, where are you?
I wanna talk to you. Call me.</i>

341
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:52,939
<i>Next message.</i>

342
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:56,499
<i>Hi, Jal. OK, so I looked it up
in the Spanish dictionary.</i>

343
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:58,569
<i>Ring me. Ring me, Jal, please.</i>

344
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:17,828
Sit down.

345
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,240
I said sit.

346
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,697
Give me the plan.

347
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,979
Move in with Chris? Have a kid?

348
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,249
Have a couple?

349
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:36,620
Maybe.

350
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,859
- Look at me.
- I don't want to.

351
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,699
You fucking look at me!

352
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:43,779
Dad!

353
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:47,099
It's simple. You either
fuck up your life or you don't.

354
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,115
You've got an audition,
music college.

355
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:53,164
Everything you've been working for,
everything I've been paying for!

356
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,786
- I'm not going to that audition.
- Why?

357
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,669
I can't even look at you right now.

358
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,339
I'm... disappointed.

359
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,139
Disappointed?

360
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,409
OK, I'm a big fat disappointment!

361
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,480
Yeah, you are!
Jesus! Why are you doing this to me?

362
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,699
- Stop it.
- If your mother was here...

363
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,659
Oh! Well, I'd like to see that!

364
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:16,377
But she's not here,
she won't set foot in this place!

365
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,889
You did something,

366
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:22,049
you fucked up so bad, and one day
we're gonna find out what you did.

367
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,219
- I don't know what I did.
- Crap!

368
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,888
What would my mum say, Dad?
Where is my mum?

369
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:29,160
Shut your mouth!

370
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,553
Where is she?!

371
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,364
No! What would my mum say, Dad?

372
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:35,061
Come back here!

373
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,134
Yo...

374
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,969
Uncle Lynton in the house!

375
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:07,859
Go away.

376
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,299
It's blessed.

377
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,428
What you bawlin' for?

378
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,348
Got a young blood nephew
passing through

379
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,640
We're already feeling it still.

380
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:25,469
I love you guys.

381
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,269
Gimme some of that love.

382
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:38,349
I never clocked how lucrative
the "Do You" baby range could be.

383
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:51,055
You all right? I thought you were
coming round last night.

384
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:52,787
Yeah, sorry.

385
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,314
Cassie says that
I should to talk to you.

386
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:59,918
I can't. I've gotta go to London
for my audition and back for my oral.

387
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:01,619
I know, but you need to hear this.

388
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:03,619
- No.
- I waited for you and...

389
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:04,739
Not now!

390
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:08,110
Hold on, look, listen...

391
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,303
What are we waiting for?
Come and live with me.

392
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,003
We're gonna run out of time
if you don't stand still...

393
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:16,129
I've gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

394
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:17,339
Yeah, I know.

395
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:19,059
You... You know?

396
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:21,819
I know that if you go to that
audition, then you'll get in,

397
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,458
and then, sooner or later,
we'll be over.

398
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,299
You don't know what
you're talking about.

399
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:27,419
No?

400
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:29,379
Look, my pad's this way.

401
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,179
My music audition.

402
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,520
Don't go.

403
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,515
- What?!
- I need ya.

404
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:37,179
- It's not like I've got in yet.
- You'll get in!

405
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,059
And then you'll probably move in
with some fucking music student

406
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,729
called Terry from East Anglia,
who blows a fucking trombone,

407
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,436
and then you'll sit up discussing
your blowing techniques,

408
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,520
- then you'll blow him.
- Huh?

409
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,109
And I fucking love you.

410
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,109
Yeah, you'll move in with him
and I could be, like, dying,

411
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:58,446
yeah, and you wouldn't
even know about it.

412
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:06,049
I'm just going to an audition.
Then we're gonna talk, Chris.

413
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,000
Wish me luck.

414
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,099
Luck.

415
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:16,009
All right, no blowing
trombones, then, yeah?

416
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:23,659
Yeah.

417
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:49,534
Jalanda Fazer.

418
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:58,459
Which of the four pieces
are you playing for us today?

419
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,579
The Brahms.

420
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:00,779
Brahms?

421
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,019
A bit of a cop out.

422
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Cop out?

423
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:07,949
It's the easiest piece
out of the four,

424
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,684
and we're about challenge.

425
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,339
- We need to know if you are, too.
- But...

426
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:14,499
So we'll give the Weber a crack,

427
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,038
unless you feel you aren't up to it.

428
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,229
Oh, let her play the easy piece.

429
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:22,920
I'll play the fucking Weber.

430
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:32,178
What are you lookin' at?

431
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:46,659
Hi, Cassie.

432
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,779
Hi, Chelle.

433
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,767
Um... I was just wondering
if Jal was here.

434
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,853
Thought we could go
to the oral together.

435
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,299
She's not here.

436
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,899
- OK?
- Cassie.

437
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,960
- Has she told him yet?
- It's none of our business, Chelle.

438
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,619
Look, I want to talk to him.

439
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,256
Chris went to bed.

440
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,269
He's not feeling well again.

441
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,934
She'll be at the oral.

442
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:15,200
She always does
what she's supposed to do.

443
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:18,750
Look, Cassie...

444
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,560
I'm really sorry about me and Sid.

445
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:25,291
He saw sense.

446
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,320
I'm glad.

447
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:29,920
Good luck, Chelle.

448
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:15,689
Hello?

449
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,389
Hello, Jalanda.

450
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:35,674
Mum?

451
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:38,659
Is this real?

452
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,629
Everything's real, darling.

453
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,589
You'd better tuck in

454
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,987
before Ace and Lynton come.

455
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,709
You won't be here
when Ace and Lynton come.

456
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Sit down.

457
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,200
I hear you've got a boyfriend.

458
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,433
Who said...?

459
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,789
Right, Dad told you.

460
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:13,478
Ronnie tells me a lot of things.

461
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:17,339
No, he doesn't. He doesn't talk
about you, you don't exist for him.

462
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,559
Well, you know all about it,
don't you?

463
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:24,129
Dad wouldn't. He hates you.

464
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,369
One thing I know for certain about
Ronnie is that he doesn't hate me.

465
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:34,283
Jalanda,
there is a reason for everything.

466
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,927
Whatever you do now
about this baby...

467
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:40,854
will have a reason.

468
00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:43,503
You'll understand it,
maybe nobody else will.

469
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:46,840
But you can live with that,
can't you?

470
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,529
Where the fuck were you?!

471
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,810
I remember standing...

472
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,809
in this kitchen one Tuesday.

473
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:01,555
I scraped sauce off Lynton's coat

474
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:05,129
and wiped snot off Ace's knee.

475
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,379
And I re-did
the plaits in your hair.

476
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:11,942
And I watched you go off to school.

477
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:15,299
And I knew that your Dad

478
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:17,696
was coming in from the afternoon
flight from New York.

479
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,248
We needed you.

480
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,815
I couldn't stand that.

481
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,166
It was easy to go upstairs
and pack a bag,

482
00:35:27,286 --> 00:35:28,720
walk to the bus stop,

483
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:30,699
get on.

484
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,789
I had some choices.

485
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,726
I had some choices,

486
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,649
and that's what I did.

487
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:45,255
Did you know
the maximum text charge

488
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,982
from one mobile phone
network to another is 30p?

489
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:53,122
And you couldn't even spare
30 fucking pence to check I was OK,

490
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,195
to say happy birthday!

491
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:57,280
Talking now is gonna achieve what?

492
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,120
Tell me,
because my network's fucking cheap!

493
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,080
You made your choice.

494
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:06,356
- Jalanda...
- It's Jal.

495
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,062
Jalanda...

496
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,600
The one thing that your
father couldn't forgive was...

497
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:20,647
I wasn't honest.

498
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,409
I didn't tell him.

499
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:24,819
That was all.

500
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,029
You'd better go before
Ace and Lynton get back.

501
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,092
Bueno. Jalanda...

502
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:41,779


503
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,475


504
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:51,357


505
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:59,435


506
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:03,815


507
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,093


508
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,081


509
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:11,920


510
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:14,649


511
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:19,448


512
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,755


513
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,276


514
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,959


515
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,589


516
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,010


517
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,995


518
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:42,985


519
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:46,577


520
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:51,179
Jalanda.

521
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,009
Chris?

522
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,180
I've been trying to call you!

523
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,671
Where the fuck have you been?

524
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,729
Well, they had coffee,

525
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:11,739
but I thought these looked so
vibrant I couldn't resist.

526
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,910
Cassie, nothing's making sense.

527
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,059
I couldn't choose a flavour, so
the man suggested we had lucky dip,

528
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:18,629
like a thunderball.

529
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,139
Mmm, guava...

530
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,709
With a hint of papaya...

531
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,370
Cassie, what's wrong with Chris?

532
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,379
So refreshing. I can feel the steel
drums chiming against my taste buds.

533
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:32,499
Cassie.

534
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:35,840
I don't want to play any more!

535
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:40,729
What the fuck's going on?

536
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,179
I told you.

537
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:46,259
He had a headache. Said he'd just
nip down to the hospital.

538
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:47,840
Nip? To the hospital?

539
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,139
What's wrong with him?

540
00:39:52,615 --> 00:39:54,819
What if I just told him your secret?

541
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,098
What?

542
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:59,489
You're not the only one, Jal.

543
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,299
What are you on about, Cass?

544
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:02,819
Chris doesn't have secrets.

545
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:04,579
I know all there is to know...

546
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:06,349
You never saw the pills?

547
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:09,979
Chris is always taking pills and
I'm always telling him to stop, but...

548
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:11,612
Not those kind.

549
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:15,480
The kind that you're
supposed to take.

550
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,059
Why?

551
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:21,480
Because there's
something wrong with you.

552
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:26,800
What kind of pills, Cassie?

553
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:30,089
He fell on the floor, Jal.

554
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:33,849
There was blood in his ear.
I didn't know what to do.

555
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:35,469
Cassie Ainsworth?

556
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,800
- Is there a Cassie Ainsworth here?
- Here.

557
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,609
This way, please.

558
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:42,829
Why are they asking for you?

559
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:47,929
He'll have to explain.

560
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:50,249
He can't do anything else now.

561
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:52,914
Go on.

562
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,234
I keep stepping on mines, Cass.

563
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,850
I know.

564
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:39,739
Chris?

565
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,609
Are you the girlfriend?

566
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:44,019
Good. He's nearly gone.

567
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,891
What? Where?

568
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,899
Premeds.

569
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,769
He'll be out in a minute.

570
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:51,989
Go on. Have a chat.

571
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,056
Chris. What's wrong?

572
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:09,600
The sky is blue
and the grass is green.

573
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:17,389
Good mood shit.

574
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:23,382
Everything's...

575
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:25,760
Everything's cool.

576
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:28,670
What pills do you take?

577
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:32,200
Everything.

578
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,899
I stick the packets on the wall.

579
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,360
What pills?!

580
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:41,781
It's a secret.

581
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:43,788
No-one knows.

582
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,869
Don't tell Jal cos...

583
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:53,217
then if you tell Jal...

584
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,480
... she won't move in
with me any more.

585
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:05,219
I'm pregnant.

586
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,360
I might have to have a baby.

587
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:15,161
Or I might have to...

588
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:17,974
I might want...

589
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:26,709
Why is he like that?

590
00:43:27,499 --> 00:43:30,339
It's probably a mixture of
the premeds for the operation...

591
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:31,699
What operation?

592
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:33,939
The swelling on his brain
caused by the clot

593
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:35,739
isn't doing
him any good, though.

594
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:38,320
That's why we've decided
to keep him under until...

595
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,909
The doctor explained
all this to you.

596
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:45,270
It's marked as
"Girlfriend spoke to doctor".

597
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,529
You said you knew about this
because of the hereditary aspect.

598
00:43:50,853 --> 00:43:52,040
The brother.

599
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,469
The brother died of the same thing.

600
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:01,560
What's happening?

601
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,109
What are they doing?

602
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:06,819
Chris.

603
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:10,619
Chris?! Oh, my God,
can you hear me, Chris?!

604
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:11,659
Out!

605
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:13,899
What's wrong?!
What's wrong with him?!

606
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,120
Calm down!

607
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,134
Tell me what's wrong with him.

608
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:20,400
Where's he going?
Where are you taking him?

609
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,659
Where's he going? Chris!

610
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:24,779
Come on.

611
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:26,429
Get off, get off me!

612
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:45,019
Any...

613
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:49,759
Any chance of a cheeky foot job?

614
00:44:54,979 --> 00:44:57,661
This is all my luck.

615
00:44:58,467 --> 00:44:59,714
It's all I got.

616
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,851

Sync: Nathbot

617
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,160
{\a3}You may turn over your papers.

618
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,360
{\a3}- I'll love you forever, Sid.
- You will?

619
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,880
{\a3}Yes. That's the problem.

620
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,417
{\a3}I fucked up. Tony fucked up.
Sid fucked up.

621
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:08,760
{\a3}Jal's fucked up the worst, but it
doesn't have to turn to shit.

622
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,400
{\a3}You're her. You're Chris's Mum.

623
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:12,728
{\a3}It's the vanilla.

624
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:14,600
{\a3}Maybe not great with meatballs.

625
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:18,529
{\a3}<i>I stopped eating and then
everyone had to do what I said.</i>

626
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,149
{\a3}I fell in love.

627
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:21,659
{\a3}Ah, love.

628
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:24,520
{\a3}Why cut yourself when
you can be in love?
