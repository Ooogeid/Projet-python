1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,969
I'm Katie.I've never not had a boyfriend since I was seven.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,259
That's my sister.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,130
I want to have sex with girls.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,933
Why didn't you tell me?

5
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,439
I'm sorry, maybe my postal application hasn't reached you yet.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,759
Take them off.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,800
This is a once-only charity event, you understand.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,170
Karen, I told you...
Hi, Effy.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,039
Please don't take him from me.
What?

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,460
As if you could take him from me.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,980
Where are we going?

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,810
It's you and me, babe. It's always gonna be you and me.

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,509
* Dirty, dirty, beautiful *

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,610
* Dirty rich *

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,049
* Dirty, dirty rich *

16
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,329
* Dirty, dirty rich *

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,810
* Beautiful *

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,209
* Beautiful, dirty, dirty rich, rich *

19
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,099
* Dirty, dirty... *

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,550
Katie Fitch, History as exam. *

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,470
Good to see you back, Katie.

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,450
History at the back there.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,119
Hi, Katie, I...

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,220
Hi.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,360
* Honey, but we got no money *

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,709
* Daddy, I'm so sorry *

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,909
* I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah *

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,619
* We just like to party *

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,999
* Like to p-p-party, yeah... *

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
Ok, kids, you can turn over your papers, and no funny business.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,340
Let's get ready to rumble!

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,470
* We're beautiful and dirty rich *

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,079
* We live a cute life, soundfematic *

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
* Pants tigh-ter than plastic, honey *

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,589
* But we got no money *

36
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,129
* We do the dance right *

37
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,269
* We have got it made like ice cream topped with honey *

38
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,660
* But we got no money... *

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,120
Katie?

40
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,400
Katie? Can I come in?

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,770
How about some sun, eh?

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,239
Don't.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,930
I think so.

44
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,130
Come and do PlayStation with James.

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,820
I could fix your hair.

46
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,459
What difference would it make?

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,879
Still look awful.

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,719
Oh, no. Marks don't last.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,420
They cover up.

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,740
I rang college today about your history exam.

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,890
Why? I told you not to!

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,750
It's important!

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,170
They said you can sit it later.

54
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,900
When you're yourself.

55
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,260
I'm rubbish at history anyway.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,290
Rubbish at everything.

57
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,899
Not like Emily.

58
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,670
Oh, hush!

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,760
I hope they lock that Stonem girl up when they find her.

60
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,280
Nice job.

61
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,959
Stop it!

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,599
Don't. It took fucking ages!

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,170
Yeah, well.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,559
Wish I had someone to pass my exams for me.
Yeah.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,559
I hope you're gonna finish the job

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,239
and dump Freddie for her as well.

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,270
Oh, that's over. Katie knows it.

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,530
Yeah.

69
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,330
It was an eventful barbecue.

70
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,680
Adultery makes a party go with such a swing!

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,849
It's not funny.

72
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,729
Effy hurt her.

73
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,140
Like I said, it was eventful.

74
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,510
You should dress up more often.

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,050
They're Katie's.

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,969
Yeah? You look nice.

77
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,300
From the neck down.

78
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,210
Naomi...

79
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,110
I think I'm going away for the summer.

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920
Oh.

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,630
Spain, Cyprus perhaps.

82
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,190
By myself.

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,019
Spend some time by myself, you know? Do some thinking.

84
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,460
By... myself.

85
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,620
About what?

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,709
Let's just be friends, OK?

87
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,450
We say that, don't we?

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,260
Yeah.

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,010
Have a good summer.

90
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,750
I'll miss you.

91
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,240
I can't stand it. I can't.

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,779
It's ok.

93
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,100
Jesus.

94
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,970
Christ. Let's get out of here.

95
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,719
Katie?

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,390
I... thought you were Katie.

97
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,770
Oh, shit.

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,730
Shit, shit, shit, girl.

99
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,380
* In your brown eyes *

100
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,970
* I walked away *

101
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,830
* In your brown eyes *

102
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,610
* I couldn't stay *

103
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,580
* In your brown eyes *

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,310
* You watch her go *

105
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,490
* And turn the record on *

106
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,219
* And wonder what went wrong *

107
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,150
* What went wrong, brown eyes. *

108
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,819
That's secret!

109
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,029
Fuck off, worm.

110
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,029
Dinner's ready, bitch!

111
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,959
Excuse me?

112
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,926
Gordon Macpherson says "bitch" all the time.

113
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:37,129
Now I say it too.
You don't say it to me, ok?

114
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,059
Ok, sorry.

115
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,139
What's in the box, James? I know you know the combination.

116
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,879
I don't, Emily changed it after I...

117
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,450
After you what?

118
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,230
Nothing.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,099
What's in the box, James?

120
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,079
It's a secret. Oh!

121
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,889
I'm waiting.

122
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,420
Ok, ok.

123
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,180
Fannies! It's full of fannies!

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,430
You ok?

125
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,070
Yeah.

126
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,720
What about your mum?

127
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,700
This is my room.

128
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,370
No-one's allowed in here.

129
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,000
I wish I had a room like that.

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,520
Katie and me,

131
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,759
we're always together.

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,349
Everything together.

133
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,430
Eating, sleeping...

134
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,659
until we were nine we used to take a dump at the same time.

135
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,240
Jesus!

136
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,709
Yeah.

137
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,630
No secrets, there's no point.

138
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,320
And what about this one?

139
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,820
Naomi...

140
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,270
I want to tell people.

141
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,630
That you're gay?

142
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,660
I want to tell people about us.

143
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,879
Come to the college ball with me.

144
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,969
Like we're...

145
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,160
together.

146
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,100
I don't want to do that.

147
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,700
Why not?

148
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,059
Em, it's nobody's business.

149
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,699
Why? Who cares what other people...

150
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,230
Emily.

151
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm not like you.

152
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,389
I'm not sure, like you are.

153
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,480
What aren't you sure of?

154
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,429
Can't things ever be complicated?

155
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,349
Fine. You like boys too?

156
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,560
Maybe.

157
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,330
Maybe I only like boys, apart from you.

158
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,369
Well, that's fucking great!

159
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,780
You're so in touch with yourself, aren't you?

160
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,230
Come to the ball with me.

161
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,089
Don't do that.

162
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,489
No. You don't do that.

163
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm not your fucking experiment!

164
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,440
Where are my fucking...?

165
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,520
Oh, my fucking shoes!

166
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,350
Oh, fuck it! Keep them.

167
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm tired.

168
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,700
So sick and tired of it.

169
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,410
Still holding hands through a cat flap, aren't we?

170
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,480
Have fun in Cyprus.

171
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:05,820
* Turn away, run away Turn away, run away, run away

172
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,739
* Turn away, run away Turn away, run away, turn away... *

173
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,310
Hi, Emily.

174
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,339
Where are your shoes?

175
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,730
They...

176
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,860
Hello.

177
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,310
I couldn't find them.

178
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,539
Well, you can wear mine.

179
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,089
No, you don't need to.

180
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,610
It's ok.

181
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,370
I don't mind bare feet. It's easier to run.

182
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,540
Here. Let me give you a jacket.

183
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,789
No, really, Thomas...

184
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,890
It's fine. I have three coats. See?

185
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,340
Now, all fixed up, yes?

186
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,950
What do you do if someone you love lets you down?

187
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,650
Really fucks you over?

188
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,390
You must try to stop loving them.

189
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,790
Is that possible?

190
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,640
No. I don't think so.

191
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,010
I'm gay, Thomas.

192
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,600
It's fine.

193
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:41,819
Shall we call a taxi?

194
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,060
I don't think this bus is going to come soon.

195
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,940
Besides, my feet are extremely cold.

196
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,639
It's pathetic.

197
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,649
This guy can hardly do ten reps

198
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,919
on a bench press without retching like a baby.

199
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,039
Eventually I had to say to him,

200
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,079
"Ken, if you puke one more time in my gym"

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,899
"it won't be your heart you'll have to worry about"

202
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
"cos I'll kill you meself!"

203
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,619
That's great, Rob.

204
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,469
I'm sure he'll appreciate it...eventually

205
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,599
Too right. No pain, no drain, no gain, yeah? Yeah?

206
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,099
I'm sure that's right.

207
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,019
You don't get your gluts and your pecs taut

208
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,059
without reps, reps, reps.

209
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,769
I'm always saying that.

210
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,609
Yes, you are.

211
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,419
Wow. Great soup. What is it?

212
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,599
Artichoke and beetroot.

213
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,169
Babe, you're the best. You feed us like champions.

214
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,310
It won't make you fit, it'll make you what, Katiekins?

215
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,699
Fitch.

216
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,410
Yes! Don't get fit, get Fitch, right?

217
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,839
I want fish and chips. This tastes like bollocky wankshite.

218
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,749
James!
What?

219
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,509
They say bollocky wankshite all the time

220
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,479
at Gordon Macpherson's house.

221
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,409
Mrs Macpherson says as long as swearing is used in context,

222
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,840
it's fucking A.

223
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,809
Rob! That's ten reps on the naughty bar.

224
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,429
Why, why, why?!

225
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,059
We're not Macpherson, we're Fitch. Do it. Go!

226
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,389
Go, go!

227
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,350
It's just not fair.
And proper extension, boy.

228
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,420
One...

229
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,930
Two...

230
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,939
Three...

231
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,079
Come on, kid. Put some burn into it!

232
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,450
Four...

233
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,129
Five...

234
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,159
Emily, is that you, darling?         Six

235
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,540
Dinner's getting cold.

236
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,920
Get up, kid. You can do the last four reps before bed.

237
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,659
You smell...
Shut up

238
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,820
What have you been doing?

239
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,490
Nothing.

240
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,779
You look like you've been fighting.

241
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,220
Well, I haven't.

242
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,120
Look, leave me alone.

243
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,390
Ok.

244
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,190
Is it a boy that's upset you?

245
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,499
Look, mum, I don't think she wants to talk about it.

246
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,019
Well, I do.

247
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,250
Cos if it's been a boy that's been...

248
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,910
You look like you've been roughed up, so tell me.

249
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,749
It wasn't a boy.

250
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,339
Yeah, see? So... it was a girl.

251
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,099
You've been fighting with a girl? That's not very ladylike.

252
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,900
No, Dad. I've been making love to a girl.

253
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,980
Ok?

254
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,220
Everybody satisfied?

255
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,159
You're such a liar. Don't listen to her.

256
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,869
Her name's Naomi.

257
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,710
She's rather beautiful.

258
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,799
So I was nailing her.

259
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,940
Sorry?

260
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,869
Ok, ok, I get it.

261
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,869
Nice one. Had me going there!

262
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,720
I've got to mind my own business.

263
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,079
Funny, very nice.

264
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,289
Very nice!

265
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,619
You've got to give it to her! Convincing!

266
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,249
Dad. I'm trying to tell you...
Shut up!

267
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,450
I've got Mambo Badminton at nine. High calorie burn.

268
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,620
I love those moves.

269
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,179
"Nailing her..."

270
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,930
You're funny!

271
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,949
Gordon Macpherson says you call them dykes,

272
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,850
because you have to stick your finger in them.

273
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,899
You ruined my fucking top.

274
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,883
I sat your exam for you. You could've at least backed me up.

275
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,349
I did back you up!

276
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,509
I just spent an hour downstairs trying to convince mum

277
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,396
that you made it all up.
That's fucking great.

278
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:56,920
Because you have!

279
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,249
What?

280
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,039
You've just conjured up this thing with Naomi because....

281
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,020
I don't know, maybe you're jealous of me.

282
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,659
Jealous?

283
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,079
Yes, jealous, because I get more boys than you,

284
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,655
I look better in clothes than you and I'm more popular than you.

285
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,939
Fuck off.
Yeah, I think so.

286
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,480
You can't stand it, it's sad.

287
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,099
So are you gonna stop now before you hurt everybody?

288
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,279
Fuck off.

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,519
You're not gay. You're just stupid.

290
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,189
Right, I'm stupid. I'm stupid because I don't let anyone fuck me

291
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,859
when they're in love with somebody else?

292
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,069
What?

293
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,489
You let Freddie use you and look where it's got you.

294
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,179
That's a normal relationship, isn't it?

295
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,679
She fucked you up good, didn't she?

296
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,910
Nobody hits me over the head with a rock. Loser.

297
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,500
Katie.

298
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,480
Look at me!

299
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,220
I'm still Emily.

300
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,479
Oh!

301
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,499
Sorry.

302
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,280
That's ok. I'm always in a rush.

303
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,869
I'm sorry, I don't think we've...

304
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,490
Naomi, I'm a friend of Emily's.

305
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,689
Come in.
Oh, I thought you were in...

306
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,129
No, really, it's fine. They're all still in bed.

307
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,730
Come in.

308
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,240
I should go.

309
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,870
Please.

310
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,640
Sit down. Please.

311
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,640
I just...
Emily's impressionable.

312
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,880
What?

313
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,280
She's the younger twin.

314
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,799
Right.

315
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,959
And that means that somehow she's always in her sister's shadow.

316
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,229
I don't know why that is, but it is.

317
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,289
Katie's always in charge.

318
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,860
And I think Emily wants to, I don't know,

319
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,739
do something to feel that she's...

320
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,219
I don't know what we're talking about here.

321
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,430
Yes, you do.

322
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,199
So I want you to stop putting ideas

323
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:17,061
into her head, ok?

324
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,719
She's not gay.

325
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,749
I'm not gay.

326
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,280
Right, so there's nothing to worry about then, is there?

327
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,409
Because they're the apple of their dad's eye.

328
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,549
He loves them, like, fierce, you know?

329
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,219
Just the way they are. Normal, happy twins,

330
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,549
and they're more alike than you'll ever know.

331
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,040
Are you sure of that?

332
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,150
I want you to disappear now, Naomi.

333
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,140
Don't screw her up, ok?

334
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,270
Goodbye, Naomi.

335
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,509
Sory

336
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,140
Huh?

337
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,829
Why are you talking Twin?

339
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,439
We don't do that any more.

340
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,900
say you're sorry too

341
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,800
sorry

342
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,890
Are you getting dressed?

343
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,080
Are you going out?

344
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,710
Yep. I'm sick of this fucking house.

345
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,180
I'm sick of being sick.

346
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,710
Where are you going?

347
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,949
We're going shopping.

348
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,070
For what?

349
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,729
For Love Ball dresses.

350
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,110
We don't have dates.

351
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,870
So we'll go together.

352
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,259
I don't want to.

353
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,000
We're going together!

354
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,030
Please, I need you, ok?

355
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,439
I want my packed lunch.
Shit.

356
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Whoa! You're naked, bitch.

357
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,410
kick the shit out of him

358
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,550
Sorry!

359
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,450
Mum! Mum!

360
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,509
* I don't care just where you go *

361
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,369
* As long, as long as it's with me *

362
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,409
* And I don't mind just what you do *

363
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,840
* As long, as long as it's with me... *

364
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,359
Oh.

365
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,389
Hi.

366
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,790
Hi, Panda.

367
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,220
How you feeling?

368
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,299
Yeah, I'm better.

369
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,949
You're feeling better? That's great.

370
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,220
Have you heard from Effy?

371
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,439
I'm sure she didn't mean...

372
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,590
Oh, I think she meant it, don't you?

373
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,819
It's not your fault, Panda. What are you doing?

375
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,956
I bought this dress for the Love Ball

376
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:20,475
in case Thomas forgave me.

377
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,120
Anyway, I'm taking it back.

378
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,469
We haven't got anyone to go with

379
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,809
but we're still going. Right, Ems?

380
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,619
Yeah, I suppose.

381
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,569
So keep your dress and we'll go together, ok?

382
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,059
Just the girls, right?

383
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,069
You mean, like, go girls?

384
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,309
Yeah, go girls. Right. You got it.

385
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,760
Ok, go girls. Whizzer.

386
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,740
See you, Panda.

387
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,209
I'm never doing surf and turf with boys ever again.

388
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,640
It just fucks everything up, don't it?

389
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,290
Let's shop.

390
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,240
* Yeah *

391
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,440
* Millionaires *

392
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,720
* That's right *

393
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,679
* Friday night, it's time to party *

394
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,509
* Drop it down and get real naughty *

395
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,361
* Girls talk shit, we don't care *

396
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:09,169
* We'll take off our underwear *

397
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:10,999
* Drinking cocktails, beers with lime *

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,799
* All these guys yell, "She's a dime!" *

399
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,479
* I just wink and blow a kiss *

400
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,700
* While other girls just bitch and diss *

401
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,300
* Come get fucked up *

402
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,719
* Give me my alcohol *

403
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,070
* Let's get fucked up *

404
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,509
* A-L-C-O-H-O-L *

405
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,940
* Fucked up... *

406
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,549
Shit.

407
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,539
Shit.

408
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,090
What the fuck is he doing here?

409
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,319
Do you want to go?

410
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,280
Yeah... no... I don't know.

411
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,200
Come on, let's go.

412
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,979
Christ, is he coming over?

413
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,610
No, he's not that stupid.

414
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,760
Oh, fuck.

415
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,140
Fuck.

416
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,569
Hi, Katie.
What do you want?

417
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,059
Nothing, I just wanted to see how you are.

418
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,030
Oh! Now you want to see how I am.

419
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,310
Thanks, that's well compassionate.

420
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,660
Cheers.

421
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,199
Hi, Emily.

422
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,169
Hi.

423
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,780
I didn't know what to say.

424
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,539
I fucked up.
No, Freddie.

425
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,109
You fucked Effy when you were meant to be fucking me.

426
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,660
Oh, yeah, after she hit me with a rock!

427
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,990
Right.

428
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,520
Yeah.

429
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm trying on dresses.

430
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,219
So, mum bought me my first man suit for the Love Ball.

431
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,629
65% polyester, 35% viscose.

432
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,689
It is a bit crackly and

433
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:50,369
I don't like the way the cat rubs against me...

434
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,499
JJ, shut up.

435
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,509
I needed a tie... and I'm winding up.

436
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,809
Freddie brought me here and...

437
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,810
I've stopped. I've stopped, but still uncomfortable.

438
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,400
Do I really have to tell you what to do now?

439
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,749
You didn't tell anyone about me and you, did you, JJ?

440
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,079
No, no. Of course not.

441
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,179
Because that's a secret.

442
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,539
Yep. Schtum.

443
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,460
Need-to-know basis. Zipped it. Total, total secret.

444
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,619
I told Freddie.
JJ!

445
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,999
No, no, no, no. It's fine, it's fine,

446
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,100
he doesn't even mind that you're gay either.

447
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,190
Come on. Let's get you a fucking tie.

448
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,430
Can't you see I just want to make things right?

449
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,080
You can't.

450
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,999
Look at the state of me.

451
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,370
What can I do?

452
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,820
You humiliated me.

453
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,870
Effy doesn't even want you.

454
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,469
No.

455
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,290
No, cos otherwise she'd be here and not with Cook.

456
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,589
There's nothing I can do

457
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,210
to make you want me more than her, is there?

458
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
Katie, I'm sorry.

459
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,299
But you fucking owe me, Freddie. You owe me!

460
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,820
Ok.

461
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,539
You'll take me to that ball

462
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,339
and everyone will see you looking like you like it.

463
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,839
Right, but I told JJ I'd go with him. He's a bit shy.

464
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,069
He's taking Emily.

465
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,159
Oh, he'd like that.

466
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,629
I don't care if he'd like that. He's doing it.

467
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,820
Ok.

468
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,680
I suppose after they had their thing...

469
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,390
He was very animated, you know.

470
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,840
Sorry?

471
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,220
You know, when they got it on.

472
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,830
I told him he was a lucky, lucky boy.

473
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,040
Right.

474
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,979
Yeah, she said he was cute.

475
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,030
Cute? He was fucking ecstatic.

476
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,510
But that's a secret, yeah?

477
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,100
Yeah, yeah, well, she tells me everything.

478
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,490
I figured.

479
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,879
I told you there was a guy in here.

480
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,549
Excuse me, I'm changing!

481
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,369
You've got to come with me.

482
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,220
That's disgusting. They probably pinched stuff.

483
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,119
Yeah, I've gotta frisk you.

484
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,349
Go frisk yourself.

485
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,449
I've got a situation here, Samantha.

486
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,710
Get names, Trevor.

487
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,250
How did something like that just happen?

488
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,920
He wanted a rumble and so did I.

489
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,139
That's not a rumble.

490
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,790
That's insanity spelled G-E-E-K!

491
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,409
You're such a secretive little cow.

492
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,069
What the fuck?! Can't I sleep with someone now?

493
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,030
That's not someone, he's a mong.

494
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,739
Right, well, I feel like having sex with him.

495
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,009
I don't have to ask you.

496
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,288
Yes, you do!
What?

497
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:01,530
You have to ask me.

498
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,920
you have to ask katie

499
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,330
Not gay, stupid!

500
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,639
* You're equal, but different You're equal, but different *

501
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,809
* You're equal, but different You're equal, but different *

502
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,959
* You're equal, but different You're equal, but different *

503
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,129
* You're equal, but different You're equal, but different *

504
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,640
* It's obvious, it's obvious... *

505
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,690
Emily...

506
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,710
please don't be horrible to Katie.

507
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,009
She's a bitch, Mum.

508
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,359
She's been hurt. You've got to remember that.

509
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,850
Please, Em.

510
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,000
No-one's hurt you like that.

511
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,490
Ok.

512
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,059
* Cheer up, honey *

513
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,310
* I hope you can *

514
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:37,340
* There is something wrong with me... *

515
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,439
Excuse me! Where are you going?

516
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,660
* My mind is filled with silvery stuff *

517
00:30:53,530 --> 00:31:00,460
* Honey kisses, clouds of fluff... *

518
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,340
"What?"
Please, Emily.

519
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,290
I have to speak to you.

520
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,570
"What for?"
Don't hang up.

521
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,620
Fine, you can meet me for coffee.

522
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,969
* Cheer up, honey *

523
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,100
* I hope you can... *

524
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,710
Emily.

525
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,530
You gonna sit down?

526
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,450
Was that you on the phone?

527
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,680
She shouldn't leave it lying around.

528
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,239
So?

529
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Leave her alone, she's mine.

530
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,010
She can't help what she is, Katie.

531
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,310
Neither can I.

532
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,830
Yeah? Seemed like she could help it when she was fucking JJ.

533
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,509
What?
Apparently he's quite keen, actually.

534
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,810
After she saw to him good and proper.

535
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,409
It's not true.

536
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,840
You hurt her,

537
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,330
and now she doesn't want you.

538
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,609
Why are you so horrible?

539
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,389
Because I love her more than you ever can.

540
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,913
Now if you'll excuse me,

541
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,745
I've got dresses to buy for a ball.

542
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,770
You won't be there, because if you are...

543
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,930
* I remember all the times you lied *

544
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,759
* Don't meddle with the heart *

545
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,109
* Meddle with the mind *

546
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,829
* Meddle with the things that are inside *

547
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,289
* You don't know what you'll find *

548
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,910
* You don't know what she hides *

549
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,589
* So don't go messing with a heart *

550
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,949
* Or messing with a mind... *

551
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,010
JJ, hi.

552
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,360
Hello, Jonah.

553
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,910
Pleased to meet you.

554
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,819
Yo, Fitch family.

555
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,959
What are you stressing about? It's tradition.

556
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,890
Parents just want to know their little girls are in safe hands.

557
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,949
They'll know just where these hands have been.

558
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,399
JJ, they're not gonna know you had sex with Emily.

559
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,360
My mum knew straightaway. It was written all over my face.

560
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,629
Mr Fitch. Freddie, JJ.

561
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,210
Ah! The young men have arrived.

562
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,169
They're getting ready. You know how girls are.

563
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,589
They're not still virgins tomorrow,

564
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,780
I'll hunt you down like dogs.

565
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,360
Come on, they're here.

566
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,130
I don't want to.

567
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,280
I said Katie schum, ok?

568
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,290
I was surprised, that's all.

569
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,900
Did she ring you again?

570
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,949
No.

571
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,399
No. She cos she doesn't want to go with you and I do.

572
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,160
So just put the dress on and let's go out.

573
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,479
Don't touch that.

574
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,510
I know what's in here, Ems.

575
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,120
Please. Give it back.

576
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,540
It's a box of fannies, is it making you happy?

577
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,520
No.

578
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,250
So put it away.

579
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,300
Please can we go to the ball now?

580
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,849
They're taking a long time.

581
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,979
Yeah.

582
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,950
It's a chance to get to know you, isn't that nice?

583
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,929
So, tell me JJ, do you know Emily well?

584
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,620
Um, pretty well.

585
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,070
She hasn't mentioned you.

586
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,049
Well, a bit of a secret, you know.

587
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,919
Really?
JJ's a bit shy.

588
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,699
I can see that. It's written all over your face.

589
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,469
No, it's not.
J...

590
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,179
I didn't... well, I did... pyjamas and she made me do it.

591
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,899
Huh?

592
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,450
Yes, but it was all totally safe, so don't worry.

593
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,580
Right. Right.

594
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,250
Hey. We're ready.

595
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:06,830
* I can feel it comin' in the air tonight *

596
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,200
* Oh, lord... *

597
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,219
Welcome to the Love Ball.

598
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,149
Nice suit.

599
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,880
Have a good time.

600
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,490
Pandora! Step this way.

601
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,299
I must say, Pandora, you are a vision.

602
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,439
Thanks, Doug!

603
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,010
Where is your beau?
Here, silly.

604
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,049
No, your... beau, your boyfriend.

605
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,309
Your escort.

606
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,560
No, I tried escorting, I didn't like it.

607
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,130
So I'm getting myself to a nunnery.

608
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,369
You know, no boys, no way, no how.

609
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,379
They're idiots. I've had it.

610
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,609
Oh, dear.

611
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,979
In that case, would you allow me the honour of a dance?

612
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,259
Let's get this party started, shall we?

613
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,160
Great. Cos I'm a wicked dancer.

614
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,879
You're in the hands of a master.

615
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,609
* That's not my name *

616
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,470
* That's not my name *

617
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,849
* I miss the catch if they throw me the ball *

618
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,849
* I'm the last chick standing up against the wall *

619
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,659
* Keep on falling these heels they keep me boring *

620
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,340
* Getting glammed up and sitting on the fence now *

621
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,349
* So alone all the time at night *

622
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,729
* Lock myself away *

623
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,970
* Listen to me, I'm not... *

624
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,109
Oh, Jesus, what is this stuff?

625
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,680
It's Dad's potato moonshine.

626
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,109
He went on a "distil anything" course.

627
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,760
Use it for weedkiller, mainly.

628
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,420
What's it like?

629
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,180
Urgh! Shit, ugh! Fuck!

630
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,039
Katie, this is too weird.

631
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,849
This just... this feels a bit weird, you know?

632
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,229
I know. We have to do it, though, right?

633
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,900
We're just on a date.

634
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,300
We're just on a date. No... shagging.

635
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,609
No? I'd quite like to, you know? If... she'd let me.

636
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,169
Just as long as I don't have to shag him.

637
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,279
No-one's shagging, we're just gonna...

638
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,800
Chill out. That's it, ok?

639
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,840
Ok.

640
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,270
Give me that.

641
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,520
Hang on, JJ, no, you don't...

642
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,590
drink.

643
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,589
Right. Let's do this.

644
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,540
Go, girls. All right?

645
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,040
Ladies.

646
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,030
Welcome to the Love Ball.

647
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,459
Yes, love is all around, hopefully.

648
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,720
And...

649
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,075
Oh, how sweet.

650
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,929
Out on a foursome.

651
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,000
Look at you, JJ. Suave!

652
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,190
Well, it should be fun.

653
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,939
Emily's great in the sack, isn't she, JJ?

654
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,969
Um... yes...

655
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,670
I mean... wait, I mean...

656
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,930
but...

657
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,140
Oh, bobbins.

658
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,819
Naomi, I wanted to tell you...

659
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,220
Yeah?

660
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,850
But you didn't, did you, hon?

661
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,670
So, if you'll excuse me...

662
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,380
Christ!

663
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,710
Right.

664
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,470
Definitely not shagging tonight, then.

665
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,120
No, JJ.

666
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,410
Come on.

667
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,190
They're girls. They always kiss and make up.

668
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,580
Fuck off!

669
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,439
You're just a mad fucking cow, aren't you, Katie?

670
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,120
You're so fucking right.

671
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,979
That's for fucking her up.

672
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,249
But that wasn't me.

673
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,719
She's my sister! You're just a slut.

674
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,039
Takes one to know one, doesn't it?

675
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,499
Oh, go fuck yourself, Naomi!

676
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,399
Didn't need to blab about JJ!

677
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,459
You just loved doing it, didn't you, Katiekins?

678
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,010
She deserved it.

679
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,760
What did I deserve, Katie?

680
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,920
Emily...

681
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,479
No... it wasn't like that!

682
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,019
Emily! Emily, please don't walk away.

683
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,700
You fucking cow!

684
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,580
Get off!

685
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,830
Get off me!

686
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,039
* And all the promises we made *

687
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,653
* From the cradle to the grave... *

688
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:40,701
Excuse me. Mavis. Do me a favour.

689
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:42,310
What?

690
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,140
Bugger off, would you, there's a good girl.

691
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,639
Harriet, are you all right?

692
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,340
No, Doug. There's a couple of things I need to go over with you.

693
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,800
Oh?

694
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,410
I just want to say...

695
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,760
I just want to say...

696
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:13,419
Girls, girls!

697
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,810
Girls, girls!

698
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,990
Get off!

699
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,070
Katie...

700
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,710
I can't stand this.

701
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,810
I'm a person.

702
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,820
I'm not you.

703
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,920
I know.

704
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,970
You have to understand, Katie.

705
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,800
I love you.

706
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,230
And I'll never really leave you.

707
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,920
But I can't fix this.

708
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,580
I like girls.

709
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,550
No...

710
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,500
I like a girl.

711
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,690
No.

712
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,510
I love her.

713
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,030
Ok?

714
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,090
I love...

715
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,020
her.

716
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,080
Ok?

717
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,070
Ok.

718
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,309
* Tick tock, stop the clock Fiction is my thing *

719
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:41,160
* My attitude is always I and me and mine... *

720
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,980
Pandora.

721
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,460
Please. Can we start again?

722
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,829
I promise. I promise I...

723
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,219
Hello.

724
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,570
I'm Thomas.

725
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,730
So glad to meet you.

726
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,039
* Cross my heart, hope you die *

727
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,200
* It's my own cheating heart that makes me cry... *

728
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,250
