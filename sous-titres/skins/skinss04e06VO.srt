1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
My girlfriend won't look at me.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,790
I fucked the dead girl
and now she's punishing me for it.

3
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:07,562
Cook, you're not coming back here.
I've got my own shit to solve.

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,767
Get out.

5
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:11,504
You've got to not talk about Effy.

6
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,763
She really fucked Freddie over.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,660
Go... away.

8
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:10,641
Signorina! Do my eyes deceive me or
does someone have a new cardigan?

9
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:13,054
Oh, yes, and it washes ever so well!

10
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,238
I bet it does. What's this?

11
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:17,972
Flying saucers...

12
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,858
Fizzy colas and... love hearts?

13
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:23,555
Who's the lucky man?

14
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:25,177
He's called Salvador.

15
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,486
I met him at Pilates.
He's coming over tonight.

16
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:31,677
We're gonna get a takeaway
and watch Silence of The Lambs.

17
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,997
You want to get in there, JJ.

18
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:58,935
My brother was in love with a girl
during the war

19
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,675
and by the time he'd got up
the courage to ask her out,

20
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,619
it was too late.

21
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,522
What happened?

22
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,537
His face got blown off by a bomb.

23
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,061
I've lost count now,
I'll have to start again.

24
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,970
Hello, darling, how was your day?

25
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,026
Hi, mum.

26
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,292
# Fuck you, gonna fuck you
Rub your clit like this

27
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:30,763
# Come straight back to mine
and see my dick

28
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,261
# I wanna be respectful
But, bitch, suck on my prick... #

29
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,479
Electromagnetic radiation is
released in bursts of energy called?

30
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:39,774
Photons.

31
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,408
Black holes theoretically emit
what kind of energy?

32
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,045
Bekenstein-Hawking radiation.

33
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,251
Einstein's Special Theory
of Relativity

34
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:47,606
defines the curved nature of?

35
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,962
The space-time continuum.

36
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,478
Captain's log...

37
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,423
Night-time in space is cold,
long and dark...

38
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:59,268
So is the daytime.

39
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,619
Nevertheless, the mission continues
to make contact with alien life forms

40
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,611
from a far-away galaxy.
I come in peace.

41
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,477
Tomorrow...

42
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,389
If she smiles at me tomorrow...

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,590
Hi, Thomas. Hi, AJ.

44
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,021
Holy macaroni, that's...

45
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:33,905
Oh, man.

46
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,218
You've got to ask her out, cuz.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,905
Yeah. But she's out of your league.

48
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:40,263
I mean, yes, but...

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,330
But you've only slept with one girl,

50
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,413
and this person was a lesbian
who felt sorry for you.

51
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,015
No! I mean, yes, but...

52
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:49,868
But you have no hair on your balls.

53
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:51,584
No... I mean... Yes.

54
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:54,527
I mean... no,
there's lots of hair on my balls.

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,546
I don't think so, cuz. There's none.

56
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,336
What? But... that's...

57
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:01,666
I do have hairy balls!

58
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:05,096
There is lots of hair on my balls.
My balls are hairy!

59
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:08,020
My cock's hairy too!
What do you think of that?

60
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:16,291
Captain's log.
Experiencing turbulence.

61
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:20,380
Abnormal cosmic conditions
are generating unforeseen forces.

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,836
Strange...

63
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,291
Life form was wearing
really nice earrings today.

64
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,256
Tomorrow...

65
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,557
If she smiles tomorrow...

66
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,563
I have you now, Congo Man.

67
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:05,641
I could get you deported, you know!
One phone call!

68
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,806
When you've finished
flirting with each other,

69
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,979
the customer toilets
are in a right state.

70
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:21,364
She smiled at me...

71
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:29,991
This is your chance.
You must seize it.

72
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,424
Go on, seize it.

73
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:36,653
Maybe... What's it worth?

74
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,562
Shut up!

75
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:46,666
# I'm no racist
I like white ladies

76
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,650
# I'm no racist
I like white ladies

77
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,561
# I'm no racist
I like white ladies, yo! #

78
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,202
Poppet not singing?

79
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:55,441
Poppet not singing?
I don't feel like it.

80
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,858
If the atoms in a container
of helium gas

81
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,304
have the same average speed
as the atoms of...

82
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,353
I don't care...

83
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,201
...a container of argon...

84
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:04,336
which is hotter?

85
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,320
I don't care.

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,050
I don't bloody care!

87
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:16,001
Edward?

88
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,662
The house is on fire.

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,196
Captain's log. Alien life form
defined as Lara Lloyd.

90
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:28,590
The most beautiful girl
in this or any known universe.

91
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,607
Jonah Jones, a pathetic wanker
who will die alone

92
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,496
in a flat full of pigeons
that he calls his babies.

93
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:38,495
Mission aborted.

94
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,307
Fuckin' hell, my chest!

95
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:16,582
Hello.

96
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:17,378
Hey.

97
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,434
You don't look well, Lara.

98
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,039
It's just a bit of a...

99
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,189
Atchoo! Sorry.

100
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:37,094
She even makes mucus look good.

101
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,156
C'est vrai.

102
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:41,535
Atchoo! A-A-Atchoo!

103
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,017
This looks bad, doesn't it?

104
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,027
Vitamin C.

105
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,887
Helps your immune system fight off
colds and flu,

106
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,213
and if you're like me,

107
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:04,206
it regulates your bowel movements,
which is...

108
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,039
important.

109
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:07,505
Sweet.

110
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,457
Tasty. Thanks, AJ.

111
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:32,913
Lara. I...

112
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,344
My name's not AJ. It's JJ.

113
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,314
Oh... right.

114
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,895
Silly me.

115
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:50,296
If you don't ask her out
in the next ten seconds, I will.

116
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,351
Ten... nine... eight...

117
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,157
seven... six...

118
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,290
Thomas... wait!

119
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,782
...five... four... three...

120
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,771
Lara, have you got a minute?

121
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,750
Get out of my way.

122
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,742
Lara Lloyd, would you like
to go out with me tonight?

123
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,979
Yes, all right.

124
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:47,013
There has been an unexpected warp

125
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:52,013
in the space-time continuum.
Operation Lara is go.

126
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:55,388
Repeat, go.

127
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,676
Repeat, go!

128
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:12,768
Come!

129
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,495
That's an awful lot of stuff,
Freddie.

130
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,571
Yeah, you know. Revision.

131
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,825
Give me a shout if
you need anything.

132
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,003
Are you gonna fucking
help me here, or what?

133
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,493
Yes, but what's?

134
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:31,784
Freddie?

135
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:35,991
Your bag's on fire.

136
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,846
Just open it.

137
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,360
Way-hey! Cook!

138
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,123
Daddy's home, Jaykins.

139
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:51,023
Now, hands up
who wants to play Anne Frank.

140
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,644
You can't just stay here.

141
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:02,186
I'm sorry, mate. Fred's dad
was getting suspicious, wasn't he?

142
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,028
You'll have to keep me here
for a bit.

143
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,802
Keep you?
What do you mean, "keep you"?

144
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:09,325
Her Majesty's Prison Service
is supposed to be doing that!

145
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,862
I escaped, all right?
What's the problem?

146
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:15,301
I've got a life, Cook!

147
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,367
Oh, I wouldn't want to interrupt your
fucking hectic social whirl, Jaykins.

148
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:21,650
FYI, things have changed, Cook.

149
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,957
I've got... a job!

150
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,514
And a date!

151
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,913
With a girl.

152
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:31,759
But this is hopeless. I'm stressed.
I'm gonna fuck up.

153
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,613
And I don't know what I'm doing.

154
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,717
Well, let me make fucking use
of myself, then, Jaykins.

155
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,341
How? What can you?

156
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,533
Listen, three rules...
One, just be cool.

157
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:42,495
Just "be cool"?

158
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,914
Just "be cool"?
Two, touch her.

159
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,020
Simple creatures, women, right?
Touch her, she knows you want her.

160
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,795
If you don't, she starts to think
she's ugly. Right?

161
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,632
Right. Touch her.

162
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,822
Three, look at her pupils.
If they dilate when you look at her,

163
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:59,132
it means she actually wants to play
with your ding-a-ling. Capische?

164
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,153
Could you pass us that Ladyshave
there, Jaykins? Good lad.

165
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:07,429
OK. You need to hide
in my room, hurry up.

166
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,057
What are you doing?

167
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,582
Locking the door!

168
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:20,964
But I need to clean your room,
you know that.

169
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:24,796
Yes, but what if I have private
things? Things you can't see?

170
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,531
We don't have secrets, Jonah.

171
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:28,798
What things?

172
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:30,413
Porn!

173
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,382
I don't want you to see
my pornography, Mother!

174
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,213
And I know you've been looking.

175
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:03,149
Let's do this.

176
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,815
OK, changed her mind.

177
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:12,890
JJ?

178
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:17,345
You're a little early.

179
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:18,552
Really?

180
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,873
Yes. Two hours early.

181
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:26,306
Watch, daylight saving, you know.

182
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,196
Uh! Idiot...

183
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:30,256
Is it cool to arrive early?

184
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:31,552
No.

185
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,630
No... No, of course not.

186
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,409
You look amazing.

187
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,615
Thanks.

188
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,844
What are you doing?

189
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,072
Just... touching you.

190
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:45,681
Soft.

191
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:47,589
OK, shall we cut to the chase?

192
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,172
Possibly.

193
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,820
Your eyes... Can I just check?

194
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,088
Why don't you come inside? I just
wanted to show you something.

195
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,215
Inside, you know?

196
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,518
Over here.

197
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,730
JJ, I'd like you to meet someone.

198
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,381
This is Albert... my baby.

199
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:32,195
Your... baby. As in?

200
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:35,272
As in, yes, I had sex, and shazam!

201
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,943
Baby.

202
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:37,989
Baby.

203
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,573
Baby.
Baby, that's right.

204
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:46,000
Um, maybe you could watch him
for five minutes, just while I get ready?

205
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,620
No problemo.

206
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,565
No problemo.
Cool.

207
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:05,739
Hey?

208
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,271
So...

209
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:11,452
there's nothing in my left hand.

210
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,846
There's nothing in my right hand.

211
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:28,605
Oh, you like that, do you?

212
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,875
What's going on?

213
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,270
Tell you what, Albert,
let's see what else we can find.

214
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,354
What's this behind your ear?

215
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:44,056
A pound!

216
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,932
Five pounds! Ten pounds!

217
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:47,828
What are you, made of money?!

218
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:54,111
I don't mean to be rude, Albert,
but you kind of stink.

219
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,801
Do I?

220
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:04,911
Oh, Jiminy Cricket,
that is disgusting!

221
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,819
Oh, no. No! No!

222
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:10,343
I forbid you to do that! Oh!

223
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,019
Help! Help! Lara!

224
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,281
It's all gone tits up in here.

225
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,347
Argh!
Who the fuck are you?

226
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,171
I'm Jonah Jeremiah Jones,
and he wee'd in my mouth!

227
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,893
Who said you could touch
my fucking baby?

228
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,084
Nobody, nobody,
but there's a lot of poo.

229
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:25,574
I'm telling you. A lot!

230
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,909
JJ, this is Liam, Albert's dad.

231
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,544
He baby-sits for me sometimes...
if he's good.

232
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,953
Right, Liam?

233
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,090
Yeah, right.

234
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,549
Yeah, right.
I'm ready for our date, JJ.

235
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,336
Change the baby, Liam.
Would you mind?

236
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:43,571
Coming?

237
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:47,316
I see you touch my kid again,

238
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,045
I'm gonna rip your lungs out.

239
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,935
Touch her...

240
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:55,232
and I'll set them on fire
and shove them up your arse.

241
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:03,512
Atta boy. Coochie-coo!

242
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:11,442
So, this is nice.

243
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:14,618
Yes. Yes. It's so lovely.

244
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,125
And you're...

245
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:20,565
I see you like peanuts, even though the
average bar snack does test positive

246
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,840
for the urine of
up to 16 different people.

247
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:27,429
Let's get this party started,
shall we? Garcon!

248
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:34,358
I'd like a Capribena, straight up,
on the rocks, with a twist

249
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,288
What the fuck's a Capribena?

250
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:39,202
It's a Capri Sun and Ribena cocktail.
That's how I roll.

251
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:42,324
We haven't got any Ribena...
or Capri Sun.

252
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,790
OK.

253
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,559
Water, tap, hold the ice.

254
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,517
Lady? I mean Lara?

255
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,124
Vodka and Coke.

256
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:54,514
You heard the Lara. Vodka and cock.
I mean Coke.

257
00:17:57,096 --> 00:18:00,727
Personally, I find vodka
weakens the neck of my bladder,

258
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,103
but each to his... Emily?

259
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,656
Hi, JJ. Who's this?

260
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,791
Hi, Emily. This is...

261
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:13,875
well, what are you?

262
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,918
I'm your friend, JJ.

263
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,739
Yes, this is my friend, Lara.

264
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:22,099
Right.

265
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:25,445
Um... this is my friend, Mandy.

266
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,902
We were just leaving.

267
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:28,220
We were just leaving.
We just got here.

268
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:35,292
See you, JJ. Nice meeting you, Lara.

269
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,221
She's lovely, isn't she?

270
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:42,993
Funny...

271
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,274
Funny...
What?

272
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:46,259
Oh, nothing.

273
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,068
Now, where were we?

274
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,104
JJ.

275
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,257
Yes?

276
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:54,514
You're touching me.

277
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:56,232
That's right.

278
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:01,533
Tell you what. Let's keep our hands
where we can see them for now, yeah?

279
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,596
You cool with that?

280
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:04,126
You cool with that?
Oh, yes. I am.

281
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,529
Um... So you and Liam
are definitely not...

282
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,621
Would I be sitting here
with you if I were?

283
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:13,021
Of course not. Obviously.

284
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:18,098
Are your pupils usually so dilated?

285
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,635
Only when I'm pissed off.

286
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,052
Only when I'm pissed off.
Right, OK. Yup.

287
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,940
Er... cheers.

288
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,545
Wrong drink!
That's gone straight through me!

289
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,628
She's got a baby.

290
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,224
'Shit the bed! '

291
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:39,007
Are her baps all shonky, then?

292
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:41,627
'I don't know and I probably never
will! Oh, and by the way,'

293
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,419
her ex-boyfriend
wants to shove my lungs up my arse.

294
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,238
On fire. What the hell do I do?

295
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:49,722
Get out of there, J.
Abort mission, mate.

296
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,102
Abort mission.

297
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:53,251
Yes. Abort.

298
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,422
Yes.

299
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:04,218
Do you need a hand?

300
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:06,174
No, I'm fine. I just...

301
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:10,961
Oi! What are you doing in here?

302
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,804
This is the ladies'.

303
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:18,822
Yeah. Yes, obviously.

304
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:21,175
I just came in to...

305
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:22,756
buy tampons.

306
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,234
For you.

307
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:26,758
As a gift.

308
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,779
Forget it. This was a mistake.

309
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:33,821
Forget it. This was a mistake.
No.

310
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,995
No... I'm the mistake!

311
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,749
I'm the mistake, it's me!

312
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,205
I'm a mistake.

313
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,625
I really like you.

314
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,378
Funny way of showing it.

315
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:19,935
Yeah.

316
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,707
This isn't going to work, is it?

317
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:28,059
I mean, you're a ten
and I'm a three.

318
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,103
I'm a bit funnyy.

319
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,403
There it is.

320
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:36,451
You should be with somebody
less reliant on their mother.

321
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:38,593
Somebody with pecs

322
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:40,621
and guns...

323
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,031
Someone like Liam.

324
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,069
Liam doesn't flirt with old ladies.

325
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,858
O... K.

326
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:55,776
You flirt with old ladies.

327
00:21:55,816 --> 00:22:00,418
At work, you call them signorina and
tell them their lipstick looks nice.

328
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:03,742
And you're nice. Just...

329
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:06,209
will you stop trying so hard?

330
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:08,712
Yeah?

331
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,057
You're nice.

332
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:40,810
Where the fucking hell
have you been?!

333
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,271
Sorry?
Time flies when you're having fun.

334
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:46,808
You've been gone for two days.
I've been drinking piss!

335
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,283
Whose piss?

336
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:51,292
Whose piss?
Mine!

337
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:54,978
Fucking hell! Does no-one turn down
the central heating in here? Jesus!

338
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,379
Savoury pork pie?

339
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,344
You need to make this up to me.

340
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,079
I'm serious.

341
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,129
I want Chinese food - a lot of it.

342
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:10,024
I texted Freddie, he's coming over.
You and him sneak me out...

343
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:12,354
Can't. Me and Lara have got plans.

344
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:13,994
"Me and fucking Lara"!

345
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:16,818
Where's the love, J? Hm?
Where's the love!?

346
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,605
Can't you just be happy for me?

347
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:21,529
I am happy for ya,
but it ain't gonna last, is it?

348
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:22,785
Why not?

349
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:25,113
Cos women are a mystery
to us with even normal brains.

350
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,454
Your special noggin
does not stand a chance.

351
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:30,729
Fuck! And I need you to sneak me
into your shitter, J.

352
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,269
Cos I'm tellin' you, man, I've been
waiting three days to drop my load.

353
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,644
That's how much I care.

354
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,578
OK?

355
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,695
I haven't said anything.

356
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:52,456
No.

357
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:55,295
So... why are you writing?

358
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,980
Oh, it's... it's what we do.

359
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,427
You're worrying.

360
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,199
Yes.

361
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,894
Just don't do that.

362
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,859
Actually, I'm worrying, Dr. Felly.

363
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:08,884
Really?

364
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,504
I just don't know what to do.

365
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:15,295
He's eating more and he's secretive
and he's looking at pornography.

366
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,735
Oh, you mustn't do that, JJ.

367
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:20,376
I mean, maybe if he had
a real girlfriend, then...

368
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,550
Yes, well...

369
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,197
sustained relationships
are something that's very difficult

370
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:26,922
for someone with JJ's condition.

371
00:25:26,962 --> 00:25:28,246
There's no need to worry.

372
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:29,732
I do have a real girlfriend.

373
00:25:29,772 --> 00:25:31,257
But I do worry. I can't help it.

374
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,069
You mustn't...

375
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,788
I do have a real girlfriend.
I have sex with her every day!

376
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:38,325
Oh, JJ!

377
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:41,143
Secrets.

378
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,606
You know, JJ,
I'm not sure you should do that.

379
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:45,515
Have you told her
about your condition?

380
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:47,057
No, of course I haven't!

381
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:48,165
And why is that?

382
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,734
Because I don't want her to think
I'm a psycho!

383
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:51,955
You're not a psycho.

384
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:53,174
No! No.

385
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:55,033
Now,

386
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:58,060
these are lovely little pills.

387
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,121
Calm you down.

388
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:01,657
Stop the urges, that kind of thing.

389
00:26:01,697 --> 00:26:02,806
Stop the urges, that kind of thing.
Shove it up your cock!

390
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:10,822
It's a strain, I know,
coping with everything by yourself.

391
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,280
It's all right.

392
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,805
I'm all right.
I just wasn't... ready for...

393
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,182
Don't worry!

394
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,952
If I might say, that's a very nice
frock you have on today, Celia.

395
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,404
You do look charming.

396
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:30,744
You really shouldn't do that, Eric.

397
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,551
Oh, I know...

398
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,254
I mustn't.

399
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,001
You.

400
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,158
Hello again.

401
00:27:00,198 --> 00:27:01,443
I'm not a psycho!

402
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:05,347
It's not really looking too good,
is it, mental box?

403
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:07,341
Liam, please, please, don't...

404
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:10,759
Don't tell the mother of my child
she's going out with a fruit loop?

405
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,592
Yes. Please don't tell her that.

406
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:14,580
OK. Really?

407
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,689
Nah. Not really.

408
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:17,943
I can't wait to tell her
all about you.

409
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:20,436
You ain't going to win this one,
you know, mate.

410
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:23,739
Lara and me - we've got a baby.

411
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:26,034
And all you've got is...

412
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:27,968
a ticket for the special bus.

413
00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:41,044
I want to meet her. I mean...

414
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:42,818
Have your friends met her?

415
00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:54,476
You sure you're ready for this?

416
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:56,389
I'm sure they're lovely.

417
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,945
I'm just wondering...
have you spoken to Liam recently?

418
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:02,087
No. Liam's being a tit.

419
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,388
Why?

420
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,242
Oh, no reason.

421
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:16,893
Welcome to the house of fun.

422
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:23,765
So, I wanted you to meet Naomes and
Emily, cos they're really... fun.

423
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:27,551
Right.

424
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:28,993
So, Laauraa...

425
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,072
Lara.

426
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:32,454
Yeah. Isn't that what I just said?

427
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:35,527
Um... how old is it?

428
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:36,971
He's nine months.

429
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:43,465
Um... would you mind not,
you know, smoking a spliff?

430
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:44,715
Oh, shit, sorry.

431
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:46,005
I'm such a tit.

432
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:47,336
Tell me about it.

433
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,610
Anyway... after we ran into Emily
the other night,

434
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,325
I thought, "Why not just...
come down?"

435
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:59,185
Have you... have you already met?

436
00:28:59,225 --> 00:29:01,017
Um... yeah. It was a coincidence.

437
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:02,542
Yeah, you were with that nice...

438
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:06,179
JJ, will you go over
my politics coursework?

439
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,745
I don't do politics.

440
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:09,576
Yeah. Just come and look, OK?

441
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:25,299
What's going on?

442
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,701
Nothing.

443
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,064
Nothing!

444
00:29:31,852 --> 00:29:33,613
Nothing, OK?

445
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:35,615
Are you?

446
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,345
If you're cheating...

447
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,675
I mean...

448
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:44,272
I just... like Mandy.

449
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,282
Nothing's happened.

450
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:48,159
Because that would be bad, Ems.

451
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:53,057
You think I want to get
into another relationship?

452
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:00,399
Relationships suck.

453
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,476
They really fucking suck.

454
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:03,545
Mine doesn't.

455
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,860
Look at her -

456
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,422
she's using you.

457
00:30:09,462 --> 00:30:12,301
What? Wh... How?

458
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:13,998
She's...

459
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,289
I dunno. Maybe it's the kid.

460
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:21,055
Maybe she's trying to get back at
someone. Otherwise, why would she?

461
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:22,941
Why would she be
with a mental basket like me?

462
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:24,464
I'm trying to protect you.

463
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:27,999
Get out before she kicks the shit
out of you, because she will.

464
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,547
Lara's not Naomi!

465
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:31,341
And... I'm not you.

466
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,988
I have...

467
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,467
trust

468
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:37,380
I have...

469
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,534
75% trust

470
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:42,550
You're running on empty.

471
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,337
And it takes a mental basket
to tell you that.

472
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:49,016
Just remember who you can rely on.

473
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,454
OK?

474
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:08,888
Your friends are weird.

475
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:11,550
You just have to get used to them.

476
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,970
OK.

477
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:17,453
Right. When we get in there,
let me do all the explaining. OK?

478
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:21,186
JJ, I'm just your girlfriend.
We're OK, right?

479
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,845
Yeah.

480
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,631
Look... no.

481
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:29,344
No-one's "just" anything to me.

482
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:31,671
I'm a bit all or nothing.

483
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:33,504
In fact, I'm a little bit...

484
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:39,052
Hello. You must be Lara.
I've been so looking forward to...

485
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:41,916
We've been looking...

486
00:31:41,956 --> 00:31:43,453
We...

487
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:45,664
We've been...

488
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:57,633
Edward, um...
this is Lara, JJ's girlfriend,

489
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:59,056
and, um...

490
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:00,227
Albert.

491
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:04,219
Albert. Baby Albert.

492
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,220
I beg your pardon?

493
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,189
So, Lara, does little Albert
have a father?

494
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,325
Yes, he does, Celia.
They usually do.

495
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:27,177
Silly! Of course he does - listen to me!
"No, Celia! He's a medical marvel!"

496
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:32,753
Edward, have you
got anything to say?

497
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:37,755
I... I don't think so. No.

498
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:39,616
Right! Well, then...

499
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:41,749
Sorry! No more questions.

500
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:43,398
Let's have a cup of tea

501
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:44,587
and a nice slut...

502
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,342
Chat!

503
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,702
A nice cha... at.

504
00:32:48,742 --> 00:32:50,434
Oh, my God!

505
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:54,261
OK. I think I'm going to go change
him, leave you to it.

506
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,431
Where's the?

507
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,160
Top of the stairs...

508
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:04,405
I thought you wanted me to be normal
and have a girlfriend!

509
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:05,911
I do! I...

510
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,699
I... did. I thought I did.

511
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:09,892
Dad?

512
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:12,557
I know nothing.

513
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:14,689
JJ, the toilet's locked.

514
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,744
Shitification!

515
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:19,271
But we're all... down here.

516
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,599
Lara!

517
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:21,911
Wait... no...

518
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:22,970
Why is it locked?

519
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,151
Security! Very important!

520
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:25,708
JJ, what's going on? Nothing.

521
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,091
Why is the door locked?

522
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,347
Have you got the key?

523
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:31,570
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

524
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,576
It's fine. It's a little while since
I was called a slut, but...

525
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,625
The baby was a bit of a surprise.

526
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,580
Can we all just go downstairs?

527
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,252
Actually, I need to pee too.

528
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:41,467
No, no, no. You can't.

529
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:42,530
JJ, open the door.

530
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:45,184
See, he's not ready for...

531
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:48,882
I'm sure he can decide for himself,
can't he? It's not exactly your business.

532
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,953
Go downstairs.
You could pee in the yard.

533
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,309
Don't be ridiculous!
Go and get a screwdriver.

534
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,890
Actually, I think it is.

535
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,822
Maybe JJ hasn't told you about
himself.

536
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:01,371
All right, that's it.
I've had enough.

537
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:05,591
Lara...

538
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:09,971
No. Just leave me alone.
You're all fucking mental!

539
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,579
Open the door, Cook.

540
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:21,060
Hello, Celia.

541
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:24,143
James.

542
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:26,185
Aren't you supposed to be in jail?

543
00:34:26,225 --> 00:34:27,268
Yes.

544
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:31,554
Well, can I suggest that you bugger off
before I even remember I've seen you?

545
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:33,977
Can I finish my left side?

546
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:57,676
I really need you
to try harder, Edward. OK?

547
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,415
OK.

548
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,583
You're a man, aren't you,
Screaming J?

549
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:16,237
You're a man of flesh and blood

550
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:18,206
and fight

551
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,505
and spunk and hair and fists.

552
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:24,949
J, you find this Liam twat and you
have it out with him, man to man.

553
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,955
Like you and Freddie did with Effy?

554
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:28,902
No. That's...

555
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:31,700
Lot of good it did. She went crazy.

556
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,329
Where are you going?

557
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:42,914
Naomi's, I guess.

558
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:45,533
You're sort of
running out of places.

559
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:55,581
Thanks, man.

560
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:03,710
And... thanks for the shagging tips -
they really, really work.

561
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,135
Spunk, yeah?!

562
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:11,547
Spunk!

563
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,212
It's all we've got.

564
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,738
I can't talk to you right now, JJ.

565
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:26,315
Well, I want to talk to you!

566
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:27,894
Mate, didn't you hear her?

567
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,451
She doesn't want to.

568
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm not your mate.

569
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,729
Look, just...

570
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,456
Listen, I warned you, psycho.

571
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,333
I told you to stay away
from my family.

572
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:38,266
OK, cool your boots!
Everybody keep calm, please.

573
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,615
She's not yours, she's mine!

574
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,271
Not any more she ain't, mate.

575
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,295
JJ. You'll lose your job.
We all will.

576
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,195
OK. I'm calm. I'm calm, OK?

577
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:51,640
I am a psycho!
I'm a fucking psycho!

578
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,704
JJ, stop!

579
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:53,734
She loves me!

580
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:54,991
You'll lose your job! JJ!

581
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:56,401
You're fucking nothing, OK?!

582
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:06,584
I don't think we should see
each other any more, JJ.

583
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,640
Come on.

584
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,340
Fucking psycho!

585
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,318
I'm a fucking...

586
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,029
We had a lot of arguments,
your mum and me,

587
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:12,078
way back when she started
taking you to these doctors.

588
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:15,202
I just let her get on with it,
you know.

589
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:19,127
She had this... love in her, this...

590
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:23,763
...care, that was...

591
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,583
so strong, and...

592
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:32,339
I knew in many ways
it might be too strong...

593
00:38:34,865 --> 00:38:38,250
...you know, if we both...
felt like that.

594
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,896
It can be a burden to a kid...

595
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:41,617
She didn't do anything wrong.

596
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:43,892
No, no, she didn't, she...

597
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:51,246
I suppose I just...
couldn't see the point.

598
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:57,472
All these... bits of paper with this
and that... stupid diagnosis, and...

599
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:59,428
nobody knows anything anyway.

600
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:06,523
I used to pick you up
from playschool, and...

601
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:12,337
...all the other boys would be
running round, shouting, fighting,

602
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,816
normal.

603
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:18,398
You'd be sitting making telescopes
out of toilet rolls.

604
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:23,521
And...

605
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,029
...well... I just...

606
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:36,697
Er... I just... wanted you to know
how I felt about that, and...

607
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:40,600
How do you feel about it, Dad?

608
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:46,811
Well...

609
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,425
I felt you'd always be all right.

610
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:55,060
I thought you could
come through anything.

611
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,230
I think you can
come through anything, J.

612
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:42,052
Thank you for the flowers.

613
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:44,544
Right.

614
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,574
You look nice in that dress.

615
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,267
Thank you.

616
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:58,228
People do say that.

617
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:02,851
Good.

618
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:36,635
Captain's log.

619
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:39,092
Let's refuel this goddamn ship.

620
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:50,665
Boy, you really fucked it.

621
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:51,721
Big time.

622
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:53,506
Yeah.

623
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:55,352
You can hit me.

624
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:57,834
If it makes you feel better,
then... hit me.

625
00:41:57,844 --> 00:41:59,125
What?

626
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:01,697
Sooner or later, you're going
to punch my lights out.

627
00:42:01,737 --> 00:42:04,973
So... I figure... better get it
over and done with.

628
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,636
I love her.

629
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,235
I can't fucking help it.
I love her, all right?

630
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,544
Yeah.

631
00:42:15,584 --> 00:42:17,730
Me too. It's a problem.

632
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,944
Well, it's not too much of a problem,
is it, mate? She thinks you're a cunt.

633
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:24,392
I am a cunt.

634
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:27,874
Because...
I didn't trust her to like me.

635
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:29,987
You said it, mate.

636
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,739
And she's clever, like...

637
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:35,105
She's too clever for you or me.

638
00:42:36,294 --> 00:42:38,376
I am... sorry.

639
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,776
We've got a kid together.

640
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:47,977
And that ain't going to go away.
And I will not give him up for nobody.

641
00:42:48,017 --> 00:42:51,633
I never thought... What...
what are you trying to say, Liam?

642
00:42:51,673 --> 00:42:53,436
She doesn't love me back.

643
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:56,496
It's... it's not her fault.

644
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:00,176
But I love my kid,

645
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:01,575
and she's given it respect.

646
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,703
So whatever you do...

647
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:10,227
...it better be fucking good.

648
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:52,377
What the fuck?

649
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:55,010
Piss off, will you?
You'll wake the fucking...

650
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,554
JJ?

651
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:59,745
What are you doing? I told you,
I don't want to talk to you right now.

652
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,717
# So true

653
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:11,449
# Funny how it seems

654
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:12,874
# Always in time

655
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:15,931
# But never in line for dreams

656
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:20,684
# Head over heels when toe to toe

657
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,719
# This is the sound of my soul

658
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:27,933
# This is the sound

659
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:30,891
# I bought a ticket to the world

660
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:34,493
# But now I've come back again

661
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:39,924
# Why do I find
it hard to write the next line

662
00:44:39,964 --> 00:44:44,099
# When I want the truth to be said?

663
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:49,764
# Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

664
00:44:49,804 --> 00:44:54,393
# I know this much is true

665
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:57,655
# Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

666
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,708
# I know this much is

667
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:03,448
# True! #

668
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:09,496
Take it away.

669
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:22,745
# This much is true-oo

670
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:26,154
# This much is true-oo-oo

671
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:28,801
# I know, I know
I know this much is true

672
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:32,402
# This much is true-oo
This much is true-oo-oo

673
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:35,557
# I know this much is

674
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:39,653
# True... #

675
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,742
We should have done it in B flat.

676
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,967
Oi! Maestro!
