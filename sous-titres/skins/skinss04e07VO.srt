1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,469
There has been an unexpected
warp in the space-time continuum.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,619
Operation Lara is go.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,100
Emily this is my friend Lara.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,769
This is my friend Mandy.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,769
Have you already met.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,159
Yeah it was coincidence.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,249
What's going on?

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,519
Nothing.

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,219
James aren't you supposed to be in jail?

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,909
Yes.

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,630
You can't just stay here.

12
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,249
Effy what the fuck is going on?

13
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,280
You didn't reply.

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,819
Freddie, Effy won't
come out of the toilet.

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,490
You left her alone?

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,700
She's going to need us
to help rebuild her again.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,490
What you thinking about?

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,090
My brother.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,180
What about him?

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
Nothing.

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,500
Something happened to him, didn't it?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
Lots of things happened to him.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,720
He was born almost a month late.

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,375
Won a poetry competition
when he was eight.

25
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,957
And met Sarah Ferguson.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,030
Got the highest mark for first
year essay in Cardiff history.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,730
And somewhere in there.

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,359
He was hit by a bus.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,680
And nearly killed.

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,300
Right?

31
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,870
Why didn't you tell me about that?

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,800
Why that?

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,909
Why not the good stuff?

34
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,770
Because I'm not interested in it.

35
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,800
Tell me what happened to
your brother, Elizabeth?

36
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,860
From the start.

37
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:24,518
* set the sails I feel
the winds are stirring *

38
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:34,915
* toward the bright horizon set the way *

39
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:42,439
Ok, on three, one, two,

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,720
yambai! Stop it!

41
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,820
Come here fucker!

42
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,680
* and who could heed the
words of Charlie Darwin *

43
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:18,525
* fighting for a system built to fail *

44
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,460
Ohh! You said you were cold.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,830
I don't recognise it.

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,670
It's Freddie's.

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,771
Oh do you want me to get you another one?

48
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,120
No it's fine. I'll keep it.

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,380
You are doing so well sweetheart.

50
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,510
There's a bus coming Tony doesn't see it.

51
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,550
He's distracted.

52
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,570
It hits him, runs him over.

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,250
He's in the gutter and he's bleeding.

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,680
He looks dead.

55
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,260
Open your eyes.

56
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,430
Well done, Elizabeth.

57
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,000
It's taken you three weeks
to tell me that story.

58
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,450
- How do you feel?
- Awful.

59
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,650
I'd like us try something new.

60
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,560
I want you to close your eyes again.

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,870
And imagine that bus never hit Tony.

62
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,540
Can you do that for me?

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,420
- But it did hit him.
- It's just an exercise.

64
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,810
Try to imagine it never happened.

65
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,960
Ok.

66
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,770
Make a picture in your head.

67
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,740
What do you see?

68
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,860
Tony standing by the road.

69
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,660
He's laughing.

70
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,150
Good.

71
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,600
Afternoon.

72
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,669
How's the real world?

73
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,840
Fine.

74
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,660
Well I don't know actually.

75
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,950
Me and Emily.

76
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,129
We're all... since... the ...

77
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,580
You know, and I don't
know what we're doing.

78
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,680
If we're ok or if we're about to break up.

79
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
Sometimes I think she can read my mind.

80
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,080
I seriously do.

81
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,619
I mean is that normal?

82
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,170
Is that what you...?

83
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,840
Eff?

84
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,469
You think you're going
mad so you came to see me,

85
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,709
to see what a mad person looks like?

86
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,950
No!

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,220
No.

88
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,670
No.

89
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,019
Yes.

90
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,389
Listen to me very carefully Naomi.

91
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,970
You need to get a message to
the dog lord of Azerbaijan.

92
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,300
He's got my toilet ticket.

93
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,910
Oh God what are they giving you?!

94
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,080
And can I have some?

95
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,260
This whole thing with this girl, Sophia.

96
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,590
Why don't you just
imagine it never happened?

97
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,360
But it did.

98
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,170
Yeah, but if you tried to
think like you didn't...

99
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,490
But...

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,060
Am I missing something?

101
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,879
You can't change what's already happened.

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,180
I wish you could.

103
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,960
But... you just can't.

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Please go on Elizabeth.

105
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,330
The boy is crying.

106
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,710
And his mother.

107
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,940
And his little sister.

108
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,250
He doesn't want him to go.

109
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,890
What happens next?

110
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,760
And then et says,

111
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,710
"I'll be right here".

112
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,690
And then he gets in the
spaceship and flies away.

113
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,630
Yeah yeah that's right,
make fun of the old man!

114
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,140
I think you're ready
to go home, Elizabeth.

115
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,090
What?

116
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,009
I'm not ready we're not finished yet.

117
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,749
Oh we're far from finished.
You'll be seeing me twice a week.

118
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,070
So I just go home, back to normal?

119
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,279
Stick to your routine,
and no drink or drugs.

120
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,100
But yes, pretty much back to normal.

121
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,770
You can go.

122
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,980
Thank you.

123
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,000
We'll see each other soon.

Why didn't you let me see you, Eff?

John?

He's the one that helped me.

166

And what did he do that was so special?

167
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,890
He took all my bad memories.

168

And made them good.

169
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,960
And some of those memories
were about me, right?

Only a few.

I'm sorry.

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,240
Nothing else.

186
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,710
(* Giselle: They stay down deep)

187
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,079
* what's that you hide behind your back? *

188
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,749
* nothing but a shadow trap *

189
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,149
* what's that you pressed
against your lips *

190
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,819
* set sail with words on conjured ships *

191
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,099
* and in those ocean eyes of yours *

192
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,559
* sea monsters swimming put in drawers *

193
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,750
* I'm scared they'll climb
out when you leave... *

194
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,000
we're ok, we're ok we're ok.

195
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,780
* they stay down deep *

196
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,239
* oh what's that you
hide behind your back? *

197
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,450
* nothing but a shadow trap... *

198
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,539
Hello?

199
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,763
Oh my God, it's you! I
can't believe it's you!

200
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,329
I don't even know why I'm bothering.

201
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,239
I know I'm failed. Useless as usual.

202
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,869
At least you took yours, I was too mental.

203
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,359
So you're mental and I'm useless.

204
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,790
It's shame we'd have fit
right in at Cambridge.

205
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,200
Let's find out what I got.

206
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,720
(* Francois and the atlas
mountains: So many nos)

207
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,980
* I never took the time *

208
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,370
* to catch you on my side... *

209
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,729
Hey good luck!

210
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,420
Well done girls.

211
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,319
Ah, Ms. Moon, Ms. Stonem.

212
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,980
Good to see you up and about.

213
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,529
I suppose this is the last
time we'll see each other.

214
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,859
Oh, I'll come back to see you Doug.

215
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,610
Yes well, massive attack
said the same thing.

216
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,102
Though daddy G writes at Christmas

217
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,539
and on my birthday.

218
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Though he's missed the last two.

219
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,960
Anyhow, here you go, Ms. Moon.

220
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,450
A c? Ok.

221
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,799
Listen Eff, I need to
tell you something...

222
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,209
Doug, I want to retake. What do I...?

223
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,289
Yes, er, about that...

224
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,070
Would you come with me?

225
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,100
What is it?

226
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,770
Mr blood wants to see you.

227
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,619
It's been a good year here
at Roundview, Elizabeth.

228
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,259
Every single student
received A to C grades.

229
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,209
Really?

230
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,100
Well, we had a lot of
people doing media studies.

231
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,120
Nevertheless, our targets were met.

232
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,709
Except by you.

233
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,879
You failed everything.

234
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,330
Yeah I know.

235
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,710
I didn't even sit the exam.

236
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,869
Which brings down the college average

237
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,749
and affects the funding scenario.

238
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,289
Do you see my dilemma?

239
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,960
I can retake, right?

240
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,980
It wouldn't make a difference.

241
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,220
Let me level with you Elizabeth.

242
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,840
Here are your old results.

243
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,900
And here...

244
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,900
Are your new results.

245
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,090
Please act as such.

246
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,839
Three As?

247
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,369
An excellent result,
considering your circumstances.

248
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,430
You want me to tell people I got three as?

249
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,389
In my experience, Ms. Stonem,
we are all living lies.

250
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,370
Reality, as the sophists so elegantly
informed us, is all relative.

251
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,150
Now go on, go out with you.

252
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,100
It feels wrong. It's like cheating.

253
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,080
It's like cheating at life.

254
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,169
And now I'm starting to
wonder about everything.

255
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,250
Elizabeth, what's really going on?

256
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,520
What do you mean? That,
what I just told you.

257
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,070
We talked at length...

258
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,119
At length... about this, Elizabeth.

259
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,020
Achievement, success, academic or
otherwise, earned or not, is nothing

260
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,689
- compare to being well and being happy.
- Yeah but...

261
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,290
Happiness.

262
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,270
Correct?

263
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,520
Yes.

264
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,070
You're right.

265
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,750
You're right.

266
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,260
These don't matter.

267
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,710
There are bigger things happening here.

268
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,680
Bigger than school.

269
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,520
Bigger than friends.

270
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,780
Even bigger than love.

271
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,500
Ok?

272
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,040
Ok

273
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,660
right now that Effy's here and
we're all suitably refreshed.

274
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,419
Speech!

275
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,229
The exam result party
planning committee have decreed

276
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:05,150
that all our results be read out
in quick succession. So, ready...

277
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,730
A, A, B!

278
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,690
A, A, A!

279
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,110
B, B, C!

280
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,930
C in philosophy!

281
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,760
B, C, C!

282
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,160
A, C, C!

283
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,030
I got expelled!

284
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,910
Eff?

285
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,890
It doesn't matter what I got.

286
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,760
None of this matters.

287
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,180
It's just numbers on a page.

288
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,230
It's not real.

289
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,230
Not to me anyway.

290
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,500
You're all great. You're all great people.

291
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,710
But I think...

292
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,930
I think I'm finished.

293
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,410
I think I've had enough.

294
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,020
What are you talking about Eff?

295
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,630
You have to make sacrifices, Fred,

296
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,769
to get the stuff you want.

297
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,649
I don't understand.

298
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm in a different place now.

299
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,070
We all are.

300
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,970
And I'm sorry.

301
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm really sorry.

302
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,980
What are you saying?

303
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,769
I'm saying goodbye, I have to.

304
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,390
To everyone? To me?

305
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
Yeah.

306
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,170
To everyone.

307
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,150
To you.

308
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,990
Where the fuck are you going?

309
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,180
Home.

310
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,510
She dumped you again?!

311
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,530
Hey, princess.

312
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,380
Aren't you supposed to
be in prison or something?

313
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,740
Aren't supposed to be in the loony bin?

314
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,550
I did my time, you should have done yours.

315
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,590
I did enough.

316
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,100
Surely Effy Stonem's
not abandoning a party?

317
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,620
I don't belong in there.

318
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,520
Neither do I, we've got a
lot in common, me and you.

319
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,650
Not any more.

320
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,900
We're both stood in the rain.

321
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,060
We're both miserable.

322
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,979
You're no good for me, Cook.

323
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,190
You never were.

324
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,590
If this was us meeting for the first time.

325
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,890
I'll do it all again. Everything.

326
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,419
The fucks, the fuck-ups, everything.

327
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,949
I'll do it all again.

328
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,370
What's that supposed to mean?

329
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,480
It means I still love you.

330
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,230
Piss off.

331
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,630
When I touch your little finger...

332
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,040
You will be completely relaxed

333
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,390
now, describe the room to me.

334
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,730
It's dark.

335
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,260
I can't see.

336
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,290
The curtain's are closed.

337
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,360
There's a man...

338
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,390
Sitting on a chair.

339
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,450
He's facing away from me.

340
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,890
He's so full of hate.

341
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,060
So full of death.

342
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,250
What if he leaves? What if he's not there?

343
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,760
What is he was never there?

344
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:53,730
Open the curtains and
let the sun shine in.

345
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,340
It's warm.

346
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,550
Pato the funny giraffe is here.

347
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,470
This is a place without fear or danger

348
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,650
this is a safe place.

349
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,140
Peaceful.

350
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,710
Away from everyone...

351
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,130
And everything,

352
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,290
it's here.

353
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,580
And you...

354
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,390
Are wonderful.

355
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,810
- What are you doing here?
- I want an explanation.

356
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,280
- Freddie...
- Do you know what you've done to me?

357
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,589
- Dumping me with no reason at all?
- I had reasons.

358
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,443
Well, if the urge to tell
me any of them occurs,

359
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,138
please let me know.

360
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,810
Or did John steal your
soul as well as your past?

361
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,400
- Tea and biscuits?
- Mum...

362
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,340
All right...

363
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,190
The night before you dumped me,
you told me that you loved me.

364
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,310
I know.

365
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,520
So look me in the eye and
tell me you don't love me now.

366
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,650
Don't do that!

367
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,070
I went crazy when I was with you.

368
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,280
I can't let that happen again.

369
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,339
Love's not supposed to do
that, you made me go mad!

370
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,600
You're making me mad now, Effy.

371
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,540
And that's exactly what
love's supposed to do.

372
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,210
Effy?

373
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,310
Yes?

374
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,940
Are you all right?

375
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,620
Yes.

376
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,140
Did you remember your pills?

377
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,790
Effy?

378
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,370
Yeah.

379
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,580
Love you.

380
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,590
Pato?

381
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,170
Where is he? Pato?

382
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,050
Mum!

383
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,999
What's wrong? What's the matter?

384
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,920
I can't find pato!

385
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,579
Eh, have you looked under bed?

386
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,960
Of course I have!

387
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,530
- Effy, Effy, don't worry.
- Pato!

388
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,039
We'll find him.

389
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,190
Where are you?!

390
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,880
Pato?!

391
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,680
Effy, Effy.

392
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,200
Effy.

393
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,710
He was behind the bed.

394
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,870
I don't think this is right,
burning all your things.

395
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,090
I need John.

396
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,350
He'll make me better.

397
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,130
Ok.

398
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,820
Here she is.

399
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,830
It's not good for you, that.

400
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,690
That has never bothered you before.

401
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,340
You know, I walk through
this park every day.

402
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,550
I've never noticed there's a pond here.

403
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,430
Can you believe that?

404
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,620
Every day for years.

405
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,140
And then today, bam.

406
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,980
Like it came out of nowhere.

407
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,190
What the fuck are you on about?

408
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,260
Yeah yeah, I know,
"piss off" and all that.

409
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,720
What?

410
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,450
Listen, I got a call from
your man. He's all in a tizzy.

411
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,610
So I thought I'd come and hear
your side of the story, like.

412
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,490
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

413
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,260
Come on, Eff

414
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,930
Eff?

415
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,720
Who's Eff?

416
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,269
Yeah, of course, sorry.

417
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,650
You're not Effy.

418
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,140
I've mistaken you for someone else.

419
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,150
Looks like it.

420
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,190
So what is your name?

421
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,130
Elizabeth.

422
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,539
Elizabeth, nice to meet you.

423
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,720
I'm James.

424
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,930
(* crystal fighters: Xtatic truth
- last Japan remix)

425
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,239
I wouldn't normally go for a drink,
let alone a dance with someone.

426
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,930
- I've just met.
- Yeah?

427
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,820
So why did you?

428
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,079
You seem nice.

429
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,490
I am nice.

430
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,930
So, what are we doing next, mystery girl?

431
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,080
Something bad.

432
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,600
You've come to the right man.

433
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,540
Oh, déjà vu.

434
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,290
Yeah, ain't that the French
for "what the fuck is going on?"

435
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,930
No.

436
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,510
I've been here before.

437
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,070
Something bad happened here.

438
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,400
What?

439
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,840
I was screaming.

440
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,520
Someone got hurt.

441
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,790
Ok, this is getting way too
much Stephen king for me.

442
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,100
You win, all right? I call chicken.

443
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,430
Someone got hurt.

444
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,310
What are you talking about?

445
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,510
What am I talking about? Come on, Eff

446
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,660
I know you, you know me.

447
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,030
We've dated, we have fucked
in every sense of the word.

448
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,099
We are Cook and Effy.

449
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,329
No, tha... that's not
true, we've never met.

450
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,024
So how do I know you've got a mark

451
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,722
shaped like a wine glass on your arse?

452
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,690
Or that your favourite film is et?

453
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,730
Stop it.

454
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,889
That's because we know each other.

455
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:37,288
The fucking world knows us.

456
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,730
So cut the fucking shit...

457
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,360
My brother, he got hit.

458
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,330
He got run over here.

459
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,699
No, that never happened, that
never happened! You never happened!

460
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,199
Yes it did, it did.

461
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,790
What's happening to me?

462
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,380
It happened, but it never happened.

463
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,899
It happened, but it never happened.

464
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,250
- It happened, but it never happened.
- Stop it!

465
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,560
- Hit me again.
- No!

466
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,680
What's wrong with me? Hit me again!

467
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm not scared.

468
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,879
I'm not scared of anything. Hit me.

469
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,910
Effy, please stop.

470
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,330
I can't!

471
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,484
Eff! Get out the road, man!

472
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:50,220
I'm not scared!

473
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,589
I want to be scared! I want to be hurt!

474
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,820
I want to remember! I'm not scared!

475
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,850
I'm not scared! I'm not scared!

476
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,850
Come on! Come on! Come on!

477
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,190
Take me to Freddie, Cook.

478
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,489
You need to get me to him.

479
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,920
You need to get me
there. I need to tell him.

480
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,450
You remember me, though,
yeah? You know who I am?

481
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,110
How could I forget?

482
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,620
You're my friend.

483
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:42,880
- "Emergency..."
- Yes, an ambulance, please.

484
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,310
It's for my girlf.... my friend.

485
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,460
She's not right, I don't...

486
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,870
She's been sectioned before.

487
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah, it's 82 Peveril Road.

488
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,110
That's the one, yeah, ok.

489
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,470
You fucking skipping out on me, man?

490
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,769
Yeah, I'm leaving, I
was going to go tonight

491
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,300
you were going to fuck off?

492
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,650
Leave her?

493
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,689
Cook, she broke my heart man.

494
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,410
She broke my heart as well.

495
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,980
You broke my heart.

496
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,450
I bet you've broken hers at some point.

497
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,556
So what are we gonna do?

498
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:32,300
Are we just three losers
screwing each other for ever?

499
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,320
Or are we something better than that?

500
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,980
Fuck, mate, grow up.

501
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,190
Cos I'm done here.

502
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,919
Thanks for bringing her to me.

503
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,120
Where the fuck else would I bring her?

504
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,410
Don't screw it up.

00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,829
* and her skins is fair
and dark is her hair *

548
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:53,529
* and her eyes dart 'round
and fall on the ground *

549
00:41:53,530 --> 00:42:00,430
* and her lips move alone
to an old country song... *

550
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,029
I don't like this place.

551
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,520
Neither do I.

552
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,350
I'll look after her.

553
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,889
* ...An old liquor store
where we danced on the floor *

554
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:21,639
* oh the light on the wall
it brightens the hall *

555
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:28,540
* but the room in the back
is quiet and black... *

556
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,150
Hello?

557
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,696
* her voice and her breath *

558
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:56,410
* could I hear them sounds
in life underground? *

559
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,465
Hello.

560
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:19,009
* ... and her lips move
along to an old country song *

561
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,540
Please.

562
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,610
You do your counselling in here?

563
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,240
You find it oppressive?

564
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,620
It pacifies me.

565
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,460
Although I suppose I should
brighten it up a little.

566
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,260
My patients are my livelihood.

567
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,871
Anyway, about Elizabeth, and
your reason for being here.

568
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:44,120
Yeah man what the fuck
am I doing in your house?

569
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,490
Elizabeth and her mother have expressed...

570
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,420
Dissatisfaction with my methods.
It's perfectly understandable

571
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,979
I am something of a Maverick.

572
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,690
You never helped her at all.

573
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,750
She's worse than she ever was now.

574
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:03,130
Anyway, I'm hoping to keep
working with her regardless.

575
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,319
There are some thing I haven't tried...

576
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,500
Are you deaf?

577
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,590
Listen, we don't want you.

578
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,120
Just stay the fuck away.

579
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,220
Indulge me a moment longer.

580
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,259
I admit I was arrogant, stupid.

581
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,610
I made mistakes.

582
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,910
I got too close.

583
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,250
I feel terrible.

584
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,970
I care too much.

585
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,800
Stay away from her.

586
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,650
I'm too human.

587
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,040
We're essentially creatures of instinct,

588
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,090
passing whims.

589
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,560
Are really a profound moment.

590
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,250
Can't let you have her, I'm afraid.

591
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,590
She really does love you, you know.

592
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,189
Hey come on.

593
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,710
Just open the door, yeah.

594
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,680
- Something is odd.
- Karen, I've asked around.

595
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,559
There's no sign for Freds.

596
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,499
I love you.

597
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,439
Don't lie.

598
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,009
Freds?

599
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,609
He's talking in my head.

600
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,159
What's Fred saying?

601
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,300
He's saying that they're all fucking mad.

602
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,009
Thomas is coming around latter.

603
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,619
He's giving me French
lessons for my interview.

604
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,799
Hey, Fredster.

605
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,689
Look where we ended up.

606
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,899
All back at Naomi Cambells.

607
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,039
You owe him, Cook.

608
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,059
When you were fled last
year, who was looking for you.

609
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,509
What kind of lame rave is this?

610
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,589
I dressed up.

611
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,979
You find him, you fucking find my brother!

612
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,849
You've to forget about good and bad.

613
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,523
I'll never forget you.

614
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,300
R.I.P Freddie Mclair 1992-2010

615
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:31,223
* that we can walk down, me and you *

616
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,383
* so keep your candles burning *

617
00:46:36,383 --> 00:46:39,254
* and make her journey bright and pure *

618
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,666
* that she will keep returning *

619
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,386
* always and evermore *

620
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:50,226
* into my arms, o lord *

621
00:46:50,653 --> 00:46:55,665
* into my arms, o lord *

622
00:46:55,975 --> 00:47:00,223
* into my arms, o lord *

623
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:04,795
* into my arms, *
