<i>Best mates for life.</i>

3
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:06,240
You love him.
You love the lips.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,690
When I'm with you,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,280
I feel like I'm a better person.
I feel happier.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,400
Take them at breakfast
and supper, OK?

7
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,920
- Makes you tell the truth, allegedly.
- What's wrong with that?

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,960
There you go.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,960
Cookie's always got nothing.
That's why I do her pal.

10
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,525
That's why I pop Panda.

11
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:25,241
Panda's popped.

12
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,036
It's well bad, JJ.

13
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm officially off the rails.

Jack-a-fucking-nory!

00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:26,984
Smashing.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,510
See you later, yeah?

<i>You're through

<i>Please leave a massage.</i>

21
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,280
Jamie Oliver. Bastard.

22
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:24,313
Stephen Fry.

23
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:25,528
Bastard.

24
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,176
Nelson Mandela.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Bastard. Bastard.

26
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:34,210
Big, fat, ugly Irish bastard!

27
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,098
What are you doing?

28
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:39,974
I'm just looking at pictures of men,
saying which ones are bastards.

29
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,147
Nice...

30
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:43,885
Cook's gone.

31
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:46,914
We broke up.

32
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:50,464
Never mind, sweetheart. You OK?

33
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:56,960
It's just gonna make it
really hard raising our baby.

34
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:20,840
Bastard.

35
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,189
Karen, I told you...

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,912
Babe, not being funny, but you look
like microwaved shit. What's up?

37
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,560
Nothing.

38
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:04,482
My God, it's really good you're here,
actually. You can drive, right?

39
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,840
- Why?
- Cos...

40
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,948
Me and Freddie are having
a party tonight, in the woods...

41
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,289
What's it called again, honey?

42
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:13,920
Gobblers End.

43
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,719
That's right. You should come!

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,055
I was gonna borrow my dad's car,
but now he has to...

45
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,896
Take Karen to an audition.

46
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:23,248
We're always doing that!

47
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:27,039
Maybe. I have to ask my mum
if I can borrow the car.

48
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,596
Can we ask you something, though?

49
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,760
Me and Freddie want this to be like,
a quiet thing,

50
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:36,850
not some kind of...

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,840
- What did I call it before?
- Pikey hoe-down.

52
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:41,298
Thanks, babe.

53
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:44,307
- So?
- So Cook's not invited.

54
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,349
Cos we don't like him.

55
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:48,851
Like I said.

56
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,834
- I have to ask my mum.
- You just have a little think about it

57
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,245
and let us know, yeah?

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,502
I'm going to have a shower.

59
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:56,912
You coming, juicy?

60
00:04:57,684 --> 00:04:59,160
Yeah. In a minute, hon.

61
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:09,985
You should come.

62
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,117
You want me to come?

63
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,383
Why are you here?

64
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,870
Came to tell you something.

65
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,331
Your shed's changed.

66
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,004
I'll see you later, yeah?

67
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,320
All right? Take me to your kitchen!
Your daughter's in for a fucking treat.

68
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,367
Four courses, real fancy shit.

69
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,012
Pesto. Salmon. Salad.

70
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:17,680
- Love, she's gone.
- OK. What time's she back?

71
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,761
Oh, not till tomorrow.

72
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,675
They've gone to some party
at Gobblers End.

73
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,200
{\Nah, cos }We're supposed to hang out tonight.

74
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:30,165
Was that before you broke up
or after?

75
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,421
I bought a fucking gateau.

76
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,680
- Black Forest...
- My favourite.

77
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,280
Cheers.

78
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,221
Can't talk now, Mum.
Later. Later, OK?

79
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:56,600
- You sure this is the right way?
- That's what the map says!

80
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,840
- Oh, my God!
- No, we haven't...

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,128
Yes, we have!

82
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,726
Whatever! Where do we go now?

83
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:10,062
Right. Turn right.

84
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:13,016
- You're not indicating.
- No, that's left!

85
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,385
- Turn right and go straight on...
- I'm sure it's left, right, Fred?

86
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,199
What are we doing?

87
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,119
This isn't the right way,
I told you!

88
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,880
Stupid piece of crap.

89
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:41,610
We're just gonna have
to ask someone for directions.

90
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,730
Who?

91
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:45,777
Hello?

92
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:50,520
Is anybody here? For fuck's sake!

93
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,849
Excuse me, gentlemen,

94
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,051
could you tell me,
how to get to Gobblers End, please?

95
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:02,520
I wouldn't start from here, love.
No, I reckon I could show you.

96
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,012
- Great.
- All right.

97
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,960
Listen to the nice man.

98
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:15,200
Come on.

99
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:25,927
Right. Gobblers Knob...

100
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,000
Gobblers End, you call it...

101
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,280
See the roundabout?
Well, go back there...

102
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:40,513
Anybody here?

103
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:47,693
Second on the right.
You got that?

104
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,699
Thanks.

105
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,274
You kids want to see something
before you go?

106
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,200
Are you leaving
something for me, lovely?

107
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:19,762
- Let me out, please.
- Cos I've got something for you.

108
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,578
Get out of the way!

109
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,276
Little tradition of ours.

110
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,400
- Hang on, mate, do you really think...
- Shut up, kid.

111
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,560
- {\Come on, }Sweetheart, you know you want it.
- Get off!

112
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:43,926
Get off of me!

113
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,360
Help!

114
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:59,202
You made me miss.

115
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,313
- Sorry, but...
- I've never...

116
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,665
missed...

117
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:03,785
before.

118
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,165
All right! That's it,
that's enough, leave her alone!

119
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:10,598
Go.

120
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:15,504
Beware the moon.

121
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:21,800
Whatever. Freak!

122
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:31,920
- Did you {\fucking }see the size of that gun?
- Let's get out of here.

123
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:38,880
Katie, what happened?

124
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
He just started shouting at me.
I didn't even do anything.

125
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,497
Thomas, is she OK?

126
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,520
It's them. It's them.

127
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,160
Just stay calm.
It's probably nothing. Just chill out.

128
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:23,212
What are they doing?

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,680
Pull the car over. Stop the car.

130
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,960
Stop the car now!

131
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,759
Effy, stop the car!

132
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,360
Wankers.

133
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,250
Are they gone?

134
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,240
I think we should go home.

135
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,306
They're gone now. We're safe.

136
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,776
As long as we, "Beware the moon".

137
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,342
Obviously.

138
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,452
Why are you laughing?

139
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,200
- It's not fucking funny!
- All right, babes. Chill out.

140
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,667
Sorry. I was...

141
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:48,000
Come on.

142
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,220
Not far now.

143
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:14,956
It's so heavy.

144
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:18,064
This way, right, Freds?

145
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,240
You'll like it here, mate.
It's all right.

146
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,635
So what's the deal with Thomas?

147
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,887
I don't know!

148
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,411
Cook, like, had carnal relations
with Pandora!

149
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:45,863
Don't call it that.

150
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:50,349
His girlfriend's a no-good hussy
and he's acting like everything's fine!

151
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:51,968
It's messing with my head!

152
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,095
How you doing, mate?

153
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,431
Wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

154
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,476
I mean it's great you're here.

155
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,440
Just thought.
After what Cook said at your gig.

156
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,978
I would like that we keep
that between us for now, yes?

157
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,804
Course. Whatever you say.

158
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:19,729
Is this the right way?

159
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:21,706
That's right, sweetheart.

160
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,591
Just up here.

161
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,827
Are you all right?

162
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:46,276
Fine!

163
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:50,064
I mean,

164
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:54,058
relationships just can't stay
the same, can they?

165
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:57,740
Can't always be lovely and lush and
not full of weird silences all the time.

166
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,680
People can't always be perfect
cos that's not real, is it?

167
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:05,920
It's not real cos things change.
Don't they?

168
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:11,092
They do.

169
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,839
But you can tell me.

170
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,840
If something's up, I can help you.

171
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,089
Everything's great.

172
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,111
I love Thomas, he loves me,

173
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,183
everything's just
tickety-flippin-boo!

174
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,840
OK, if you say so.

175
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,063
Look what I found.

176
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:34,156
Shroooms.

177
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,587
Are they funny ones?

178
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,525
What are you doing?

179
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,760
Found some shrooms. Want some?

180
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,981
How d'you know
they're not poisonous?

181
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:49,323
I don't want you ruining
my party by, like, vomming blood!

182
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,268
And this isn't supposed to be
that kind of party.

183
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:54,388
It's just drinks and sausages.

184
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,003
No mushrooms.

185
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:57,911
Mushrooms!

186
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,238
Who's got mushrooms?

187
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,877
Give me some!
What? Chill out.

188
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,360
Did I hear mushrooms?

189
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,515
Don't you fucking dare!

190
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:13,806
Don't listen to her, Ems.

191
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,378
All part of the fun, I suppose.

192
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,683
Come on, Panda. Live a little.

193
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:25,000
No, thanks! Love is our drug!

194
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,480
Sometimes

195
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,141
you need a little more sugar
in your bowl, though.

196
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:42,505
Go on, Panda.

197
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Don't cry.

198
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,015
Don't fucking cry.

199
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:10,120
How long till it kicks in, Eff?

200
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:12,374
Not long.

201
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:02,880
I am so fucked.

202
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:05,612
Do I look fucked?

203
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,715
In the shed. I just wondered...

204
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,469
What were you gonna say?

205
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:18,640
I'll tell you later.

206
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,647
Katie's cold.

207
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:35,617
Cos that's what it's about, isn't it?
Forget all that other shit,

208
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:39,810
cos it's not about that,
it's about everything else.

209
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:43,120
Like when you open
your eyes in the night

210
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,951
and you see that face...

211
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:55,157
Listen, Effy.

212
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,823
I didn't even want you here{\ in the first place}
and you've ruined my night.

213
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,259
The reason I invited you here
was because you can drive

214
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:02,200
and you're embarrassing yourself.

215
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:05,640
It's pretty sad. Throwing yourself
at your mates' boyfriends, really.

216
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:10,920
- Come sit down.
- I'm not being nasty or anything!

217
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,840
I don't even think
you realise you're doing it,

218
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,581
it's just it makes you look
like a desperate whore.

219
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,539
Who moved the stuff?

220
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,154
What?

221
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,966
Who moved the stuff?

222
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:54,457
The bags are gone.

223
00:24:56,423 --> 00:24:57,800
What are you talking about?

224
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,740
For God's sakes.

225
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,520
- This is so not funny, guys.
- Chill out, somebody...

226
00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:15,456
Turn the music off!

227
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,688
Shit!

228
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:39,135
I don't like it.

229
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:40,648
It's OK, Panda.

230
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,960
Turn the lights off now. Everything off.
Quick. JJ, get that fire out!

231
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,755
Everyone, round the fire!
Get down, get down.

232
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:53,207
What the fuck...

233
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,285
do you think you're playing at?
You fucking idiot. You nearly had...

234
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:03,360
You fucking prick!

235
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:11,600
- I should fucking kill you!
- You scared the shit out of us,{\ stupid} prick.

236
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,294
It wasn't me!

237
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:16,395
There were psychos
in the woods with a gun!

238
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:19,600
I saw them nick your stuff so they
started shooting. They're{\ fucking} mental!

239
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,396
Shut up. Joke's over.

240
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:24,035
Bloody scared us,
you stupid fucking tosser.

241
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:25,597
All right, calm down.

242
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,211
I took your sodding
knapsacks, children.

243
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:32,040
- They're just poachers, you {\daft }wankers.
- Poachers?

244
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,349
After rabbits and shit. Not you.

245
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,854
- I was just trying to freak you out.
- Why?

246
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,739
Cos I thought it'd be funny!
And it totally was!

247
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,240
Turn off the lights!
We're going to die!

248
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,316
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I smell a shindig, I'm there.

249
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:57,236
You weren't invited
so you can just fuck off!

250
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,820
But we're having such a nice time!

251
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:03,460
Your tits look fucking mint
from this angle by the way, Kit Kat.

252
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,830
- What is your fucking problem?
- Come on then, Rambo.

253
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:10,240
What do you want? My fucking blood?

254
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,293
Cos you've fucking taken
everything else! You've taken fucking JJ

255
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,497
and now,
he's nicking her off me as well!

256
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:26,948
She hasn't told you, has she?

257
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:30,332
Fuck me,
I'm so glad I didn't miss this.

258
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,006
What's going on?

259
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,174
Effy doesn't want me any more.

260
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,534
Do you, princess?

261
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:49,158
So?

262
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:52,612
Why should we care?
Freddie's with me now.

263
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:54,407
Right, Freddie?

264
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,720
Right.

265
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:08,072
I'm going for a walk.

266
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,128
I think she took
that pretty well, don't you?

267
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Just go!

268
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,599
No-one wants you here!
No-one likes you! Just fucking go!

269
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:29,519
Do what he says.

270
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:30,903
Fuck off.

271
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:33,853
Whatever.

272
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,624
Have nice lives, all of youse.

273
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:41,520
You coming?

274
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:45,044
Stay here. With your friends.

275
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,014
Look at them.
Look at their little faces.

276
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,164
You're all such whizzo chums,
aren't you?

277
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:58,357
Ain't that right, Eff?
Ain't that right, Panda?

278
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,456
Panda's been worried lately.

279
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:05,120
Says you don't see each other
as much as you used to.

280
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,005
That right, Panda?

281
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,604
I said to her, "Cupcake,

282
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,901
maybe if you didn't spend as much
time with my cock in your mouth."

283
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,821
Shut up! Come on, Thomas, let's go!

284
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,120
It's fine.

285
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:19,227
I know.

286
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:22,522
Know what?

287
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:24,394
Wait.

288
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:28,065
It was one time, right?

289
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,240
Your party.

290
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,712
It was only once, right?

291
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:38,118
I need to sit down.

292
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:45,697
Sorry, slugger,

293
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,791
I don't think you heard.

294
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,911
Me...

295
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:51,806
fucked...

296
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:53,320
your girlfriend,

297
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:55,327
like,

298
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,007
multiple times.

299
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,309
- What do you want me to say?
- Say nothing! Hit me.

300
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:04,960
Come on!

301
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:07,471
Come on, hit me!

302
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:11,182
You are such a sad little boy.

303
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,727
Thomas, please. I stopped it.

304
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:17,341
- I love you. Just give me a chance.
- I have given you chances!

305
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:20,339
And you have not taken them!
Time and again. You've lied to me!

306
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:21,858
It's too late now!

307
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:24,880
I fell in love with this girl,
she was good.

308
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,710
She was honest...

309
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,740
and doughnuts and...

310
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,954
Now she is gone and this new one,

311
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,635
I don't like her.

312
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,974
She makes my heart hurt.

313
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:51,049
Please, please, Thomas, come back.

314
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,280
Effy, are you OK?

315
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,021
I'm really tripping,
there's something on me.

316
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,720
- Calm down.
- Get off me!

317
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,507
Calm down! It's me!

318
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:53,277
Who's that?

319
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:58,445
Is that you?

320
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:01,137
It's all right. It's me.

321
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,437
Why are you crying?

322
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:06,650
I don't know.

323
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:10,075
Look at you.

324
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,826
You're, like,
totally monged, aren't you?

325
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,333
What?

326
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,670
Fuck, there's loads of,
like, bugs in your hair!

327
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,640
Where? Get them out!
Get them off me!

328
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:22,660
What you doing?

329
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:26,242
- The bugs! The bugs!
- What bugs? There's nothing there.

330
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,311
Please don't take him from me.

331
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:47,521
What?

332
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:50,617
Freddie.
Please don't take him from me.

333
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,616
Don't do that.

334
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:03,665
Get your fucking hands off me!

335
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:08,638
As if you could take him from me!
God, you're so up yourself!

336
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,349
Your life's so shit,
you want to crap all over mine!

337
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,777
Don't invite fucking
psychos to my party

338
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:17,897
and don't push your flat little
tits in my boyfriend's face, OK?

339
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:20,171
I said, OK?

340
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,655
Cos I swear, babes, I'm serious,

341
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,650
if you ever try and touch anything
that belongs to me ever again,

342
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,506
I will fuck you up.

343
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,839
I said OK?

344
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:33,498
I said OK?

345
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:25,289
- Hit me.
- What?

346
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,847
Just once.

347
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:33,256
I want to feel something.

348
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:34,627
Hit me!

349
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:37,640
I dare you.

350
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:03,263
Bit cramped in there.

351
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:05,773
Me, two girls
and one tent nightmare!

352
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,880
You ladies like to wriggle,
don't you?

353
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:12,935
Anyway.
I need a wee and a Tic Tac.

354
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:16,723
Morning.

355
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:18,273
Good morning.

356
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:25,147
Anyone seen Pandora and Thomas?

357
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,977
And where's Katie?
Thought she'd be with you, Fred.

358
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:31,620
She's probably still asleep.

359
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,702
Thomas has gone home. He's gone.

360
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:52,352
I got to go now, please.

361
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:19,509
Nothing.

362
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:22,720
Just need to find her, OK?

363
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:21,561
<i>Are you saying
you don't know where you are?</i>

364
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:24,440
- No, I mean I can't find her.
- <i>Why not?</i>

365
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,369
Because I just fucking can't, OK!

366
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:30,016
- Just send an ambulance, will you?
- <i>Keep calm... Calm down.</i>

367
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,473
I think I hit her.
No, I mean I can't find her.

368
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,120
With a rock, and now she's...

369
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,486
- I was tripping, I didn't mean to.
- How long does it take to have a wee?

370
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:46,771
- <i>Tell me where you are.</i>
- It's Gobblers End.

371
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:47,891
Coming!

372
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:03,759
<i>This is Pandora.</i>

373
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,744
<i>I can't get to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Bye.</i>

374
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:08,902
<i>You're through
to Freddie's dyslexia helpline.</i>

375
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:11,092
<i>Sorry I can't take your call
right now.</i>

376
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,211
- <i>I'm not here. Wait for the beep.
- JJ's phone.</i>

377
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:16,824
<i>I can't take your call
so just leave me a message.</i>

378
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,438
<i>Please call again later.</i>

379
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:27,011
- Are you...
- <i>I should've gone with her.</i>

380
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:29,475
<i>Middle of the night,
I just let her go.</i>

381
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,643
<i>She's got nine stitches in her head.</i>

382
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:35,091
<i>She was lying
in those woods all night. Alone.</i>

383
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:36,905
<i>Fuck knows what happened to her.</i>

384
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:38,702
<i>She's not even woken up yet.</i>

385
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,331
But she's OK, right?

386
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,698
She is OK?

387
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,027
<i>I guess.</i>

388
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:49,568
<i>Eff, you there? I gotta go.
I'm meeting Em at the hospital.</i>

389
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:51,322
- Freddie, wait.
- <i>Call you later.</i>

390
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:15,708
- She woke up, then?
- Yeah. She woke up.

391
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,320
Fred, listen, she... pulled my hair.

392
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:22,680
So what?! She pulled your hair
so you smashed her head open?

393
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:26,200
It was an accident! I was tripping!

394
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,148
She choked me, I couldn't breathe!

395
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:31,960
I can't see any bruises.
I can't see nine fucking stitches!

396
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:34,967
But when did it happen?

397
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,244
Em, it was an accident. I promise.

398
00:43:52,184 --> 00:43:53,760
You hit her with a rock.

399
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:56,000
You just left her there.

400
00:43:56,606 --> 00:43:58,360
She could have died.

401
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:01,987
Panda, listen.

402
00:44:57,485 --> 00:44:58,970
Whose car is this?

403
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:00,477
Dunno.

404
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:03,320
But they do have a sterling
collection of power ballads.

405
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,400
Where we going?

406
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,230
Where are we?

407
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:43,786
It's you and me, babe.

408
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:47,096
It's always gonna be you and me.

409
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,677
It's always you and me.

410
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,320
I hope they lock that stupid girl up
when they find her.

411
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:39,200
We're going shopping.
For Love Ball dresses.

412
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,920
Come to the college ball with me.
Like we're... together.

413
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,120
You humiliated me.
Effy doesn't even want you.

414
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,000
But you fucking owe me, Freddy.

415
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,729
Fuck off!

416
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:56,797
We're really not shagging tonight.
