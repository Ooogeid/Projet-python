1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,169
I fucked with that girl
and now she's punishing me for it.

2
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:05,944
- You made me go mad.
- You're making me mad now.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,624
- We are Cook and Effy.
- We've never met.

4
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:09,673
I'm not scared.

5
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:10,646
You're no good
for me, Cook.

6
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:12,629
I need John.
He'll make me better.

7
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:14,532
- You're John Foster.
- And you must be Freddie.

8
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,058
Can't let you have her,
I'm afraid.

9
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,623
She really does love you,
you know.

10
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,958
# Thought it was a nightmare #

11
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:42,211
# Lo, it's all so true, #

12
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:46,432
# They told me,
"Don't go walkin' slow" #

13
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:49,100
# "'Cause Devil's on the loose." #

14
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:52,192
# Better run through the jungle #

15
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,732
# Better run through the jungle #

16
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:59,275
# Better run through the jungle #

17
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,224
# Woah, don't look
back to see. #

18
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:07,143
# Thought I heard a rumblin' #

19
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:10,213
# Callin' to my name #

20
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,702
# Two hundred million guns
are loaded #

21
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:17,212
# Satan cries, "Take aim!" #

22
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:20,473
# Better run through the jungle #

23
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,956
# Better run through the jungle #

24
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:27,401
# Better run through the jungle #

25
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:31,251
# Woah, don't look
back to see #

26
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:03,786
# Over on the mountain #

27
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:06,633
# Thunder magic spoke #

28
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,189
# "Let the people know
my wisdom" #

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,605
# "Fill the land with smoke" #

30
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,665
# Better run through the jungle #

31
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,094
# Better run through the jungle #

32
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,313
# Better run through the jungle #

33
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:24,187
Three.

34
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,688
- # Woah, don't look back to see #
- Four. Shit.

35
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,595
Come on, get up!
Five...

36
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:31,623
Come on!

37
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,245
Freds?

38
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,593
I'm wearing your best tee.

39
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,132
Anything?

40
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,497
Only in my head.

41
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,867
He's talking in my head.

42
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,421
What's our Fred saying?

43
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,742
He's saying
they're all fucking mad.

44
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,517
Two, three and... go!

45
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,150
Yup.

46
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,357
Where's Panda gone?

47
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,357
What's she doing?

48
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,144
Oh my God!

49
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:33,563
You're going the wrong way!

50
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:38,382
Go, Panda.
They're all after you.

51
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,402
Bounce to me!

52
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,910
Ems! I'm back!

53
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:57,851
No!

54
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,723
Oh my God.
Oh my God. Oh, shit.

55
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:02,922
Hi.

56
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:05,288
I got eggs.

57
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,090
We can have eggs, yeah?

58
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,684
And Red Bulls
and pain au chocolat and...

59
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,048
I got the heat.
What?

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,874
She'd been snoring
like that all night.

61
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:23,706
What?

62
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,758
You were both
so fucking trashed.

63
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,275
So I slept in the sofa
with Panda.

64
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:30,694
Right.

65
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,433
She's quite cute.

66
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,018
For a straight girl.

67
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,301
Wow. In the scud.

68
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,610
- When did that happen?
- I didn't notice.

69
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,742
Good thing. You might have got
you know...

70
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:48,573
Tempted...

71
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,339
I was wrecked.

72
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,347
Yeah.
You were both pissing corn.

73
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,205
Like I said, cute.

74
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:00,839
Is this bad?

75
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:04,836
You all need your breakfast?

76
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,738
I can fry you,
poach you, scramble you.

77
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:10,714
Do you any way you like.

78
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,669
But shower though,
cause, Ems...

79
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:16,092
You smell of something
and it ain't roses.

80
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,156
Couldn't you have just brought me
some grapes or something?

81
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,311
Grapes are for chipmunks.
This is so better.

82
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,322
I wrote you a song,
I just can't get the hang of...

83
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:37,899
Tit and piss,
the instructions were in Japanese!

84
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:41,170
Oh, fuck me up
the arse three ways!

85
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,414
- Come on, you nonky cunt!
- Language!

86
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,508
Great, innit? I've been practising.
Oh, I've got it!

87
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:50,975
Scrapey, scrapey for you,
shakey, shakey for you.

88
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:54,177
What for?

89
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,980
Life.
Can't stand still, can we?

90
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:57,748
So this is gonna
cheer you up.

91
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,883
# Some days are disasters #

92
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:06,124
# That you wish could just end #

93
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:09,511
# Other days are bastards #

94
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:12,588
# Just like a bad boyfriend #

95
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,646
# But it makes me feel
much worse than this #

96
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:18,655
# To see a face masked
with a frown #

97
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,173
# I'm not telling you to smile,
but don't be down #

98
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,882
# Don't be down, my friend #

99
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:31,044
# Don't do your wrist
any harm #

100
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,149
# You don't belong
on a funny farm #

101
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:42,514
# And I'd rather see you in a party
dress than in a hospital gown #

102
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:47,464
# I'm not telling you to smile,
but don't be down #

103
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:07,335
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

104
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,694
- Do, do, do, do, do, do.
- Did you write that?

105
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:25,572
Oh, fuck me!

106
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,533
Seems nice.

107
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,294
Met her at Dojo's.

108
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,101
Hit it off. You know.

109
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,051
Like a whirlwind romance.

110
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,912
Yeah, well,
we got chatting.

111
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:43,175
Did you?

112
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:45,493
No.

113
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:49,852
Well... least
you're moving on.

114
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:53,631
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm well over Eff. Finito.

115
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:58,016
It's like... liberating, yeah.

116
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,642
- Good.
- Moving on.

117
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,713
I'm looking
forward to meeting...

118
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:07,123
Phew, fucking hell! I'm never
having the mezze platter again.

119
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,382
I opened the window a bit,
you know.

120
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,341
Naomi, Arcia.

121
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:14,629
- Pardon?
- Arcia.

122
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,261
Sorry, I didn't quite...

123
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:18,310
Arcia.

124
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,030
Arcia?!

125
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:22,466
Arcia, all right?

126
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,664
Yeah, it's fine.
Arcia, Arcia.

127
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,651
It's pretty...

128
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,722
- Arcia.
- Cheers.

129
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,207
Listen, lover,

130
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:36,942
I think I lost my pissing thong
in the bus station.

131
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:39,752
Er, did you?

132
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,335
You know I fucking did,
stud man!

133
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,192
He's a little criminal.

134
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,912
That is what they say.

135
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:46,929
Yeah.

136
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,438
I'm not going!
I'm fine here! Leave me alone!

137
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,357
Sometimes
it's hard to move on.

138
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,232
How are you, Elizabeth?

139
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,491
Better.

140
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,048
Sure?

141
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,385
No.

142
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,092
Your mother
wants you to go home.

143
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,942
She says she can look
after you there.

144
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,957
- Is that good?
- Good?

145
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,696
You know better than that,
Elizabeth.

146
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,283
We have to forget about
good and bad.

147
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,670
My boyfriend ran away.

148
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:43,768
That was bad.

149
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,708
How can we know?

150
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:50,218
If only we knew
how things will turn out.

151
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,946
Yeah.

152
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,338
I came to tell you that
I'm leaving my job here.

153
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:02,590
You?
You're leaving?

154
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,286
Don't be upset.

155
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:06,432
I think...

156
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,791
Maybe it's time.

157
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:12,234
Do I say thank you?

158
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:17,331
We don't know yet.
But I think...

159
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:22,049
Yes, you could be something
I'm proud of.

160
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,926
I'll never forget you.

161
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:30,949
No.

162
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,703
You won't.

163
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,596
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

164
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,193
Goodbye.

165
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,669
Effy, Effy...

166
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,717
Freds?

167
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,334
I thought you didn't
sleep with her any more.

168
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,875
Yeah, well,
people keep moving in.

169
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,719
Isn't what you told me,
that's all.

170
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:34,553
Mandy, we haven't done
anything.

171
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:35,903
So, I don't why...

172
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,924
I mean,
we didn't do anything last night.

173
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:41,667
Did we?

174
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:43,218
You wanted to.

175
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,484
If you hadn't been totally
fucking AWOL...

176
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,851
No. I didn't.

177
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:49,832
Yeah?

178
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,568
Otherwise,

179
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,987
what have we been doing?

180
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,594
What have you been doing?

181
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:59,404
She thinks I'm straight!

182
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,403
What?
How do you even...

183
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,462
Said it when she was
looking at my tits, didn't she?

184
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:06,031
Bit fucked up, that.

185
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,354
I don't want to be
fucked around, Emily.

186
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,026
Just cos she won't
take you to Goa.

187
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:27,242
Don't.

188
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,838
I'd take you.

189
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,622
We'd go dancing.

190
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,230
Sleep in a hut.

191
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:42,176
I'd make love to you
on the beach.

192
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:47,573
Isn't that
what you want?

193
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:53,504
Ems! Mandy!
Breakfast!

194
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:56,695
Oh, yeah. There's someone here
you've got to meet.

195
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,173
You're Freddie's sister.

196
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,852
Yeah.
Thomas, right?

197
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,575
I thought maybe
he's hiding in here.

198
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,058
Why would he hide
from you?

199
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,231
I don't know.
But something's not right.

200
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,065
So I want to...

201
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,044
I don't fit here.

202
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,292
I don't think it matters.
I don't fit anywhere.

203
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,825
But I like
all the wrong things.

204
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,995
- Like?
- You know.

205
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:46,376
Gossip Girl, Davina,
Dick Van Dyke,

206
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,974

207
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,034

00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,914
mojitos, Rio Ferdinand,
Marsala Zone, Pop Tarts,

209
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:58,959
Jude Law's accent in Cold Mountain,

210
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:03,618
Kylie, Whitney, Britney, Robbie,
Brucie, L'Oreal, Wild At Heart,

211
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:04,867

212
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:08,981
Comic Relief, ponies,
Posh, Becks, pecs,

213
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,168
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
and heavy petting.

214
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,938
Oh, I fucking love that!

215
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:19,443
Anyway, Freddie doesn't
mind what I like.

216
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:24,256
If they knew where he was,
they'd tell me, right?

217
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,051
Let's ask.

218
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,078
I like to run.
I run like a dog.

219
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,232
Cute.
So what are you doing here?

220
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:35,856
Oh, Katie has a plan.

221
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:38,226
I'm supposed to teach her French
for her interview.

222
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:40,979
You know, Panda notices
that we are a little too friendly.

223
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:42,604
She's jealous,
and she wants me back

224
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,345
because she can't stand to see me
giving Katie French.

225
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,572
It's a good plan, yes?

226
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,212
Go for it.

227
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,478
- Panda?
- Yo.

228
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,928
You're looking happy.

229
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,976
Am I? That's weird.
I'm suicidal, obviously.

230
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,853
Because your boyfriend smashed
your heart into 1,000 pieces

231
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:03,832
seven months ago?

232
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,220
Yup. He did that.
Tragic, ain't it?

233
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,351
Bummer.

234
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,929
Thomas is coming round
to Naomi's later

235
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,287
to give me French lessons
for my interview.

236
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,960
That's kind of him,
isn't it?

237
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:18,810
Yeah, kind.

238
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,745
Hmm, you like a bit
of cheese cake, innit?

239
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,960
Well, this is... nice,
isn't it?

240
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,420
Yeah, it's nice.
I think it's nice.

241
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:44,839
I'm doing cocktails.
Who wants a Ball Breaker?

242
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,415
- Um...
- I've got rum,

243
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,769
creme de menthe, ouzo
and... rum.

244
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,786
- I'm fine.
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

245
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,066
Oh, come on!

246
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,901
What's wrong with everyone?!
It's nearly half eleven.

247
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,755
I'll have one. I love that
creme de menth-ay stuff.

248
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,164
Makes you piss green, innit?

249
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,129
There you go.

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,582
Come on, you pussies.
Ball Breakers. They're cool.

251
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,743
If Effy's having one,
you can all fucking...

252
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:15,030
What did you call her?

253
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:18,663
Um... I might have
made a slight...

254
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,002
Her name's Arcia,
for fuck sakes!

255
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,965
Why's everybody weirding her?

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,965
Yeah. Your friends
are weirdal, Cook.

257
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,496
They don't half fucking stare,
do 'ey?

258
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,221
Oh, man!

259
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,294
Um, I just remembered,
you gotta go.

260
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:36,847
What?

261
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,193
Something's come up.
I've gotta, um...

262
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:40,751
But we was gonna
get piercings.

263
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,215
Yeah, yeah,
and we will soon.

264
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,737
- Soon...
- What the fuck?!

265
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,958
You said you was gonna be
right up my alley, wasn't it?

266
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:50,169
Yeah...

267
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,579
Yeah, bye.

268
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,821
Screw you!

269
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,764
Did I do that?

270
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:58,767
Yeah, you kinda.

271
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:05,098
I'll go.

272
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,622
Cook...

273
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:12,801
I'm losing it, man.

274
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:14,246
Cook, come and
talk to me.

275
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:19,031
I never clocked
that she looked like Eff, I swear.

276
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,787
Chrissakes,
stop being a tit.

277
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:22,618
Freddie.

278
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,684
Something's up.

279
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:28,284
Look, Karen, I've asked around.
There is no sign of Freds.

280
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,749
He's legged it,
that's all there is.

281
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,023
You owe him, Cook.

282
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,661
When you ran off last year,
who came looking for you?

283
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:34,866
That's only cos I took his girl
with me...

284
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,182
You stupid bastard!

285
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:40,278
- What is wrong with you all?
- Fuck.

286
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,886
You find him.
You fucking find my brother.

287
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,153
Karen, I'm sorry.

288
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:47,008
- I miss him too.
- No, you don't.

289
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,881
Nobody loves him
like I do.

290
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,800
Not even
that crazy bitch, Effy.

291
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:54,362
He's all I've got.

292
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:56,697
God knows
he's all you've got.

293
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,597
Read that and tell me
there is nothing wrong.

294
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:02,669
I'll give you a blowjob
every day for a year

295
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:03,921
if that's
all you care about.

296
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,936
You've got me wrong,
Karen.

297
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:12,378
Show me.

298
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,690
So do I, Freds.

299
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:52,221
So do I.

300
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:21,107
Come on.

301
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:22,491
Where's everybody going?

302
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:25,535
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,903
I'm going.

304
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,516
The atmosphere's
not great in there.

305
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,908
Naom's caning
the spliff again.

306
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,168
Yeah, and the rest.

307
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,849
Well, let's go get
some of that baby food.

308
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,379
Hi, Tommo.

309
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:46,590
Panda. Katie, are you ready
for some French?

310
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,406
Yes, thanks, Thomas, I'd love some.
You remember I said...

311
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,574
Yeah, I remember.

312
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,212
I'm pretty cool, huh?

313
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,154
Do you think she cares?

314
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,145
Oh, she cares.

315
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,627
What's going on in there?

316
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:01,878
Je ne sais rien, putain.
(Fuck, I don't know anything)

317
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:04,159
- Huh?
- It's time for our lesson, Katie.

318
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:07,395
Where's everybody gone?

319
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,204
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

320
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:16,254
- What is it?
- It's Mandy.

321
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:19,134
Yeah, yeah.
You can dance. Come on.

322
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,328
I gotta get going.

323
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:22,403
No. No.

324
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,191
Everyone's so fucking pissy.

325
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:31,687
Come on. Emsy's got the gob on
and I wanna party.

326
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:33,383
That's all we have to do.

327
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,320
OK. Why not?

328
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,792
There you go. You hear that?
Why not.

329
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,709
Let's have
a bit more volume.

330
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,119
Better!

331
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:23,127
You dance pretty good...

332
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:24,740
for a straight girl.

333
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:28,520
Yeah. We...
We had problems.

334
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:31,883
Me and Emsy.
Cos... Cos I was...

335
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,576
I was bad, and...

336
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,593
That right, Ems?

337
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:39,456
See?

338
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,547
I'm forgiven.

339
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,361
It's just been heaven
these last months.

340
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,537
Fucking heaven.

341
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,325
I'm only saying...

342
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:56,426
I'm only saying
because...

343
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:00,554
Naomi...

344
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,995
Eh?

345
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,679
If you don't want her...

346
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:12,480
I do.

347
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,607
Combien de fois
allons-nous baiser?

348
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:48,312
Combien de fois
nous allons baiser?

349
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:49,539
It's future conditional.

350
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,100
Hang on, let me try again.

351
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,325
Combien de fois...
nous allons baiser?

352
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Awful.
You're actually terrible.

353
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:00,715
I know. I'm terrible.

354
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:02,454
Let me try again.

355
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:06,430
Combien de fois
nous... allons... baiser.

356
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:07,554
Not even close!

357
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,401
Watch my lips,
listen to how I say it.

358
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,164
Combien de fois
allons-nous baiser.

359
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:17,186
Alright, I think I've got it.
Combien de fois nous allons baiser?

360
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:19,570
No, you're not listening.
One more time.

361
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,641
Combien de fois
allons-nous baiser.

362
00:25:27,478 --> 00:25:28,338
Try this one...

363
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:34,358
OK... Tes mamelons
se leveront pour moi.

364
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:37,678
- What the fuck's "mamelons"?
- These.

365
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:41,450
You cheeky bastard. Honestly!

366
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,591
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry.

367
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,747
No, no, no.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

368
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:52,887
No, it wasn't...

369
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:53,738
I thought we were...

370
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,038
No, that's not right.

371
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:59,916
I'm such a dozy bitch!

372
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,138
I didn't realise.

373
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,265
What?

374
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:05,297
Don't make me say it,
Tommo.

375
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:21,644
You are beautiful, Katie,
in so many ways.

376
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:25,658
But I can't stop loving her.
Sorry.

377
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,648
Oh, fuck!

378
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,168
I love you.

379
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:51,930
Don't lie.

380
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:05,930
My mum's coming back
next week.

381
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,408
Maybe you should go.

382
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:43,750
Cook!

383
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,765
What?

384
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,264
Freds?

385
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,170
Hey, Fredster.

386
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:22,056
Look where we ended up.

387
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:26,742
All back
at Naomi Campbell's.

388
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:02,882
Naomi...

389
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,180
Naomi!

390
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:08,976
Bit loud. Bit loud!

391
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,249
Fuck!

392
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:30,313
What?

393
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,340
Cook! Cook!

394
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:37,560
What the fuck?!
What's happening?

395
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,391
- Gotta go, Cookie, the fuzz.
- I'm on it.

396
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:41,099
Open the door!
Police!

397
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,144
Always looking good
in lingerie, Panda.

398
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:48,180
This is the police,
open the door!

399
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:57,102
This is the police,
open the door.

400
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:58,474
James Cook?

401
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:03,129
Open the door.
This is your last chance.

402
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,940
Right, OK, step back.

403
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,659
James Cook!

404
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:11,685
Police,
stay where you are!

405
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:13,522
You, stay there.

406
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:15,730
Where's James Cook?

407
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:16,813
Where is he?

408
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,221
Come on.

409
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,041
Yeah...

410
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:36,387
You train pretty hard.

411
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:37,750
Yeah.

412
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,255
I run fast...

413
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,737
like a dog.

414
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:45,502
Perry, I'm still fucking
watching you, you know!

415
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:49,463
17, 18, come on.
Shape. Shape. Move!

416
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:57,636
You just ran 400 metres
in 48.2 seconds.

417
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:58,590
So?

418
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,294
So?!

419
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,242
That would put you in the European
Junior Championships, that's all.

420
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,822
I'm not from Europe.
I'm from Congo.

421
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,654
So what you
doing here, then?

422
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:10,644
Nothing.
I work. I run. So?

423
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,396
No college?

424
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:14,466
Why not?

425
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,720
And I mind
my own business.

426
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:16,991
Sure you do.

427
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:20,754
You could be in university,
a shit-load of universities.

428
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:23,709
You know, there are scholarships
for boys like you.

429
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:26,216
Boys like me?

430
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:30,013
Yes. Boys that run fast.
Problem?

431
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:33,592
I can do many things.

432
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,594
I don't have to run for Whitey
to get what I want.

433
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,374
No? OK.

434
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:44,035
Perry, if you do not put
that fag out of your mouth,

435
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:46,712
I am going
to ram it up your arse.

436
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:51,069
Neither do I.

437
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:55,338
You... can call me.

438
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,235
And fix your head.

439
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:03,328
We gotta take our chances,
young blood.

440
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,731
Otherwise,
what else we got?

441
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,957
Right, Perry, get down!
Squat thrusts!

442
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,146
Two, three.
You are going to puke your guts,

443
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:21,455
or I'm going to rip your balls out
and sell them to Nando's!

444
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:22,389
Come on!

445
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:45,082
You fuck
everything up again?

446
00:32:48,787 --> 00:32:49,899
Yeah.

447
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,329
It's his birthday today.

448
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,256
Yeah.

449
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:06,226
Do you think
he'd mind?

450
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,421
Freds probably got scared.

451
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,508
I'm pretty scary.

452
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:20,182
Yep.

453
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,356
But I can't not know...

454
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,097
if he couldn't bear it.

455
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,982
I can handle it.

456
00:33:31,622 --> 00:33:32,986
I think
I can handle it.

457
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,854
We'll go and find him.
All right?

458
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:26,379
My powers of deductive
reasoning are unparalleled.

459
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,497
They're actually hunting you
with dogs. Impressive.

460
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:32,370
Anyway, we weren't sure
if the coast was clear.

461
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,442
What do you mean, "we"?

462
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:37,137
Yeah, and it's a bit chilly
hiding out there in the garden.

463
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,313
The sea eagles
are roosting.

464
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,277
Hello, Eff.

465
00:34:50,396 --> 00:34:51,891
I've been trying
to tell you something.

466
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:53,989
Spit it out, Panda-pops.

467
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:57,959
I'm going away.

468
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:02,498
Really? Fine.
Where?

469
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:04,775
Harvard.
On a history scholarship.

470
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:08,980
I might have done some exams
without telling anyone.

471
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:27,734
Hello, Mum.

472
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:33,685
Yeah. Looking forward
to seeing you, too.

473
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:41,573
Oh, no. Nothing much.
Just... the usual stuff.

474
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:49,669
Yeah, I accepted a place
at Goldsmiths, but...

475
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,237
I know how proud
you are of me, Mum.

476
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:58,871
I love you, too.

477
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:15,509
It's all over.

478
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:42,778
I thought...

479
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:45,068
What the fuck
are you doing?

480
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:48,377
We're having a party.
Freds'd like it. Don't you think?

481
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:53,308
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess he would.

482
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:20,542
So here!
I guess it's round here.

483
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,588
- Hi, Thomas.
- Hey!

484
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:33,696
I've never
been here before,

485
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:35,529
to Freddie's shed.

486
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:38,039
Yeah. Same here.

487
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,933
First time
for everything, yeah?

488
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:43,304
Yeah.

489
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,034
Right.
Let's get this party started.

490
00:38:57,111 --> 00:38:59,312
What the fuck
kind of lame-o rave is this?!

491
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:01,584
I dressed up.

492
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,942
Yeah. Well, pardon me for farting,
dinky tits.

493
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:05,444
You took long enough
getting here.

494
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,008
We're playing Ace of Truth.

495
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:08,873
And I can tell you we've learned
a few things tonight.

496
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:10,894
- Haven't we, Karen?
- You said it had to be shocking.

497
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,851
- Yeah.
- Please don't say it.

498
00:39:13,886 --> 00:39:14,787
I'm still feeling queasy.

499
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,613
Who's going to start?

500
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:24,457
I will.

501
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:33,811
I've loved you
from the first time I saw you.

502
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:36,059
I think I was 12.

503
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:40,112
It took me three years to pluck up
the courage to speak to you,

504
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:43,324
and I was so scared of the way
I felt, you know,

505
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:45,299
loving a girl,

506
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,065
that I learned how
to become a sarcastic bitch

507
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,366
just to make it
feel normal.

508
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:53,812
I screwed guys
to make it go away,

509
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,413
but it didn't work.

510
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,752
When we got together,
it scared the shit out of me,

511
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:04,437
because... you were the one person
who could ruin my life.

512
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:11,166
I pushed you away and made you
think things were your fault,

513
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:14,116
but really I was just terrified
of pain.

514
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:19,248
I screwed that girl Sophia
to kind of spite you

515
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,514
for having a hold on me

516
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,857
and I'm a total fucking coward,
because... I got...

517
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:28,977
...these...

518
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:34,087
these tickets to Goa for us
three months ago...

519
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:38,196
...but I...
I couldn't stand...

520
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:44,320
I didn't want to be a slave
to the way I feel about you.

521
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:47,096
Can you understand?

522
00:40:49,376 --> 00:40:52,298
You were trying to punish me back,
and it's horrible.

523
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:54,636
It's so horrible
because...

524
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,708
Really, I'd die for you.

525
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:00,838
I love you.

526
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:04,988
I love you so much
it's killing me.

527
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:37,765
Freds?

528
00:42:52,463 --> 00:42:53,234
Who's that?

529
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:40,123
I'm going away, Panda.

530
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:44,451
Yes. Even though I have no exams,
I have a chance to study.

531
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:47,517
They have a scholarship for athletes.
A friend is going to help me.

532
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:51,141
Right.
I was going to tell...

533
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:52,345
It's a long way away.

534
00:43:52,677 --> 00:43:53,606
The USA.

535
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:55,313
It's called Harvard.

536
00:43:56,604 --> 00:43:59,670
I think I have a chance there.
I can make a new start.

537
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:03,834
And you know...
I run like a dog.

538
00:44:07,717 --> 00:44:08,862
That sounds cool, Tommo.

539
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:17,752
Wacker.

540
00:45:13,283 --> 00:45:14,618
What?

541
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:31,894
Get out.

542
00:45:43,347 --> 00:45:44,707
What have you done?

543
00:45:46,853 --> 00:45:49,035
Don't be stupid, Cook.

544
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,743
She told me
all about you too.

545
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:53,991
There was much
to correct in that girl.

546
00:45:55,364 --> 00:45:56,543
I almost managed it.

547
00:45:57,808 --> 00:45:59,134
Perhaps I still can.

548
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:00,884
You...

549
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:03,985
You did something
to my friend.

550
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,181
This is wasting time.

551
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:09,024
Would you kneel down,
please?

552
00:46:09,576 --> 00:46:10,544
Mr Foster...

553
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,927
Dr Foster, actually.

554
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,064
Kneel down, please.

555
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,620
I don't think you know
what I am, mate.

556
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,699
I think I do.
You're nothing.

557
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:39,926
You don't deserve that girl.
And, you know...

558
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:42,154
I do.

559
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:46,033
I'm a fucking
waste of space.

560
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:49,144
I'm just a stupid kid.

561
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:52,052
I got no sense.

562
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:54,318
Criminal.

563
00:46:57,103 --> 00:46:58,900
I'm no fucking use, man.

564
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:01,852
I am nothing.

565
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:04,152
So please...

566
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:06,639
Please...

567
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,946
Get it into your...
you know...

568
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,935
Into your bonks.

569
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:13,777
That you killed my friend.

570
00:47:18,987 --> 00:47:19,932
I'm Cook.

571
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,235
I'm Cook!
