1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
{\a3}And I'm gonna make a choice. I am.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,200
{\a3}When?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,470
{\a3}Soon. Honest.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,640
{\a3}- I've got something to tell you.
- Me too. I got you a present.

5
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:20,799
{\a3}He fell on the floor, Jal.

6
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,159
{\a3}There was blood in his ear.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,959
{\a3}I didn't know what to do.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,320
{\a3}<i>I love you too.</i>

9
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:30,284
{\a3}It's a secret.

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,809
{\a3}Don't tell Jal.

11
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:35,199
{\a3}You said you knew about it
because of the hereditary aspect.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,840
{\a3}The brother.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,250
{\a3}The brother
died of the same thing.

14
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:12,392
CASSIE

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,414
"I know I was all right
on Friday when I got up.

16
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,842
"If anything I was feeling
more stolid than usual.

17
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,011
"When I went out to the kitchen
to get breakfast

18
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,863
"Ainsley was there, moping.

19
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:44,902
"She said she had been to
a bad party the night before.

20
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,847
"After the first minute I was
surprised to find my feet moving,

21
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,877
"wondering how they had begun.

22
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:51,434
"But I didn't stop.

23
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:54,004
"The rest of them were so
astonished...

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,631
<i>Hello? No, he doesn't
like grapes.</i>

25
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,994
For fuck's sake,
don't neck them all, you tit.

26
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,764
Pass me a grape, Anwar.

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,317
Hey, mate. Do you want some spliff?

28
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:08,887
"'I think I ought to tell you
something', she said softly.

29
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:12,867
"His dark eyes opened and
looked up at her vacantly.

30
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,467
"'That's your problem then',
he said.

31
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,327
"'At last I know
what I really want to be.

32
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,417
"She pulled her face
away and gazed down at him.

33
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,457
"His eyes were closed. He was
gazing serenely at the ceiling.

34
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:37,627
"I took a quick drink of water.

35
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,657
"I couldn't imagine Ainsley
making a miscalculation.

36
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,457
"Being a person is too complicated.
I don't believe you.

37
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,540
"She wasn't smiling.

38
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:48,057
"'Why are you
so interested in me, Miss?

39
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,827
"'Oh, they're immortal',

40
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,617
"she said quietly.

41
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:54,987
"'It's only a cake.'"

42
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,041
Where's Jal?

43
00:03:20,997 --> 00:03:22,447
She was here, Chris.

44
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:23,637
Yeah? When?

45
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,287
You were sleepy.

46
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:27,357
Yeah?

47
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,477
Hey, what happened to my grapes?

48
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,847
Anwar ate them.

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,668
Yeah, well, he's a bloody grapist.

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,390
Feels funny, this.

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
Funny?

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,717
Yeah, Cass. I think
you'd feel quite funny

53
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:49,837
if they'd stuck a tube up
from your balls to your brain.

54
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:52,587
Jal knows how to change the, um...

55
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,760
thing.

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,798
She went to her call-back
at music college.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,120
Right.

58
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,107
I didn't watch, did I,
when they were doing it.

59
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:08,167
Maybe you should have
stayed in hospital, Chris.

60
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,590
Nah, bollocks.

61
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,440
Had to get home, didn't I?

62
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,173
Chris, are you allowed spliff?

63
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,400
Allowed?
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,867
- You were dead.
- Mmm. Yup.

65
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,059
Properly dead. Three minutes.

66
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:27,760
If you can survive that,
a couple of doobies can't hurt.

67
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:32,940
You want me to take a look?

68
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:36,320
Cassie, I've got a hole
right by my balls.

69
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,690
Well, an extra hole...

70
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,900
I've seen your balls so many times
I've lost count.

71
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,767
- Like when?
- Like when you were using them

72
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,040
to impersonate Mick Hucknall
from Simply Red.

73
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,240
You've gotta admit, that
resemblance is uncanny.

74
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on.

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,310
Let me look.

76
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:01,840
We'll fix you up in no time.

77
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,783
Boxers, Chris.

78
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Looks fine.

79
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,330
Of course, but, er...

80
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,819
what about the wound?

81
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:31,270
Tell me about Jal
at the hospital again.

82
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,697
She sat beside you the whole time.

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,134
The whole time. Never left me.

84
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,598
She never left you.

85
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:41,571
What, not even to go for a wazz?

86
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,998
No, Chris. She had to go for a waz.

87
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,360
Yeah.

88
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,679
Yeah, she loves me.

89
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Yup.

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
Love conquers all,
do you know that?

91
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,774
I bet it even conquers a genetically
acquired subarachnoid haemorrhage.

92
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,201
That would be good.

93
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:02,890
I should have told her.

94
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,150
When my brother died they said
that forewarned was forearmed.

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,035
If I got into trouble
they could fix it.

96
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,871
So why didn't you tell anyone?

97
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,040
- I told you didn't I?
- Jal, Chris.

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,996
Well, I took blood pressure pills.
They said that'd stop it.

99
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:24,040
- You took lots of other pills too.
- I like pills, OK?

100
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:26,276
Never thought it would
actually happen.

101
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:28,800
There's lots of things
you never think will happen.

102
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,999
Like that, Chris!

103
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,668
Hello, old friend...

104
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,568
It's all right. I'm glad it... works.

105
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,370
Goodbye, old friend.

106
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,476
Um, do we...
Do we tell Jal about the...

107
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,279
about the donger?
Or is that a secret?

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,110
You shouldn't have secrets, Chris.

109
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:00,658
- Neither of you should.
- Right.

110
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:02,790
Because we love each other.

111
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,130
Because you love each other.

112
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Sleeping.

113
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:39,391
You're not ill and
hiding it from me, are you, Sid?

114
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,014
No.

115
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,601
I'm stupid and hiding it from you.

116
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:45,332
Do you mind?

117
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:46,903
No.

118
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,925
Also I've got a nasty boil on my bum

119
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,118
and I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

120
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,094
Too late.

121
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:10,200
That's not nice.

122
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,380
No.

123
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,160
Going to my exam.

124
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,270
Is Jal here?

125
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
No.

126
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:19,840
Who's looking after Chris?

127
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,685
You are.

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Right.

129
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,463
What do I do?

130
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,540
Oh, just change his dressing.

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,779
He's still a bit confused so he'll
probably think that I already

132
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:34,360
changed it today,
but just ignore that.

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,330
Right. Where is this dressing?

134
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,839
Oh, he'll show you. Don't let him do
it himself, no matter what he says.

135
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,146
It's much better if somebody else...

136
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,378
handles it.

137
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
All right.

138
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,520
OK. What do you have to say to me?

139
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:53,880
Um... I'm sorry I'm such a tit?

140
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,919
No.

141
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,359
My life never made sense to me
until I met you.

142
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,399
No.

143
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,755
I never really loved Michelle
and it was all a terrible mistake

144
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,764
and I must have misheard her when
she said that I was the best lay ever

145
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,920
and she really, really
wasn't that great in bed.

146
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,079
No.

147
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:16,719
Good luck in your exam.

148
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:22,440
Thanks.

149
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:28,361
What do you have to say to me?

150
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,739
I'll love you forever, Sid.

151
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:35,239
You will?

152
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,620
Yes.

153
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,790
That's the problem.

154
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,006
You may turn over your papers.

155
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,919
Chris?

156
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,420
- You all right, Sid?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:51,460
Yeah. I thought you were...

158
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,260
I gotta change your dressing.

159
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,930
Oh, no. It's fine.
Cassie did it earlier.

160
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,710
Course she has.

161
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,959
Sid?

162
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:10,079
- Yeah, just let me handle it.
- No fucking way. I'll smack you.

163
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:13,341
- I'm just trying to help you...
- I've told him. He's not listening.

164
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,359
He's not listening to me.
Here we go.

165
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,799
You're gonna love this.

166
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:26,260
Cassie?

167
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Yes?

168
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,879
You're 43 minutes into
a two-hour philosophy A level paper

169
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,290
and I'm pretty sure you
haven't written anything yet.

170
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
No.

171
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Cassie...

172
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,159
Everybody else has finished exams
and started their holidays.

173
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:50,302
Here I am running a re-scheduled
exam especially for you.

174
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,515
So, are you going to write anything?

175
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,290
I'm not sure.

176
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,700
What about?

177
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,982
How long I can put off starting
to write and still get an A.

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,670
Is it possible to truly enjoy power?

179
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Sorry?

180
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,710
It's question three.

181
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,122
I'm not supposed
to help you with your exam.

182
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,850
I stopped eating and then
everyone had to do what I said.

183
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,050
That was powerful.

184
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,639
And did you enjoy that?

185
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,490
I think it was
the happiest time of my life.

186
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:36,478
But I had to stop
before I died, because...

187
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,430
... otherwise it wasn't fun.

188
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,880
You wouldn't understand.

189
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,873
You're wrong, Cassie.

190
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,930
Did you cut yourself too?

191
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,161
People will do anything to...

192
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,550
People will do anything to work out
why they feel bad, won't they?

193
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,091
And did you?

194
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,190
Work it out?

195
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,670
Like I said,

196
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,970
I'm not supposed to
help you with your exam.

197
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,730
I want you to tell me!

198
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:18,746
What?

199
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,670
How to stop bad things happening.

200
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,599
Doesn't work, does it?

201
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,279
That's why you have
to start eating again.

202
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,270
I fell in love.

203
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,933
Ah, love.

204
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,508
Why cut yourself
when you can be in love?

205
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,580
You think passing an exam
will make me happy?

206
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,879
Cassie, passing exams generally
only makes life more complicated.

207
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,838
But there's lots of other stuff
that makes things bearable,

208
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,759
and you don't even
have to use a knife.

209
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,080
Like?

210
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,100
Disco.

211
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,199
Yes, hi Martin.
Are you on security?

212
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:46,719
Come on, Doug.

213
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,518
One blast, then Cassie's gonna write.

214
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,499
Bye.

215
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,920
Hey, Cass! How'd it go?

216
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,719
Fine.
What are you doing?

217
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:31,860
Well, er...

218
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,532
I got hungry, like real hungry,

219
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,078
and so Sid went to get stuff.

220
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,324
Hey!

221
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,520
You've finished! Congrats.

222
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,680
- What happened?
- That was me. Reflex action.

223
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,799
Yeah, seems he didn't need
his balls arranging after all.

224
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,680
Funny.

225
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,000
Thanks. You're... cooking.

226
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,399
Yep, we're celebrating. I'm in love,
exams are over, and he's alive.

227
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,084
I'm al-i-ve!

228
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:10,547
I thought, "Fuck it,
let's make a night of it."

229
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,719
How?

230
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Hi, Cassie.

231
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,479
Cassie, listen. Come on.

232
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,239
Forget it, Sid. I'm going.

233
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,342
This is fucking ridiculous.

234
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,769
Is she here yet?

235
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:43,320
I've gotta tell you, mate.
Top notch. Mmmm, it's mega.

236
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,000
Fucking A, Sid. Fucking A plus.

237
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:47,875
A double plus!

238
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:52,959
It's the vanilla, isn't it?

239
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,814
- Maybe not that great with meatballs.
- Fuck.

240
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
It's fine, Sid.

241
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,620
I've never had cherries
and nuts in Smash before.

242
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:02,319
- Bit of bite.
- Great, yeah.

243
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:03,952
Love it.

244
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:09,170
So... all pals together.
At a dinner party.

245
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,230
Just like grown-ups.

246
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,032
Let it go, Cass.
We're just trying to get on.

247
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:18,384
Normally, I'd say "Let's stick
some hash in the meatballs."

248
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:20,439
But these have a kick
all by themselves!

249
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,359
Amaretto. It was on special offer.

250
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,236
So, Michelle. What's the plan?

251
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,319
You going to get back
together with Tony now?

252
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,864
All lovey? Just like before?

253
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,385
We're trying not to
make a thing of it, OK?

254
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,231
All pals again. Smashing!

255
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,310
Anyway, you and Sid, you know...

256
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:53,559
It all came out right, yeah?

257
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,919
And I'm properly forgetting
that I ever saw Michelle's breasts.

258
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,999
- Or her pants...
- Yes, Sid.

259
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,167
Or the freckle on the inside of...
I've gone too far again, haven't I?

260
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Yes.

261
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,479
Mostly we're just happy that
Chris is all right. OK, Cass?

262
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:10,102
Yes.

263
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,799
I'm all right!

264
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,919
Everyone's seen Michelle's breasts.

265
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:18,100
- And that freckle on her fa...
- That's not the one I meant.

266
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,959
Would it be helpful if
I say I love you again?

267
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:26,393
He loves you, Cass.

268
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,308
Which university are you
going to if you get your grades?

269
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:31,959
- Cardiff.
- And you?

270
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
York.

271
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:38,389
You two must really love each other.
Like hardcore.

272
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,255
I dunno, Cass. I guess we're...

273
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,959
So tell me what the point is.

274
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,415
- I didn't apply to univer...
- Yeah?

275
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,190
Well, I did.

276
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,479
You're all full of crap.
I'm going to bed.

277
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:01,635
Do you want me to come?

278
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:03,705
Yes, Sid. I want you to come.

279
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,830
Think I'm gonna go.

280
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,070
I'm sorry about
what happened, Cassie.

281
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,040
I fucked up.

282
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,039
Tony fucked up. Sid fucked up.

283
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,679
Jal's fucked up worse than any of us
but it doesn't have to turn to shit.

284
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,090
And you just put up with that?

285
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,160
Grow up, Cass.

286
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,999
That's it. I'm never putting
vanilla in anything ever again.

287
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,639
- Shall I come with you?
- Yeah.

288
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,506
- Come on, let's just go.
- Right.

289
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:45,720
Guys?

290
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,270
How's Jal fucked up?

291
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:55,006
Sorry, the train was late and...

292
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,480
What've you done?

293
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,510
I don't know why I am
the way I am.

294
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,750
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

295
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,978
Something makes me hate everything.

296
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,860
Everything.

297
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,890
That's what I like about you, Sid.

298
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,770
You never try to explain things...

299
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:31,264
No.

300
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:35,830
I probably would if I could.

301
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,510
We're finished.

302
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,796
Do you realise that?

303
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Finished?

304
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,630
Two weeks from today we get
our results and it's all over.

305
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,230
We're grown up.

306
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,360
We've made it. Done.

307
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,290
That's good, isn't it?

308
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,239
Everything ends badly.

309
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,950
It doesn't have to.

310
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
No?

311
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,890
I've got you.

312
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,799
Don't you wish you could go back
to when you hadn't lost anything?

313
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,310
Everything's in the future.

314
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,070
More shit to happen, that's all.

315
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,238
I love you.

316
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,610
I'm here now.

317
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:44,759
That's the best I've got, Cass.

318
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,566
Let's... never go.

319
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:03,780
I wanna stay here.

320
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:05,854
I don't want to go.

321
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,780
I might have... I might have to go.

322
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Don't.

323
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,850
She told you.

324
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Yeah.

325
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,370
She tried to tell you before.

326
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:06,706
I know.

327
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,250
It's gonna be OK, though.

328
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,610
Talked it through.

329
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,670
We talked a lot.

330
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,620
And?

331
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,028
I'm not really qualified
to be a dad.

332
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,610
I don't know what they do.

333
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:31,500
And, um...

334
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,900
She's gonna be famous, Cass.
I mean, she's gonna be great.

335
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,159
Fucking mega.

336
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:41,210
- I'm not exactly A plus...
- You're A plus, Chris.

337
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,415
She just doesn't want a baby.

338
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:49,790
No, I know. I'm on her side.

339
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,770
She's all I got, so...

340
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,350
... I'm on her side.

341
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,070
Where's Sid?

342
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,010
He went to do his milk round.

343
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:09,190
I think he likes
having all that milk.

344
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,957
Cool. Lots of milk.

345
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,271
A truckload. All he can drink.

346
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:16,170
He's a lucky man.

347
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,820
Nonstop glugging.

348
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,140
- He'll be chucking it down.
- He's milktastic.

349
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,510
- Milkulous.
- He's a milkionaire.

350
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Tea?

351
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:30,741
Tea.

352
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,930
Do you live up there?

353
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Yes...

354
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,700
Do you know Christopher?

355
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,568
Yes, I live with him.

356
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Girlfriend?

357
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,823
No. No, I just live with...

358
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:03,036
Who are you?

359
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,553
I just heard something about him.

360
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,409
He was in hospital.

361
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,190
But he's better now.

362
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:14,199
He's not better.

363
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:15,879
No, really. He's fine.

364
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
You're her.

365
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,830
You're Chris's mum.

366
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,710
You should see him.

367
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:33,210
- Please, come in and see him.
- His brother died.

368
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Peter died.

369
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,510
And they say... Chris might.

370
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:44,550
- Chris might...
- He's better! He's fine.

371
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,260
Tell him...

372
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,230
... I couldn't stand it.

373
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,494
No, don't go!

374
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Chris!

375
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Ay-up.

376
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,929
When's Jal getting back?

377
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:20,481
Tomorrow.

378
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,959
She said she wants me
to think about things.

379
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:26,749
You could make her
change her mind...

380
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,710
... if you wanted to.

381
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,927
Listen, Cass. When a woman
of that calibre is prepared

382
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,919
to get her tits out for you,
you don't mess it up on purpose.

383
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:37,279
Ah, romantic.

384
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Ta.

385
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,880
I fucking love her. That's it.

386
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,750
Anyway...
You went to make tea six hours ago.

387
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,518
Oh! Yes... I got the milk.

388
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,720
I was talking to...

389
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,499
... to someone outside...

390
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:00,600
Yeah, well, that's all
very interesting,

391
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,559
but it's not gonna make my tea,
is it?

392
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:07,120
And girls who won't make my tea do
not ever get to see my cock again,

393
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,184
and that is what you call
social deprivation.

394
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,839
You cheeky, sexist fucker!

395
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,559
I am, I'm a sexy fucker!

396
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,479
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna wash your
big fucking mouth out!

397
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:23,200
- Ah! Jesus Christ! Watch it!
- Oh, my god!

398
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,279
Christ!

399
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:27,099
Fuck! Chris, I forgot! Jesus!

400
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Is it OK?

401
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,800
Oh, yes!

402
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,319
Shit! You bastard!

403
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,633
And, I'm still
awaiting my tea, Wenchy.

404
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,181
Wenchy?

405
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Yeah.

406
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,830
Wenchy Foozy-Moo.

407
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,778
You were right about Adam Sandler.

408
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,960
He is quite sweet
if you keep the sound down.

409
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,120
Nah, yeah, he's cool...

410
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,684
Look. He's gonna
piss on himself again!

411
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,821
Oh! Forgot...

412
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,634
I got something for you.

413
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:24,778
Yeah?

414
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,330
Stole it on Park Street.

415
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Smart.

416
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,050
You were gonna tell me
who you were talking to outside.

417
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Cass?

418
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,960
Oh, cool!

419
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:50,441
Oh, man!

420
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:53,120
Fucking A, man!

421
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,440
Chris,
I've been thinking about secrets.

422
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:01,480
Here comes the Monkey Man!

423
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,890
Sometimes you have to keep them.
In case someone got hurt.

424
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,519
Oh, I can't wait to
show this to, um...

425
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,390
Show it to, um...

426
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:18,000
Cass?

427
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,264
Show it to, um...

428
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,839
My girlfriend, what's her name?

429
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:29,359
Don't be stupid!

430
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,520
Spliff, I...

431
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,080
I feel a bit...

432
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,640
Shit.

433
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,880
Chris?

434
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:57,750
Chris, you OK?

435
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Come on!

436
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:08,520
Fuck! Come on!

437
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,359
Help! Please help.
He needs help!

438
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,399
Number 4... Lewis Gate block!

439
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,652
They're coming, Chris!

440
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Got it...

441
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:35,840
... Jal...

442
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,071
... got it...

443
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,050
Hey kid. Where you headin'?
Where you headin'?

444
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,558
I don't'know...
Somewhere nice.

445
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:06,725
- Yo, Earl!
- Yeah?

446
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:09,790
The lady wants to go
someplace nice, man.

447
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,610
Tell her to get the
fuck out of this neighbourhood!

448
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:57,630
Thank you, Frank.

449
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,503
Where are you going now?

450
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:02,799
I haven't decided.

451
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:05,001
Well, decide to eat.

452
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,270
You gotta eat.

453
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Here.

454
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,770
Look up there on the right.

455
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,920
Martha serves chilli on Tuesdays,

456
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:18,743
blow your balls off!

457
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:20,884
Yeah.

458
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,454
Hey, what the fuck
you looking at, man?

459
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,570
You should eat that. It's good.

460
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,719
I... think I'm hungry,

461
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,390
but then I'm not.

462
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,370
Tell you what...

463
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,640
Skip it.

464
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,790
This is so...

465
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,248
It's nice of you.

466
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:23,519
Sure it is.

467
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:35,339
I take all this leftover food
after my shift.

468
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,490
Nobody wants it.

469
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,919
Guess they know I'm from Iowa.

470
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,439
Where's that?

471
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:47,960
Over there.

472
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,650
About a thousand miles.

473
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,679
Boy, you're raw, aren't you?

474
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,486
Tired, mainly. Just tired.

475
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,964
The bed's through there.

476
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,270
Hey, be my guest.

477
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,799
I'm wired after work.

478
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,400
Hey. You found the shower.

479
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,567
I just got back.

480
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,559
Hope you don't mind but,

481
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,338
you've been sleeping for two days and
I usually try to do...

482
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,973
Two days?

483
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,420
Where did you...?

484
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,124
Couch.

485
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,159
Anyway, I'll...

486
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,701
No, it's OK.

487
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,060
Please.

488
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:52,800
Well, I just got to fix
these pictures up a little, then...

489
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,810
Did you tell me your name?

490
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,930
Yeah, couple of times. It's Adam.

491
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,988
And you're Cassie.

492
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,174
Hi. Again.

493
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Hi.

494
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:12,325
The pictures.

495
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,210
Does anyone see them?

496
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,630
No way.
I'm just your New York cliche.

497
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,730
Waiting, waiting.

498
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,677
Who's that in the photos?

499
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,130
She takes a good picture.

500
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,790
Is she your girlfriend?

501
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,020
For a while, um...

502
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,390
But she's, er...

503
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,630
she's gone now.

504
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,265
Adam?

505
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Yeah?

506
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,999
I don't really want to fuck you,
if that's OK.

507
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:58,359
- I didn't say...
- I thought you'd...

508
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:01,079
No, you needed
somewhere to sleep, right?

509
00:40:01,563 --> 00:40:03,770
- Yes.
- So, it's cool.

510
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,999
Stay here as long as you want.
Till whatever's going down is over.

511
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:13,379
It won't ever be over.

512
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:16,371
Yes, it will.

513
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,399
Do you like to dance?

514
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,160
It's two in the morning.

515
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,170
You guys don't go out in England?

516
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,039
Come on!

517
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,750
I don't think I can.

518
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Come on!

519
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:46,253
No.

520
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,720
No! Put me down! Don't!

521
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,330
Get out of my way!

522
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,320
Boy, you can run.

523
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,790
I'm fucked up.

524
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Yeah.

525
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
I ran away.

526
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
No.

527
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,160
I thought Americans didn't do irony.

528
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,680
It's Manhattan.
It's different.

529
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,830
Don't you want to know what I did?

530
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:08,999
Would it change anything?

531
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
No.

532
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
So...

533
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:16,359
Let's go.

534
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,870
Do they have boats on this river?

535
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:41,170
- No.
- There! You did it again!

536
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:37,450
Don't worry.

537
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:39,680
He's OK.

538
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:41,693
I won't touch.

539
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,039
<i>Dear Cassie,</i>

540
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,910
<i>I went away for a while.</i>

541
