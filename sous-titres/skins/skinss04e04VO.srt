1
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,588
My girlfriend won't look at me.
I could cry every minute.

2
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:10,242
We did it before. Can we do it now?

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,535
I don't think so.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,659
You put a kid in hospital.

5
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,504
I couldn't stand the way she
was fucking looking at him.

6
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,511
I love him, Cook.

7
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:21,853
Sentence set for two weeks
from today. Take him down.

00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,516
- Ready?
- Teeth?

10
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:26,715
All clear.

11
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,475
Right, let's get to work then.

12
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:36,938
Please, Dad, I'm too young to die.

13
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,056
Shut up, kid.

14
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:39,934
I'm your son, your only son.

15
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:40,958
Saml

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,121
Hiya, love.

17
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,706
Dare I ask what you're doing now?

18
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,363
Are you leading a busy lifestyle?

19
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:53,912
Not enough time for a full work-out?

20
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,853
Don't worry, cos Fitch Fitness
has got the answer.

21
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:57,969
Yeah!

22
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:02,805
The new concept in fitness that
gives you a full body work-out in just...

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,077
Five minutes!

24
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:06,433
The HyperFitch Machine!
Don't get Fitch...

25
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,699
Get HyperFitch!

26
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:11,440
That's great, Rob!

27
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,921
Any chance you could invent
a moneymaking machine

28
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:14,952
while you're at it?

29
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,261
You're looking at it, love.

30
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,256
Are you girls off to work?

31
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:20,119
Someone has to.

32
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:23,921
See you in a bit, yeah?

33
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,272
Laters, lover.

34
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,506
Er, Rob?

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,742
Yeah?

36
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,369
Where's that bolt go?

37
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,509
What? Oh, shit!

38
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,513
- Agh!
- James!

39
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:47,413
Things are cool, aren't they, Mum?

40
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,833
Between you and Dad?

41
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:54,485
Of course, Katiekins!
Nothing for you to worry about.

42
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:07,250
How unreal do I look?

43
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,573
Amazingly unreal.

44
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:12,532
Dean is going to come in his pants
when he sees me.

45
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:16,225
Brandy!

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,445
Baby!

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,666
You look unreal.

48
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,704
I'm sorry I'm late.
My colonic overran.

49
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:27,582
Jenna, have you talked to OK!
About covering the wedding?

50
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:31,394
Unfortunately, Vivienne, they insisted
they only cover premiership do's.

51
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,822
Excuse me?

52
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,508
I mean, negotiations are still
ongoing.

53
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,221
Wonderful.

54
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:41,602
Now,

55
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:48,258
we also want a gaggle of swans,
100 doves and a trained owl.

56
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,253
An owl?

57
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,555
To bear the ring.

58
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,826
These will be expensive extras.

59
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,841
Jenna, I promised Brandy
the wedding of her dreams...

60
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:00,279
...and that is what she'll have.

61
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,484
I'm sure you'd want the same for
Katie.

62
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,274
Look, I'll sort out the hen night and
you just deal with the owls and stuff, OK?

63
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:10,235
Daughters, eh?
What would we do without them?

64
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,258
Don't know!

65
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:16,891
See you tonight, and don't forget
the theme, sluts and studs.

66
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,319
Sluts and studs.

67
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,601
Well, come on then.

68
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:31,659
That's you.

69
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:36,973
Now, Katherine, your home tests were
coming up correct, you're not pregnant.

70
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,710
Thank God!

71
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:42,713
What's up with my periods then?

72
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:47,197
Your results show that you're going
through something called...

73
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,988
...a premature menopause.

74
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,632
Oh, right.

75
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,958
Shit!

76
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,517
I can't imagine what you're feeling.

77
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:03,830
Not being able to have children...
Well, it isn't a nice thought, is it?

78
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,436
Especially at your age.

79
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,008
What are you talking about?

80
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:12,360
Katherine, the menopause
prevents you from ovulating.

81
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,625
Which means you won't
be able to conceive babies.

82
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,880
What? Ever?

83
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,921
But there's pills for that, right?

84
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,269
I'm afraid not.

85
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,448
I know this is a lot to take in.

86
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:33,832
Would you like me to call your mum?

87
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,066
Well?

88
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,137
Have I got you knocked up?

89
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,148
Thank fuck! That would totally
not be awesome.

90
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:59,149
You can pretty much fuck off now.

91
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,513
What's with the mood, sugar titties?

92
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:02,506
Leave me alone.

93
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,093
Kitty Kat, stop kidding round.

94
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:06,596
Do I look like I'm kidding?
You're dumped.

95
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:07,943
Fuck off.

96
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,517
Broke my fucking toe.

97
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:24,521
Goodbye, Sam.

98
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,208
Katie!

99
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,403
Hi, this is Emily. Can't come to the phone
right now but leave me a message.

100
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,429
Bitch!

101
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:59,428
You're in the wrong account.

102
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,070
- No, sweetheart, I can assure you...
- Mum.

103
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:05,310
"The Fitch Fitness account
has been empty... '

104
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:07,476
This has nothing to do
with Fitch Fitness.

105
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,706
I use our family account
and we are not bankrupt.

106
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,357
'I'm sorry about this,
give me a moment to look into it.

107
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,794
'Do you know your password? '

108
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:18,787
Look, you know,
I don't have time for this.

109
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:22,125
I'm trying to run a business here.

110
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,256
So why don't you just get it on
your stupid screen and sort it out?

111
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,108
'It says here you've been informed
on numerous occasions.

112
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:32,215
- 'Have you had any letters? '
- No, we haven't received notification.

113
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,530
No nothing, zilch.

114
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:36,830
'Mrs. Fitch, you are not eligible
for any more loans

115
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:39,601
'and you've exceeded
your overdraft limit.'

116
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:41,008
Arsehole!

117
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:45,753
- 'Are you referring to me? '
- No, not you.

118
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,555
'Hello? '

119
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,051
Mum?

120
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,428
What are those?

121
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,223
Deep breaths, Jenna.

122
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,637
Deep breaths.

123
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,735
Mum?

124
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,715
Honey, we're home!

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,134
Mum?

126
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,474
Mum?

127
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:03,533
Babe, we're back.

128
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,847
Mum!

129
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:08,079
The nurse said that I have an unusual
fascination for the female anatomy

130
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:11,606
and that I should consider
a career as a gyna...

131
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,421
Gyna...

132
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:17,202
Gyna...

133
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,892
What's the word, Dad?

134
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,278
Gynaecologist.

135
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,487
Something you want to tell me, Rob?

136
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:32,174
Don't you dare run away from me,
don't you dare!

137
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:35,472
You stupid, stupid person.

138
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:40,809
- You bastard, you're a fucking
coward. - I was going to tell you.

139
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,566
- You're a fucking coward.
- It's not my fault.

140
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,288
We are so finished.
Consider yourself divorced.

141
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:51,596
You arsehole! You ruined everything!
You fucking bastard! Stupid, stupid...

142
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,786
What's happening?

143
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,460
You'll be all right.

144
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,168
Everything's going to be fine.

145
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,813
Don't you dare make out
like I'm the one in the wrong.

146
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:55,363
Just calm down, love.

147
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:58,629
I'm gonna burn your
"Gym of the Year" certificate.

148
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,517
- What?
- What's going on, Mum?

149
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:04,922
Is Dad coming back?

150
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,401
We'll talk about it later.

151
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:11,839
You need to concentrate on doing
a good job for me tonight, OK?

152
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:17,144
We've got a lot riding on
this wedding now, sweetheart.

153
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,166
Let me look at you.

154
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,852
Perfection.

155
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:32,422
Katie! This is Candace, my BFFE.

156
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,369
Nice outfit!
Sorry about the change of theme.

157
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,971
Candy surprised us all with these.

158
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:41,204
Soz, hun. I was going to get you one
but I didn't know what to put on the back.

159
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,133
Another shot, Brands?
WTF, Cands.

160
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:48,480
Here we go, a toast to my new
boyfriend, Danny Guillermo.

161
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,584
To husbands, handbags and holidays!

162
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,109
Danny's told me about you.

163
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:01,762
I figured you'd have bigger tits.
They're like Danny's favourite thing ever.

164
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:04,302
- He never complained.
- Not to your face.

165
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,689
So, you got a new man now then?

166
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:10,421
Brandy, Baby, I am paying Katie
to work, not to socialise.

167
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:11,812
Sorry, Mum.

168
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,367
Our table is finally ready, girls.

169
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:21,895
My darling daughter has been blessed
with her looks

170
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,565
and what God didn't give her,
my plastic surgeon did!

171
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,641
Brandy, sweetheart, beautiful...

172
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:36,166
I am so proud of you.

173
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:40,174
You've grown up to be
a sexy, arousing woman.

174
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,320
And what with the wedding,
and now the baby,

175
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:48,432
you've just exceeded all my
expectations.

176
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:49,414
What baby?

177
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,981
Mummy, it's a secret.

178
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:55,099
It's better for people to know,
than think you're a fatty.

179
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:58,382
Girlies, will you please raise
your glasses

180
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:03,366
and toast my angel,
daughter and grandchild bearer!

181
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,526
To Brandylicious!

182
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:07,616
Brandylicious!

183
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,978
Now, let's all get completely
wrecked,

184
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:13,210
give them paps
something to print tomorrow!

185
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:14,828
Hiya, Babes.

186
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:17,259
You having a rave?
Rave and a half.

187
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:20,138
I'm so angry Mummy told everyone
I got knocked up.

188
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,878
Yeah, I bet.

189
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:23,714
Oh, I'll have some of that.

190
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,994
You do know you're not supposed
to drink when you're pregnant?

191
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,240
Don't care, and I don't think
you can talk to me like that.

192
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,432
I'll do what I want.

193
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,735
You're in my way. Move.

194
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:42,473
Katie!

195
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:48,876
What are you doing here?

196
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:52,211
You cool?

197
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,895
Have a drink with us.

198
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,042
Is that a joke?

199
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:57,607
Katie, I'm...
You haven't changed.

200
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,138
I can see straight through you.

201
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,565
Likewise.

202
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,409
Never going to let that smile
falter?

203
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:03,947
Only when yours does.

204
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,260
Sweetheart, I've run out of fags.

205
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:09,025
You'll need to run along
and go and get some more.

206
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:12,877
One, I'm not your fucking maid.

207
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:17,781
Two, I don't work for you, so you'll have
to go and get your own fags, sweetheart.

208
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,022
Stupid bitch.

209
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,149
Rudeness!

210
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,731
Swallow or spit, girlfriend?

211
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,989
How dare she?
Who does she think she is?

212
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:43,524
Who the fuck do you think you are?

213
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:49,701
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?

214
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,728
Come on, princess,
that's enough for one night.

215
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:53,844
Get off me!

216
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,239
Look at yourself.
You are disgusting.

217
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,237
You are an embarrassment.

218
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:03,473
Sack her, Mummy.

219
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:06,318
You and your useless mother
are fired. Get rid of her.

220
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,647
Come on, sweet cheeks,
don't mess with them.

221
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,949
I don't smoke.

222
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,383
What you scared of?

223
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,120
Uh, cancer?

224
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:00,581
Fuck it.

225
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,386
Steady.

226
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,288
You didn't inhale properly.

227
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:10,787
Breathe in.

228
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,905
Now breathe in again so it goes
there.

229
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,634
Why are you being nice to me?

230
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,166
Life's too short.

231
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,569
You are such a fucking cliche.

232
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,257
So what's it like?

233
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,824
What's what like?

234
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,040
Love.

235
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,321
Great.

236
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:45,919
It's really lovely.

237
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,751
That sounded convincing.

238
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:50,408
It's fine.

239
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:55,141
Nothing's ever perfect, you know?

240
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,247
I thought it could be.

241
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,378
I wanted the perfect boyfriend,
perfect marriage, perfect everything.

242
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:04,896
What's changed?

243
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:07,995
Me.

244
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:17,529
I don't know who I am any more.

245
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:21,227
I thought you were
Katie fucking Fitch!

246
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,401
I used to hide in the bath
when she was angry.

247
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,079
I've really messed up, kiddo.

248
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:08,311
Yeah, but you love each other, right?

249
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,583
For richer, for poorer.

250
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:39,576
Kids...

251
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:43,160
it seems that your father
has let us down once again.

252
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:44,226
Jen, please.

253
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:46,605
He's been selfish and stupid.

254
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,500
- Mum, stop it! - I suggest
you keep shtoom, young lady,

255
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:52,361
considering you've lost us
the only income we had.

256
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:58,800
Because of his stupidity, this
house...

257
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,515
our home, is being taken from us.

258
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,651
Today.

259
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,881
Tell your children what that means,
Rob.

260
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,133
It means we're homeless.

261
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:18,252
That's right, it means we're
homeless because of your dad.

262
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,995
I tried to save the gym.

263
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,795
It's these loan companies,
nice as pie one minute,

264
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,833
next thing they're calling you up,
sending you letters,

265
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:27,270
but you gotta believe me,

266
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:29,791
we're going to make a fortune
out of that machine.

267
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:33,068
That machine's a total waste of
space, Rob, just like you.

268
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:37,661
Take James upstairs.

269
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:40,802
But Mum...
Katie, for once, do as you're told.

270
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,615
How could you do this to us?
To your own children?

271
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,185
- Your own children?
- I'm trying to do the best I can.

272
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,178
Have you got any
sense of responsibility?

273
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,372
- Have you heard of communication?
- I'm doing the best I can.

274
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,750
- Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- You're just like a child!

275
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:12,646
Hello?

276
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,640
Come on, folks.

277
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:20,377
Yes?

278
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:24,018
Good morning, sweetheart. We're
here to repossess your belongings.

279
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,652
Love, open up, would ya?

280
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,699
Come on, folks!
Don't fuck us about!

281
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,163
Open up, open the door.

282
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,091
Get your stuff.

283
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:46,960
Morning, Mr. Fitch.

284
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:52,288
Hey, lads, you're going to be
reasonable, yeah?

285
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,058
Certainly, ain't we?

286
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:56,470
Reasonable's our middle name.

287
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,879
Good, ta.

288
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:02,759
Can you just read out your court order,
just so I know you're not, you know...

289
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,391
Cunts.

290
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:05,988
Righty-oh.

291
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:16,137
"By the order of the county court,
given this day, 17th of February 2010,

292
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:22,040
"it is hereby given down that
goods to the value of £13,337...

293
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:29,369
"...William M Janus and granted
licence to reposse..."

294
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:32,170
Are you still there, Mr. Fitch?
Hello?

295
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,959
Something's not right here.

296
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:40,071
All right, my lover? You going
to open up? I got sweeties.

297
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,347
Paedo!

298
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,066
- Move!
- Garage!

299
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:45,204
Go!

300
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,152
Come on, open up, you lot. Come on,
this is getting stupid now.

301
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,111
Right, fuck this, we're going in.

302
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,832
Hello?

303
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,111
Tell you what...
I think it's happened again.

304
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:07,362
Oh, bugger!

305
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,295
Oh, well.

306
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,787
Fuck it, can't think of everything.

307
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:16,087
Oh look! They've got one
of them there glass swans.

308
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,148
Where to?

309
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,434
My mum used to have one of those.
Oh, yeah!

310
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:24,577
This is a beauty. It's really heavy.
Perfectly sculptured. Look at this, bud.

311
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:28,523
You see, it's the weight of the lead
that they put in the crystal, see?

312
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,692
Oh, feel the quality of him.

313
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:36,507
Oh, yeah, I see where
you're coming from, Kev.

314
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,807
Might take this home for my Carol.

315
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,981
I promised Phil some new saucepans.

316
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:43,363
And a toaster.

317
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:45,953
You get a better quality of
toaster up at this estate.

318
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:49,139
Well, you know what they're like round
here, all fur coat and no knickers.

319
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:52,130
Nouveau reech, in't it?

320
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:56,208
Mind you, I wouldn't have done it
out like this, would you?

321
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,554
I don't like that paint job at all.

322
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,109
Magnolia and lime? Bollocks!

323
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,936
Time? All that time when those
fucking bills were coming in

324
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,288
and you did nothing about it!

325
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,167
How long was that?
Cos when I looked at them

326
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:08,860
I'd say there was a good six,
seven months' worth!

327
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:12,296
It takes time to sort out -
you wouldn't let me deal with it!

328
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:18,558
I know you're not
the sharpest tool in the box...

329
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:21,948
We're not going to sort it out here.
Get in the car!

330
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,587
I hate KFC.

331
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:25,507
What?

332
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,658
Elliot Evans's parents got divorced

333
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,732
and his dad spent
every night in KFC.

334
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:33,602
Then he met this woman
and she had a huge problem,

335
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:38,574
so he tried to help her,
and her friend got really angry

336
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:40,542
and he ended up with
only one kneecap.

337
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:43,081
And now his mum's doing pornos

338
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:46,768
and his dad's a junkie
and he never sees them.

339
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,911
Except on the internet,
and then he has to pay for it!

340
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:53,195
I mean, how unfair is that?

341
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:58,077
- I never thought you'd fail as a father!
- I haven't failed as a father!

342
00:23:58,112 --> 00:24:00,587
You've let your kids down!
They're in the car,

343
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:04,353
all that time when those fucking
bills were coming in...

344
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,556
How long was that?
Cos when I looked...

345
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,888
I'm so fed up!
I can't go on like this, Rob.

346
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:13,185
I swear to God,
I've had it up to here with you.

347
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:17,687
Drop me and the kids at the airport.
I'm going to my mum's.

348
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,746
No!

349
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,665
Get back in the car, Katie!

350
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,760
Mum, we can't afford the flights
to Malaga. We're broke!

351
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,690
You want to sleep
with your dad on the streets?

352
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,042
It won't come to that!

353
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,238
Well, where else
are we going to stay?!

354
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,497
Fix it, Rob.

355
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:34,821
Or I'm getting in the car
and I am leaving with the children.

356
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,707
There is someone we can stay with.

357
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,148
Who?

358
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,732
Good morning, Naomi.

359
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,361
You're looking sexy.

360
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,444
You heard of a shower?

361
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,859
What do you want?

362
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:05,386
This is difficult, OK?
But we've lost our house.

363
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,322
Oh, that was careless.

364
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:08,468
So what?

365
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:10,801
We need somewhere to stay.

366
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,724
Your house is pretty empty
at the moment.

367
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,690
You're having a fucking laugh.

368
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,115
Yes, Naomi, I'm kidding that
my parents have no money, no house

369
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,651
and are about to split up.

370
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:26,615
I'm sorry, but...

371
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,006
It's not my problem.

372
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,430
Oh, but it is.
Cos it's Emily's problem.

373
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:34,286
She's your girlfriend.
That makes it your problem.

374
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:38,205
No lesbian digs?

375
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,660
That, I can't promise.

376
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:47,217
I'm gonna sort this.

377
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,783
I'll be back later.

378
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:57,060
Running away again?

379
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:03,312
He's gone to look for
somewhere to live, actually.

380
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:07,085
I'm not going in there.

381
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,795
Please, Mum.

382
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,205
You've got nowhere else to go.

383
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,734
Please?

384
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:33,119
We've run out of cereals.

385
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:34,945
Garibaldi?

386
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,280
Thank you.

387
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:45,632
Look at her, swanning about
as if she's done nothing wrong.

388
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,143
She hasn't.

389
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:49,988
I want the best for Emily,
and she isn't.

390
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,531
How do you know?

391
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:55,707
Mums know these things.
You'll realise that one day.

392
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,624
Are you really going to leave Dad?

393
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:08,612
When your dad and I got married,
we had nothing.

394
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:11,373
We spent years working and saving,

395
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:15,538
so that you kids could have the best
of everything. And for what?

396
00:27:16,713 --> 00:27:18,078
It's all gone.

397
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:22,770
I never thought we'd split up.

398
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:25,865
But then I never thought
I'd be evicted from my home

399
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,894
or that my daughter would be a...

400
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,283
...so rebellious.

401
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:38,869
People always let you down, princess.

402
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,797
They fuck things up.

403
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:45,484
Not you, though.

404
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:51,501
Mum, I need to tell you something.

405
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:56,952
I know everything's going wrong
at the moment but... it's just...

406
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,507
...I went to the doctor's
the other day, and...

407
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:12,115
Fuck's sake.

408
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:29,564
You could have called.

409
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,097
- You've been out all night.
- I know.

410
00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:35,408
Can you blame me? And now they're
here. We've got enough problems.

411
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:36,189
Stop it, Em!

412
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,140
All the shit she put us through,
you let her march into our home.

413
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:43,025
She's your mum.
She's a selfish cow, is what she is.

414
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,326
Emily?

415
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,515
Whatever! Stay here.

416
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,825
Don't expect me to care,
cos I don't.

417
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,250
It's just for a couple of days while
we get ourselves out of this pickle.

418
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:54,485
Stay out of my way.

419
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,592
This is my house.
I live here with my girlfriend.

420
00:28:57,627 --> 00:28:59,436
And we're having a barbecue.

421
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,672
All right?

422
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,004
Whatever you say, love.

423
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,573
I'm going to finish emptying the car.

424
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,001
Wow, isn't this peachy?

425
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:19,923
Who's got any more pills?

426
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:23,051
Effy?

427
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,092
Don't you think you've had enough?

428
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,099
Don't think. Makes life much easier.

429
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:29,063
Naomi, darling?

430
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:31,646
Got any more of your special powder?

431
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:32,967
No? Don't, Em.

432
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:34,538
Where's Cook when you need him, eh?

433
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,871
Somebody phone for more pills.

434
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:43,347
Another fun day at
Mrs. and Mrs. Campbell's.

435
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,573
Come on!
What's wrong with everyone?

436
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:51,052
Turn the music up.

437
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,274
Come on, you boring bastards.

438
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:18,333
Can I interest you ladies in
a "cooked to perfection" burger?

439
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:24,177
Don't think so.

440
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:31,899
Hey, babes. Did you miss me?

441
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,238
- D'you want me to ask everyone
to leave? - Thanks, Thomas.

442
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:04,895
What's the point?

443
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,989
It's all fucked anyway.

444
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:16,461
What the fuck
are you doing, Emily?

445
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,997
Emily, fucking stop this shit now!

446
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,323
Naomi, darling, am I
making you nice and wet?

447
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:41,961
Fuck you!
This is a fucking pantomime.

448
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,372
Fuck you right back.

449
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:47,811
Ems, stop it.

450
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,173
Stay out of this.

451
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,392
What? Want to fuck her, is that it?

452
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,292
Maybe I do. So what?

453
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,767
That's enough!

454
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:59,208
What's this all about?

455
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:04,607
It's none of your business.

456
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:08,037
I fucked the dead girl.

457
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:12,714
I fucked Sophia
and gave her the drugs

458
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:15,096
and now she's punishing me for it.

459
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:17,365
I knew you'd screw her up.

460
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,599
Hey! Good news, everyone.

461
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,636
I found us a caravan.

462
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:24,780
What have I missed?

463
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:26,897
Why don't you all
just fuck off?

464
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,579
Look at you.

465
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:33,119
Pretending to be happy families,
pretending to love each other.

466
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:35,802
Don't you dare speak to me like that.

467
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:37,296
Get off your high horse.

468
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:40,607
I can't... I can't be here any more.

469
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,705
Bit melodramatic.

470
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,755
Remind you of anyone?

471
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,296
Stop it!

472
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:58,034
Come on, son.

473
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:03,947
Em...

474
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:48,290
I'm coming, I've just got to...
I'll catch up with you.

475
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:49,204
See ya later!

476
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:57,516
Merde! Sorry!

477
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:01,222
Ah! Super merde!

478
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:02,489
JJ!

479
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:03,722
Emily!

480
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:06,469
JJ!

481
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:13,649
I think they've all gone out.

482
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:15,108
Bollocks.

483
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,495
You gonna stand there
till they get back?

484
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,881
Yes, yes, I'll get you
a towel and...

485
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,362
...Putain!

486
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,451
Just sit down.

487
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:38,550
Bit of a pickle!

488
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,531
Do you think I'm a bitch, Thomas?

489
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:58,322
I think you are Katie.
You should always be you.

490
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:04,321
You're strong and...

491
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:07,757
I'm just too aggressive,
just like my fucking mum.

492
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:12,114
I know it. I am a bitch.

493
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:15,312
Everyone relies on you
to tell the truth, Katie.

494
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:17,092
They need you.

495
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:24,284
That thing you do - is it for real?

496
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,448
What thing?

497
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:31,849
The lovely honourable thing.

498
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:35,905
I'm not.

499
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,737
I screw up so often.

500
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,638
Panda, college...

501
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,712
...everything.

502
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:47,360
Right now I'm Monsieur Screw.

503
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:10,277
D'you fancy me?

504
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,714
Just checking.

505
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:13,117
Of course.

506
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,528
I can't have kids.

507
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,453
They say I can't have kids...

508
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,844
...ever.

509
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:39,259
And you're sad?

510
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:44,749
You think maybe no man
will ever want you?

511
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:51,670
But I am a man, and I think you're
a beautiful, magnificent woman.

512
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,547
Panda was an idiot
not to forgive you.

513
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,300
I was the idiot.

514
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:02,857
I wasn't honourable.

515
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,838
We can be friends.

516
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,804
Yes, I'd like that.

517
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,402
Me too.

518
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:56,460
Give me five minutes.

519
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,166
Mum?

520
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,870
Mum... I can't have children.

521
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:37,961
I went to the doctor's yesterday and
they said there's nothing they can do.

522
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:46,206
I wanted to tell you,
but you were too busy shouting.

523
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,408
It's all about you.

524
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:52,754
I don't want to let you down,

525
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,929
but you let me down.

526
00:40:58,313 --> 00:41:00,895
I really needed you
and you weren't there.

527
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,190
My baby girl.

528
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,119
It doesn't matter, Mum.

529
00:41:06,154 --> 00:41:09,021
The house and the money.
I don't want it.

530
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:13,029
I'm not going to be you.

531
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:17,326
I just want a mum who loves me,
no matter what.

532
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:20,212
I do love you, no matter what.

533
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:23,418
I'm so sorry.

534
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:26,841
And we love you, Mum.

535
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:28,992
So appreciate us.

536
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:32,069
Stop trying to push us away.

537
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,329
Jen.

538
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:51,933
I love you.

539
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:01,049
You stupid bastard!

540
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:03,888
I'm sorry.

541
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:31,763
They're using tongues
and everything.
