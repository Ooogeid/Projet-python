00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:03,040
<i>The game is on, Freddie.
You wanna play?</i>

2
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:04,920
- Don't be stupid.
- <i>Me, you and JJ.</i>

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,722
- <i>Best mates for life.</i>
- I'm tired of you.

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,920
- What's that mean?
- I can't look after you any more.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,160
<i>We're friends cos you don't surf'n'turf
my men. You said that.</i>

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,560
He's not yours.
He'll never belong to anyone.

7
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,040
I've told you, OK?

8
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:18,440
Now you know.

9
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,054
<i>- Please make up with Freddie.
- Freddie can fuck himself.</i>

10
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:22,320
Just care. OK?

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,120
- About what?
- About me, you twat!

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,760
- You're all fucking twats!
- <i>Hit me.</i>

13
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:28,768
Ready?

14
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:32,600
- Where are we going?
- It's you and me, babe.

15
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:35,871
It's always gonna be you and me.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,920
Transcript: chocolate

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,760
Synch: Arrow, Breys, Walid20-101

18
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,701
- Morning, slugger.
- Where are we?

19
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:24,605
Thought you were the man
with the plan.

20
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,101
I am.

21
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:30,705
I am.

22
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,849
I am.

23
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:40,487
It's been weeks, Cook.
One small shitty town after another.

24
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,749
It's not about the destination.

25
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:44,800
It's about the journey.

26
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,560
'09 Bonnie and Clyde.

27
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,038
Outlaw tour of Britain.

28
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:51,444
I'm serious, Cook.

29
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:53,852
Where are we going?

30
00:03:58,348 --> 00:03:59,398
We're here.

31
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:02,280
This is it.

32
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:05,440
- Here?
- Here. This town.

33
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,097
Why?

34
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,132
Because this is where my dad lives.

35
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,174
Aren't you coming with me?

36
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:51,573
Not yet.

37
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:55,788
But I want you to meet him.
I brought you here to meet him.

38
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,036
I will.

39
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,200
But I think
you need to meet him first.

40
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:02,252
Don't be a pussy.

41
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,151
Be careful.

42
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,377
Ladies and germs,

43
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,599
the fucking Milky Bars are on me.

44
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,586
Drinks all round, yeah?

45
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
Everyone, the fruit of my looms.

46
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,615
My fucking son.

47
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,831
And this is
his very lovely ladyfriend.

48
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,735
Pints and shots over here, <i>monsieur</i>,

49
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:23,560
and make it snappy,
my mouth's as dry as a nun's.

50
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:27,120
Have a view at the only copper
for 40 miles.

51
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,119
Do what you like. Smoke inside.

52
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,134
Ash on the fucking floor,
see if anyone bats an eyelid.

53
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:36,142
In fact... piss on it.

54
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:40,093
There's a couple of old boys
would pay top dollar to see that.

55
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,737
This ain't Kansas any more, Toto.

56
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:46,000
- Out here you are free as fuck.
- A-fucking-men.

57
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,565
Right, here we go.

58
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:54,509
You get one round
on account of your lad being here.

59
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,480
Donald, how am I meant
to clear my tab?

60
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:02,167
Your wife's away so much
I hardly get a chance to see to her.

61
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
That's £345...

62
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:07,855
23 pence.

63
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,406
"That's £345 pounds... 23 pence."

64
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:15,919
Dick.

65
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,040
The only thing that matters
to shitheads like him is money.

66
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:20,922
It's a fucking disgrace, Dad.

67
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,560
I mean, there's got to be more
to life than that, am I right?

68
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,997
Like what?

69
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,722
- Fucking.
- Shagging.

70
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,840
Great minds, Son.

71
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:31,200
Great minds.

72
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,923
Everyone knows the best things
in life are free.

73
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,220
Never a truer word, Dad.

74
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,679
Can't believe it.

75
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,360
This.

76
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,432
Feels all right, don't it?
Me and you,

77
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,384
back together. At last.

78
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,508
I'm like a dog with two dicks!

79
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,533
There's nothing more important

80
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:59,089
than blood.

81
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,427
Isn't that right, princess?

82
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,539
I can't find item 47758 anywhere.

83
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,442
Someone's made
a very inconvenient error.

84
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,252
If we have to go
through all the 477s

85
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:38,939
I'm going to be piqued,
not to mention vexed.

86
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,520
Especially if someone's...

87
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,671
- You all right?
- Yep, don't worry.

88
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,920
My back and skull
cushioned the fall.

89
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,060
Here's item 47758.

90
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:01,597
I told you to be more careful
on the step ladder, J.

91
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:03,820
Stupid old useless, mental me.

92
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:06,784
You're not useless, just...

93
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:12,080
Who loses a toilet seat on a bus?

94
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,920
The 477s are all from trains.

95
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,626
Have you got{\, like some kind of} a problem with me?

96
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:24,560
I just wish you wouldn't smoke
so much weed while we're working.

97
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,792
- Why? They don't care.
- It's just a bit boring sometimes.

98
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,108
Are you saying I'm boring?

99
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:39,284
Right, so what's next on the list?

100
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:42,186
- Look, Fred, sorry.
- It's fine.

101
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,920
- Please, I'm sorry, Fred.
- It's... fine.

102
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,280
For flip's sake!
Stop saying it's fine!

103
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,277
It's not fine! Nothing's fine!
It's all... smegged, OK?

104
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,480
You're really getting the hang
of this swearing stuff.

105
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:53,809
How about this, then?

106
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:57,359
I mother-fucking, fanny-farting,
cock-munching resign!

107
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,934
- {\What do you mean }You're quitting? You can't quit.
- I can.

108
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:02,614
I learned from the best.

109
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,042
You've still got the toilet seat.

110
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,240
Are you... Effy's friend?

111
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,690
I think so. Are you her mum?

112
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:33,720
Can I sit?

113
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:41,256
JJ, right? The magician.

114
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,076
I used to do magic.

115
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:47,186
- Not any more, though.
- I used to be married.

116
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,999
Not any more, though.

117
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:57,078
Pick a card, any card.

118
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:59,214
I thought you gave up.

119
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:03,080
Some things are quite hard
to let go of.

120
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,717
Effy likes magic.

121
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,396
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, not the...

122
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:14,227
you know, stupid abracadabra sort.

123
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,934
I'm so sorry.

124
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,549
It's OK.

125
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:19,987
I've come to terms with the facts.

126
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,860
You know...

127
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,600
She was four years old the first time
she beat me at hide and seek.

128
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Four!

129
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,431
I was looking for her for hours.

130
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,710
When I finally found her...

131
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:34,736
she just smiled.

132
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,280
You know that Effy smile?

133
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:39,571
That means...

134
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,760
"You don't know me at all.

135
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,602
"And you never will."

136
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:47,760
See, that's a kind of magic.

137
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,774
She's so good
at concealing things and...

138
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:55,459
hiding,

139
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:56,951
avoiding.

140
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,432
But I do know her.

141
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:08,129
And I know that she has got
so much love in her heart...

142
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,986
that the thought of...
letting it out,

143
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,446
showing her cards...

144
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,505
it scares her to death.

145
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,084
I never knew it would be possible

146
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:28,944
to miss someone this much.

147
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:47,360
Go on, Dad! Come on, all the way!
All the way, Dad!

148
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,484
Go on, Dad!

149
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,619
Excellent. Piece of piss.

150
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:55,739
Have that!

151
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,560
He's done most of it.

152
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,360
Don't be a twat, give him his prize.

153
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
The whole jar, we said.

154
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,481
All right.

155
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:17,947
Nice. Ease you in.

156
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,735
There she goes.

157
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:23,924
Get in!

158
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,066
There you go.
One half-pint of bitter,

159
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,154
you sad little man.

160
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,621
Right! Time!

161
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:50,092
Everyone either head down the club
or fuck off home!

162
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,097
I'm gonna have to neck it now.

163
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,280
How about that, boys?

164
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:32,252
All right?

165
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:34,800
What you doin'?

166
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,120
Not sure.

167
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:40,960
What you doin' tomorrow?

168
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:45,205
It's the solstice steeplechase.
Come down and watch.

169
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:47,092
- The what?
- It's a race.

170
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:48,717
Old village tradition.

171
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,840
I'm champion, three years running.

172
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,080
- Aren't I, lads?
- Whoop-de-do.

173
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,880
You know, if you were my girl,

174
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,804
I wouldn't let you out of my sight.

175
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:05,483
I'd handcuff you to the bed an' all.

176
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:13,014
- Those things'll kill you, you know.
- Hadn't heard.

177
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:14,538
That's funny,

178
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,832
You can put it on your tombstone.

179
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,318
So, what, you don't smoke?

180
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,400
Drink?

181
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:23,153
Nothing?

182
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:24,648
We're straight-edge.

183
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,675
I don't let the pressure
crush me up.

184
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:33,920
You've got to look after yourself.

185
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:35,680
Know what I mean?

186
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,200
Come on. We're going clubbin'.
You, me and Dad.

187
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,920
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

188
00:15:57,909 --> 00:15:59,720
Let's just go, now.

189
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:04,026
Listen, there's nowhere else to go.

190
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,649
This is it.

191
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,084
And it's fucking brilliant!

192
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:12,484
Come on, let's go get fucked up.

193
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,492
So what d'you think of her, then?

194
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:44,612
Very tidy.

195
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:46,640
Nice pins,

196
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,130
quality tits

197
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,840
and an arse like two snooker balls
in a sock. Marvellous!

198
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,819
I'd ride that to hell and back.

199
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,506
Looks like I'll have to get
in the fucking queue, though.

200
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,640
No, I'm gonna keep her, you know.

201
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,084
She's mine.

202
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:06,080
No cunt's taking her away from me.

203
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:12,757
I reckon some cunt already did.

204
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,360
What? You fucking prick!

205
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:03,600
Full moon.

206
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,986
When the full moon rises...

207
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:14,922
gods

208
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,840
and monsters will come out to play.

209
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,105
So how does it feel?

210
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,840
To have everyone want you?

211
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:34,116
That Donny's desperate
to get into your pants.

212
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:38,009
Are you gonna let him?

213
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,133
What about me?

214
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,761
You gonna let me into your pants?

215
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,276
Too pretty for your own good.

216
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,428
That's why you destroy
everything you touch.

217
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:03,554
Look who's talking.

218
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,153
I'm Guns N' Roses, love.

219
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:08,360
I've got an appetite
for destruction.

220
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:10,903
You're not his dad.

221
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,375
Not really.

222
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,768
And you're not his girlfriend.

223
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:16,264
Not really.

224
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,400
You're gonna fucking snap
that boy's heart in two.

225
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,640
And you've been doing it to him
every day of his life.

226
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,907
Where do you think you're going?

227
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,027
Nowhere.

228
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:31,955
JJ's here.

229
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,704
Sorry, it's just...

230
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:42,270
Facebook really needs
to hear about this.

231
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,937
- I wanted to say something.
- Maybe I'll turn this off first, yeah?

232
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,607
You can look now.

233
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,027
- So what's up? I thought you'd quit.
- I can't quit.

234
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:01,317
You can't quit.

235
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,222
None of us can.

236
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,975
We're still the Musketeers.
We do stuff.

237
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,360
- What are we supposed to do?
- We're supposed to find them.

238
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,840
- We're supposed to sort this mess out.
- There's nothing to sort out.

239
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:14,484
Really?

240
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,427
What is this number?

241
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:34,573
Who is this?

242
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,462
Cook's in trouble.

243
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,258
He needs your help.

244
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,527
<i>You need to come get him, right?</i>

245
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,747
Why can't you help him?

246
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:51,823
Because I love you.

247
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:00,408
Where's Effy?

248
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:06,198
No idea.

249
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
She must have fucked off
{\sometime }during the night.

250
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
What?

251
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,903
Probably jealous of you and me.

252
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,631
- We've got to find her.
- Never mind, she'll be back.

253
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:23,401
How do you know?

254
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:28,725
She's in a small town,

255
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:31,855
she's got fuck-all money
and she's got no car.

256
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,120
Anyway, fanny's fanny.

257
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:36,160
Family's family.

258
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,052
I've got an idea that's going to
take this town by fucking storm.

259
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,418
But I need you with me 100%. Yeah?

260
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:55,347
- Right, when we get in there...
- You do the talking.

261
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:58,440
- Great minds, son. Great minds.
- Yeah, Dad.

262
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:03,477
- I've missed "Dad".
- Fuck off, Dad!

263
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,085
Place looks cracking, Donald.

264
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:17,034
What time's Binkie the Clown
serving up jelly and ice cream?

265
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:20,320
Piss off, you. You're never getting
a drink in here, ever.

266
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:22,431
Fucking hell, Donald.

267
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:25,096
Your customer service has gone
right out the window.

268
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,989
They'd never stand
for that in the States.

269
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,966
You want to sod off to America,
Cook, be my guest.

270
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,640
I'll even buy your ticket.

271
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,284
But if I left, Donald,
I'd never be able to pay off me debt.

272
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:38,704
How are you ever gonna pay me back?

273
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:41,760
Little wager.

274
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,600
Wonderful. Do tell.

275
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:45,440
My boy here...

276
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,800
is gonna enter your steeplechase.

277
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,156
That...

278
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,679
is...

279
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:56,960
good news.

280
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:00,994
No-one was even bothering
to enter against Donny this year.

281
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,252
Fucking hell!

282
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:07,577
- What's the bet?
- If my boy wins,

283
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:11,786
you drop the debt, like Bono wants
for them starving Africans.

284
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,230
Fine. But if...

285
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:15,719
he...

286
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,839
loses...

287
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,520
I get your boat

288
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:28,647
and you...

289
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,040
fuck off out of town.

290
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
You're fucking on.

291
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,480
Beat you later, then.

292
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:49,655
What a shithole.

293
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,822
This was the area code.

294
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,020
So what do you reckon?

295
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,770
Shall we...

296
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,678
have a look around town, do you think,
try and find that phone box?

297
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,175
No, we'll stay here.

298
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:20,160
- How do you know they'll be here?
- They're coming. OK? They have to.

299
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:23,694
What the fuck are you doing here?

300
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:26,560
What the fuck are you doing here?

301
00:27:27,017 --> 00:27:30,400
- We thought you might be in trouble.
- Do I look like I'm in trouble?

302
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,454
I'm 10 times better
than you've ever been,

303
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:37,760
you pair of miserable,
boring shites.

304
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:43,346
Where is she?

305
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,815
Right.
That's why you came.

306
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:50,498
Fucking hell. You don't know
when you're fucking beat, do you?

307
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,280
- Guys, this isn't how it's supposed...
- How did you find me?

308
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:04,520
She called him.
But... just stop this, right?

309
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,824
Listen to me, please.

310
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:07,994
- JJ, stop it.
- Fuck off, JJ.

311
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
OK, then.

312
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,035
You know, flipping...
flip the both of you, then. Fuck-turds!

313
00:28:15,993 --> 00:28:17,635
- Enter the race.
- You what?

314
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:18,873
Enter the race.

315
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:21,440
The winner gets to keep her.
For ever.

316
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:24,376
- You're a child.
- You're a pussy.

317
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:27,765
- Come on, let's fucking settle this.
- In a race?

318
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:30,443
You got any other ideas?

319
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:35,797
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

320
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:40,040
<i>welcome to the annual
solstice steeplechase.</i>

321
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,680
<i>From time immemorial,</i>

322
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:47,839
<i>this race has typified
the spirit of our town,</i>

323
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:50,080
<i>tough, uncompromising,</i>

324
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:51,913
<i>hard.</i>

325
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:55,757
<i>Many have attempted the challenge.
Few have succeeded.</i>

326
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:57,862
<i>It's winner-takes-all...</i>

327
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:00,168
- You do it.
- He might be, Cook.

328
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:03,347
<i>Allow me to introduce
the reigning champion,</i>

329
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,986
<i>my son, Donny Donaldson.</i>

330
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:20,849
Who's that bellend?

331
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,320
<i>Not since the first time,</i>

332
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,040
<i>since Kriss Akabusi graced us
with his presence,</i>

333
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,706
<i>we have outsiders in the race,</i>

334
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:32,926
<i>so I'd better explain the rules.</i>

335
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:36,745
<i>Once round the village.
First one back here is the winner.</i>

336
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
<i>And if you drop your elder,</i>

337
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,280
<i>you're out, and, we give you
a bit of a shoeing, lads.</i>

338
00:29:57,954 --> 00:29:59,655
<i>Elders, assemble.</i>

339
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,906
<i>Choose your riders.</i>

340
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,400
<i>Elders, mount.</i>

341
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:19,800
<i>On your marks...</i>

342
00:30:20,874 --> 00:30:21,874
<i>set...</i>

343
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:23,797
<i>go!</i>

344
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:35,468
I think I'll chop up your boat
and use it for firewood.

345
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:38,440
Come on, son!

346
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,792
<i>Come on, Donny! Away, man!</i>

347
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,480
You dropped her!

348
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,875
Fuck you!

349
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:29,085
- Why did you stop, mate?
- He fucking elbowed me.

350
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:30,205
So?

351
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,840
- That's not fair, is it?
- Fair?

352
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,986
What do you think this is?

353
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,256
Enid Blyton?

354
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,293
- <i>Come on, son!</i>
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

355
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:13,911
Come on!

356
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,364
You twat!

357
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:46,860
Crap, you were.

358
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,519
This is my race!

359
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:03,973
Mine!

360
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:18,710
Tell your dad
that I'll be there in the morning

361
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,939
to collect me winnings.

362
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,170
Fucking dick!

363
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,920
You've lost my dad's boat, Effy...
I've got fuck all now, you...

364
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,786
This is the wushu finger hold.

365
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:39,040
I learnt it in a book.
Of a film.

366
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:41,327
J, let's just leave it now...

367
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,063
I'm pretty sure if I apply
the correct pressure, your eyes pop out.

368
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,289
J, my eyes aren't gonna pop out.

369
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,005
Do you really want
to take that chance?

370
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:00,391
Let's not air our dirty
laundry in public, boys.

371
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:02,668
You, too.

372
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:09,180
Not you, loser.

373
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:16,400
Take a seat, Ef.

374
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,400
JJ, mate...

375
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:22,151
Now, let's get down to it.

376
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:23,760
No more evasion.

377
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:26,913
No more,
"Ooh, I'm so fit and mysterious."

378
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:28,371
Now,

379
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,520
Freddie he's in love with you.

380
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:32,609
Aren't you, Freddie?

381
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,240
Aren't you, Freddie?

382
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:36,657
And Cook,

383
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:38,126
he loves you, yes?

384
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:43,722
And just for the record,
I love you, too.

385
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:45,874
Plus... I won the race.

386
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,706
So, three boys, one girl.

387
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:53,800
It's an insoluble equation,
unless you choose.

388
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,010
Then we can finally
get back to our lives.

389
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:13,320
Fuck all of you.
Your Prince Charming made a bet on you

390
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,255
said whoever wins the race
gets to keep you. Classy?

391
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,140
Effy, I didn't know.
Cook, stay.

392
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,929
No, I'm not living
on my fucking knees any more.

393
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:23,680
Cook, we can solve this.

394
00:35:24,645 --> 00:35:26,253
Stay here you two.

395
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:37,349
What did you expect?

396
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,326
You made this a game first.

397
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:45,724
Remember that stupid fucking list?

398
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:49,245
You made this happen.

399
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,560
And it's all your fault
this is all so fucked up.

400
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:54,049
- I know.
- You know?

401
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:56,404
What sort of fucking answer's that?

402
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,200
The only one I've got.

403
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:18,338
You all think...

404
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:22,345
You all think that I'm scum
that you're better than me,

405
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:25,080
that you're better than my dad.

406
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,388
I'm not better than your dad.

407
00:36:28,508 --> 00:36:29,508
You are.

408
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
You're better than someone who runs away
from the people who love them.

409
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,400
Who need them.

410
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,969
Fuck off, man. You daft boon!

411
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:43,760
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to drink myself to death.

412
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:47,767
Then I'm going to say sorry to me dad.
Then life finally begins.

413
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,727
I thought we was gonna take
this town by storm, you and me.

414
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:26,922
I'm not letting
that twat take my boat.

415
00:38:27,283 --> 00:38:28,800
Can't I just come with you, then?

416
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:34,196
Look, I didn't ask for this.

417
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:40,000
I didn't ask you to turn up here.
There's no fucking space.

418
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,952
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me the keys.

419
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,174
Let me tell you something, James.

420
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:11,249
I never fucking wanted you
in the first place.

421
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:18,494
So give me the keys
and get off the fucking boat.

422
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,480
Give me the fucking keys!

423
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:55,693
Now, give Daddy the keys,
or I'm gonna melt your fucking face off!

424
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:01,360
Be sensible, son.
I'll fucking do it.

425
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,294
I'll fucking do it!

426
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,600
I don't give a fuck.

427
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:07,986
I don't, either.

428
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:28,400
This is bad.

429
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:31,337
Fuck!

430
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:35,979
Cook, are you all right?

431
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:40,400
He didn't mean it.

432
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:45,040
What's the fucking difference?
Nothing good ever stays with me.

433
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,269
Absolutely nothing.

434
00:40:50,986 --> 00:40:52,240
You've got me.

435
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:11,149
I can't believe
we just went granny racing.

436
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,080
I had it all planned out, man.

437
00:41:20,506 --> 00:41:22,150
Get a boat of our own,

438
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,475
moor it down here,

439
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
a job,

440
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,214
everything.

441
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:31,721
- But she doesn't love me.
- She does.

442
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,528
- I know she does.
- She loves you better.

443
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,168
I was with her last night.
Do you understand?

444
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,637
So you know
what I've come here to ask you.

445
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,590
Cook, please...

446
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:56,628
Please just say it's OK.

447
00:42:00,928 --> 00:42:01,928
I can't.

448
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,979
I just can't.

449
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm sorry. I just fucking love her.

450
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm sorry.

451
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,600
- I fucking love her.
- But we can't share, can we?

452
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,288
Right, there you are.

453
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:40,400
What's up?

454
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:45,560
On balance, I'd say he was alive.

455
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,240
Great.

456
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:51,679
Should we like tie him up?

457
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:55,898
A bump to the head like that, you don't
want to interrupt the blood flow.

458
00:42:56,018 --> 00:42:57,000
I dunno, J.

459
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,800
Right, we'll dump him later.

460
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,610
Everyone wrap up warm.

461
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:05,666
What are you doing?

462
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,657
"We" are going home.

463
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,760
We can't nick the boat,
this is ridiculous.

464
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
This is 17 years worth
of birthday and Christmas presents.

465
00:43:21,578 --> 00:43:24,230
Cook, start the engine, please.
We need to leave quite quickly.

466
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,920
- Why?
- Too late.

467
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,720
- Look.
- Get out of my boat!

468
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,867
Get on the boat. Go, go.

469
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,920
- Get that engine started, OK?
- Hurry up, Fred.

470
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,400
Help me push it out.

471
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Hurry up!

472
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,800
Get out of my boat!

473
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,770
- Get it started. Come on!
- JJ, help him, will you?

474
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,000
Wanker!

475
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:02,718
Wankers!

476
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,160
It's all right, you little fucks.

477
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,063
Wankers!

478
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:17,848
You shit, I'll find you!
I'll find you!

479
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:23,160
Fuck you!

480
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:26,336
I'm Cook, you shithead!

481
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:27,720
I'm Cook!

482
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:32,840
Come here.

483
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,760
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, son.

484
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,640
I'm Cook, you fuckers!

485
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:43,955
Cook!

486
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,137
I'm Cook.

487
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,640
Fuck you! Fuck you!

488
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Fuck you!

489
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:30,744
So...

490
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:32,939
What do we do now?
