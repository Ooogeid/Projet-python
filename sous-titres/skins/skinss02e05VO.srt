1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,760
Where were we?
Michelle's annoyed with you.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,680
Yeah, because my willy's gone
wonky and I'm a little bit mad.

3
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:08,440
OK. Anwar's acting weird.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,060
If I didn't know any better

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,800
I'd say he's fucking
someone secretly.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,280
That's your stalker, Maxxie!

7
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:16,400
And you went to Scotland
to see Cassie

8
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:19,959
and think she's off shagging
some Scottish guy named Lachlan.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,200
Women, you know?

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,760
- And my dad's dead.
- Bummer.

11
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:25,319
Chris, got anything to offer?

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,799
Bubbles... go up,

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,480
and up and up and then...

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,160
- ... disappear.
- Hello, Sid.

15
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:38,903
Poof.

16
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,348
CHRIS

17
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,919
Let me see, Chris. Chris Miles?

18
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,679
Ah, just a minute...

19
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
Ah, good.

20
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,959
Chris. In life,
we're all walking down a path.

21
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,559
And when that path lacks direction,
that's when people get lost.

22
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,319
And we don't like lost people,

23
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,423
because no-one should get
left behind. Are you following me?

24
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,599
I'm a bit lost.

25
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,360
So glad we agree.

26
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm afraid you can't
take your exams here.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,264
Are you saying I'm being expelled?

28
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,759
I prefer the term "no longer
permanently affiliated."

29
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:58,239
- Why?
- It's less discouraging.

30
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,879
No. Why am I being kicked out?

31
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:03,024
Let's take a look, shall we?

32
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:06,306
The nurse's office. Three days ago.

33
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,118
I had a headache.

34
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,803
Are you peeing on the science block?

35
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:15,019
Nope.

36
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,925
That's my desk.

37
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,439
That's not even me.

38
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:30,864
- Ah, this is invasion of privacy!
- I'll cut to the chase.

39
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,605
We've no coursework from you
and the exams are about to start.

40
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:34,919
You're a shit student.

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,548
Your inevitably shit results
will affect my averages,

42
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:40,399
and I'll be swimming in a river
of shit and I didn't pack a snorkel.

43
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,910
We'll send you a letter saying when
you have to leave your student flat.

44
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,319
Look, this isn't right... Just...

45
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,632
Wah-wah!

46
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:51,021
Welcome to the real world.

47
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,399
Chris?

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,920
Chris!

49
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,119
Come on, Chris.

50
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:05,671
Wanna hear a joke?
What do you call nacho cheese?

51
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,569
Oh, shit. I got that wrong.

52
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,319
Shelley.

53
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,359
How does that nacho cheese joke go?

54
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,201
Right...

55
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,680
Right. OK. Bye!

56
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,919
What do you call cheese
that doesn't belong to you?

57
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,441
Nacho cheese?

58
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:27,759
Have you heard it before?

59
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,569
I've got nothing, absolutely nothing.

60
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,239
It's not all that bad.

61
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,679
I've been kicked out of college,

62
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,098
I'm homeless

63
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,760
and I'm never going to see
Angie ever again.

64
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,879
Oh, dry your eyes, Princess.

65
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,919
Huh?

66
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,639
Maybe you should stop being such
a pussy and get off your arse

67
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,279
and go do something about it.

68
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,479
Oh, fuck it.

69
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:00,281
Right. Saying "fuck it"
works for you, then?

70
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,579
Not really.

71
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,039
Then maybe you should,
you know, try.

72
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,487
I do try!

73
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,800
- Don't I?
- No!

74
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,359
That's all you ever say - no.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,839
- No way!
- Ah-ha! See? There you go.

76
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,887
Always saying no.
No to pills, to parties...

77
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,119
to me putting my hand on your gooch.

78
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,919
OK. OK.

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,211
So let's make a deal.

80
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:29,559
I'll start saying "yes",
and you stop saying "fuck it".

81
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,479
I'm gonna have to have that in
writing, I'm afraid. Use your pen.

82
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,079
Who says I've got a pen?

83
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,559
Jal...

84
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,879
will you buy me a falafel?

85
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:04,999
Yes.

86
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,439
Bollocks.

87
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:18,919
So, Derek,
let's see what we've got left.

88
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,672
Slough Metropolitan University,
Abergavenny Tech,

89
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,609
Cambridge Ringroad University...

90
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,240
Come in!

91
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,599
Bad time?

92
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,599
Derek needs to go away,
have a nice sit down

93
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,640
and consider his UCAS options.

94
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,199
Right, I've been to
the Job Centre, yeah...

95
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:57,439
And they're a bit...
well, they're all just fu...

96
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:58,839
Fuddy-duddies.

97
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:01,239
Yeah! They are fuddy-duddies.

98
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,679
Right. They're like, "Just
queue up here, fill in this box here,

99
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,719
"don't steal that."
It's a load of cra...

100
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,519
Cranberry juice!
Do you want cranberry juice?

101
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,629
Thanks.

102
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,879
Anyway, yeah, there's one lady there,
I've never met such a big fat bi...

103
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,079
Biscuit! Do you want a biscuit?

104
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:26,025
How can I help?

105
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,999
Well, I was thinking.

106
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,067
Seeing as you're a careers officer...

107
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:36,544
... I thought you could...

108
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:38,559
you know...

109
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:43,879
... help me get a job.

110
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,879
Oh! Yeah! Totally!

111
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,439
Yeah? Fucking ace!

112
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,040
Chris!... Swearing.

113
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,519
Let's get you a job!

114
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,399
What happened, Chris?

115
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,319
There's loads of these Chinese
lads flipping burgers there.

116
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:02,759
Me and Han Li
were having a spliff break,

117
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,479
and then Paul, the shift manager,
comes along.

118
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,359
And she said, "You can't do that."

119
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,199
Why not? It's pucking hard
getting people to talk to you.

120
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,966
I mean child abuse, it's a bit
depressing. So my theory was,

121
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:18,499
reel them in with the free porn,
then get to the serious stuff.

122
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:22,087
So I said, "Why can't people
bring their own glasses to the bar?"

123
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,959
No wonder this country's
turning obese.

124
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,363
But Morris said that was the job, and
if I didn't like it, I could puck off.

125
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:30,399
So I told him he was a
pitty boss and a pastard

126
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,960
and he could pucking shove his pub
polo up his pap's-eye, stupid prick.

127
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,022
I think one slipped
through there, Chris.

128
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,119
Stupid punt.

129
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:42,719
What are you going to do?

130
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:48,440
Do you remember them colouring-in
books when you were little, Jos?

131
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:50,759
I hated them.

132
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,873
If I'm going to do a picture
of a house,

133
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:55,626
I don't want someone else
telling me what it should look like.

134
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,619
I hate this conformist,
repressive society

135
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:14,302
and its stupid culture of conformity,
right.

136
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:16,990
You know, everybody listens
to the same plastic music

137
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,412
and does the same plastic job,

138
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,640
and dresses the same plastic way.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,770
- I know, man. I know.
- Totally.

140
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:27,320
I mean, you're cool
because you've got drugs.

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,736
But most people just haven't got
a clue how they come across.

142
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:32,719
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, that's right.

143
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,880
Look at this guy.
He is so mainstream.

144
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:40,440
I mean, nobody thinks
for themselves any more.

145
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:43,440
Individuality is dead.

146
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,266
Originality is a dirty word.

147
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:51,939
I mean, the only original thing left
to do is get totally fucking wasted.

148
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,179
Like us.

149
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,320
Go for it, man.

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
What are you doing?

151
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,917
Shotguns! You gotta try this.

152
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:05,210
What's up with your hair?

153
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,641
Why? Don't you like it?

154
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,277
No. No, no, no. It's fine. Really.

155
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,378
Right. Enough bollocks.

156
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:18,520
Time to get drunk.

157
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Your turn.

158
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,253
Man like me don't even like beer but
I'm brap-brapping this all day, blood.

159
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,845
Brap brap brap.

160
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,560
OK. Yes.

161
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:39,120
Brap brap brap!

162
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Fuck off!

163
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,681
Come, come, try again.

164
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:46,783
No!

165
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,581
What was that? No?

166
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,339
I don't have to say
yes to everything.

167
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,987
Um, I think you do.

168
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,480
Yo, that guy's hat is nang!

169
00:09:57,383 --> 00:09:59,080
His hat game is strong.

170
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,901
Why don't you go get his hat for An?

171
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,019
What?

172
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,139
Go get his hat. Go on.

173
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:14,280
Easy peasy.

174
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:08,089
What?

175
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,560
Oh, my God! It's Cassie!

176
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,720
So what happened in Scotland? Did
you eat loads of deep-fried shit?

177
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,120
Did you get me a kilt?

178
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,040
Not an actual deep-fried shit.
But, you know.

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Hi.

180
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,059
So how was it?

181
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,507
Oh, it was just... life.

182
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:57,032
But I want to hear all your gossip.

183
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:59,480
When did you two first
get together, by the way?

184
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,320
By his hospital bed?

185
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,769
Don't you know?

186
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,040
Lovely Sid and
lovely Michelle are fucking.

187
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,400
We're not...

188
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,752
Not in the way you're thinking,
anyway.

189
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,690
Don't lie, Sid.

190
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,720
I know your dad's dead,
but you can't just go around

191
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,710
doing whatever you want.

192
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,022
What's going on?

193
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:44,470
Cassie just said that Sid
and Michelle are doing it.

194
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,324
But Tony didn't know.
And neither did I. Or Chris.

195
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:49,040
Or Maxxie. Or you. Probably.

196
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,270
But, hey. Hey!

197
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,566
Cassie's back! Woo!

198
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,031
Tone...

199
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,339
Listen, Jal...

200
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,939
Why didn't you tell me?

201
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:13,484
It's awkward.

202
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:15,768
If you can't talk to your
best mate about it, then...

203
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,862
maybe it's not awkward
but completely fucking shit.

204
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,680
Do you want to get out of here?

205
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,920
It's beautiful here.

206
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:43,163
That was mental,
what you did tonight.

207
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,140
Brilliant mental.

208
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:47,124
Yeses are good.

209
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,220
Yeah. Yeses are good.

210
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes.

211
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,822
Yes.

212
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,363
Don't forget your side.

213
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:59,384
Oh, I haven't. I made
50 quid off that powder tonight

214
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,530
so, er, life's looking up.

215
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,720
Where you going?

216
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,600
That's cheating.
I hate cheats, Chris.

217
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,920
My dad's a cheat.

218
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,520
What you doing?

219
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:33,480
Play the game, Chris.

220
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:36,681
I am.

221
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,459
There was a note on your door.

222
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,343
What's it say?

223
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:35,594
You've got to leave today.

224
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,499
Shit. Better pack my stuff up, then.

225
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,000
Is that it?

226
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:01,223
Where are you staying?

227
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,380
Oh, you know.

228
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:06,330
Nowhere.

229
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,065
It's fine.

230
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:12,840
See you around, Cass.

231
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,859
Your CV is... unusual.

232
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,239
We don't get many written
on cigarette packets.

233
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:27,499
I like to recycle.

234
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,919
By a few of your GCSE subjects,
you've put a question mark.

235
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,139
- I wasn't sure if they counted.
- Why not?

236
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,080
Because I achieved fail grades.

237
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,777
I see.

238
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,259
So. I'm looking for a trainee.

239
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,859
Somebody good with people, a talker.

240
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:50,150
I'm a talker.
I mean, I've been talking for...

241
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,554
Well, I don't know how long exactly,
but years.

242
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,779
And I know loads of words as well.

243
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,759
Like apivorous, for example.

244
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,439
What's that?

245
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,206
Someone who eat bees.

246
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,880
OK. Er... A little test.

247
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,077
Sell me this cup of tea.

248
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:16,999
Um, right. OK. Tea. It's...

249
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:22,287
... shit. Er...

250
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,559
Would you like to
buy this mug of tea?

251
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
No, thanks.

252
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:35,560
That's an interesting tie, can I...?
Do you mind if I have a little?

253
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,479
Sure I can't offer you that tea?

254
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:40,664
Here!

255
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,607
Right. Fair enough.

256
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,799
Just a teeny note.

257
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:53,320
That won't work with houses, OK?

258
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,990
Yeah, OK.

259
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,719
Everyone,
this is Chris, the new trainee.

260
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
Dave, Sarah, Dominic.

261
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,675
I'll have the papers sent
straight over. Bye-bye.

262
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,225
Goooooooooooo...

263
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:20,619
Brraaazziil caraaa!

264
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,800
Yabba doo-doo.

265
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
And Jon.

266
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,635
The sales table.

267
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,680
I'll let you get your bearings.

268
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,119
So what do you get if you win, then?
A pack of chocolate buttons?

269
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,669
Don't be stupid.

270
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,680
You get a balloon.

271
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,759
Looks like you're not
doing too well there, mate.

272
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:58,599
Yeah, well, first day.

273
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,585
Pah! That's what they all say.

274
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,740
Chris, is it?

275
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,039
Let me give you a bit of advice,
Chris.

276
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,659
I'm the Sir Alec round here, yeah?

277
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,659
Even if you signed Rooney, Ronaldo,
Wright-Philips, Adebayor,

278
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,733
you wouldn't have
the balls to get above me.

279
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,823
I wouldn't sell you
Rooney or Ronaldo, anyway.

280
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,040
Or Wright-Philips.

281
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,159
Or Adebayor. Yeah?

282
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,179
Not really that into football, so...

283
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,496
Poof!

284
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,845
Mrs Smith? Hi there.

285
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:38,960
Yes, looking good for you.

286
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,379
So as I was saying earlier,
the kitchen is a real deal maker.

287
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:48,919
If I could afford a kitchen like this,
my wife would never have left me.

288
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,339
And in here particularly,
we've got huge amounts of LSD.

289
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,172
It's not what you're
thinking, madam.

290
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,480
Light, space,

291
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,084
and drawers.

292
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,316
If you're still humming and hawing,

293
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,559
let me tell you a little secret.

294
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,562
The owners'll accept
20 below the asking.

295
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,453
Have we've got a deal?

296
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,279
I think we do.

297
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:15,495
Thanks.

298
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,506
OK, son. This next place has been
on the market for about a year.

299
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,043
It's spatially challenged so
it's a little tricky to rent.

300
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,616
Ball's in your court.

301
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,229
Don't worry,
it just needs the right patter.

302
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,579
Just wait till you see the kitchen,

303
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:36,392
it's a real deal maker.

304
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:46,568
If I could afford a place like this,
my wife might never have left me!

305
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,808
Whoops.

306
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,353
Sorry. Watch your, er, yeah.

307
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,164
Watch your feet.

308
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:02,393
So, this place
is great for doing LSD.

309
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,289
No, no.

310
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:05,575
Light.

311
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:09,899
Space.

312
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,179
And drawers.

313
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:18,883
Garden.

314
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,179
Can I tell you a secret?

315
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,680
What do you think?

316
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:52,387
Look, we've got electric lights.
On and off.

317
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:55,279
We've got luxury radiators.

318
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,239
We've got, like, four plug sockets!

319
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,274
I mean, imagine,
who'd need that many?

320
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,760
Like, Puff Daddy or someone.

321
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,614
Well, la-di-da.

322
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,709
Sure, it needs some stuff.

323
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,939
But structurally, it's...

324
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,280
<i>Right, you dozy mare.
Get your fucking knickers off!</i>

325
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,439
So you've got a job
and a flat in one day.

326
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,539
Yes, I did.

327
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:28,379
I think that's playing the game.

328
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:29,593
Yes, it is.

329
00:22:30,004 --> 00:22:32,011
I think you deserve a reward.

330
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,679
No?

331
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,720
That word's banned.

332
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:38,854
Reward me.

333
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,265
What? Oh.

334
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:21,799
Oh. Wow.

335
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,075
Thanks for letting me stay, Chris.

336
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:48,383
That's OK.

337
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:50,679
Just for a bit, yeah?

338
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,279
Yeah.

339
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:08,080
Oh, Jal.
Have I shown you the bedroom?

340
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,261
We're gonna have some
mad fun in here, eh, Jal?

341
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:16,359
Yeah. We will.

342
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,400
Yeah, there's gonna be
pills, and pucking and pillows.

343
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,839
Lots of pillows...

344
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,319
Chris and Jal.

345
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:48,079
Jal and Chris.

346
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:51,444
More couples.

347
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:55,556
More and more couples.

348
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,432
Have you ever been in love?

349
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,439
I don't think so.

350
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:10,333
Do you want me
to describe it to you?

351
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,359
OK.

352
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:17,153
Do you remember when you rode
with me in the ambulance

353
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:18,999
after I tried to kill myself?

354
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,436
Of course.

355
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,479
That's what love feels like.

356
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,079
We can arrange that, Mrs Collins.

357
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,279
Yeah... and may I say I'll be sorry
not to be speaking to you every day?

358
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,839
That's right. Yeah.

359
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,199
Yeah, sure, sure.

360
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,170
I'll call your solicitor first thing
in the morning about completion.

361
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,159
Can I have a word?

362
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,679
That's right. Oh, that's marvellous.

363
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,480
Many thanks. Bye-bye.

364
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:54,173
Goooo...

365
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,600
It's just you've
not sold anything yet.

366
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,285
You've been here a while now and...

367
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:04,092
No, no, I understand.

368
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:07,400
If there's anything I can
do to help, just let me know.

369
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,140
A muzzle, maybe?

370
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:13,920
He does sell properties, son.

371
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,877
<i>Fuck off out of here,
you little prick.</i>

372
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,418
Thanks for the duvet cover.

373
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:41,938
That's OK.

374
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:43,748
When you were little,

375
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,457
did you ever use to unbutton
the covers and get inside?

376
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:50,040
When you were young, did you ever
read The Very Hungry Caterpillar?

377
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,720
It's a classic.

378
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,884
It's about this caterpillar, yeah,
and he eats a load of stuff,

379
00:26:56,257 --> 00:27:00,044
and then he gets in a cocoon
and becomes a butterfly.

380
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,292
And after my brother died,
whenever my parents were just...

381
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:09,920
you know, I'd get inside my duvet
and I'd just read it over and over.

382
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:12,440
And it made me think that

383
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,680
when I came out,
I didn't want to be different.

384
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:18,562
I just wanted what was
outside to be different.

385
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:21,440
And was it ever?

386
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:22,999
No.

387
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:28,279
I'm gonna get sacked, Jal.

388
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,879
The boss knows I'm a fuck-up.

389
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,587
Do you remember what you
wanted the house to look like

390
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:36,566
when you came out of the duvet?

391
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,240
Maybe you can sell that.

392
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:45,080
You're not a fuck-up, Chris.

393
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,119
Anybody got any poppers?

394
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,735
So this is the window
leading from the... windowy room,

395
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:10,262
into the... sofa-ry room.

396
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,959
This is so lovely.

397
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,787
But it's... just out of our budget.

398
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:18,468
I'm not sure we can pay the asking.

399
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:21,136
The owner won't budge, I'm afraid.

400
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:24,000
Then it looks like
we're wasting your time. I'm sorry.

401
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,800
Sorry, can I just...?

402
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,671
Money.

403
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:35,015
It's just bits of paper, or
numbers on a screen, innit, really?

404
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:38,355
But these walls, they exist.

405
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:41,520
If you can imagine memories
happening in them, then that's real.

406
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:45,639
I just...
I want you to imagine dying.

407
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:48,462
Right, I know it sounds weird
but just...

408
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:51,400
right, you're really old,
and you're in your bed

409
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,154
and you're remembering your life.

410
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,222
Right,
your daughter's first birthday.

411
00:28:57,538 --> 00:28:59,817
Shagging on a Sunday afternoon.

412
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:02,115
Skinning up in the garden...

413
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,800
with the kids.

414
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:07,348
Right, when you do that,

415
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:10,546
is this the house that you
see in all those memories?

416
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,947
Cos if it is, then a few pieces
of paper here or there

417
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,879
don't really seem to matter.

418
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,485
You're right.

419
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,708
Really?

420
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:24,528
We'll take it.

421
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:27,920
Brilliant. Right, let's get back
to the office then.

422
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,873
- So what line of work are you in?
- We're erotic art dealers.

423
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:32,747
Nice one.

424
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:56,513
No, I'm good. The job's great,

425
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:59,351
Jal's beautiful,
and I've got a flat.

426
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,660
Did you get my present?

427
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,439
I never take it off.

428
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,160
I wanted to say thank you
for everything you've done for me.

429
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
Oh, Chris. I just gave you
the crayons. You drew the house.

430
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,120
I'll call you back.

431
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,732
This is the office.

432
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,155
This is the office div.

433
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:25,599
Let me get you some details.

434
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,039
You must really like your lunch.

435
00:30:36,897 --> 00:30:38,880
Maybe you could find me a flat.

436
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:40,865
Oh!

437
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:43,320
Hello.

438
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:49,809
- It's nice.
- It is, isn't it?

439
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,679
Good location,
ceilings, walls and floors.

440
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,960
No, I mean it's nice
to see you again.

441
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:58,055
You look really good in a tie.

442
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,551
I'll take it.

443
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,954
The flat.

444
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:08,640
Right!

445
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,300
Right, good. Good.

446
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:19,149
<i>She just kept on staring at me,
just like she always did.</i>

447
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,119
It's not like anything happened,
it's just...

448
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,644
<i>Chris, listen.</i>

449
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,151
<i>Right now's not a very good time.</i>

450
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,760
Angie makes my pollocks tighten,
you know?

451
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:31,359
<i>After all this time,
I still wanna fuck...</i>

452
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,794
Chris, I've gotta go. Sorry.
Bye. Bye.

453
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm really sorry
you had to hear that.

454
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:40,659
Oh, don't worry. It's totally cool.

455
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:44,779
OK. So, how can we help
you down your careers path?

456
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,791
I'm thinking of leaving school,

457
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:51,600
growing a beard
and joining the circus.

458
00:31:57,051 --> 00:32:01,417
Eye of newt, toe of frog.

459
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,916
Wing of bat,

460
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:07,320
and tongue of dog.

461
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:12,120
Cass... what is this?

462
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,600
Punch for the housewarming party.

463
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:19,427
What party?

464
00:32:19,547 --> 00:32:20,760
Housewarming party.

465
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:25,142
Bye, Tom!

466
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,706
It's Tim.

467
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:33,568
What are you doing
to yourself, Cassie?

468
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:35,760
Throwing myself to the wind.

469
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,992
Do you mind not throwing Chris, too?

470
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,715
Oh... wow.

471
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,880
But... fuck you.

472
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:47,360
Do you think I'm jealous?

473
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,189
Jealous of you and your boyfriend
and his ex who he's going to fuck

474
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,270
because she makes
his pollocks tighten?

475
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,759
What?

476
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,540
Angie's back.

477
00:32:58,597 --> 00:32:59,840
He's seen her.

478
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:05,561
I've had my pain, Jal.

479
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,560
Yours is in the post.

480
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,356
What are you doing?

481
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,720
Chris!
You've been missing all the fun.

482
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,239
Yeah, what's going on?
Who are all these people?

483
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,569
We're having a housewarming party.

484
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:49,919
Where's Jal?

485
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,519
She's gone, Chris.

486
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,599
Where?

487
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:56,800
No. She's gone, Chris.

488
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
That's people.

489
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,292
We arrive, consume what we can
and then leave.

490
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:04,362
Like locust.

491
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:25,971
What you doing here?

492
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:29,321
I came with Anwar.
He's gone to get me some punch.

493
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,315
When are you going to stop
playing these games, Sketch?

494
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,248
Green doesn't suit you, Maxxie.

495
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:38,427
Sorry it took so long.
Tastes a bit funky, too.

496
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,392
Yo, blood.

497
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,899
What?

498
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,185
What is it, dude?

499
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:49,697
Have you seen yourself?

500
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,708
He looks proper lush.

501
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:53,399
Shut it, you!

502
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,949
You're fucking da-humped.

503
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,831
I was passing.

504
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:30,763
Ange.

505
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,960
Having a party?

506
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:37,175
Where's your girlfriend?

507
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:41,799
She's eating locusts. Or something.

508
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:45,848
Right.

509
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:50,015
Want to explore?

510
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,683
No.

511
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:08,480
Chris? I don't mind about her.

512
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:17,639
It's not the same, is it?

513
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:31,218
<i>Chris, are you in there?</i>

514
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,174
<i>Chris, it's me.</i>

515
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:38,280
<i>I know you wouldn't do it, OK?
Chris...</i>

516
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:41,252
<i>Chris?</i>

517
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:58,906
Jal!

518
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,559
Where you been?

519
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:10,560
Your shirt's inside out.

520
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,039
Jal...

521
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:44,523
Oh, it's, er...

522
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,730
We seem to have a small problem
with vermin.

523
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:53,916
Come through anyway.

524
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:00,419
Master bedroom.

525
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:07,899
Second bedroom.

526
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:26,179
I'm really sorry.

527
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:29,419
Not as sorry as I am.

528
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,139
Bye then.

529
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:36,893
Good luck, son.

530
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,579
I'm sorry I got you sacked.

531
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:52,713
Oh, it would have happened
sooner or later.

532
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:55,527
Where's Jal?

533
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:57,819
I dunno, Cass.

534
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,775
That's my fault too.

535
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,255
No it's not. That was mine.

536
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:16,105
Do you know what hurts the most
about a broken heart?

537
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:20,407
Not being able to remember
how you felt before.

538
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:26,528
Try and keep that feeling

539
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:29,739
because, if it goes...

540
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:31,939
... you'll never get it back.

541
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:35,539
What happens then?

542
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:43,269
Then you lay waste to the world...

543
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:46,480
and everything in it.

544
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:23,799
Again. Again, again...

545
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,819
Well done, well done.
You were last, but well done.

546
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:29,739
Off you go, son.
Go on, go on, don't panic.

547
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:33,636
Don't panic. Keep going. Come on.
Good boy! Good boy.

548
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,179
- Do you want some sandwich?
- No, thanks.

549
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:56,819
OK.

550
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,746
Tony. I've fucked it all up.

551
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,596
Again.

552
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:05,259
Shit, dude.
Try getting hit by a bus.

553
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:08,259
That'll really put
a dampener on your day.

554
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:16,357
Honestly, have some tuna sandwich.

555
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:19,419
It'll make you feel better.
Promise.

556
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,219
Bye, Tony.

557
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:34,779
See you next week, Anna.

558
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:42,440
Do you ever get depressed about...

559
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,000
your accident?

560
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:47,419
Used to.

561
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,739
But who does it help?

562
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:53,368
I had everything I wanted.
And lost it all.

563
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,019
Hurts like fuck.

564
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,619
But, Chris...

565
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,749
... I'm going to get it all back.

566
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,914
Piece by piece.

567
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,219
What else is there?

568
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:38,240
Fuck it!

569
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:53,099
<i>Hi. It's me. Leave a message.</i>

570
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:55,659
<i>Hi, it's Angie.
Look, I'm sorry.</i>

571
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:59,219
<i>I shouldn't have come.
But I hope things work out for you.</i>

572
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:02,619
<i>I'm going, but there's something
I want you to have.</i>

573
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:07,638
Whose flat is this?

574
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:11,459
A friend of mine left town.
I'll tell you later.

575
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:12,939
Thanks for coming.

576
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:27,819
OK, so I've been thinking about why
I always fuck everything up for myself.

577
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,880
And this is the best way
that I can explain.

578
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:37,019
This is how it started for me.

579
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:38,619
It was good.

580
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:43,339
Then things started going wrong.

581
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,779
Then someone else escaped.

582
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:51,099
The gravity holding us together
was gone.

583
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:53,139
We were floating in space.

584
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,698
It's kinda easy when
you've got nothing, because...

585
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:11,059
nothing can't be
taken away from you.

586
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,019
But I don't want nothing any more.

587
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:21,404
Is that it?

588
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:24,520
Are you the only person
in the world that's been let down?

589
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:29,576
The only one that's been hurt,
abandoned.

590
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:31,419
Are you?

591
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:36,539
So what gives you the right
to act like you are?

592
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,544
Jal... can't you forgive me?

593
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:44,483
No.

594
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:47,899
Don't you understand?
I wanna...

595
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,299
Make a new fucking pact
that means nothing to you?

596
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:52,819
Yeah. Let's do that.

597
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,899
Let's build something.
And we'll tear it down.

598
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:58,520
Fuck it. Come on...
Come on. Say it!

599
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,745
Build something. Tear it down!

600
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:06,499
You're not who I thought you were.

601
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:09,979
You're an empty, poisonous smile.

602
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:16,080
What do you want me to say?
I don't know what I'm meant to say.

603
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,819
Jal, look at me.

604
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:20,419
Look, I was perfectly happy
killing myself.

605
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,779
Right, but then
you asked me to try...

606
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,879
And for the first time
in my life it felt like

607
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,939
someone actually gave a shit.

608
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,859
And that person was
worth trying for. And now I'd...

609
00:45:31,547 --> 00:45:34,995
I'd fucking make the world record
biggest sandwich if you asked me to.

610
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:38,886
I'd kick old grannies in the tits.
I'd fill the rivers with panda pops.

611
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:40,133
Stop.

612
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,459
I fucked up big time.

613
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:50,089
I'm more than sorry.

614
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,379
I love you, Jal.

615
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:56,379
You're my whole world.

616
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:01,779
Now you've got snot on your face.

617
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:21,339
I'm going to the Job Centre.

618
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:23,139
Wait for me?

619
00:47:01,431 --> 00:47:04,011
