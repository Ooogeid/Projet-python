1
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,399
<i>{\a3}Tony fucked up, Sid fucked up,
Jal's fucked up worse than any of us</i>

2
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,719
{\a3}but it doesn't
all have to turn to shit.

3
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:29,652
<i>{\a3}I'll love you for ever, Sid.</i>

4
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:30,772
<i>{\a3}You will?</i>

5
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:32,826
<i>{\a3}Yes. That's the problem.</i>

6
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:08,638
EVERYONE

7
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,280
Oh, I'm loving that.

8
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:01,091
Oh, yeah, Cassie.

9
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,675
Great.

10
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,434
Mmm, yeah.

11
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,554
... little finger.

12
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:11,456
Sid.

13
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,479
Yeah, and your thumb.

14
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:23,123
Tony.

15
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,611
Hi.

16
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:28,147
How come I...?

17
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,148
You locked yourself out.

18
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:33,085
Right. So I came here.

19
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,139
You'd been drinking - you thought
we were still best friends.

20
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,101
How come we were drinking?

21
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,341
We all went out - it was
Chelle's idea to cheer up Jal.

22
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,200
Well, take her mind off it, anyway.

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
And did it?

24
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,304
No.

25
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,792
Final question -
my hand being on my bollocks...

26
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,169
That's just you.

27
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
Right.

28
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,261
You should forget about her.

29
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:14,103
- Who?
- Cassie.

30
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:17,919
- What? Who's talking about her?
- She's gone. It's time to move on.

31
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:21,560
I've already forgotten about her. I
haven't thought about her for days.

32
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:22,840
All right.

33
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:25,364
I'm just saying.

34
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:28,095
Yeah, I hear what you're saying,
Tone, but, well

35
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:29,976
one - I wasn't talking about her,

36
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,335
B - today's about
A - Chris and B - results,

37
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:34,856
so that leaves no room
for 3 - Cassie,

38
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,879
and D - it's none of your business.

39
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,680
I got that slightly confused.

40
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,520
- If you wanna talk...
- Why would I want to talk to you?

41
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:51,134
Actually, there is one thing...

42
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:52,199
Yeah?

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,950
Are you naked, too?

44
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,566
No, again, that's just you.

45
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,409
Right, well,

46
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:05,645
I know it's your bedroom, but would
you mind getting out of bed first?

47
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,004
OK, Sid.

48
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,142
- You all right, Mum?
- Sid.

49
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:30,142
Sid, where have you been?

50
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,580
I've been up all night - I'd
thought you'd done something stupid.

51
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:39,160
I forgot my keys. I slept at Tony's.
I didn't wanna wake you.

52
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,907
Sid... are you OK?

53
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,592
Yes.

54
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:46,377
I know today's gonna be difficult.

55
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,919
When we buried your Dad...

56
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,477
- Mum!
- It's just...

57
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,279
I could call in sick, if you like.

58
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:53,959
If you wanna talk.

59
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:57,445
Sid, wait!

60
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:01,919
This came for you.

61
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,000
And this.

62
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,720
Looks like girl's handwriting.

63
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,707
So... this is odd.

64
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,231
You... me...

65
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,760
my bedroom... my bed.

66
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:13,684
I need answers, Cassie.

67
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,999
I need answers right now!

68
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,877
Can I speak to Sid Jenkins, please?

69
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,844
You are.

70
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,469
Oh, you're Sid?!

71
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,288
Oh! I imagined you'd be fatter
for some reason,

72
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,839
with bigger ears!

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,440
Facebook.
I looked you up on Chris' Facebook,

74
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:41,351
you left more comments in his... box

75
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,771
than any of the other children.

76
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:46,640
Don't have any photos of
you there, though, do you?

77
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,419
Just little pictures
of Batman characters.

78
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,855
- I like Batman.
- Right.

79
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,639
Sorry, but who are you?

80
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,536
Oh, did I not introduce myself?
I'm Graham, Graham Miles.

81
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,824
- You're Chris' dad.
- Yes, that's right. Can I come in?

82
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:23,174
So...

83
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:27,497
Would you like a drink?
I've got more or less everything.

84
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:31,033
Um, tea, coffee, whisky, beer,

85
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:33,173
orange, apple... chocolate milk.

86
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:34,996
No! Thanks. I'm fine.

87
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,616
I've come about the funeral.

88
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:41,454
Right.

89
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,450
You see, the thing is,

90
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:47,096
I've got a lot of relatives
coming to this funeral...

91
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:48,742
Sid.

92
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:51,039
Some from
as far away as Basingstoke.

93
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:55,880
Yes. And they remember Chris
as a kind, gentle fun-loving boy,

94
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,793
and I'd really like
to maintain that image.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,320
And I think the best way
of maintaining that image

96
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,486
is you not coming.

97
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:08,355
What?

98
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,715
I don't want you at the funeral.

99
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,886
Any of you... friends.

100
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,144
We, um, we won't spoil anything.

101
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,999
I mean, and Chris, he was
totally a fun-loving guy...

102
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,440
Don't tell me what my son was!

103
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,840
I know what he was.
And I know what you are.

104
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,719
The junkie friends
who brought him down with them.

105
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:35,078
But...

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,313
I'm his father.
It's my son's funeral -

107
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,822
you will respect my wishes,
is that clear?

108
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,305
- Crystal.
- Good.

109
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,801
I'll find my own way out.

110
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,470
- He can't do this!
- If we talked to him...

111
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,448
- He's a psycho!
- Right.

112
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,604
Chris is our friend.
You know, it's our funeral.

113
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:08,680
Don't take it so personally - he's
just throwing his weight around.

114
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,174
Fuck you!

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,363
No, Sid. I know how you feel.

116
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:18,400
Like you do! You don't know how
I feel these days. Postcards...

117
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:21,120
fucking results, and dads.

118
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:24,737
And now we're not allowed to bury
our friend. And you don't even care!

119
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,159
So why are you here?

120
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,372
Sid, what do you want me to do?

121
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:32,133
No, I didn't...

122
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,110
I don't know.

123
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,529
It's just...

124
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,221
I never get to say goodbye.

125
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,770
But, you know, you're right.

126
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:02,600
Sid and Tony,
Tony and Sid - it's pathetic.

127
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:06,155
Me coming to you all the time,
hoping for what? What am I?

128
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,040
- Your fucking...
- Look, it's fine.

129
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,319
We'll have our own funeral.

130
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:13,672
Yeah, great(!)

131
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:16,582
A funeral with no coffin.

132
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:19,591
And then we'll sit around
singing Kumba-fucking-ya.

133
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,251
So let's steal it.

134
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:23,427
What?

135
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,576
Let's steal...

136
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,024
the coffin.

137
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:32,068
What?

138
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:35,241
We're going to steal Chris' funeral.

139
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
<i>Anwar?</i>

140
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:50,241
<i>Anwar, are you masturbating?</i>

141
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:51,361
Mum!

142
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,270
Sorry.

143
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:57,231
Thought it was a more interesting
thing to ask than "Are you asleep?"

144
00:10:57,351 --> 00:11:00,225
If you have to ask "Are you asleep?"
the chances are they are asleep.

145
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,795
But with masturbating
who can be sure?

146
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:09,573
So?

147
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,049
What?

148
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:13,972
So what?

149
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,850
We made a pact, Mum.
No results until after the funeral.

150
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,220
Mark of respect.

151
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:24,494
I can boil a very hot pan, steam it
open. No-one will know.

152
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:25,479
I'll know.

153
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:35,300
If the grades aren't good you
can always work with your father.

154
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
I know.

155
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,548
You look very handsome, my son.

156
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,424
I'll make kulfi with lunch, special.

157
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:57,363
You just...

158
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:00,088
go back to what you're doing.

159
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,049
Do some more masturbating.

160
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,730
Right.

161
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,676
Right.

162
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:03,117
Jal.

163
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:11,732
Jal, shall we get dressed?

164
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,919
Funeral's at three.

165
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,944
Have you ever
climbed inside a duvet cover?

166
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,751
Yeah.

167
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,425
Will you?

168
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,219
Yeah.

169
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,777
Well, this is nice.

170
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,896
Like we're at a sleep-over...

171
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,466
I had the abortion.

172
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:05,423
OK.

173
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:15,092
I would have come with you.

174
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,754
No. I needed to do it alone.

175
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:22,699
OK.

176
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,630
I think we should get out of here.

177
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,000
I want to stay.

178
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:35,034
I know somewhere we can go.

179
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,754
Zoos are a great place
to think about stuff.

180
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:42,872
Yeah?

181
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:43,992
Yeah.

182
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:46,634
It's just...

183
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,304
it's weird, because...

184
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,663
I get my grades, succeed,

185
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,309
and I'm off to York.
And Tony goes to Cardiff

186
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,770
and we're 600 miles apart, and
that doesn't feel like success.

187
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,040
It doesn't feel like much reward.

188
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,789
You think I've made
a mistake, don't you?

189
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:06,108
You do. I know you, Michelle.

190
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,759
I think you've made the hardest
decision I've known anyone to make.

191
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:19,143
That's what I think.

192
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:23,159
Why are we here?

193
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,542
Special treat?

194
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:28,384
Take my mind off it? Because I'm
not ten and I don't like animals.

195
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:29,851
No.

196
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:33,225
We're not here to
take your mind off it.

197
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,850
This is where I first met Chris.

198
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,011
Yeah?

199
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:39,507
Yeah.

200
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:42,374
I was seven. His mum
got talking to mine

201
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:45,519
and he was this funny little kid
with his hands down his pants

202
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,631
doing impressions of the fish.

203
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:52,577
I don't know if he
thought he could talk to them or...

204
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:58,142
I'm not saying forget about him,

205
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,269
because you can't and you shouldn't.

206
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,639
He was special.

207
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:05,899
But I just think...

208
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,025
fuck it.

209
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,803
What?

210
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:13,814
Like Chris.
He said, "Fuck it.

211
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:15,564
"I'll do it my way.

212
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:18,675
"And the people that love me
will understand why I'm doing it

213
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:21,179
"because they love me.
Fuck it."

214
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,269
Come on.

215
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:30,759
You don't think he'd say exactly that
if he was standing here?

216
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:35,560
He'd probably be too busy
talking bollocks about the fish.

217
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,563
"Fuck it" for Chris?

218
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:44,560
OK. "Fuck it" for Chris.

219
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,540
Say it like you mean it.

220
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,080
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it!

221
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,439
Come on, Jemima!

222
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,420
Fuck it.

223
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:04,528
Here we are.

224
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:06,829
Is this him?

225
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,929
No. It's me as a boy.

226
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:10,831
Nice-looking boy.

227
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:14,928
Not nice-looking...

228
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,724
It's just it looks like you had...

229
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,022
have a nice personality.

230
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,976
Um... Obviously attractive.

231
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,327
I'm not saying that you weren't.

232
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:33,594
It's quite rare...

233
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,311
to have a funeral without a woman.

234
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:38,957
A mother, a sister.

235
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:42,836
A girlfriend, a wife.

236
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,100
- It's a bit of a novelty really.
- His mother left.

237
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,648
And his stepmother.

238
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:51,424
Oh, right.

239
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,609
It's nice though, isn't it?
Father burying his son.

240
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:00,333
It's... not nice.

241
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,420
It's a nice... novelty for me though.

242
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:05,632
Right.

243
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:11,274
Very powerful bond,
fathers and sons.

244
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,714
It's like mothers and daughters,

245
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,909
but different. Less oestrogen.

246
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,079
He just... he just stole my son.

247
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,713
Get in, you tit.

248
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:04,614
Fuck.

249
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,210
He's really gone.

250
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:08,904
Yeah.

251
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,680
You know, we could get in real
trouble for this. It might be...

252
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,280
We need to say goodbye, Sid.

253
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:18,440
We all do.

254
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,009
Thing is, though,

255
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,911
after this there's fuck all
to say goodbye to.

256
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:27,737
Chris gone, Dad gone,

257
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,430
fucking Cassie.

258
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,000
You and me, we're...

259
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:32,986
Yeah.

260
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:36,093
- What are we, Sid?
- Tony...

261
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,920
Shit. Shit! It's him!

262
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,538
We're under control.

263
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,425
Holy fuck, Tone!

264
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,320
Turn right!

265
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,159
Shut up, Sid.

266
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:13,205
How close are they?

267
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,002
Very fucking close.

268
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Tony. Tony!

269
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Oh, fuck.

270
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:35,174
- Sid, are you buckled in?
- Yeah, why?

271
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,680
Shit!

272
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,091
I think we lost him.

273
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,920
We have. We fucking have!

274
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,959
Mate.

275
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:17,856
You OK?

276
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,228
No. I feel uncomfortable.

277
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,956
You're my boyfriend and we're
gonna be living together.

278
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,707
That makes you one of us.

279
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,630
There's no need to
feel uncomfortable.

280
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,100
Maxxie, there's a coffin in the room.

281
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,159
How's that not uncomfortable?

282
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,856
What's going to happen
to those fish? I mean,

283
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,857
someone's got to take 'em.

284
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:39,733
Hi.

285
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:40,853
Hi, Maxxie.

286
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:45,178
We've had a really good morning.

287
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,048
Yeah, we had a pretty
interesting time, too.

288
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:50,439
Is that what I...

289
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,200
What the fuck is that doing here?

290
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,639
Funny story actually.

291
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:03,690
Chris's dad came to see me and
he said we couldn't go to the funeral

292
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,759
because we were all junkies,
so I went to Tony, and Tony...

293
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,639
What the fuck have you done?

294
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,852
- The thing is, Jal...
- Give it back.

295
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,563
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- You didn't hear him.

296
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:19,354
He wouldn't bury Chris as Chris.
We did this for Chris.

297
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,759
- You did it for who?
- I'm not saying...

298
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,599
What right have you?
You stupid, stupid...

299
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,093
- You're not listening.
- No, you're not listening.

300
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,839
There's other ways to do this.

301
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,799
Give it back.

302
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
Now!

303
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,280
But...

304
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,717
You do as she says.

305
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,001
OK.

306
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:49,642
Here we are.

307
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:57,399
I did say sorry, didn't I?

308
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:00,792
Wasn't your fault.

309
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:05,505
I didn't...

310
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,501
think to lock the boot.
You know, you just...

311
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,158
don't think.

312
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:13,200
I'm not a thinker.
I don't think.

313
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,915
Why would they do this to me?

314
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,506
ASBO culture.

315
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:21,651
Or Arabs. It's one of the As.

316
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:25,845
My son, it was my son.

317
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:31,220
Well, the police are on their way.
They'll find it.

318
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:32,968
Him.

319
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:35,505
It. The coffin.

320
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:41,596
How am I going to explain this?

321
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,663
Right, I'm going to need
an empty coffin and some ballast.

322
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:54,279
Oh, right. Ballast?

323
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,307
I've got relatives coming expecting
a funeral. It's the only solution.

324
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,250
Oh, no, it isn't.

325
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,581
- I think I know what's best.
- Well...

326
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,220
the best just got better.

327
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:25,759
I suppose we'll just have to hope
it's the right coffin.

328
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,670
I didn't know anywhere else to go.

329
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,761
I worked hard.
I worked really hard.

330
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:33,986
And then these.

331
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,039
What grades did you need?

332
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,227
Have you ever played
the five-year test?

333
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:57,398
What? No, I don't think so.

334
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:00,800
It's not that wanking game, is it?

335
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,048
Maxxie. Where do you think he'll be
in five years' time?

336
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,832
Easy. Dancing in a London show.

337
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,077
Jal?

338
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:12,718
Playing the clarinet
in some really good orchestra.

339
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:13,789
Michelle?

340
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:16,353
Working some slick jobs
in some fine suits.

341
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:17,791
Now you.

342
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:21,360
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

343
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,581
Haven't thought about it, have you?

344
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:28,396
No. I'll be
with my friends, having a laugh.

345
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:32,403
Somewhere.

346
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:34,030
But don't you get it?

347
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,319
They've got
their plans, their futures.

348
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:39,039
And you're not in them.

349
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,618
And you're so much better, are you?
Made any plans, have you?

350
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:46,127
I'm going to stay here,
and there's nothing wrong with that.

351
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:50,477
They'll smile every time
you call them,

352
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,638
they'll just take longer
to return your calls.

353
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:57,729
Being left behind, Anwar,
that's not such a big problem.

354
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,660
You'll just have new friends.

355
00:26:03,356 --> 00:26:04,806
New friends like me.

356
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,600
I am the resurrection

357
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,984
and the life.

358
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:49,160
He who believeth in me,
though he were dead, sayeth the Lord,

359
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,940
yet he shall live.

360
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:54,229
Deliver your servant Christopher...

361
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:58,833
I've been thinking about what Chris
would have wanted me to say today.

362
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:01,198
The advice he'd give me.

363
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:04,528
Which would be something like,

364
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:06,039
"You know what, babe,

365
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:07,626
"fuck it.

366
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,280
"These guys know all about me.
Tell them about someone different."

367
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:17,733
So I thought I'd say something
about a hero of Chris's.

368
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,658
A man called captain Joe Katanga.

369
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:25,205
In 1960,

370
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,951
climbing into a foil balloon,

371
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:32,632
Captain Joe ascended 32
kilometres into the stratosphere.

372
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,280
And then,

373
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,001
armed only with a parachute,

374
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,419
he jumped out.

375
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:51,707
He fell for four minutes and
36 seconds,

376
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:54,120
reaching 740mph

377
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:58,626
before opening his parachute
five kilometres above the earth.

378
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,808
It had never been done before.
And has never been done since.

379
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,440
He did it just because he could...

380
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,240
- Keep going.
- ... and that's why Chris loved him.

381
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:13,340
Because the thing about Chris was
he said yes.

382
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:16,000
He said yes to everything.

383
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:18,056
He loved everyone.

384
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,688
For ever and ever, Amen.

385
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,258
He was the bravest boy...

386
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:25,837
man, I knew.

387
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,670
And that was...

388
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:33,840
He flung himself
out of a foil balloon every day.

389
00:28:35,804 --> 00:28:37,154
Because he could.

390
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:39,252
Because he was.

391
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:43,152
And that's why...

392
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,200
and that's why...

393
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:49,314
We...

394
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,340
We loved him.

395
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:54,413
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

396
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:58,986
In sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection, to eternal life.

397
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,879
Who are these people?

398
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:21,560
Arabs.

399
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:29,836
Graham, if you would like to
put some soil on the coffin now.

400
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,766
- Toot on that.
- Jal, you all right?

401
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:09,036
Yeah, I'm fine.

402
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,459
Results o'clock, I think.

403
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,080
Chris would want us to have
a party, a proper blow-out

404
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:38,360
before you all leave.

405
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,879
But I'm leaving tonight.

406
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,862
Tonight?

407
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,336
Yes. Me and James are on the
late coach to London.

408
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,662
There you go.

409
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:50,640
We're all busy.

410
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:53,559
Maybe at Christmas
when we come back, yeah?

411
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,279
Right, then. No peeking.

412
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:01,112
Tony.

413
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,640
Three A's and a B.

414
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:14,373
Cardiff it is then.

415
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:22,799
Yeah, and if anyone gets me a Baa
Baa Fuck Sheep, I'll kill them.

416
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:24,919
So, who's next?

417
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,880
Sidney.

418
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:36,700
B, C, C.

419
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:38,251
Yay, Sidney boy!

420
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:42,078
Good job.

421
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,520
Maxxie.

422
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,068
Maxxie.

423
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:51,719
B, E.

424
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:54,175
B, E.

425
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:55,818
B.
Not bad.

426
00:31:56,968 --> 00:31:58,560
I be, I be.

427
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,156
Nice one.

428
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,799
Chuck us the bag, Chell.

429
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:11,954
Jalanda.

430
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:15,812
It'll be fine, Jal.

431
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,720
Two A's and a C.

432
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:22,882
- Great stuff.
- Well done, Jal.

433
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,794
Now give it here.

434
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:31,119
Well done, Jal.

435
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:36,415
Michelle...

436
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:46,399
B, A, A.

437
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,656
Well done.

438
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:57,839
 -Looks like you're off to York.
- Well played, Chelle.

439
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,720
Hang on, still one left.

440
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:03,426
Anwar.

441
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,439
- Where's he gone?
- He was there a minute ago.

442
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:08,959
They've been opened.

443
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:11,933
He'll be fine.
He worked really hard.

444
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Two Es and a U.

445
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:20,069
How fine is that?

446
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:39,135
You were right what
you said earlier.

447
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,505
Was I?

448
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:43,746
totally right.

449
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:49,771
I never came here
to talk to you about that.

450
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:50,891
I came...

451
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,401
- I wanted to invite you ice-skating.
- What?

452
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:57,104
Or to the cinema.
Maybe bowling.

453
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,883
I've never been bowling
before but I might be good, so...

454
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:03,936
Or we could eat something?
Or do something?

455
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,731
Or we could have sex.

456
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,774
Bristol's our oyster.

457
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,103
Let's just...

458
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,082
Let's just start this life,
shall we, Anwar?

459
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:40,247
Just handing nibbles
around at the wake.

460
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,234
Said I'd gone to the toilet.

461
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:48,036
Wasn't good at it,

462
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:49,523
being his dad.

463
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,617
Some people just aren't built
for parenthood, I guess.

464
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,730
It's used but there's probably
some clean bits.

465
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,678
Sorry... Just...

466
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,640
You sound just like him.

467
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:16,830
He was my son.

468
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:26,469
So, I'm guessing, right, that
you were his girlfriend?

469
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:27,887
Yeah.

470
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:31,040
Good, you seem like a nice girl.

471
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,150
Yeah, you would have liked me.

472
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:40,560
Sorry that I didn't
invite you to the... funeral.

473
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:43,655
Fuck it.

474
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,951
The idea that you cared
enough to ban us all.

475
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,440
He would have liked that.

476
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:53,161
You fought. For all the
wrong reasons, but you fought.

477
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:56,353
No...

478
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,520
In some ways, today
couldn't have gone better.

479
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,621
He doesn't want you
to find him, does he?

480
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:26,008
He's my best friend.

481
00:36:26,128 --> 00:36:27,795
I know but he'll be fine.

482
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:31,945
Hi.

483
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:33,839
Hey.

484
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,650
I just...

485
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:41,165
I just wanted to say goodbye
and good luck.

486
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,880
Thanks.

487
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:47,799
Listen, it'll be really shit.
We'll find the cheapest rooms

488
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,903
we can and we're going to have no
money for food or booze but...

489
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:52,890
Fuck it. Why don't you come?

490
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:54,479
What?

491
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:56,986
It'll be fun.

492
00:36:57,186 --> 00:36:59,520
And I really want you there.

493
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:05,274
But aren't I supposed
to be deciding about my future?

494
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:06,999
Moving on and doing all that?

495
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:10,319
Fuck the future.
Come to London, have a laugh.

496
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:17,841
You know I don't have
any pants, right?

497
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:21,320
No-one wears pants in London.
Come on. We need to roll.

498
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,439
What's that?

499
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,666
It's supposed to be lucky.

500
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:57,983
So, the three of us

501
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:00,811
in the car.

502
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:02,181
Together again.

503
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,134
Yeah.

504
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,956
We've seen each other naked.

505
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:09,991
Which is nice.

506
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:17,720
One small question.
Where are we going?

507
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:19,745
Oh, yeah.

508
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:24,108
What's this?

509
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,275
Open it.

510
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:35,148
New York?

511
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:37,882
Why would I want to go to New York?

512
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:42,033
She's thin, she's blonde,
she says "Wow" a lot.

513
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:45,240
It's over, Tone. Me and Cassie
are done. You said so yourself.

514
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,239
Don't look at me.

515
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:55,263
You'll find her.

516
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,200
You just will.

517
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:09,272
Right. So...

518
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:11,761
this is it.

519
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:13,487
Right.

520
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:16,811
Good luck.

521
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:19,275
Right. Yeah.

522
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:22,480
Thanks for the ticket.

523
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,745
- Tony.
- I know.

524
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:58,704
But three things, Sid.

525
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:00,886
One,

526
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,600
get rid of the hat.
It makes you look retarded.

527
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:09,723
Two...

528
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:22,359
I always loved you the best, Sid.

529
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:27,708
Three.

530
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:33,955
I can't think of a three.

531
00:41:39,658 --> 00:41:42,360
<i>Passenger announcement.
Can all remaining passengers</i>

532
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,967
<i>for flight AZ184 to New York
proceed...</i>

533
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,359
I'll miss my flight.

534
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,306
Yeah.

535
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,710
What if...?

536
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
What if?

537
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,690
What if...?

538
00:43:17,068 --> 00:43:18,601
I'm not ready for this.

539
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:21,958
For what?

540
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:25,505
All of this.

541
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,198
But you sort of need to be.

542
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:38,576
You know, the first time I met you,

543
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:40,520
I knew.

544
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:43,079
I just

545
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:46,309
knew I wanted to have sex with you.

546
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:54,765
Fuck you.

547
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:03,445
We were good, weren't we?

548
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,622
We were better than that.

549
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:25,602
Excuse me, my name's Sid.

550
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,083
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

551
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,740
Excuse me. Have you seen...?
Excuse me, really sorry.
