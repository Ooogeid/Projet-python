1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:03,039
My new friends!
Rory's letting me blow his chanter.

2
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:05,280
You just need to learn to finger it.

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,240
- I will remember everything.
- I fancy you.

4
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,800
I wanna have sex with you.
I can't do it from out here!

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,520
Here I come, Cass. I'm coming.

6
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:48,568
Episode 3
SID

7
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:03,578
<i>Sid, can you
get yourself down here?!</i>

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
<i>Fuck!</i>

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,049
Fucking hell.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,519
<i>You'd better help me here or...!</i>

11
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,160
All right!

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,720
All right.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,150
<i>Oh, come on, work,
you fucking thing!</i>

14
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,880
Hit the video button.

15
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:33,920
<i>Sid!</i>

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,560
We can talk.

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,080
Come on, you ditzy moo, it's the
big fucking red button marked "video".

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>Sid, I need your help!</i>

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,880
- For Christ's sake!
<i>- Sidney!</i>

20
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,799
Big fucking red button!

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,409
There you are!

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,430
Hey, sexy!

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>

24
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Cass.

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,685
Cass?

26
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,800
<i>What the fuck is a ratchet lock?</i>

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,440
Yes, you do, turn on
your sodding speakers! Cass.

28
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,272
<i>Sid, what are you...?!</i>

29
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:14,600
<i>Is it not working?</i>

30
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:16,333
No.

31
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:20,320
Sid. For Christ's sake. You made me

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,720
buy that frigging Dyson and
I can't make the pissing thing...

33
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,334
<i>Oh, that's...</i>

34
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,265
That's...

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
- ... my girlfriend.
- Right.

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,669
So, she's in Scotland and...

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,520
She doesn't know I can see her.

38
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,681
Right.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Because...

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,814
Oh, fuck, no!

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,319
<i>Fuck!</i>

42
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,040
Fuck!

43
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:04,904
- What do you think?
- Sex on a stick, so you are.

44
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,296
Thanks, Lachlan.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,959
But the pink one ain't bad either.
Eh, no, Rory?

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,426
Aye. He's a lucky,
lucky gadge, this Sidney.

47
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:15,400
He's lovely!
I'm going to surprise him.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,199
Look at this.

49
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,766
Help ma boab! Nice.

50
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:25,039
Fucking A.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,434
You think he'll like it?

52
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,720
Jings, you're almost
turning me straight here!

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,471
Love is in the air! Eh, no, Rory?

54
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,839
I'm feelin' it, man.
I'm feelin' it.

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,800
It's one of those things,
shit happens.

56
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,680
Is that the best you've got, Dad?

57
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:46,559
- You always get my best, son.
- Because she's...

58
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:51,279
Well, she says she loves me,
then she waltzes off to Elgin,

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,560
now she's fucking
the Scottish rugby team!

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,319
No. She's only fucking one of them.

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,240
Stop trying to console me.
I'm inconsolable, OK?

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,800
OK, OK! It's just...

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
It's just women, you know?

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,883
Hang on, are we comparing
women here?

65
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:07,231
I don't know.

66
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:10,320
Mum left you because you're
a total, world championship cretin.

67
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,799
I'm not sure that that's...

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,839
Mine's done this cos I'm
a gullible soft touch who's

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,400
far, far, far too fucking nice
for his own good.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
There's no comparison, OK?

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,120
But you've worked it out then.

72
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:24,680
Didn't you?

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
What is this thing?!

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,399
Attach the guide nozzle to the
flange circulator? What the fuck?!

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

76
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:38,440
Dad...

77
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Your mother'll be here in a minute.
We've gotta get this...

78
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,320
We've gotta clear it up.
And maybe...

79
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,160
She's not coming back because
you tidied the house, Dad.

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,919
Yeah? Yeah?
Oh, please. Something work.

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,800
What time's your Dad arriving?

82
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:52,961
12.

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,319
We can do it if we concentrate.

84
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,679
I thought he hated you.

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,800
Who said my dad hates me?

86
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:01,640
Well, you did, didn't you?

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,698
He's not well.
We've got a few issues.

88
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,033
Fuck!

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,599
We should have started earlier!

90
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,040
We should have started earlier!

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,079
Anwar.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,560
How you doing, man?

93
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm not too good,
as it goes, actually.

94
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,199
Right. I just thought I'd pop
round, wonder if you're busy.

95
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:26,359
In the bedroom department.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Your bedroom,
is it currently in use?

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,279
My mum's coming to pretend to still
be married to my dad for my grandad.

98
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
But this won't take long.

99
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:37,231
What?

100
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:41,599
This is Sketch.

101
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, I know who she is. She stalked
Maxxie, she got our drama teacher

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,200
wrongly fired for sexual abuse
and she tried to poison Michelle.

103
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,361
Yes.

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,120
Sketch!

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,719
I've come to my senses.

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
She's sorry.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,080
Boy, she's sorry.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,799
Thing is, Sid,

109
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,200
sex hasn't been invented yet
round at my place.

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,471
Tricky with 2,000 years of
religious tradition.

111
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:10,520
So me and Sketch were
wondering if we could...

112
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Come on. My whole family's
gonna be here in an hour.

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
- It won't take long.
- It never takes long.

114
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,159
You don't mind do you, Sidney?

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,280
I do, actually, you know I...

116
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,329
Oh, whatever.

117
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:40,080
This is gut, ja?

118
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,780
Oh, yes, Manfred.
It's lovely, but I've got to go.

119
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,620
Thanks for the lift.

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,999
But you will hurry,

121
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:50,440
and tonight we will have
much more great sex, ja?

122
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,840
Ja.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,164
I mean, yes, yes.

124
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,360
Yikes!

125
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,260
You are liking it like that, huh?

126
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,040
Oh, fucking hell.

127
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,303
I've got to go.
I've really, really got to go.

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,280
Jesus wept.
Does she have to do that?

129
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,020
I mean, what kind of
a fucked-up relationship is it

130
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,700
where you have to jump each
other every time you say goodbye?

131
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,518
A good one?

132
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:26,520
Jesus...

133
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,200
Jesus, Je... Bollocks!

134
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,452
- Hi, Sid.
- Hi, Mum.

135
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,340
- Mark.
- Liz.

136
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,380
You all right, Sid?

137
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,849
Yeah, I'm fine.

138
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,380
You smell of something.

139
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,060
It's just Opium.

140
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,660
You know, perfume.

141
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,840
You hate perfume.

142
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,920
Manfred likes it.

143
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,790
I'm sure
Manfred fucking loves it.

144
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,780
I'm sure Manfred loves
rolling into Belgium,

145
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,640
rounding up the Jews
and sending them to Poland,

146
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,980
but hey, that's Blitzkrieg for you,

147
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,240
and Manfred's gotta have
his Opium-scented Lebensraum. Right?

148
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,320
- He can't help being German.
- Who can?

149
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,520
Right, perhaps I should go home.

150
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
You should come home.

151
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,000
This is gonna be so silly.

152
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,060
Why on earth did you tell your
father that we were together again?

153
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,163
After that night, you know,
when you stayed...

154
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:53,920
But that was just...

155
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,600
I mean, you stayed and we...
I thought...

156
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,320
You...

157
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,680
You stayed?

158
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,032
It was just one time.

159
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,353
You know how the
old bastard loves you.

160
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:10,360
I never got round to telling him
you were just fucking with my head.

161
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,360
Right, that's it. I'm going.

162
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
- No!
- No!

163
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,028
Liz...

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,920
... I can't make the
sodding Hoover work.

165
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,680
For Christ sakes.

166
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Sid, load the dishwasher.
Have you any cigarettes?

167
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,180
Oh, yeah.

168
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,360
Thanks.

169
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,216
Oh, God.

170
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,020
Godfather. The Godfather Part Two.

171
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,180
Apocalypse Now.

172
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,520
The Conversation...

173
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,980
It's not working.

174
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,429
You gotta get some staying power.

175
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,013
Don't you dare, boyo.
I am far, far from satisfied.

176
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,230
OK. Oh... shit.

177
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,220
Oh, fucking hell.

178
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,840
- Hello, Mrs Jenkins.
- Hello, Anwar.

179
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,020
This is Sketch.

180
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:01,400
Nice to meet you.

181
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:04,580
Sid didn't mention you were back.

182
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
Yes, I'm not staying.

183
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,060
Mum, you don't need to...
I can tidy my own...

184
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,809
Oh... shit!

185
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,780
Just having a lovely chat
with Anwar and his, um, new friend.

186
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,080
How's your mum, Anwar?
I must give her a ring some time.

187
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,920
Yeah, yeah, she's fine,

188
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
she's fine.

189
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,960
She's fine, yeah, but, you know...

190
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:28,913
Muslim.

191
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,480
She's been a bit busy Muslim...

192
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,980
She doesn't know I have sex.

193
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Really?

194
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,620
Well...

195
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,589
Anyway...

196
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,840
Make sure you
come again soon, Anwar.

197
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,280
Yeah, cheers.

198
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,280
Chance would be a fine thing.

199
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
Isn't this nice?

200
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Yeah.

201
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,340
Nice.

202
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,749
How's Cassie?

203
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,200
Still missing you, I bet.

204
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,749
Actually, no.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,360
I don't think
she's missing me at all.

206
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,140
Really? How's that?

207
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,700
Oh, the usual. Woman dumps him
for no good reason

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,100
without even explaining herself,

209
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,060
falls into bed with some
random idiot with a big cock,

210
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,340
you know the kind of thing.

211
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:42,040
That's rotten, Sid. I'm sorry.

212
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,000
I haven't been keeping up properly.

213
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
No.

214
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,760
I could explain, but it
wouldn't make any difference.

215
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,080
To me it would.

216
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,860
You heard him.
It would help if you explained.

217
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,720
I mean, we're all here.
Let's explain.

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,340
Bloody hell. He's early!

219
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,140
Jesus Christ!

220
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,700
Later, OK?

221
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:14,514
Liza!

222
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,460
How are you, Alex?

223
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,080
Och, embracing adversity
as ever, my dear.

224
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,640
But borne aloft
by the sight of you, lassie.

225
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,809
Hi, Dad.

226
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,725
You're going grey -
what have ye been doing?

227
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,751
- Nothing.
- Where's my drink?

228
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,580
Sandy! What a nice surprise.

229
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Aye, I ken it is, eh, no?

230
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,832
You've brought the boys.

231
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:38,618
They've been fair jumpin'
wi' excitement, ken, aye?

232
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:41,080
Right... Hello, Lex.

233
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,446
<i>Hallo, Ally.</i>

234
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,420
It's nice.

235
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,920
How's the work?

236
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,269
It's fine.

237
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Interesting?

238
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,020
Sometimes.

239
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,611
What is it you do?

240
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,880
Strategic analyst, Dad. OK?

241
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Aye.

242
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,380
Well... done any good, um...

243
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,240
analysing recently?

244
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:35,389
I do my best.

245
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,089
Well... as long as you've
done your best.

246
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,360
Aye, that's the main thing, Da.

247
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,680
That's the main thing.

248
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,360
Who's that?

249
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,640
Nobody.

250
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,000
And... Sidney...

251
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,940
- You still in the school, boy?
- Oh, A-levels, you know?

252
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,120
A-levels? I hear they make them
nice and easy for you down here.

253
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,320
- What?
- Subjects?

254
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,160
Um, English, drama and psychology.

255
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,260
Psychology? It's piss easy.

256
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,012
No need o' psychology,

257
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:15,640
staring doon the sights
o' a Stinger missile, ken, aye?

258
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,319
Maybe Sidney is gonna be a...

259
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,011
strategic analyst like his father.

260
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,423
I might,
if my grades are good enough.

261
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:26,719
Never rated grades.

262
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:30,119
Few years in the Paratroopers
like Sandy here,

263
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
that's wisdom.

264
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,160
Aye. You learn early.
You learn hard.

265
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,442
So now he's taking over
the business.

266
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,029
He's what?

267
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,549
I'm standing aside...

268
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,400
because of my illness.

269
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,982
The doctors are shaking their heads.
Nae idea.

270
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:50,900
Pure phenomenal, Da.

271
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,919
It's will. Iron will!

272
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,519
Guts. Determination.

273
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,640
Never say die, and here I have it.

274
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,069
My legacy.

275
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,799
Sandy?

276
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,591
Sandy's gonna run
12 dry-cleaning shops?

277
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,320
17.

278
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,500
Bathgate is opening up.
City of the future.

279
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,283
I'm leaving the business
in safe hands.

280
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,479
Is that what you've come to tell me?

281
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,520
Och, no. Wouldnae have bothered
coming all that way for...

282
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,040
No, I'm buying a wee holiday place

283
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,199
in Devon for Sandy
and the weans here.

284
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,759
Nothing too fancy.

285
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,840
1.7 million, ken, aye.

286
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,479
Small change. Ye cannae put too high
a price on loyalty, eh, no Liza?

287
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,379
No, Alex. But my names's not...

288
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,633
Liza, you're a saint.

289
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,680
A good cook is a saint.

290
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:48,160
And she's a saint
for taking pity on you.

291
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:53,411
She took you back.

292
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Lucky.

293
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:01,489
So...

294
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,320
Do you wanna go on the swing?

295
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,640
Slide?

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,960
Spliff?

297
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,559
No? Say anything you like doing.
Anything at all.

298
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,560
Fitba.

299
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,799
You what?

300
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Fitba.

301
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh!

302
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,420
Think I've got one...

303
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,889
Used to... A-ha!

304
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,400
Football!

305
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,839
Not too good at this.

306
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,959
How about I go in goal and...?

307
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,568
Square go!

308
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,185
- Ya bastard!
- Stick the heid on him!

309
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,224
Hold still.

310
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:58,679
Will I tell him what we used
to do to bullies in the desert, pal?

311
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,960
- But... I didn't.
- I'm sure it was an accident.

312
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,878
We used to tie them to
the bonnet o' the Saracen,

313
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:07,120
roast their bollocks for
a couple o' hours, ken, aye.

314
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,159
You'll never dance
the fucking samba again.

315
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,519
That's enough.

316
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:13,928
Aye, Da.

317
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,600
Sidney's sorry. Aren't ye, son?

318
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,119
Yes.

319
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
There you go.

320
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,760
Sorted like men.

321
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,419
Now, if you'll just tell us
where we're sleeping, hen.

322
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,519
- Wait a minute!
- You're staying?

323
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,140
Couple of days. Three, tops.

324
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,720
Don't want to put you out.

325
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,260
I am not sleeping with you
just cos your fucking dad's here!

326
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,600
I had no idea they were staying.

327
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,020
Why don't you stand up to him?
Tell him.

328
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,039
I can't.
He's dying for Christ's sake!

329
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,480
Oh! I'm going home.

330
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,799
Tell me there's not a part of you
that wants to stay.

331
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,060
Mark...

332
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,399
You're not good for me.

333
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,020
Tell me you don't love me.

334
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,679
Go on.
Tell him you don't love him.

335
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:18,347
Then you can fucking stop this. OK?

336
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,340
Answer it.

337
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
Hello.

338
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,460
No, I'm still here.

339
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes, well, it's a bit difficult.

340
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,436
No, I'm sorry, Manfred.
I meant to text but... Don't!

341
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,639
No. No, of course not.

342
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,320
Oh, Manfred.

343
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,540
You're not coming round!

344
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,660
No. No!

345
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,200
- Mark! Mark!
- Yes, Dad.

346
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,000
I cannae get hot water.

347
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,040
What?
You have to jiggle the thing.

348
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,479
Then fix it, man.
What's wrong with you?

349
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,220
- I haven't had the time.
- Time?

350
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,740
Time?!

351
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,679
How long does it take to strip
down a shower unit? Minutes!

352
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Da! Da!

353
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
It's OK.

354
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,580
Sorted. Some eejit forced
the pressure regulator.

355
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:22,560
Aye...

356
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
So...

357
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm going.

358
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,340
I'm going to bed.

359
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,980
Goodnight.

360
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,320
Handsome young lassie,
always said that.

361
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,369
Och, aye. She's steamy.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,960
I hope I can sleep tonight
in that bed.

363
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,900
Man in my condition.

364
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,420
Night, bro.

365
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,000
Alex, Sandy, Lex, Ally.

366
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,020
Kinda weird.

367
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,780
They're all called Alexander.

368
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:18,405
Yup.

369
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:23,055
- Except you.
- Except me.

370
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,820
Why don't you stand up to him?

371
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,620
Dad's always been ill.

372
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,437
- What with?
- It's, er...

373
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't actually know.

374
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:45,580
I think every time I see him,
it's gonna be the last time and...

375
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,360
You can't take chances with that.

376
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,120
He calls you stupid
and useless and crap.

377
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,607
My father's disappointed.

378
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,620
They often are.

379
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,160
Is that how you see me?

380
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,439
Never.

381
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,702
I'm useless and crap.

382
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:08,705
I fuck everything up
and it drives you mad.

383
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:10,712
You hear me, Sid?

384
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,520
Never.

385
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:16,760
Make her stay.

386
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Mark.

387
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Get into bed.

388
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:06,975
I'll probably never change
that much.

389
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:09,911
Don't talk.

390
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:13,061
Just do something.

391
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,760
I want you to do some...

392
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,810
Oh, ja... ist gut...!

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What?!

394
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,000
Nothing.

395
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
<i>Sid?</i>

396
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,280
<i>Sid, you there?</i>

397
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,520
<i>I found the button.</i>

398
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,052
<i>Sid?</i>

399
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,732
<i>I can see you!</i>

400
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,560
<i>That's so cool.</i>

401
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>I could fucking see everything
you were doing.</i>

402
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
<i>What?</i>

403
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,600
<i>Oh, God! No, that was...</i>

404
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
<i>- I'm such a tit.
- Sid?</i>

405
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:20,720
<i>I just thought...</i>

406
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,659
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

407
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,994
<i>Nothing ever works out, does it?
Nobody ever waits.</i>

408
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>Nobody ever loves anyone properly,
do they?</i>

409
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
- <i>You've got it wrong, Sid.</i>
- <i>Just leave me alone.</i>

410
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,307
- <i>You rang me!</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

411
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,328
<i>Don't you trust me, Sid?</i>

412
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,609
<i>No.</i>

413
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,680
<i>I don't trust you.</i>

414
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:50,720
<i>You're up there fucking
Oor Fucking Wullie or</i>

415
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,360
<i>whoever the fuck it is and...</i>

416
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:54,576
<i>I can't talk to you.</i>

417
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,189
Fuck!

418
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Shit!

419
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:34,622
Gott in Himmel!

420
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,880
Where is she?
Lizzie! Com raus!

421
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Hang on!

422
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,320
Lizzie! Liebchen!

423
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:45,839
You must come with me!

424
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,960
No, Manfred, please!

425
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:50,000
Who the fuck's this?

426
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,560
Manfred. He's a... friend.

427
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,920
Leave it to me!

428
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:58,320
Screw you, man!
I vant my chick!

429
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
What... Who?

430
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:06,880
Square go.

431
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:12,360
Get out!

432
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:16,320
I vant my baby! And vat I vant,

433
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:17,720
I take!

434
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Stop!

435
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,144
But, he is ein plinker!

436
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:26,114
You are saying, he is ein plinker!

437
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:27,240
Plonker.

438
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,200
- Right...
- I was angry.

439
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,774
It's fine.

440
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,760
Manfred, you're bleeding.
I'm going to take you to hospital.

441
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,476
I feel nothing! Nothing...

442
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:44,799
I'll call you in a couple of days.

443
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,809
I need time to think.

444
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:48,427
OK?

445
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,349
Manfred? Manfred?

446
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,180
Raus!

447
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
We're going to hospital.

448
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:15,640
Cannae hold on to your woman, eh?

449
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,048
Fuck off out of my house,
you miserable Scottish cunt.

450
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,783
You... You, you... what?!

451
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,165
I know what your game is, Alex.

452
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:36,240
It's a fucking good yin.
But I'm not buying it. You got me?

453
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:38,481
Dad?

454
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,469
It's OK, Sid.

455
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,720
They're all leaving!

456
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:45,820
Right now!

457
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:04,419
OK?

458
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,866
Yup.

459
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:20,160
I think I dumped Cassie.

460
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:24,003
She's with some guy.

461
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,360
They're always with some guy.

462
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:30,680
If they're special,

463
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,440
you just have to make sure that
that guy...

464
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,153
is you.

465
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,130
All right?

466
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,040
Thanks, Dad.

467
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,320
No problem, son.

468
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:07,974
Little Scottish bastards.

469
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,445
Hey, Cassie.

470
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:14,448
Everything was a bit weird.

471
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:17,160
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

472
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,144
Er, we need to talk now.

473
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:22,661
Everything's...

474
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:31,120
Jesus,
the fucking signal in this house!

475
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,320
<i>Sorry. The user has blocked
your call.</i>

476
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:39,437
Idiot!

477
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,154
Ah, fuck!

478
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:07,929
Dad?

479
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:34,707
Dad?

480
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:50,000
You sure you're OK with that, Tony?

481
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,880
It's fine. Give me a sec.

482
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,240
Maybe you should take it easy, mate.

483
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,880
Jesus, Chris,
maybe you should take it easy!

484
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,600
Nah. Angie's coming back today.
I'm a bit...

485
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
She's been in touch?

486
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,039
Not as such. But I know
she still loves me.

487
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,520
Chris. She's your psychology teacher.
It was just a fling.

488
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,840
No, it wasn't.
OK? She needed her space.

489
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,480
Right, and now I really need her
naked, buffed, gagging and slippy

490
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
in my bed, because...

491
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,371
You know, four months without sex,
that ain't funny.

492
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,799
You probably
wouldn't understand that, Jal.

493
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,115
You don't have sex at all, do you?
You have clarinet lessons.

494
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:33,240
I do... I mean, I have had...

495
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,960
Look, we're not counting
fapping here, Jal, right,

496
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,839
cos if we were, I'd have had sex
14 times in two days.

497
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,560
I haven't had sex for...

498
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,120
A long time.

499
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,304
Right.

500
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:47,240
OK, in summary then,
we all need some pussy action.

501
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,720
And I shall be getting mine
tonight with the lovely Angela.

502
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,850
Hey, you all right Sid?

503
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:01,479
- You two still not talking?
- He stopped coming round.

504
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,719
Tony, he sat with you for months.
He read fucking Anna Karenina to you.

505
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,760
I don't remember.
He must have stopped.

506
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,400
Mate.

507
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,200
Hey, Sid. Do your coursework?

508
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,972
No...

509
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,280
Morning! All right.

510
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,720
Yes, quickly please.

511
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,120
First of all, I've had a word
with the Imam at Redcliffe Mosque

512
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,320
about the school musical last month.

513
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,480
I explained that
it was all meant to be ironic

514
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,437
and he was very understanding.

515
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,624
He's not exactly sure
who imposed the fatwa,

516
00:34:55,744 --> 00:34:57,080
but it wasn't him.

517
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:00,080
Probably somebody in Iran.

518
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,040
So - what a relief.

519
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:05,332
And secondly, I have to inform you

520
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:07,600
that Angela will not be returning

521
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,600
to teach psychology at the college.

522
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,040
She's sent me this message.

523
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,440
"Dear everyone.
I'll never forget you and hope

524
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,560
"you all do great in the A2s."
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

525
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,381
And I don't quite understand this.

526
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:25,521
"Tell Monkeyman
I'll miss the spaghetti."

527
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:26,720
Anyone?

528
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,360
In the meantime,
I'll be doing my best.

529
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,120
Biology, psychology,
is there really any difference?

530
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,680
So folders open,
and let's make a start on...

531
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,040
Loss! Oh, fantastic!

532
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,733
So what do we all know about loss?

533
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,220
Sid?

534
00:36:13,186 --> 00:36:15,920
I didn't know what to do.
So I came to college.

535
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:18,840
What's happened?

536
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:29,086
Everyone says you looked after me
when I was... iconic.

537
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:32,506
Intimate.

538
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,331
Fuck! Fuck!

539
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Ill...

540
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,680
I mean, ill.

541
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:46,560
I just can't remember you.

542
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:50,142
I reckon it was pretty scary.

543
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,200
I know why you stopped coming.
I would have, too.

544
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,560
It was so awful.

545
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:01,925
You were so awful.

546
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,960
That bus fucked you up so bad, Tone.

547
00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:08,921
I just couldn't...

548
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:10,560
I know.

549
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,640
What's happened?

550
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,348
I can't say it.

551
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:31,619
Know how that feels.

552
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,830
Let's go for a drink.

553
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,307
Sid?

554
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,176
Tony! Hi! Tony!

555
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:01,900
Oh. Hi, Abi.

556
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,199
Aren't we so kicking?

557
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,300
James says he wants me to sing
lead on his next song he writes

558
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,900
because I'm like totally
Performance Art.

559
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,500
Anyway, I bet you can't wait
to take me home tonight, yah?

560
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:16,599
I'm with Sid.

561
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:20,039
You wouldn't
desert your girlfriend, OK?

562
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,079
You're not his girlfriend.

563
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:26,380
Well, actually I don't think
you get to decide that, Sidney.

564
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:28,820
Tony loves Michelle.

565
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,780
They're having a few problems.

566
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:32,660
He can't remember stuff well.

567
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,820
But I know whatever
you've told him is a total lie.

568
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,380
So fuck off
and leave him alone. OK?

569
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,519
Tony! You remember?

570
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,100
I have nipples like
creme caramels, yah?

571
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:52,900
Sid says I love Michelle.

572
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,980
No!

573
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,410
You... You...

574
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,786
I'll be back.

575
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:08,820
The moment you've all been
waiting for. Crystal Castles. Yeah!

576
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,072
Where?

577
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,408
I can't go in.

578
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,829
Yes, you can.

579
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,860
Come on.

580
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,004
Ficking hell.

581
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:26,349
Fucking...

582
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Yeah.

583
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,180
Fucking hell.

584
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,740
Dad?

585
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:58,533
Is this really happening?

586
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,660
I think so.

587
00:44:34,428 --> 00:44:36,959
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do to him.

588
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,829
Ring someone.

589
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,215
I can't,

590
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,309
they'll come.

591
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:47,941
They'll all fucking come.

592
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,220
Do you think he'd mind?

593
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,547
He was so happy.

594
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,860
My mum.

595
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,519
Oh, Christ.

596
00:45:36,681 --> 00:45:37,681
OK.

597
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,340
Dad?

598
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,340
What do I do?

599
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,860
Mum?

- You went to see Tony?
- It's over, Sid.

603
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:07,820
{\a3}It's a present.
For the good times.
