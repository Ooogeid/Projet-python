1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:01,320
{\a3}You want it. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:06,040
{\a3}Why can't you get better for me?

3
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:09,480
{\a3}We had so much and
it's all fucked up forever.

4
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:11,160
{\a3}I'm so lonely.

5
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:12,640
{\a3}I know.

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,520
{\a3}Do you remember when you
rode with me

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,806
{\a3}in the ambulance
after I tried to kill myself?

8
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:19,926
{\a3}Of course.

9
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:23,000
{\a3}That's what love feels like.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,360
{\a3}What are you doing?

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,520
{\a3}Lovely Sid
and lovely Michelle are fucking.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,119
{\a3}We're not... Not in the
way you're thinking.

13
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,566
Effy?

14
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,846
What's wrong?

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,526
It keeps happening.

16
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,459
OK. Lie down.

17
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:42,566
- Do you mind?
- No.

18
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,292
I like this story, anyway.

19
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:46,640
Thanks.

20
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:53,476
"Orpheus was the greatest
poet who ever lived.

21
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:55,252
"His music was so beautiful

22
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:57,846
that when he played
rivers would stop flowing,

23
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,014
"winds would stop blowing,

24
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:01,926
"and the skies would open up

25
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:05,696
"so his wondrous melodies could
be heard by the Gods in heaven.

26
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,641
"One day, his wife Eurydice
was bitten to death by vipers.

27
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:16,126
"Overcome with grief,

28
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:19,196
"Orpheus played
heartbreaking songs on his lyre.

29
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,196
<i>"The Gods were moved,</i>

30
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:25,876
<i>"and so advised Orpheus
to travel to the land of the dead</i>

31
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,808
<i>"and sing his songs to Hades
to bargain for his wife.</i>

32
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:35,120
<i>"So it was
that Hades' heart was softened.</i>

33
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,366
<i>"And he allowed Eurydices

<i>"and never look back."</i>

36
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:48,529
- Hey! Here he is!
- Looking good, mate.

37
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:49,959
Cheers. I feel quite good.

38
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,688
Eh. What's going on here, then?

39
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:58,040
Ah you know, man...
The winds of change.

40
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,725
Rivers of blood and all that.

41
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,000
Shit getting wild, man.
Him and her,

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,480
Sid and Michelle...

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,919
- Ow! Easy, man.
- Yeah. Where is Sid?

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,428
He came early...

45
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:08,574
with Michelle.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
- All right?
- It's loud.

47
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,702
You all right?

48
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,040
What do you mean?

49
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,120
You look a bit...

50
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:38,766
I'm fine.

51
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:42,086
Loudest club in the west, mate.
You gonna be all right?

52
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,656
Yeah. I'll be fine.

53
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:48,580
Hey, Tony...

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
Hey, Cass. Are we going somewhere?

55
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:51,886
Oh, yes...

56
00:03:57,316 --> 00:04:00,103
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.

57
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,783
Isn't that sweet?

58
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm sad about them.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Aren't you?

60
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm fine and dandy.

61
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,980
Good. We're just fine and dandy...

62
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:31,320
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.

63
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,765
I think that since Sid and Michelle
are together,

64
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,885
we should do the same.

65
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:44,527
What, go out?

66
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,086
Yeah!

67
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,406
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?

68
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:49,526
Yeah!

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,526
And we'd talk and eat dim sum,

70
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:54,258
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...

71
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,893
But I'd knock my head on the door
frame and fall down.

72
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,446
I'd get the witch hazel.

73
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,208
And I'd say, "Witch hazel?

74
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:02,676
"What are you, 90?
Get some fucking painkillers."

75
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:05,766
And I'd say, "Hey, it's
an excellent astringent,

76
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,239
"and we're out of aspirin."

77
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,286
I'd turn the argument
into a good, hard, angry fuck.

78
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:12,726
Well, that's where we might
have a problem.

79
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,196
What do you mean?

80
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,368
I've got...

81
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,141
a bit of a problem in
the downstairs department.

82
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:19,239
What?

83
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,606
You know, downstairs.

84
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,086
What?! Where?!

85
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,656
Oh, for fuck's sake!

86
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,959
- My cock doesn't work!
- What?

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,670
My cock doesn't work!

88
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:41,967
Hi...

89
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:44,552
He's watching us.

90
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:51,587
We can't help it, Sid.

91
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:53,655
No.

92
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:01,200
It's OK, isn't it?

93
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,227
Isn't it?

94
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,840
It's fine. We're fine.

95
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:08,926
Fine.

96
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,126
OK?

97
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,640
- I'm fine...
- And dandy...

98
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,163
Whoa! Here it comes...

99
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,760
Oh, I've missed this.
Fucking hell, I've missed this...

100
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,000
I feel good!

101
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:32,206
Yes, but take it easy, Tony.

102
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,456
I feel so...

103
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,360
fucking good!

104
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,080
What about our date?

105
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:41,796
You all right?

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm balalaika, feathered up,
and ready to rock da party!

107
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:47,360
Yeah, boy!

108
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:34,568
Dude. I can't believe you're going
out with Michelle.

109
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,806
It just kind of happened.

110
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,286
But you're... you know.

111
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:39,850
What?

112
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,767
Well, you're not exactly...

113
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:44,076
Not exactly what, exactly?

114
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,646
Not exactly, you know.

115
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:49,596
A player, a don,
an R Kelly, a baby daddy...

116
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,086
All right. I get it.

117
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,402
A smooth criminal,
a president of the USA,

118
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,347
a buddha buddha buddha
cheese buddha.

119
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:57,086
Hey, Sid.

120
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,600
- Er... You having a good evening?
- I'm just marvellous, Sidney.

121
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,759
Like hell on Earth in here.
Glorious.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,121
Yourself?

123
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,086
Er, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

124
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,676
Excellent!
Vibrant! Superb!

125
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,399
So glad to hear it!

126
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,000
- Tony, are you OK?
- I'm top-notch, buddy.

127
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,320
Enjoying your night out?

128
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:22,839
Me too.

129
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,341
Hey, Nips.

130
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,199
- Don't call her Nips, Tony.
- Why, what you gonna do?

131
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm, uh, objecting.

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,239
Strongly.

133
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:52,839
- Come on...
- Tony, what are you doing?

134
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,599
Isn't she pretty, hey man?

135
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,115
Tony.

136
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,359
You two make such a sweet couple!

137
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:06,039
Out of all the world's famous
lovers - Anthony and Cleopatra...

138
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,791
Taylor and Burton,
Jordan and Peter...

139
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:09,986
Stop it.

140
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Bert and Ernie...

141
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:13,560
I would say that you two are

142
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,526
quite possibly the greatest snog
history has so far encountered.

143
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:19,086
What is wrong with you, Tony?
Are you OK?

144
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,999
What is it with you people
and the concept of OK?

145
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,839
I mean, we're a fucking threesome,
aren't we? You know... peas in a pod.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,999
A fucking family, that's what we are.

147
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,319
D'you need to sit down?

148
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,559
Just calm down.

149
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,270
No... I need to...
I don't... I've got...

150
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,937
I need to go...

151
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,319
Out of my way!

152
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:05,890
It's a panic attack. That's all.

153
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:07,641
What?

154
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:11,356
It sounds like you're
having a panic attack.

155
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:14,141
I can't breathe, I can't...

156
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:17,636
Maybe it's because you
wanna fuck your sister.

157
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:18,566
What?

158
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,836
Do you want to fuck your sister?

159
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:23,028
No! Jesus!

160
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:26,006
It's just people say panic
attacks come from some deeply

161
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,276
repressed sexual urges. You know?

162
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:30,520
What?

163
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:33,056
I was just testing a theory, see.

164
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:40,036
Actually, I'm talking shit,
cos it turns out a panic attack's

165
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:43,326
just a fuckload of adrenaline
mainlining into your heart.

166
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,596
It's just how we deal with danger.

167
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,882
Fight or flight, they call it.
Right?

168
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,680
I don't know you.

169
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,119
Are you a fighter or a
flighter, Tony Stonem?

170
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:56,696
Cos depending on your answer...

171
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,086
well...

172
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,316
A lot depends on your answer.

173
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:03,999
I'll see you around.

174
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:40,320
Hi, Effy. How are you?

175
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm fine.
How are you?

176
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:46,086
Good.

177
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:48,936
Is Tony here?
We need to speak to him.

178
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,755
Tea? Coffee, anyone?

179
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,766
- Er... no, thanks.
- Er, no, I'm fine.

180
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:09,806
Tony?

181
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,076
No, thank you.

182
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,274
You OK, Tony?
You seem a little under...

183
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,176
well, under the bed.

184
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:21,726
I'm fine.

185
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,416
Tony, come out.

186
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:25,996
I'd prefer not to.

187
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,616
Listen.
I think we need to talk about this.

188
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,286
I really don't know what you mean.

189
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,239
Well, me and Sid are together now.

190
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:36,523
Yeah.
I know.

191
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:39,256
And you're obviously not OK with it.

192
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,316
Who says I'm not?

193
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,548
Well, er, you did, pretty much.
Last night.

194
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,286
Oh, come on.
I was only taking the piss.

195
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,256
You know...
cos it's funny?

196
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,679
Listen, do you mind?
I've got an interview.

197
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,726
Got to get ready.

198
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:59,204
All right.
Oh, OK. See you later, Tone.

199
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:06,406
Bye, Tony.

200
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:11,966
Bye.

201
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,033
Fuck!

202
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:36,220
Take this.
It's stuff. Maps and shit.

203
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:37,566
OK.

204
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,119
You look really good, Tony.
Like you're ready for anything.

205
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,235
Thanks. See you later.

206
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,608
I'm gonna tell you a story.

207
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,335
A bloke,

208
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,256
he wakes up one morning.

209
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,126
He gets dressed.
He goes down the stairs.

210
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:54,896
He makes himself a
little bit of breakfast.

211
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,446
He walks to the garage,
he gets in his car.

212
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,846
He starts his car. Drives off,
I don't know, a couple of miles.

213
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:02,616
Stops. Gets out his car.

214
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:06,536
Has a couple of blokes pour
petrol over his head and...

215
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,122
Sets fire to himself.

216
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,809
He... What?

217
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,200
He sets fire to himself.
Fucking boom!

218
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:22,436
What's in the bag?

219
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:25,596
My sandwiches.

220
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,496
So what we got?

221
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,719
Ham and cheese, chicken,
or egg and cress.

222
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:35,216
Egg and cress...

223
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,716
Isn't life wonderful?

224
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:54,880
You looking?

225
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,472
I don't... what?

226
00:16:58,046 --> 00:16:59,696
Few scars, few marks...

227
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,556
What do you think of them?

228
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:07,759
I think they're horrible.

229
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,960
At least I got 'em, mate.
Cos I fucking wear 'em.

230
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,406
Right...

231
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:13,776
How about you?

232
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,176
Do you... have any marks?

233
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:18,920
- No. I'm fine.
- Oh, yeah, course you are...

234
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,639
You're fine and dandy.

235
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:25,600
Right?

236
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,496
Egg and cress...

237
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,596
It's a little fucking miracle.

238
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:33,973
18 years old. The age of opportunity.

239
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:37,076
I bet you can't wait to come here!

240
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:40,566
Imagine it... being able to
live away from your parents and

241
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:45,120
you can do anything you like, like
stay up all night and eat ice cream!

242
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:47,286
Derek.

243
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,371
Thanks, Polly.
So.

244
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:54,689
New home, new friends, new horizons.

245
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,286
The good times, the bad times...

246
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:59,319
The parties...
oh, my God, the parties!

247
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:03,280
The loves that will never be,
even though they seem so right.

248
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,320
Just remember though,
that if you will drink -

249
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,558
and personally
I have a bitter lemon...

250
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:16,899
But if you do, just don't over-do it,
or you won't be able to get up

251
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,120
in the morning for your lectures!

252
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:25,190
So, any more questions
before group sessions?

253
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,616
Are you two shagging or what?

254
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:34,867
No, we're not.

255
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,991
I adore Derek to bits.
But he's more like a brother.

256
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,879
But you'll make friends
like that here too.

257
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,479
Friends who appreciate
that you never,

258
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,876
never, never want that to happen.

259
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:51,172
So... No.

260
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:54,016
We're certainly not doing that.

261
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:57,996
No. We're not... We're...

262
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:00,446
truly not.

263
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:05,637
Any more questions before...
Thank you.

264
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:07,516
You know, if you don't
work together, then you'll...

265
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,280
You're late.

266
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,520
Sorry... I couldn't find the room.

267
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,879
And yet everybody else
seems to have managed,

268
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,000
which I find kind of spooky,
really.

269
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:22,726
Sorry.

270
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,486
Please...

271
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:32,486
So. Whilst you were
meandering around the corridors,

272
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,355
we were introducing ourselves.

273
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:37,772
Martin, you were telling us
what you did on your gap year?

274
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,719
Yeah... As I was saying, I spent
most of my time in Central America.

275
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,399
You know, building bridges

276
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:47,085
of the real,
and the symbolic variety.

277
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,720
You know, just really teaching

278
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
the people out there
out there the value of teamwork.

279
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:54,145
So 6,000 years of tribal society,

280
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:57,396
they still hadn't managed to grasp
the rudiments of teamwork.

281
00:21:57,606 --> 00:22:01,123
Sloppy. They must have been
delighted that you showed up.

282
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,486
- You next.
- Me?

283
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:12,816
Yes, yes, you. Enlighten us. Do.

284
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:15,646
Um, OK.

285
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:18,736
I'm Tony Stonem.

286
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:21,154
I go to college...
I live in...

287
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:24,356
I actually said enlighten us,
don't bore us, Mr Stonem.

288
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:27,879
Speak about yourself, about your
motives, your drive, your animus.

289
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,177
Don't know what
animus means, do you?

290
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,470
- Yes. I know what it means.
- Well, I'm relieved.

291
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:39,587
You see because at this university,

292
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:41,600
we don't have room
for the inarticulate.

293
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,399
I think I'd better go, then.

294
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:47,240
Bye.

295
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,000
Good.
So Tony, you were about to tell us

296
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,996
just how extremely clever you are.

297
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:01,546
- I'm not that clever.
- Oh, he's clever all right.

298
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:03,867
Really?

299
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,736
Touching.
Sadly lacking in substance.

300
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:12,635
At our university you have to have
verve, a sense of charisma -

301
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:14,736
intellectual thrust.

302
00:23:14,856 --> 00:23:18,055
And that's what we're here to do
this afternoon, is find out whether

303
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,563
you're a giver.

304
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:22,816
- Whether you're...
- Willing to sleep with the lecturers?

305
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,359
- I'm sorry?
- I was just making the point, sir,

306
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:31,074
that you've been screwing every girl
in here with your eyes since we arrived,

307
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:34,731
which suggests that
sex ranks higher than substance.

308
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:36,716
And I'll pass, thanks.

309
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:40,879
You see, I don't really find
intellectual thrust that sexy...

310
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:43,799
Or fake tan, for that matter.

311
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,066
Oh, you think that's funny, do you?

312
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:50,345
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.

313
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:52,763
The thing is,
I don't actually have to put up...

314
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:55,320
OK. Cool.
See you!

315
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:02,965
I think you should join her.
Don't you, Tony?

316
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:10,566
Toodle-oo.

317
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:17,566
You.

318
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:32,256
You really fucked up in there.

319
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:36,026
I really fucked up? Wait,
what are you even doing here, anyway?

320
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:37,596
Same thing you are.

321
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,101
Wow! Check it out.

322
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:56,249
Ah... Shall we?

323
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:59,826
No. No way. First of all,

324
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:02,506
I can't really swim very well
any more and secondly...

325
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,776
Ahh, boo-hoo.

326
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:09,946
What the fuck?!

327
00:25:10,627 --> 00:25:11,960
I told you, I can't...

328
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:15,506
I can't... Can't swim...

329
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:17,430
Oh, you're such a pussy.

330
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:22,666
I can't.

331
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:25,626
You just don't want to. Lie back.

332
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:28,014
That's it.

333
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:29,986
You're OK.

334
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
It's easy.

335
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:36,119
Just float.

336
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:01,996
Excuse me.

337
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,141
Come here, please.

338
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:16,186
Come on... Bit naughty.

339
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:17,677
Never mind.

340
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,356
Up you come.

341
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:32,646
- Tony - is that right?
- Yes.

342
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:36,645
Now, Tony, the thing is, we're not
really supposed to go in the pool.

343
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:38,946
It's really only
for sporting events.

344
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,959
And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club.

345
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,896
And the Super Irony
Fun Splash Club, too.

346
00:26:44,321 --> 00:26:45,919
You're supposed to be on the tour.

347
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:48,466
There was this girl, but she's gone.

348
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:50,599
Don't go with her, Tony.

349
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,520
- What?
- You should join us.

350
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:55,160
What?

351
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,171
Yes. We'll find you
somewhere you can dry off.

352
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:01,594
You should get out of
those wet clothes, too.

353
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,839
I'd really like to see
you out of those clothes.

354
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:08,160
I'll lend you my cagoule.

355
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:11,976
I'm all right, thanks. Just...

356
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:13,617
I'm all right.

357
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,719
Built in 1972, then
demolished the following year

358
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:21,928
before being rebuilt in 85,

359
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,776
the Bulwer-Lytton building
is a classic example

360
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:27,746
of the late modernist,
post-Bauhaus development

361
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:30,816
from humanist rationalist
impulses from utility.

362
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:35,057
Inspired by Alvar Aalto's signature
style, the building is built...

363
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:36,056
Psst!

364
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,479
In here. Come in here.

365
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:43,491
... Social interaction and the hyper
relevance of volume as, er...

366
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:51,119
I wanna talk to you.

367
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,612
Come here, then.

368
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:58,391
What are you doing?

369
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:02,099
The idea is to walk across the room.

370
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:05,149
The room's full of shit.

371
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:06,906
This is a lab.

372
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,476
It's an experiment.

373
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,066
Come here.

374
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,661
For fuck's sake.

375
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:21,255
Fuck.

376
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:24,626
Oh, shit!

377
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:33,648
Bollocks.

378
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:38,700
Well done.

379
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,520
Well done?

380
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,656
You got here, though.

381
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:47,856
What do you want from me?

382
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:51,469
Hey! Who's in there? Over here!

383
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:52,639
Better run.

384
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:56,520
Hey! Stop! Come back here, you!

385
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:59,759
Oi! They're going down
the science block.

386
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,725
Come back!

387
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,466
Halls of residence.

388
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:20,586
Shall we?

389
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:41,205
Good afternoon.

390
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:42,746
How may I help you?

391
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:46,091
We're seeking shelter
from the fascist oppressors.

392
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,056
And we're wet.

393
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:55,146
Can I interest you in some hashish?

394
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:56,826
I'm not really supposed to.

395
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,146
Drugs do odd things
to me at the moment.

396
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,916
Aren't they supposed to?

397
00:30:02,355 --> 00:30:03,466
This is Matt.

398
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,079
You want a hit from the bong?

399
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:07,900
He is an artist. Truly, an artist.

400
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:11,128
I'm Toby. His roommate.

401
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:16,746
And this is of the purest,
highest possible grade.

402
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:18,016
I assure you.

403
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:19,528
Cool!

404
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,800
Bravo!

405
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,800
All splendid fun.

406
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:33,386
Polly! My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?

407
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:37,625
I'm going to pretend that
I don't smell that, Toby.

408
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,320
Smell what, mon petit chou?

409
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:42,639
It's very, very naughty
what you're doing, Toby.

410
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:44,996
Quite possibly.

411
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:46,719
Anyway. Have you seen a...

412
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,466
wet boy running around here?

413
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:52,066
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.

414
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,369
We have witnessed no moist children

415
00:30:56,489 --> 00:31:00,039
of the masculine variety
gallivanting within these halls, no.

416
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:03,229
Oh, hey, Poll. How's it going?

417
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:04,599
Oh... Hi, Matt.

418
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,839
You, er,
you thought about what I asked you?

419
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,004
Yes, actually, I have...

420
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,200
And?

421
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:13,625
All right, you can shag me.
But only once.

422
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:16,547
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.

423
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:18,917
Fine. I'll be around later.

424
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:34,906
Can't allow our friends
to be naked alone, Matthew.

425
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,576
It's just not cricket.

426
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,091
Got ya...

427
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:00,986
They're beautiful.

428
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:03,369
Oh, thanks.

429
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:05,314
I do them myself.

430
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:06,395
Do you?

431
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:07,560
Yeah.

432
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,799
So you could do me... now?

433
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:12,667
Sure...

434
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,465
if you're up for it.

435
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:33,222
Does it hurt?

436
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,155
Beautifully.

437
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,624
What are you getting?

438
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:42,479
A mark...

439
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:44,694
Passion...

440
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:48,849
Want...

441
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:51,878
Need...

442
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:01,520
My, my.

443
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,007
Thank you.

444
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,476
My...

445
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,773
My pleasure.

446
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,551
Come and look at it.

447
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:22,999
What's it like?

448
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:24,946
Good.

449
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,066
Touch it.

450
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:27,626
What?

451
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,070
Touch it.

452
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:38,988
I can't do this.

453
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:41,489
So many things you can't do.

454
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:45,465
You can't swim, you can't run...

455
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:47,839
You can't fuck.

456
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:50,440
Oh, dear.

457
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,106
How d'you know that?

458
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:55,534
But you can, Tony Stonem.

459
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:58,540
You can fuck me right now.

460
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:01,079
- No, I couldn't.
- You want to.

461
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,391
Hey, fuck you!

462
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:05,333
I got hit by a fucking bus.
That fucks you up.

463
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:06,840
Well, fuck you right back.

464
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,706
You're just not trying hard enough.

465
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:11,176
You must be so happy
the way you are.

466
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:13,540
Why do you care if my dick
can get hard or not?

467
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,000
This is fucked up beyond words.

468
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,000
Coward. Fucking coward.

469
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:18,986
Coward.

470
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:20,240
Wanker.

471
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:23,461
Why don't you just stop being
such a fucking pussy

472
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:26,275
and let the fuck go?

473
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,475
Fucking leave me alone!

474
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:50,946
There you are.

475
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,158
Are you OK?

476
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:55,336
Look at you, you poor thing.

477
00:34:56,361 --> 00:35:00,106
Come with us. We'll get you some
warm clothes and a nice hot tea.

478
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:03,946
The Musical Society are going to
do a performance for all of you.

479
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,628
HMS Pinafore.

480
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:08,319
# I've treacle and toffee,
I've tea and I've coffee

481
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,115
# Soft tommy and succulent chops

482
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:15,186
# So buy of your Buttercup,
Poor Little Buttercup

483
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,456
# Come of your Buttercup, buy! #

484
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:20,786
Come back!
There'll be cheese and wine.

485
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:21,946
It'll be fun!

486
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,216
There's always cheese and wine!

487
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,980
Take a seat.

488
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:45,031
Eventful day.

489
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:49,079
Pissing around in pools, smashing
up labs, avoiding activities,

490
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,746
getting up to no good in the dorms.

491
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,466
- How'd you know what I...?
- And now you turn up

492
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,755
for an interview like,

493
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:00,955
well...

494
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,773
You know, I'm amazed you
actually even bothered, really.

495
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:07,611
But I'm a fair man,

496
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:10,036
so bearing all that in mind,

497
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,052
why don't you

498
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:17,162
try to convince me into offering
you a place at this university?

499
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:25,976
Oh, you think you're
so original, don't you?

500
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:29,284
I have met a million kids like you.

501
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah, vaguely intelligent.
Agonisingly middle-class.

502
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:35,031
Read a book by Camus,
a book by Kafka.

503
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,792
No real substance, though.

504
00:36:36,912 --> 00:36:39,546
Just a little
fucked-up jumble of misdirected,

505
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,838
immature, poly-sexuality
and pure,

506
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,200
arrogant, impotent rage.

507
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:49,949
So...

508
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:52,856
What you got, big boy?

509
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Get off me.

510
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,199
You don't know a fucking thing
about me, you sanctimonious cunt.

511
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:04,639
But since we're playing the guessing
game, let's make a few assumptions.

512
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:08,382
A divorced, lonely, middle-aged
lecturer, who lives alone

513
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:10,800
- and gets his rocks off...
- You're really fucking...

514
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:14,759
Gets his fucking rocks off trying
to sleep with fucking first years.

515
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,426
Other hobbies include intimidation
and furtive masturbation.

516
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:21,537
I bet you thought you'd died
and gone to heaven when you got here.

517
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,146
Your own office
and all the students you could eat.

518
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:25,920
- Let go of me.
- Animus.

519
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:30,670
It means spirit, courage,

520
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:32,636
passion,

521
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,399
wrath.

522
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:37,774
This is mine.

523
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:45,756
Who the fucking hell
do you think you are?

524
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,496
I'm a bad dream, mate.

525
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:50,040
I'm you before you shrivelled
and died.

526
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:54,016
And I don't wanna go
where you've been.

527
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,596
So in answer
to your earlier question,

528
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:01,796
you should've given me a place here.

529
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:04,519
I'd have been the best
student you'd ever had.

530
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,057
Here he comes. Welcome back, Tony.

531
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:33,069
Congratulations, Tony.
Good work, sir.

532
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:35,266
Enjoy.

533
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:37,386
The pleasure is all yours, sir.

534
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:39,256
The pleasure is all yours.

535
00:40:43,226 --> 00:40:44,576
You're not coming?

536
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,956
I think I'll stay
here for a while.

537
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,970
It's peaceful.

538
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,666
Go home.

539
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:03,116
It was good to meet you.

540
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:11,986
Thank you.

541
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:21,196
Don't look back, Tony.

542
00:42:23,726 --> 00:42:24,770
Hey, Tone.

543
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,556
Where are Sid and Michelle?

544
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:27,946
No idea.

545
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,746
You're a terrible liar, Jal.

546
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:33,302
Anybody can see you've
got something going on.

547
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:43,866
- Shit!
- Christ!

548
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:45,236
What the fuck?!

549
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:46,466
Tony!

550
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,719
- What the fuck are you...?
- Shut up!

551
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,246
- Sid, are you gonna let him?
- Tony, I'm objecting to...

552
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:54,121
You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?

553
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:55,890
OK. OK, Jesus.

554
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:02,186
Tony, what?

555
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,519
Are you trying to scare me,
because it's not working?

556
00:43:07,506 --> 00:43:08,556
I love you.

557
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,356
I'm saying it again. OK?

558
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:16,146
And you.

559
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:18,936
I love you too, you little fucker.

560
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,279
This is wrong.
Can't you see it's all wrong?

561
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,496
You're my girlfriend!

562
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,376
And you're my best friend.

563
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,266
- Tony, I love her.
- No, you don't.

564
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:36,736
OK, maybe I don't.

565
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,695
He loves Cassie.

566
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:40,714
And you love me.

567
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,134
That works.

568
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,260
- We work.
- Why now?

569
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,640
It's too late.

570
00:43:47,353 --> 00:43:50,160
It's always been there, Michelle.
It just took a while.

571
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:52,226
I need you.

572
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,316
You can't have her.

573
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:00,538
It's wrong.

574
00:44:02,946 --> 00:44:03,996
It's wrong.

575
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,246
That's all I'm trying to say.

576
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:48,000
Everything's gonna be
all right, Cass.

578
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,959
{\a3}Effy, 100% success.

579
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,822
{\a3}My art coursework.
It's on the subject of emotion

580
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:52,359
{\a3}and you seem quite emotional.
So you can do it for me.

581
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,799
{\a3}<i>I'm Pandora. I'm new.</i>

582
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:56,159
{\a3}Tell him I've discovered
the power of the pussy.

583
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,426
{\a3}And?

584
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,769
{\a3}I'll sort out your
fucking soap opera.

585
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,239
{\a3}And that, ladies, is why
Monet was shit.
