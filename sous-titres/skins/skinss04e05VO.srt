1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,599
You put a kid in hospital.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,439
I couldn't stand the way that
she was fucking looking at him.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,399
I love him.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,919
Sentence set for two
weeks from today.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,839
This house is being taken from us.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,839
- We need somewhere to stay.
- You're having a fucking laugh!

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,959
I fucked the dead girl,
and now she's punishing me for it.

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,239
I really fucking love you.

10
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,479
Raise it a million.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,239
<i>Ciao mi bella bambini!</i>

12
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,919
<i>I'm drinking a macchiato in
Saint Fucking Peter's Square,</i>

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,119
<i>exactly where we sat in the summer.</i>

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,119
<i>I'm just thinking of you.
Hope you're all right, darling.</i>

15
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,479
<i>I'm having an amazing time with Aldo</i>

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,319
<i>so, look, I'm gonna stay on
a bit longer, sweetheart</i>

17
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,079
<i>cos Rome shits on Bristol
from a height!</i>

18
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,039
<i>I'm missing you loads, and turn
your mobile on, love, yeah?</i>

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,679
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,839
<i>Va fan, fuck yourself!</i>

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,159
Morning, beautiful.

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,799
Oh, shit!

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,799
Judgment day.

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,799
Eff, what's the matter?

25
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,399
Come on, it won't be long.

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,599
It'll only be a bollocking about
attendance or something.

27
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,639
Just...don't.

28
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,199
You coming down?

29
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,799
Still up.

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,359
Way up.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,359
This is me happy.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,439
I can't miss a disciplinary.
Dad'll flip.

33
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,439
Be a long time dead.

34
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,959
Freddie?

35
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,959
Freddie, where have you been?
I was in the middle of doing your hair.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,919
Not now, Karen.

37
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,839
But if this style goes to shit
I'll fail my feathering module!

38
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,039
Oh! Not right now.

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,319
But I never see you any more. When
are you done with that fuck-a-thon?

40
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,319
Oh, you wanna sponsor me! That's
good cos we're saving the polar bears.

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,599
I want to cut your fucking hair.

42
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,959
Cobwebs. Got to be vigilant.

43
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,559
Stay out of my room, Dad.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,799
So you've been busy,
saving the polar bears?

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,359
Can you get out now, please?

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,079
Freddie, acknowledge your father.

47
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,079
Look, whatever the college says,
you do.

48
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
No more neglecting your studies.

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,319
I'm glad this young lady's
making you happy, but...

50
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
No, you're not, you're jealous.

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,039
What?

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,279
Clean yourself up.

53
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,279
Never thought I'd have to hide
in my own house.

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,679
- Salut, etranger!
- Hello, stranger!

55
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,159
I thought study was too 2009
for you and Effy.

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,359
Where is she anyway?

57
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,359
- She's at home. She didn't feel well.
- Trop de jiggy jig!

58
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,679
Don't you get... bored.
Reduced to a mechanism? I mean...

59
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,239
You just don't get it, do you, J?

60
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,759
Well, hallelujah for that.

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,679
Il y a quelqu'un pour chacun.

62
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,719
There's someone for everyone.

63
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,199
Right, boys, I've gotta go.

64
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,879
I've got a meeting with Mr. Love, Interim
Educational Intervention or something.

65
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,919
Tough Love!

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,359
Le Lips is tres, tres dans le merde!

67
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,959
I heard he power-hosed Dylan
Simpson for forging sick notes.

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,959
You could plead possible sexual
OCD for interfering with your study.

69
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,319
I'll bear that in mind, J.
See ya later.

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,879
What you staring at?

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,359
What are you waiting for?
Come in.

72
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,919
Door!

73
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,159
Frederick.

74
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,559
It's Freddie.

75
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,559
Why don't you sit down, Frederick?

76
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,039
Little to the left, please.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,999
Thank you.

78
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,319
So the history coursework,
I'm told, is late.

79
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,799
Yes, sorry.

80
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,359
In fact, I'm told that
everything you do is late

81
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,279
or inadequate

82
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,079
or both.

83
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,079
And do you know what late
and inadequate means for you...

84
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,919
..Frederick?

85
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,039
That's your life.

86
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,039
Right there.

87
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,279
You have until Monday to
complete the missing coursework.

88
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,439
Can you be adequate, Frederick?
Can you do that?

89
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,439
- I can try.
- Try?

90
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,879
What would Michael say?

91
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,079
Pardon?

92
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,439
Michael. What would he say?

93
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,679
- "I'm bad."
- Yes, and what else?

94
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,759
"Beat it"?

95
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,759
No. He'd say,
"Gotta be starting something."

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,439
OK?

97
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,959
Don't you think you
should be leaving?

98
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,479
Right now?

99
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,479
Yes.

100
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,239
Eff?

101
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,559
Eff, are you home?

102
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,559
Effy.

103
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,559
Eff, what are you doing
in your mum's room?

104
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,359
Effy.

105
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,879
What?

106
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,719
What is it?

107
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,199
You've found my porn stash.

108
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,679
Effy...

109
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,239
To make it easier.

110
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,479
All right, what the fuck did you take
cos you're not making any sense?

111
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,879
Easier to accept.

112
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,399
Accept.

113
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,519
The end.

114
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,519
End.

115
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,519
What fucking end would that be?

116
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,239
Mine...

117
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,239
Freddie.

118
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,439
You all right?

119
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,999
Hunky fucking dory.

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,999
Maybe just calm it down a bit, yeah?

121
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,879
I'm not the one grinding my teeth.

122
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,879
Both of us, for a bit. Or do you
want to fuck up your A levels?

123
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,839
Eff, please, just drop
the dark shit, yeah?

124
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,039
Effy, Effy, Eff, listen, all right?
OK? It's me.

125
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,159
OK? Me.

126
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,199
And this is me.

127
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,079
Jesus...I thought we were happy.

128
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,919
Too fucking happy.

129
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,119
Right, OK, what? So you want to end it?
Is that what you're trying to say?

130
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,559
No.

131
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,559
It's gonna happen.

132
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,599
Why are you head fucking me, Eff?

133
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,359
Cos I can't handle it.

134
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,359
Better fuck off then.

135
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,559
Where's Josie?

136
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,439
She's had a small breakdown.
I don't blame her.

137
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,439
I mean look...beanbags.

138
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,559
So, Frederick, how may I help you?

139
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,879
It's OK, I mean, I don't
actually think you can.

140
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,879
No, there's nothing
I cannot do, Frederick.

141
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,879
Nothing. I guarantee it.

142
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,239
All right.

143
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,519
OK.

144
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,119
So what do you do when
you can't tell anyone shit

145
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,519
cos it might really fuck things up

146
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,359
and you don't know what
to do or what's happening?

147
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,359
You just know that
something really, really...

148
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,919
...fucking bad is going down.

149
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,839
Just...

150
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,359
No.

151
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,839
I think...

152
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,839
I'm not sure...

153
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,639
I think you've got me there.

154
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,279
Just over there.

155
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
All right, Grandad?

156
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,039
You've gone bloody big!

157
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,359
Give me a hand up.

158
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,199
That Violet, she wants me
to witness her will.

159
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,719
- Think she's up for a shag.
- Grandad!

160
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,759
What? Get it when you can.

161
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,479
Who's floating your boat these days?

162
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,119
Not still chasing that Elizabeth one?

163
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,359
No, not chasing any more.

164
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,959
You snared her in the end then?

165
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,439
She snared me, Grandad.

166
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,439
Uh-oh! You'll never get
out of that headlock.

167
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,479
I just did.

168
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,479
Slam down! Hey, yes!

169
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,799
Reckon we need a time-out, eh?

170
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,519
Your mum's own miniature museum.

171
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,519
The worse she got, the more she made.

172
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,919
Mystifying.

173
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,399
How's your dad these days?

174
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,399
Better fix this young man a drink.

175
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,439
You gonna come and tell
your grandad what's wrong?

176
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,119
Grandad, when Mum was young,
did you know that she was ill then?

177
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,119
The days I spent thinking on that.

178
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,999
Maybe I did.

179
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,519
Maybe I didn't want to.

180
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,759
Memories play tricks.

181
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,399
So did hospital make her worse?

182
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,879
She did get worse in there, right?

183
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,039
It's the chicken or the egg.

184
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,759
You never know with the mind.

185
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,599
The old invisible universe.

186
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,199
We should have been the ones to look
after her, without anyone else butting in.

187
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,399
We could have if he hadn't
have just given up.

188
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,839
You can't blame Leo for
what happened to your mum.

189
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,039
It's his fucking fault, Grandad.

190
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,759
Anger will help you
survive for a while,

191
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,919
but then it'll eat you alive.

192
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,759
So...let it go.

193
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,079
Living in the past will only
fuck you up, Frederigo.

194
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,719
Pardon the Spanish.

195
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,759
Do what you can now.

196
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,239
Forget what wasn't done then.

197
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,559
This is me, whoever that is.

198
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,559
- So leave whoever a message.
- Fucking hell, Effy, pick up.

199
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,919
Gotta stay vibed to
the world, kid, alert!

200
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,239
I could be prizing your arse
out of your head right now.

201
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,959
As if I've got time for this!
I've got to tell someone something.

202
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,359
You're pretty fucked, aren't you,
mate, and so's your bike.

203
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,639
Fuck!

204
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,519
Freddie!

205
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,519
Freddie! Some bloke in the kitchen
hung Anthea's pans off his knob-ring

206
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,079
and I yanked 'em off
cos it ain't hygienic

207
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,159
but he screamed and I can't find
first aid or Effy anywhere!

208
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,799
Who the fuck set this up, anyway?

209
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,039
Eff! She only posted it
about two hours ago.

210
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,999
I am not mingling with goths.

211
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,879
What the fuck is that?

212
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,079
Goodbye?

213
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,079
Where the fuck are you going, Freds?

214
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,679
- Where is Effy?
- She ain't here, Kate.

215
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,679
Is the hall the new kitchen
for the cool kids, or something?

216
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,879
Panda, please don't...

217
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,559
Bonsoir, Stonem resid... Anthea!

218
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,519
Va bene! Va bene!

219
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,519
"Who are you?" JJ!

220
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,679
With the hair.

221
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,999
Party?

222
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,999
What's giving you that impression?

223
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,839
She hung up.

224
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,599
I am so leaving now.

225
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,759
Moi aussi.

226
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,079
Yeah, me too.

227
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,079
Effy, can you let me in, please?

228
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,439
Effy!

229
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,439
Effy, can you open
this fucking door?

230
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,479
Effy?

231
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,119
You didn't reply.

232
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,759
I didn't want to be on my own.

233
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,759
Effy, what the fuck is going on?

234
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,599
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,599
I'm sorry that I shouted
at you as well.

236
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,879
Really taking the piss this time.

237
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,879
Yeah.

238
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,479
Freddie, I don't want them here.

239
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,479
I thought I did.
I thought that was me, but...

240
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,399
I don't know what is, but...

241
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,399
I know you're the only person
I can trust.

242
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,679
Effy, nothing bad
is going to happen.

243
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,959
I'm going to take care of you now.

244
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,359
All right? I promise.

245
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,959
I promise.

246
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,759
Effy, I want you to stay here.

247
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,079
OK?

248
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,079
Stay here for me, yeah?

249
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,119
Party's over. It's time to leave.

250
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,799
Get the fuck out now! Move!

251
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,039
Get out!

252
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,479
Here.

253
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,159
It's OK now.

254
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,639
It's probably nothing.
Just a fox or something.

255
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,839
- Jesus Christ!
- The one and only!

256
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,119
You threw me a break-out party,
man. I am fucking touched.

257
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,959
In the fucking head.
Cook, what are you playing at?

258
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,199
I'm Bristol's most wanted.
What's the problem?

259
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,879
You've gotta leave.

260
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,839
What the fuck are you
doing here anyway?

261
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,439
I couldn't hack being stuck with a
million fucking me's no more, all right?

262
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,439
Where is she anyways?

263
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,999
Get out.

264
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,319
Get out!

265
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,639
Freddie, get him out.

266
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,519
She looks like the fucking
chick from The Ring, Freds.

267
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,519
Wait in the shed.

268
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,119
What the fuck's up with her?

269
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,439
Nothing. No, everything's...

270
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,079
- Tits up.
- No, OK? Listen.

271
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,159
Cook, you're not coming
back here like this.

272
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,159
I've got my own shit to solve.

273
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,279
Please, just rest your
bony arse tight,

274
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,279
while I go and get us
some food, all right?

275
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,479
This is your home,
not Tesco's.

276
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,559
Your grandad phoned last night.
He's concerned, and so am I.

277
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,319
I'll give you the
money back for it.

278
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,399
With what?

279
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,639
If you want to fuck up your life, Freddie,
if that's really what you wanna do,

280
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,559
just don't bother coming back.

281
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,919
Fine.

282
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,239
D'you know what, Dad? You're just
fucking angry because I've got a life.

283
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,159
A life? You look like a dosser.

284
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,199
You act like an animal.

285
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,639
Who are you?

286
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,039
Your pride and fucking joy.

287
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,719
- If your mum could see this... - Well,
she can't, can she, thanks to you.

288
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,719
- I was trying to fucking help her.
- She fucking killed herself, Dad.

289
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,439
I had no choice, Freddie.

290
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,439
Yes, you did.

291
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,439
You could have done
something, but you didn't.

292
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,559
Rise and shine.

293
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,919
OK, we're gonna stop this.

294
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,919
Right, this has to stop now.

295
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,279
Can we go now?Where?

296
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,479
Out.

297
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,479
Your carriage awaits.

298
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,239
Why the fuck did you bring me here?

299
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,839
Just fresh air and that.

300
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,839
Look at it.

301
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,599
Good to get away, yeah?

302
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,839
Yeah, good to get away.

303
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,919
Remember, you two lovers,

304
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,919
back by seven with
my rig, and respect.

305
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,759
Hello! Mama's home, angel.

306
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,559
Holy shit!

307
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,359
Effy!

308
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,159
I totally fucking love you.

309
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,119
Now's the bit you say...

310
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,679
Don't move.

311
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,959
That one's JJ.

312
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,599
Their faces...

313
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,759
behind the skin...

314
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,759
The skin?

315
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,679
Between this world and the next...

316
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,519
Their teeth and their claws
coming out.

317
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,519
Trying to break through.

318
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,359
Did you drop
something in the cab?

319
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,719
Like a fart or something?

320
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,479
No, like a tab or something.

321
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,479
A tab with your face on it.

322
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,679
Here.

323
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,319
A hole that fits mine.

324
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,359
The moment I saw you,

325
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,359
I knew it'd be the closest
I'd get to being...close.

326
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,279
I didn't know what to
do with that feeling.

327
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,159
- Happiness.
- Listen, Effy.

328
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,639
You are closest...
I'm ever...

329
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,599
But they know now
and they're hungry.

330
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,559
Really fucking hungry.

331
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,399
Because, for as long as I know,
they've been chasing me.

332
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,839
And now they're ready, now they're
strong enough to break through.

333
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,999
And I can't fight them.

334
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,999
I used to be able to
when I was strong but...

335
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,039
You've made me weak.

336
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,039
And now I can't, I can't.

337
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,199
Effy, there's no-one fucking there.

338
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,959
- Effy!
- I can't!

339
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,039
- Effy!
- Let me go!

340
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,719
Effy, listen.
What d'you want me to do?

341
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,359
- They're ready now.
- Effy, stay here!

342
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,039
- They're coming. - I'll fight 'em.
Is that going to stop you?

343
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,439
I'll fucking fight them.

344
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,159
Fuck off!

345
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,919
Fuck off, you cunts,
I'll kill you all!

346
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,559
I have to go home now.

347
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,879
What?

348
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,879
Get me the fuck out of here,
Freddie, please.

349
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,879
Freddie!

350
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,679
Shit!

351
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,599
- Why the fuck did you bring me
here? - I didn't, I didn't know.

352
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,919
- Fuck off!
- Oi! Come on!

353
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,919
Get the fuck away now!

354
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,799
Effy!

355
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,799
Effy!

356
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,759
Freddie! What are
you doing here?

357
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,879
I've lost her.

358
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,879
Come on, let's find her.

359
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,199
Katie!

360
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,079
Katie!

361
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,079
Eff, come on.

362
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,799
Freddie!

363
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,799
Freddie!

364
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,639
It's OK.

365
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,559
Freddie, what's happened?
Is she all right?

366
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,879
It's OK.

367
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,879
Let's get her out of here.

368
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,799
Freddie, what a lovely surprise.

369
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,279
I didn't know where else to go.

370
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,639
And which of you
lovely girls is Elizabeth?

371
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,719
I'm Katie.

372
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,999
Lovely!

373
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,039
Sit down, Freds.

374
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,559
No Grandad.
I've got to stay with her.

375
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,359
It's fine. Sit down.

376
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,359
Now, why don't you take
her to the dining hall?

377
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,599
Where they do a
very nice cup of tea.

378
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,599
Come on, Eff.

379
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,439
Everything's all right.

380
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,959
Did what I could, Grandad.

381
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,119
I did everything.

382
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,439
I know you did, son.

383
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,639
But you need help.

384
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,239
You can't take this all on yourself.

385
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,999
I'm gonna have to, Grandad.
No-one cares. Nobody.

386
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,599
I know that's not true.

387
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,799
No, I don't think you do, actually.
I don't think you understand.

388
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,879
I do. You care and
that's what's killing you.

389
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,039
What use are you going to
be doing this to yourself?

390
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,799
I don't give a fuck.

391
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,679
I can't let this happen again.
I'm not gonna let this happen again.

392
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,979
Do you have any idea how hard your dad
fought to keep your mum in this world?

393
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,519
- He fought...
- No, he didn't.

394
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,759
He gave her up, Grandad,
he let her do it.

395
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,319
- No.
- Yeah.

396
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,319
He bottled it.

397
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,519
He fucked it up, Grandad,
we all fucked it up.

398
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,519
No, he did the best he could, and
that's what you're going to do.

399
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,719
You think the world
of this girl, eh?

400
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,999
I really love her, Grandad.

401
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,639
I can't manage without her.

402
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,679
She's like nothing...

403
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,239
I'm not ready to lose her yet.

404
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,399
Do what you have to do.

405
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,519
Just for a bit.

406
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,079
She needs help.

407
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,079
Live to fight another day, eh?

408
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,879
Freddie!

409
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,639
Effy won't come out of the toilet.

410
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,479
What? You've left her alone?

411
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,679
No, no, no...

412
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,679
No, no, no...

413
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,839
Effy, Effy...

414
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,319
Help! Someone help!

415
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,399
Go on.

416
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,039
Go...

417
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,039
Away.

418
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,599
Before she hit the
world, she was this...

419
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,559
Fire, heating every bit of me.

420
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,559
It was, like, so intense, it burned.

421
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,919
I think I knew, even then, that
she was going to be remarkable.

422
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,359
And then...

423
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,359
When I held her for
the first time...

424
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,759
Man, it was like holding this...

425
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,039
Beautiful bomb.

426
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,839
The energy was...you know.

427
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,839
Even then, it scared me.

428
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,119
So I think I'm prepared for this.

429
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,159
Whatever this is.

430
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,919
She's going to need us.

431
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,919
To help rebuild her again.

432
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,959
She's going to need you.

433
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,719
There's no future without her.

434
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,719
Fuck the future.

435
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,519
There's nothing any more.

436
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,239
There's nothing but now, mate.

437
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,759
What have I done?
What did I do?

438
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,599
You went to the end of
the fucking earth, man.

439
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,599
The end of the fucking earth.

440
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,959
You're gonna have to go
further now, mate.

441
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,839
For her.

442
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,359
For you.

443
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,359
For me.

444
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,959
The radius of the event horizon
of a non-rotating black hole is?

445
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,239
The Schwarzschild radius.

446
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,359
Beyond that, nothing
can escape, nothing.

447
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,079
Alien life form defined
as Lara Lloyd.

448
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,039
The most beautiful girl in this
or any known universe.

449
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,119
If you don't ask her out in
the next ten seconds, I will.

450
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,519
I am a psycho.

451
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,799
You're not a psycho.No!

452
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,799
Lara Lloyd, would you like
to go out with me tonight?

453
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
