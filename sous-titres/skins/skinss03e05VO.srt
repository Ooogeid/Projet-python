1
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:02,639
Do you think she's going
where we're going?

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,840
- She is now
- I'm tired of you, mate.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Me, you and JJ.
Best mates for life.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,155
I'm Thomas.
So glad to meet you.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,360
- They fuck you up.
- They don't mean to, Eff.

6
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:16,159
Please don't leave me.

7
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,480
But they do.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
Pyjama party means only one thing:

9
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,722
girls getting friendly.

10
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,560
Careful what you wish for, Pandora.

11
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:29,079
I missed you too much.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,840
- I think Cook's your friend. Isn't he?
- Not necessarily.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,160
Synch: Arrow, Breys

15
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,679
<i>Every day I know this is what
I was born to do.</i>

16
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,872
It's everything to me.
And nothing else matters except...

17
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,960
This is for you, Mum...

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,956
Singing "Juicing Down",
please welcome Karen McLair!

19
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:38,026
<i>Let's see what the judges think...</i>

20
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:40,461
<i>Ladies, could you be happy
with Karen in the Sexxbombz?</i>

21
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,127
<i>Yeah.
It'd be lovely. I love her.</i>

22
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:47,732
Jordan, did you get Karen tonight?

23
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,679
Karen. I'm going to be honest
with you, okay?

24
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,720
We're in the semi-finals
of this competition.

25
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,371
<i>Everybody's talented. Yeah?</i>

26
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,582
<i>But the question is...</i>

27
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,022
<i>Are you talented enough</i>

28
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,149
<i>to join the Sexxbombz?</i>

29
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,743
- How can you watch this again?
- Shut up, cockhead...

30
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:08,584
<i>You know what?
You dance like a gazelle.</i>

31
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,478
<i>On acid.</i>

32
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:11,824
<i>I love it!</i>

33
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,543
<i>I love it! Yes!</i>

34
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:16,711
Do you think I look hot?

35
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,651
Don't be fucking twisted.
You're my sister.

36
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:19,771
Dad!

37
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:26,200
- Freddie says I look ugly.
- She doesn't look ugly. She looks sexy.

38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,107
I didn't say that.
She's talking bollocks.

39
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,447
Tell your sister she looks
sexy on the television.

40
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,331
Go on...

41
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,456
You look sexy on telly, Karen.

42
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,068
Now. Let's watch the good bit.

43
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,201
<i>We've had a record number of votes,</i>

44
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,107
<i>over 1,000 texts and phone calls.</i>

45
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:46,791
<i>And the last girl
to go through to the final</i>

46
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,719
<i>of "Search for a Sexxbomb" is...</i>

47
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,400
You know you bloody won!

48
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,738
<i>I just hope my mum
was watching up in Heaven.</i>

49
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,424
<i>This is for you, Mum,
and I love you forever!</i>

50
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:13,401
For fuck's sake, Dad.
Listen to what she's saying.

51
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:37,200
You're in my garden.

52
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:39,702
Right.

53
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:46,254
I...

54
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,600
- wanted to see what was in your shed.
- My...?

55
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,138
Shed.

56
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,392
Everyone says
you have a marvellous shed.

57
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:56,915
- Everyone?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,959
It's marvelled at.

59
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:09,270
So, this is it.

60
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,919
So what do you and the boys
do in here?

61
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,689
Braid each other's hair
and play soggy biscuit?

62
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,363
No... not for ages.

63
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,410
Spliff, then?

64
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:34,346
Cool.

65
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:45,040
Why don't you get your porn
on the internet, like normal people?

66
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,379
What the fuck's this?

67
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:59,728
You know, sometimes, when we're...

68
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,689
we're too stoned to...

69
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,500
go outside...

70
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:07,915
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:12,338
- I wasn't really expecting guests.
- What do you normally do?

72
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,673
Put out doilies?

73
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,332
Well, they do keep the cups clean.

74
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,942
Thanks for letting me in.

75
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,280
I know it's weird.

76
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,359
It's... whatever. You know.

77
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,382
It's cool.

78
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,441
It's cool.

79
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:54,995
It's just...
Seems like a good place to hide.

80
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,431
You'll never guess
what just happened.

81
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:02,560
This skinny Asian fucker
was at the Green,

82
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
body popping on a bit of lino.

83
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,776
He's got a little sign saying
"Anwar the Magnificent", right?

84
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:14,000
He's busking, making cash money.
So I said to him if I can join in...

85
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,146
And he says do I know the Buddha
Buddha Cheese Buddha routine.

86
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,299
So I says...

87
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:24,080
Well, blow bubbles up
my bollocks and call me Shirley.

88
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:34,250
Welcome to our fortress of solitude!

89
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,417
I think I love the Sexxbombz.

90
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,710
Karen's costume last night
was a bit of a marvel.

91
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm pretty sure it defied
the laws of physics. I mean,

92
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,792
that tiny amount of material
is surely not be able to cover

93
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,959
the requisite surface area
for UK broadcasting laws.

94
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,785
- Did you see it, Eff?
- No...

95
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,337
That skirt was so short
I saw her bumhole wink.

96
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,081
Pass the spliff, Freddiebrek.

97
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,802
Don't worry, I've perfected it.

98
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,164
Water... water...

99
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:22,522
No way...

100
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,080
Fucking Genius!

101
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,037
How long have you
had that planted there?

102
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,240
About eight months.

103
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:37,600
Fucking genius.

104
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,800
Fucking top, mate.

105
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,117
That's fucking tip toparoo.

106
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,720
After all this excitement,
I fancy a spunk.

107
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,599
You coming, Eff? You soon will be.

108
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,680
I'd sooner fuck JJ.

109
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,240
That isn't intended as a compliment.
But I'm going to take it as one anyway.

110
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,349
Maybe you didn't get it.
"Are you coming, Eff? You soon will be."

111
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,469
I got it.

112
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,438
Freddie and JJ got it.

113
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,027
That termite over there got it.

114
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,000
But you're not going to get it.
Got it?

115
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,040
No... I'm confused.

116
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm not going anywhere
near your crayola dick.

117
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,633
I know where it's been.

118
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,560
- What's she talking about?
- Piss off then.

119
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,379
This is our place, right?
If you're not going to shag us,

120
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:24,560
then get to fuck.

121
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Mate, try and stir my porridge
if you want

122
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,193
but I'd say even Jay's got
a better chance than you.

123
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:47,215
I mean, when was the last time
you breathed fire?

124
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,890
Dinner's ready!

125
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,455
<i>So, should I be called Minxy
Sexxbomb or Foxy Sexxbomb?</i>

126
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:43,299
<i>Jordan says he likes Minxy.
I wanted it to be Sexy Sexxbomb...</i>

127
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,484
Can't you tell? Look at his eyes.
He's completely monged.

128
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:01,569
I'm not.

129
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:07,068
I've...

130
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,018
got coursework now.

131
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,010
You gonna tell him?
About the thing?

132
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,180
Sit down!

133
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm busy....

134
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,407
Freddie, sit down!

135
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:19,703
Sit down.

136
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:28,947
- We want you here at two tomorrow.
- What for?

137
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,572
Filming for the interview
before my final performance.

138
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,541
You've got to talk about
how much you miss Mum

139
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,679
and how much it'll mean to you
to see me win.

140
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:41,199
This is like,
too fucked-up for words.

141
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,651
- My Mum's dead, vote for me...
- It's not like it's not true.

142
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:48,071
- I miss Mum every day.
- Shit... Dad, she's doing it again!

143
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,159
You need a story,
everyone knows that.

144
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,448
- See!
- She didn't mean it like that.

145
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:55,307
Yes, I did. At least I've got
some fucking ambition!

146
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,555
I don't really think wanting
Robbie Williams

147
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,794
to jizz over your baps
doesn't count as ambition!

148
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:01,759
That's nice. That's lovely guys.

149
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,820
- Be here tomorrow at two o'clock.
- You know what? Why should I?

150
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,695
Cos I wash your clothes, cook
your meals, put a roof over your head,

151
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:10,323
probably pay for your skunk

152
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:13,443
and I do it all without asking
anything in return. Except this.

153
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:14,882
Look! Look at her!

154
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,119
She's your sister,
you support her. That's it.

155
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,641
It's just...

156
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,749
Fucking hell...

157
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:23,356
You know?

158
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:28,027
It's just, like...
Fucking hell, you know?

159
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,873
- Dad!
- Get back here and apologise.

160
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,746
Freddie, get back here!

161
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,005
Dad, get him back here now
and make him apologise to me!

162
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:44,949
Sorry.

163
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,193
Dad, you've got to get him
back here. Dad, please...

164
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,991
Hamlet. What's it all about...

165
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:27,878
dudes?

166
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,125
Anyone?

167
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,213
Well, Josie,

168
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:38,754
through the fog of his grief,

169
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,360
Hamlet is struggling to choose

170
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:44,387
between action or inaction,

171
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,678
and through this struggle,

172
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:50,656
he encounters existential forces,

173
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:54,280
illuminating the path
towards death which is,

174
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,995
in itself, life.

175
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:01,975
My my, that is
an illuminating thesis, Gerald.

176
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,800
Well, done.
Thank you.

177
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:06,322
No, thank you.
You're a delight to teach.

178
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:13,888
- I got held up.
- Freddie's always late.

179
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Sorry...

180
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,480
Sit down, please.

181
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,094
Is Freddie gonna fail his A-levels?

182
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:23,827
Fraid so, Gerald.

183
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,520
You're all gonna fail if you
don't read the pucking book...

184
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,469
I've read it! It was great!

185
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,557
I didn't really
understand it though.

186
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:36,340
Did the ghost do it after all,
or was it Voldemort?

187
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,360
He's a right beast, in't he?

188
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,120
I think you got your books
mixed up again, Panda.

189
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,100
So! In summary,

190
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:48,956
the predominant themes
of William Shakespeare's Hamlet are...

191
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,200
action, inaction, madness,

192
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,352
madness,

193
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,555
grief,

194
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,233
death...

195
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:13,794
Being, or not being.

196
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:16,246
That is the question...

197
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,683
Anyone else?

198
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,040
Hamlet's basically a teenage boy.

199
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,086
He's got these desires

200
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,462
but he doesn't have the bottle
to reach for them.

201
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,752
So he goes mad
and wanks off about Ophelia

202
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,799
and ends up so boring
that somebody has to kill him.

203
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm not sure that's right.

204
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,148
There's no wanking in Hamlet.

205
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:03,200
There is. Loads.
Only they call it "soliloquizing".

206
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,583
Nice one, blondie.

207
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:09,591
She's funny.

208
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:13,244
Please don't!

209
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,708
Stop it... Stop it, please!

210
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:21,206
Thanks a lot, Cook.
Now my nipples are really chafed.

211
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,996
Come on.
We're going down the boozer.

212
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,453
- I'm gonna...
- Come on! I need to get

213
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:29,240
that fucking Dickens out me head.
Let's get fucking trashed!

214
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,256
- But...
- Come on, Freds. It's been...

215
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,320
ages since we last went out.

216
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,101
I'm going home.

217
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,405
Please don't! Not again!

218
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,520
Have a tickle!

219
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:05,548
So...

220
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:10,660
Tell us what it means to you
to have Karen

221
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:14,780
in the grand final
of Search For A Sexxbomb?

222
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:22,556
It's like, you know...
well, I mean...

223
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,933
I can't quite put it into words.

224
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,240
It's great.

225
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,660
It is great.

226
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,917
He is just the best brother
in the world.

227
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:37,518
We take every day
as a blessing from God, because,

228
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,989
you know,
Mum isn't with us any more.

229
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:41,756
It really makes you think.

230
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,223
Does it?

231
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:44,954
About what?

232
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,798
About, you know...
Life is precious

233
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:49,237
and stuff.

234
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,125
Why don't you tell me
what it was like

235
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,400
- to lose your mother?
- I didn't lose her.

236
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,120
I'm not gonna find her
down the back of the sofa or anything.

237
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,967
But, you know, like,

238
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:04,200
- how did it feel?
- It felt great.

239
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,464
It felt really great.

240
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:11,578
Let me ask you... How does it
feel being a cocaine-snorting,

241
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,400
in low-budget, corporate puppet?

242
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,600
- I think we're going to cut here.
- Mum was...

243
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:23,772
She was the one who told me
that I had a talent, a gift.

244
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:26,240
Who first sang with me
and believed in me.

245
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,847
When I'm singing out there,
I'm not just singing for me.

246
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,379
I'm singing for her.

247
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:36,680
And I'm singing for anyone
who's ever been through tragedy.

248
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:44,120
Cut there. I love you, Karen!
I actually love you.

249
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:49,320
You're so warm and sweet and cool.

250
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,374
I could eat you.
I'd love to eat you.

251
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:55,965
- You'd like that, wouldn't you, Karen?
- I'd love that, Jordan.

252
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:57,480
OK, all right...

253
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:00,479
Listen, I need a chai latte.
Where's that asshole runner?

254
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,629
In there, with the other arseholes.

255
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,932
You know, you're not that hot kid.

256
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,919
Nobody wants to eat you...

257
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:11,200
- Phil, yes, my man...
- You're such a cock.

258
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,430
Why are you trying
to fuck this up for me?

259
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,440
I want the stuff
that makes me go gaga, you know?

260
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,376
Start raping people, you know?
You are beautiful.

261
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,613
I'll see you then.

262
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:25,160
You know. You oughta get laid
or something, kid.

263
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:28,828
I might be a corporate puppet
or whatever

264
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,713
but I have a fucking good time.

265
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:35,409
How's being an angsty little prick
working out for you?

266
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,011
I haven't seen
you dressed like that since...

267
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,178
ever.

268
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,520
You look a bit
like Frau Hilde from Primary.

269
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:05,387
Right now Kinder,
get ze glitter on ze macaroni und stick!

270
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,320
Stick! Express yourselves, ja?

271
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,319
Ze glue is all over das lippen.

272
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:27,710
Do you remember how Cook used to try
and ping his crayons into her bra?

273
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:44,320
Primary was fun.

274
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:48,759
Yeah, it was.

275
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:54,061
Cook wants you to come
to Uncle Keith's pub quiz tomorrow.

276
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,320
If Cook wants me there, I suppose
I'd better fucking hop to it at 9!

277
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:02,760
Freddie... Why don't you want
to be friends with us any more?

278
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,620
Cook hasn't got any friends.

279
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,040
Just... people that he knows.

280
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,301
Don't say that.

281
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,747
So? I mean...

282
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,799
What else are you gonna do?

283
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:25,752
Anyway...

284
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,924
- You'll like this.
- Hang on, pack of cards...

285
00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:32,443
handkerchief, and a mouse,

286
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,693
but I haven't actually
got a mouse, so...

287
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,810
so, a rubber.
I need you to pick a card...

288
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:41,533
I'll pick it for you.

289
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,952
I hope you're okay.

290
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:02,160
Good.

291
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,255
Now, Elizabeth. It's important
for you to remember

292
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,359
that your mother
and I still love each other very much.

293
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:11,193
- No we don't.
- That's right. We don't.

294
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,563
- That's why you're leaving.
- That's why I'm leaving.

295
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,057
That's why I'm fucking
out of here, woman.

296
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,374
I am on a fucking plane.

297
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:20,850
You're dead right.
I am fucking out of here...

298
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:33,731
What's up?

299
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:47,257
And you've got
so little imagination,

300
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:49,628
you have to shag my fucking boss!

301
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,048
It's pathetic. You could have shagged
the turd from Tesco's.

302
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,065
- Take anything!
- I don't want anything!

303
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,002
Take it! Otherwise
it's all gonna cunting Oxfam!

304
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:02,562
Don't you dare use "cunt"
and "Oxfam" in the same sentence!

305
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:07,149
- Take something. You bought it...
- All right. I'll take my fucking pan.

306
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,880
Take that pan
and you are fucking dead!

307
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,690
I brought your bracelet back.

308
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,810
Thanks.

309
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,879
We'd be good together.

310
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,818
- Don't you think?
- No.

311
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,285
- Why?
- Because I'll break your heart.

312
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,675
Maybe I'll break yours.

313
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,358
Nobody breaks my heart...

314
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,473
and anyway, why would I want that?

315
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:45,680
Who the buggering tits is this?

316
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:49,785
Unbelievable.

317
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,265
They're not actually crazy,
you know.

318
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:01,656
They're just women.

319
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,520
It's amazing what you can
accomplish if you get up early.

320
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,092
Fuck!

321
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:58,350
- Don't swear. I don't like swearing.
- This is bullshit!

322
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:00,228
This is our fucking shed.

323
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,638
Mine and JJ's and Cook's.

324
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,548
- Since we were little kids.
- Maybe it's time you grew up then.

325
00:27:06,673 --> 00:27:10,400
Besides, Karen needs somewhere
to rehearse, and actually it's my shed.

326
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,090
I think this is the worst thing
anyone's ever done to me.

327
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,440
I didn't do to you.
I did it for you.

328
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:41,228
Right.

329
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,664
Question 23...

330
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,189
A swan is
the only bird with a penis,

331
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,792
but how long can a cockroach live

332
00:27:51,196 --> 00:27:53,956
- after you've pulled its head off?
- Easy.

333
00:27:56,432 --> 00:28:00,436
This is the life. The three musketeers
out on the lash. Let's have a cheers.

334
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:05,036
The only man in Britain to survive
three attempts to hang him

335
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,963
was John Babbacombe Lee
at Exeter Jail.

336
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:12,339
On what dates were
the attempts made?

337
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:14,796
Keith, what's up
with these questions?

338
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,320
Do you wanna be disqualified?

339
00:28:20,738 --> 00:28:22,238
What were the dates?

340
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:30,436
Do you know what
Naomi is spelled backwards?

341
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:34,040
- I moan...
- Fucking JJ...

342
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,785
Brilliant, man.

343
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:43,472
In Sherwood Forest, a famous...

344
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,412
- What's up?
- You all right?

345
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:47,138
Yes, fine. Who's this?

346
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,009
What is it?

347
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:51,132
Mike.

348
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,480
- Romantic...
- All right, love.

349
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,684
Clitoris Allsorts could do
with some more members.

350
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,720
All right Keith, we're not stopping.

351
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:02,607
Right...

352
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,003
Next question.

353
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:08,775
When dropped from a height of
100 inches onto concrete,

354
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,744
how high should
a new tennis ball bounce?

355
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,331
Answers in hectares please.

356
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:23,278
- I've got the answer.
- Write it down then J-kins.

357
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,400
We don't let nothing
come between us. Yeah?

358
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:34,062
Bros before hos, boys.
Bros before hos.

359
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:35,618
Anyway.

360
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:38,988
We've got bigger fish to fuck. Who does
your sister think she is? Gina G?

361
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:40,800
This fucking shed situation
is fucked.

362
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,787
- The Cookie Monster does not like this.
- If you find her so reprehensible,

363
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:46,777
why did you have sex with her?

364
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:51,348
Wait. That was supposed
to stay in the vault. Wasn't it?

365
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,236
- JJ?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

366
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:55,420
I'm emotionally underdeveloped.

367
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,710
- You shagged my sister?
- You know what I'm like...

368
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:01,400
half a bottle of Grappa and
I turn into a fucking machine gun...

369
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:03,600
You fucked my sister?

370
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:23,779
Just be, Freddie.

371
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Just be.

372
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:02,645
Fuck!

373
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,019
Bring it, Karen, bring it.

374
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:11,967
What do you want?

375
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,360
I was wondering if there was
anything else you wanted?

376
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,545
- What?
- You've got this...

377
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,307
Maybe you want my bedroom
for a tanning salon next.

378
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:21,360
At least then you might
stand a chance tomorrow.

379
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,600
Just let me rehearse,
and you can bitch at me after the final.

380
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,495
I am so sorry.

381
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,173
I forgot that's the only thing
that matters in the whole world.

382
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:35,196
- Grow the fuck up.
- You don't see it, do you?

383
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,836
You don't see what a stupid

384
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,516
- fucking cliche you really are.
- Piss off, Freddie.

385
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:45,247
So out of interest...

386
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:49,662
What were you dreaming of
when you fucked my best friend?

387
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,093
- It wasn't like that...
- He fucked you good, didn't he?

388
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,560
I know your type, Karen.

389
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:01,517
Love me...

390
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,529
Love me...

391
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:05,454
Love me.

392
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:06,724
Look, stop it.

393
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:09,280
You little fucking whore...

394
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,575
Go to your room.

395
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,112
Get some rest.

396
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,840
Freddie, don't you ever speak
to your sister that way again.

397
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:30,155
What are you gonna do about it?

398
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:41,022
Every time I look at you,
I wonder...

399
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:45,343
You've got
your mother's eyes, but...

400
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,838
I don't know who you are any more.

401
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,989
You just skate around.

402
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:53,924
You just fucking skate around.

403
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:40,920
Is Effy in?

404
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,605
There's no-one here
but terrible old me...

405
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:48,049
Do you know where she is?

406
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:50,094
Please?

407
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:56,137
She's at the water park, I think.

408
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,899
She goes there to...

409
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:02,895
get away from here.

410
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,881
Effy! I wanna talk to you!

411
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,389
<i>Hi. This is Effy.
I'm not talking right now.</i>

412
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:05,339
<i>But leave a message
and maybe I'll get back to you...</i>

413
00:36:57,664 --> 00:37:00,163
- Effy, I've come to tell you...
- Freddie.

414
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,014
I don't think I can...

415
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:19,036
So, now I've told you, OK?

416
00:37:21,148 --> 00:37:22,330
Now you know...

417
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,035
Jemma! That was fierce.

418
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:19,435
Fierce!

419
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,618
I didn't like it...

420
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:31,078
I loved it!

421
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:34,350
I loved it! I fucking loved it!

422
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:38,548
Well, done! Thank you very much,
Jemma. Thank you.

423
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:43,497
Okay, it's time for our third
and final act of the evening.

424
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:47,213
Singing the song that took the Sexxbombz
to number one in two countries,

425
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,746
one protectorate
and of course, Wales...

426
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,963
it's Karen Mclair, with Ass To Ass!

427
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,113
Absolutely fantastic!

428
00:40:27,421 --> 00:40:30,390
I'd like to dedicate that
to my mum, Mary Mclair.

429
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:31,971
I love you so much...

430
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,360
Shut up...

431
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:41,018
Karen, Karen, that was amazing.

432
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,582
You are not just
in this competition...

433
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,639
you are this competition!

434
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,515
What about you Sexxbombz,
are you feeling the love tonight?

435
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:04,709
<i>I wanna see you
going ass to ass with you...</i>

436
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:08,675
<i>I wanna see you going
ass to ass with me...</i>

437
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:16,612
They're feeling the ass baby!
Fo' shizzle!

438
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:20,061
They are all feeling the ass.
Thank you Karen, everybody.

439
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,479
OK. It's now time to get voting
for your favourite...

440
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:29,200
Honey? Jemma? Or Karen?

441
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:32,622
Lines are open, get dialling now
and come back here in one hour.

442
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:34,890
One of these three
lovely girls will be...

443
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:37,489
the new Sexxbomb!

444
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:12,934
Thanks, mate.

445
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:45,445
What are you doing, man?
Let's go out and fucking celebrate!

446
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,434
- What?
- She fucking lost...

447
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,155
I'm not going anywhere.

448
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,486
Okay, then.
We'll bring the party to you...

449
00:42:51,884 --> 00:42:52,930
Come on J...

450
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,677
He wanted to come around...

451
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:01,080
Just don't do anything bad, OK?

452
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:10,640
Hello, Mr Mclair. Karen.

453
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:12,509
Hello, JJ.

454
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,596
Bad luck, Karen.
In the competition, like.

455
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,608
But you know...

456
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,360
What goes around comes around.

457
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,000
How much did you lose by again?
15 votes?

458
00:43:34,026 --> 00:43:35,389
Well, that's funny, cos...

459
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:38,640
that's about how many people
were in Keith's pub tonight.

460
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,549
- You voted against her?
- Not just me. Everyone in there.

461
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:45,675
- JJ, even.
- Cook, don't...

462
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,887
You fucking did what?

463
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:50,570
You took my shed,
I took your competition. Fair's fair.

464
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,035
You little shit,
you ugly little bastard...

465
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:57,553
Guys. Come on, let's go out?
You can watch me play pin the sausage...

466
00:43:57,678 --> 00:44:00,400
- I forgot how limber you were, Karen.
- What's going on?

467
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:08,964
Come on. It's been a long day.

468
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:10,084
You prick.

469
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:13,425
You selfish fucking prick.

470
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:21,217
- Freddie, please.
- Fucking do it then. You pussy.

471
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,196
I really fucking love you,
you bastard.

472
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,663
JJ, we're leaving, man.

473
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,416
- JJ, I'm sorry.
- JJ!

474
00:44:56,204 --> 00:44:57,405
You fucking...

475
00:45:33,502 --> 00:45:37,353
<i>Hi. This is Effy. I'm not talking
right now but leave a message...</i>

476
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:56,687
- Hi, is Ef...
- Give it up, will you?

477
00:45:58,187 --> 00:46:00,240
- What?
- Just fuck right off.

478
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,469
You've got about
as much chance of fucking me

479
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:21,000
as becoming the democratically
elected Student President.

480
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:22,835
You? President?

481
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:24,542
Yeah man. Problem?

482
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:29,040
Vote for me!
Vote for non-stop party!

483
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,225
- You're such a fucking joke.
- I'm a joke? You're fucking hilarious.

484
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,761
Can we go somewhere?

485
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:38,219
Anywhere?
