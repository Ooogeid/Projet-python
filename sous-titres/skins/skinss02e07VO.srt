1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,439
{\a3}Lovely Sid and lovely
Michelle are fucking.

2
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,559
{\a3}- What the fuck...?
- Shut up.

3
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:35,279
{\a3}I'm saying it again.
I love you.

4
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:11,376
EFFY

5
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,770
<i>So, Paris is a shit-hole.</i>

6
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,570
<i>It's filthy, it's expensive,
everyone's French.</i>

7
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,770
<i>We nearly came here
for our honeymoon.</i>

8
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,759
<i>If you could see this dump</i>

9
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,530
<i>you'd appreciate those two weeks
in Rhyl a lot fucking more!</i>

10
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,330
<i>Sausages made of colon! I mean,
is that your idea of romance?</i>

11
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,090
<i>Anyway, bad news is head office
want me out here for another week.</i>

12
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,450
<i>Fucking frogs can't fart without
my assistance apparently.</i>

13
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,170
<i>So, be good for your mum, kids.</i>

14
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,874
<i>Keep a tight ship. Yep,
all ship-shape, you know.</i>

15
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,255
<i>All right, well...</i>

16
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,330
<i>Lots of love. This is Dad,
by the way.</i>

17
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,090
- Hi, Dad.
- <i>Oh. Hello, sweetheart!</i>

18
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,719
<i>You being good for Mum?</i>

19
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,031
- <i>Helping her around the house?</i>
- I've got to go. Washing.

20
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:11,450
- <i>Woman's work never done, eh?</i>
- Yeah. Ha-ha. Bye, Dad.

21
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,450
<i>Bye. Can I speak to...?</i>

22
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,166
Morning, Mum...

23
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:23,286
Tony?

24
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,410
Tony's better, Mum.

25
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,479
You... erm... gonna get dressed today?

26
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,050
Sure... sure, sweetie.

27
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,291
How long?

28
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,799
Don't rush me.

29
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,406
I'm down to my emergency pants.

30
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:11,239
The milk's off. I wouldn't bother
with breakfast.

31
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:18,810
Still nothing?

32
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:20,799
Nothing.

33
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:23,170
How many times have you called her?

34
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,290
39.

35
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,730
Texts?

36
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,850
141.

37
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,807
Nothing?

38
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,930
Nothing.

39
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,650
Wow! Michelle really hates you.

40
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,359
Well, you did totally fuck up
her relationship.

41
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,279
You stormed in
and fucked it right up.

42
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:42,530
Yes, all right!

43
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,657
I love her, OK?

44
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:45,840
Love?

45
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,719
Just leave it, Eff.

46
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,519
Love, love, love.

47
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,879
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing.

48
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,850
Yes.

49
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,839
And that, ladies, is why Monet
was shit.

50
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,095
As Lucian Freud once said to me,
"Water lilies?

51
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,746
"My arse!"

52
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,239
I was modelling in the morning,

53
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,250
stroking him to thrilling climax
in the afternoon.

54
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,930
"Enid", he said, "You will
never be an artist.

55
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,879
"But your breasts are tremendous."

56
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,850
And with great breasts come
great responsibility.

57
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,188
My task?

58
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,679
100% A grades
through the medium of art.

59
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,399
And we need coursework on
the subject of emotion.

60
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:46,210
Ursula, where is your emotion?

61
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,739
Oh, em, it's almost done,
Madame Deluca.

62
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,999
Marjorie, Araminta.

63
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:56,246
All disciples of the redeeming rush
of achievement.

64
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,570
And, Effy...

65
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,839
Ah yes, Effy.

66
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,970
Is there any hint of
creative flowering?

67
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,039
Any gushing forth of
self-expression?

68
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:09,239
Well, as I understand it,

69
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,679
in return for about £13,000
of your parents' money,

70
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:15,479
we guarantee total success.

71
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,559
So, I'd suggest you unblock
your gush by Thursday.

72
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,490
As Georges Braque once said
to me, the...

73
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,199
Is this Mrs Deluca's classroom?

74
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,090
No, child.
This is Madame Deluca's studio.

75
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,759
And who, pray tell, are you?

76
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,890
I'm Pandora. I'm new. They...

77
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,919
- Sit or strip.
- What?

78
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,170
Either sit down or divest
yourself of your clothing

79
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,729
that we may feast upon your form
with graphite and rubbers.

80
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,370
The bells, ladies.

81
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,060
They speak of achievement.

82
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,913
They speak of the ecstasy of what?

83
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,530
Self-expression.

84
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,610
Self-expression!

85
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,399
Yes. Yes. Oh, yes!

86
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,159
- Isn't she heavenly?
- She's ripping.

87
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,370
Daddy knew her in Morocco and
she's totally gaga for Arabs.

88
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,190
One moment, Effy?

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,439
Effy, one moment, please.

90
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:15,023
I don't think we can leave
a new girl to bloom unaided, can we?

91
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,719
Pandora, darling, don't do that.

92
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,358
Why?

93
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,250
You see? An innocent.

94
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,639
She needs a mentor,
a guide, wouldn't you say?

95
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,199
Er, no. I have my coursework and...

96
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,319
You can help each other.
Would you like that, Pandora?

97
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,679
Yeah, I'd love it. I'm useless.
That's why I'm here.

98
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:38,610
How perceptive you are.

99
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,743
And Effy, 100% success

100
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,260
or it's farewell to
Westfield College for Young Ladies.

101
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,170
You mean they'll expel me?

102
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,690
Well, yes. Otherwise
it doesn't work at all, does it?

103
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,810
No.

104
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,847
So, off you go, ladies.

105
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,450
Enjoy!

106
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,450
Dampen yourselves with the thrill
of art!

107
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,530
Wait!

108
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,090
Effy, wait. Madame Deluca says
we have to be friends.

109
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,650
I don't have friends.

110
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,319
Great. I don't have any either.
Isn't that great?

111
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:12,959
I can do something you can't do.

112
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,119
There's nothing I can't do.

113
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,927
You can't do this, If it's good
enough, can I be your friend?

114
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,799
I've got my own rope and everything.

115
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,159
Not bad.

116
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:35,399
Mum sent me to circus school for
my dizzy spells, right?

117
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,639
Big finish, I take off my bra
without unbuttoning anything.

118
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:41,202
OK.

119
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,770
OK, Effy.

120
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,279
- What do you want?
- I think you know what I want.

121
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,519
Jake, I'm not going to screw you.

122
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,119
- Not even just as friends?
- In your dreams.

123
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:53,959
Come on, you promised me a tumble.

124
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,690
Just as friends.

125
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,759
- So, I lied.
- Bummer.

126
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,930
I'm ready.

127
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,290
- Who's that, then?
- Pandora.

128
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,810
She's a bit funny-looking.

129
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,759
So are you.

130
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,479
You didn't say that when I gave you
the neck job.

131
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,519
Only because you said you'd
help me sell spliff tonight.

132
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,890
One... two...

133
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,130
Yeah, but I wanna lay you, baby.

134
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,810
I mean, just as friends, right?

135
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,450
I've got a friend. Wanker!

136
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:25,919
Taa-daa!

137
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:30,730
Impressive.

138
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,880
All right, Sid?

139
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,868
I was just, eh...

140
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,570
looking at your bins.

141
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,520
You wanna see Tony?

142
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,930
Well... eh...

143
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,010
might as well, now I'm here.

144
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,160
Come on.

145
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:04,685
Busy day?

146
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,240
You all right, Tone?

147
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,970
Wondered how you were doing.

148
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,650
Brilliant.

149
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,760
I've been worried about you since...

150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,976
... you stole my girlfriend?

151
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,631
Well, she's gone off me too, Tone.

152
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
Don't mind if I...?

153
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,975
Not at all.

154
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:37,440
Tangy!

155
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:41,246
What's that?

156
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:43,920
Came in the post.
Michelle's handwriting.

157
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,640
Can I open it? I love parcels.

158
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,320
That's Pandora.

159
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:48,800
Hi.

160
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,305
Mum sends our Christmas presents to
the poor in Africa... and Barnsley.

161
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:56,200
Except for Scrabble, cos Mum
says they probably can't read.

162
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:01,160
I gave it to Michelle
for her birthday.

163
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Tony, it's all my fault.
Michelle was... It was just like...

164
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:06,832
I was filling her gap.

165
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,880
I mean... Not that gap...

166
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:13,081
So who wants to hear my best
cock gag?

167
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,282
No, Mum.

168
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,970
- Hello Anthea...
- Oh, Jesus.

169
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,840
No, listen.
Best cock gag...

170
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:20,694
Mum, Mum. You don't need to.

171
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,255
Thank you very much!
My name's Anthea Stonem.

172
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,080
I shall be here all week.

173
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,459
Come on, Mum.
Think you need a lie-down.

174
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,040
Did they like my gag?

175
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,961
Yeah. Yeah, they loved it.

176
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,730
OK, Mum.

177
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,272
You take it easy.

178
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,560
Just have a nice little nap.

179
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,933
Yeah. You do that.

180
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,104
Then everything will be...

181
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,600
Is she mental?

182
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,159
No.

183
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,810
Just tired.

184
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,501
Your brother's really nice.

185
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,120
He's not nice.

186
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:48,960
He's amazing.

187
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,523
He was hit by a bus, you know.

188
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,708
Had to learn everything again.

189
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,160
How to swim.

190
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,450
How to write his name.

191
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,019
How to be my brother.

192
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,000
We're not getting on, are we?

193
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
No, Sid.

194
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,476
I was lonely.

195
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,520
And sometimes when bad stuff
happen... You just need...

196
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,970
- A shag.
- Yes. No!

197
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:13,680
She was my girlfriend.

198
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:17,000
Tony. She wasn't your girlfriend.
You didn't want her.

199
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,720
Well, now I do. So fuck you.

200
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,861
You remember when we were
little and we had a fight?

201
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:32,433
Like when you told Miss Stevens
I shaved the hamster.

202
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:33,680
Yeah. Like that.

203
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,331
And we wouldn't talk
to each other all day,

204
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:38,960
then you'd turn up on your pink bike
with the stabilisers.

205
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,228
It wasn't pink, it was magenta.

206
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:43,747
You'd say sorry and
we'd do our special

207
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,640
high five thing, and that was it.
Sorted.

208
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:48,610
Yeah.

209
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,129
Easy.

210
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,539
- That didn't work, did it?
- No.

211
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,287
It didn't.

212
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,042
- Where you going?
- Revision.

213
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,689
We've got to fix this.

214
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,880
Then get her back for me.

215
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,050
You're an idiot.

216
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,784
You are fucking the wrong girl.

217
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,958
It's Cassie you love.

218
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:49,331
You only got mixed up with Michelle
because, let's face it, men are dicks,

219
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:53,690
and there was no-one else to screw,
which is totally fucking pathetic.

220
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,570
Isn't it?

221
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,202
Has anyone ever told you, Effy,

222
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:01,734
this whole sneaking up on people,
getting inside their head, it's not cool.

223
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,183
I'm right, though.

224
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,360
You're always right!
You and your fucking brother!

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,765
You're always fucking, fucking...

226
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,560
... right.

227
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,287
That milk's two weeks old.

228
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,440
It's OK. I put
some cocoa powder in it.

229
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
It's a bit chewy, that's all.

230
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Shit!

231
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,532
Why do I always screw up?

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,839
You do seem pretty good
at it, though.

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,360
- Cass won't talk to me.
- What makes you think that?

234
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
Came in the post.

235
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,040
My life is a total shit pile again.

236
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,119
My best friend - I fucked it up.

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,160
My girlfriend - I fucked it up.

238
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,280
My other girlfriend -
I fucked it up.

239
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,160
You'd give anything
to have it all fixed.

240
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,319
But you're incapable of anything
involving effort, focus or subtlety...

241
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,560
Yep.

242
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,120
Women are a total mystery to you.

243
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
- You got it.
- Any good at art?

244
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,002
Course not.

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,120
My art coursework.

246
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,520
It's on the subject of emotion
and you seem quite...

247
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,960
Emotional.
So you can do it for me.

248
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,880
And?

249
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,420
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

250
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,320
I'll sort out
your fucking soap opera.

251
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:17,779
You will?

252
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,640
Just this once.

253
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,080
Oh! Effy, you've got such
a lovely lot of clothes.

254
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,600
Pals always share, don't they?
Oh, hang on.

255
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:46,520
Hi, Mum. Guess what?

256
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,073
I've got a friend!

257
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:50,210
No, not like the last one.

258
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,970
No, not on the internet.

259
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,730
No, Mum, she really is
a girl this time.

260
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,530
Come on.

261
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,130
Where we going, Eff?

262
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,043
- Eff?
- Yeah. Where we going, Eff?

263
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,114
- To pick up.
- Pick up what?

264
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:10,663
Hi, Mum!

265
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:12,442
We're just going to pick up.

266
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,363
She wants to know what.

267
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,317
Drugs.

268
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:16,720
Salad. Eff!

269
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,120
Come in.

270
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:35,257
Who's this?

271
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:36,886
- Pandora.
- Hi.

272
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,606
She's a virgin.

273
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,160
Cool!

274
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,520
Hey, Cass. I borrowed your knickers.

275
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,866
OK. See you.

276
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:46,290
You're an awesome shag,
you know that?

277
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,410
Of course!

278
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,558
They're man and woman kissing!

279
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:02,920
Cass.

280
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:07,084
Sid says he's very sorry.

281
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,385
He loves you.

282
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,880
He's sorry he fucked Michelle.

283
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,610
He wants you back.

284
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,085
Tell him I've discovered
the power of the pussy.

285
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:16,508
Oh, yes!

286
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,605
That one's called Sidley.

287
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,762
And that's Mischa.

288
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:36,266
Isn't Mischa just so pretty?

289
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,360
Look at Sidley,
sliming all over her.

290
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,960
Disgusting, isn't he?

291
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,084
Are they doing it?

292
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:45,640
Yes, they are doing it.

293
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,616
When I'm ready
I'll pour salt on them.

294
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:51,770
When I'm good and ready.

295
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,880
Come on, get your bush.

296
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,090
There you go.

297
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,480
Three eighths of top-quality weed.

298
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,010
- All right if I pay you tomorrow?
- It's all right. I can pay.

299
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,658
How much is it for weeds?

300
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,656
Oh. Not much.

301
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,680
Grandpops died and left me
his credit card.

302
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:23,642
Right.

303
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,360
Are we gonna put weeds in
a reefer now and get honky?

304
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Not yet.

305
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,008
It's open.

306
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,840
- Hi, Cass.
- Hi, Danny.

307
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,424
Come here.

308
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,850
Gotta get on, you know.

309
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,450
So, Sid?

310
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,860
Any other thoughts?

311
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,874
Tell him I'm on a one-way ticket
to Dick City,

312
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:52,640
and I love it.

313
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,212
Bloomin' heck!

314
00:19:57,332 --> 00:20:00,122
She's a bit of a...
What do you call it?

315
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:02,040
Whore.

316
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:38,410
Sorry I messed everything up.

317
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:41,561
Sorry for not looking
when I crossed the road.

318
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,820
Sorry you got depressed.

319
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,890
Sorry Dad couldn't handle
being around at home.

320
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,280
I love her, Mum.

321
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,370
I keep thinking...

322
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,320
I keep thinking she's just
gonna turn up at the door.

323
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,727
What's the point?
You can't hear me.

324
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,280
She's our Sleeping Beauty.

325
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,610
Jesus!

326
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,081
Waiting for a prince.

327
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,000
You want some spliff?

328
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,680
- It makes me weird.
- What, weirder than this?

329
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,690
Fuck it.

330
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,080
Why bother?

331
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,042
With what?

332
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,450
Caring about people.

333
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,726
You don't fool me,

334
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,029
Effy Stonem.

335
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,090
Hi, Mum!

336
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,614
No, I'm fine.

337
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,772
I'm super-duper fine.

338
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:10,250
Yep.

339
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,919
I'm with my friends

340
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,004
and they're, like,
so fucking amazing!

341
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:19,320
Well, I guess I'm looking
at Tony's cock.

342
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,360
But he can't tell.

343
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,530
See ya!

344
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:48,720
Is Effy in?

345
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,170
- Upstairs.
- Ta.

346
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,849
You gonna nail my sister?
Is that it?

347
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:03,250
First my girlfriend, then my sister?

348
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,851
No, I...

349
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,077
All right.

350
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,640
Just asking.

351
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,267
Nah, I'll wait till she's 16.

352
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,439
Keep it legal, yeah?

353
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:23,168
Loser isn't an emotion.

354
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,934
It is to me.

355
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,400
- You think it's shit, don't you?
- Yes.

356
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,924
I used four Biros!
I bought them!

357
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,259
Four!

358
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,760
You owe me 79 pence.

359
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:40,770
Woah, Effy, what are you doing?

360
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,612
I'm going out.
You've got 24 hours, Sid,

361
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:47,360
to produce something that doesn't
look like coursework for GCSE Spaz.

362
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:58,460
Dip your brush in that.
And don't even think of leaving

363
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,350
this room until you've done it.

364
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,720
Listen, I don't think
this is working out, yeah?

365
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,960
Shall we just leave it, OK? I quit.

366
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:17,570
Sid! Oh, my God! It's huge! Sid!

367
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,930
All right. I'm doing it.

368
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,964
Enjoy.

369
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:30,060
Somebody come and get me.

370
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,890
Why do I have to come?

371
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,710
Because if you get any more boring,
we'll have to put you down.

372
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,983
- Nice.
- I don't think you're boring, Tony.

373
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:44,103
What about Mum?

374
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:47,410
She doesn't like boys. She says
they just want my pants to get into.

375
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,810
No. My Mum.

376
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,090
She's fine. She's asleep.

377
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,770
Stop being a prick. All right?

378
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,244
- Hi, Reg!
- All right, sweetheart?

379
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:56,750
How's the novel going?

380
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:00,039
To be honest, Effy, I'm having
a struggle with the denouement.

381
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,970
My publisher's getting very picky

382
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,450
about the post-modernist
chapter structure.

383
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,359
- Hang on, who's this?
- This is Pandora.

384
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,159
How old are you, love? 12?

385
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,290
No. I'm...

386
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,581
... 32!

387
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,662
I think you're taking the piss,
little girl.

388
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:24,079
And I don't like it
when little girls take the piss.

389
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:27,040
Do know what I wanna do with little
girls who take the piss? Do you?

390
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,759
I give 'em a lollipop.

391
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:37,728
Go on in, girls. Have a good'un.

392
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:42,753
ID?

393
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:46,650
Strictly over 21s.

394
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,069
Hang on. You just let them in.

395
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:50,330
Who?

396
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:51,719
Come on.

397
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,370
Give me a fucking lollipop!

398
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,244
Can't do it, mate.

399
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,810
Yeah, in you go.

400
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,970
Blimmin' heck!

401
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,330
You want to make fuck fuck
with nice sexy boy?

402
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,650
Piss off, Jake.

403
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,119
You look hot, baby.

404
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:32,799
It makes me want to take you!

405
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,679
Holy shit!

406
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,770
Listen to me, fuckpig.
We've got spliff to sell,

407
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,999
so send little Dicky back to
Bollockistan and get on with it. OK?

408
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,439
You do spliff.
I'll do pills.

409
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,559
What pills?

410
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:55,519
Make over 100 quid and I'll
make sure you get laid. Deal?

411
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,759
Just as friends.

412
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,281
Just as friends.

413
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,810
Come on.

414
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:00,530
Where's the sodding ashtray.

415
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,450
This is brilliant, Eff!

416
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,648
Best friends always go to the
wizza together, don't they?

417
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,140
I've seen it in the films.

418
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,279
Got any loo paper, Eff?

419
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,690
No.

420
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,610
Eff? Eff. I wanna get wonky
off my face too.

421
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,079
Can I have one?

422
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,410
Oh, for Christ sake. One.
And you puke on your own, OK?

423
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:58,130
You owe me three quid.

424
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:01,099
What do you think?

425
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,161
Oh, yes.

426
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:05,893
Excellent, but...

427
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,887
In you go girls.
Have a good'un.

428
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:10,169
But?

429
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,379
The character arcs
are immaculately achieved

430
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,319
with a good degree
of stylistic control.

431
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,399
Especially liked the doorman
with super powers.

432
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,679
Vaporising Reeboks, very nice.

433
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,496
But you need to move
the climactic development back,

434
00:29:24,616 --> 00:29:28,250
so the orgy scene comes before the
disembowelling of the Elvic Horde.

435
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,370
See?

436
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,900
That's it!

437
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,709
That's it! You solved it!

438
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,690
Have a good one, mate.

439
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:26,799
What the fuck are you doing?
You just sold Michelle's watch.

440
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:30,199
Let it go, Tony.
Michelle did.

441
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,614
What? What!

442
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:33,859
Tony!

443
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:38,868
Tony, the music's beautiful!

444
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:41,770
You're beautiful!

445
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,599
- Get off.
- I love you!

446
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,730
Pandora, no!

447
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,130
I want to lick your bottom.

448
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,290
No!

449
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,450
I want to lick your... balls.

450
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,133
For fuck's sakes.

451
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,730
Time to go home.

452
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,393
I fucking hate you.

453
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,170
Well, hello.

454
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:04,552
130 English pounds.

455
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,920
I claim my prize. American Pie.

456
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,450
Lucky you.

457
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,730
Just one thing.

458
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,130
Man,
you said we were gonna get jiggy!

459
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,890
I said you'd get laid, Jake.

460
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,547
And you will. You will.

461
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,615
Don't worry.

462
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,850
You're gonna love this.

463
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,970
So you don't know me but a very good
friend of mine said you might be

464
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,810
into what I'm into?

465
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,640
Oh, and what's that?

466
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:59,080
Then she told me that all that time

467
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,399
she'd been screwing my friend.
I was just...

468
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:05,897
I couldn't believe she'd
do that to me, you know?

469
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,639
If it wasn't for my slugs,

470
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,570
I don't know what I might have...

471
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,444
Poor you.
I can't believe it.

472
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,407
It happened to me too.

473
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,570
Yeah?

474
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,650
And what did you do about it?

475
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,391
Fuck relationships.

476
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,068
I'm into mindless sex now.

477
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,696
Oh, mindless. Yeah.

478
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,090
You know, I just wanna blot
everything out, you know.

479
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,250
I'd really like to blot it out now.

480
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,905
Right here,

481
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,440
by this window?

482
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,983
How old did you say you were?

483
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,050
Oh, older than I look.

484
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,650
It's the grief.
It takes years off you.

485
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,200
Oh, yeah.

486
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,595
NOOOO!!!!!!

487
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,167
Phone's buggered.

488
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,106
Can't call her then?

489
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,581
What's the use?

490
00:34:57,377 --> 00:35:00,189
The thing I don't understand
is why her voicemail is off.

491
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,606
If I could leave a message...

492
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,038
But it just rings and rings.

493
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,918
You really don't understand
anything, do you, Tone?

494
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,359
What?

495
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:11,439
As long as it's ringing,

496
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,610
she knows you're there.

497
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:20,360
I can't believe you sold
Michelle's watch.

498
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,839
- Who says I sold it?
- What d'you mean?

499
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:28,770
Put your SIM in that.

500
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,061
I'm going out.

501
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,450
Michelle! There's a man here
with a parcel for you!

502
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,959
Cass!

503
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,930
Listen, open the door, Cass.

504
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,290
Sid, she doesn't wanna see you.

505
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,160
I don't fucking care, OK? Cass!

506
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,720
Come on, leave it, man.
This ain't...

507
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,096
What the fuck are you doing?

508
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:03,690
Jesus, Sid. Just go, man.

509
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,800
It's all right, Chris. I'm fine.

510
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:07,930
All right. Watch it.

511
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,051
Yeah? Or I'll...

512
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,259
What will I do?

513
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,560
Bite his head off
and spit in the hole?

514
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,970
Yeah.

515
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,600
I probably wouldn't do that,
but... Yeah...

516
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,800
What do you want, Sid?

517
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,050
I want you to stop
what you're doing, OK?

518
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:40,040
You know, fucking around. Fucking
anything that moves. Just stop it.

519
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:42,665
- You started it.
- I don't care.

520
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,473
I don't care. You're cruel.

521
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:48,370
- I hate you.
- Hate you right back.

522
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,240
Why don't you pop over to Michelle's
and give her one? Oh, another one.

523
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,760
Give it a fucking rest, OK?
You know, it's you and me.

524
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,840
You know that
and you're being stupid.

525
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,040
My turn.

526
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,520
You went away. Why did you go away?
I needed you, and you pissed off.

527
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,160
My dad said...

528
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:10,160
He said you're special
but you're not.

529
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,282
You're just slutting around
like a spoilt kid.

530
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:14,811
Michelle, Sid. Michelle!

531
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:17,090
I don't love Michelle!

532
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,240
I never loved Michelle.
I loved you, but you...

533
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,135
You...

534
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,330
Oh, God.

535
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,079
Where were you?

536
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,640
Dad fucking died!

537
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:40,188
I needed you...

538
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,546
And Michelle...

539
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:49,850
So we had great sex for three days
and then guilty sex for the rest.

540
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,604
So what?

541
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:58,130
I don't care.

542
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,730
I did it.

543
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,810
I hate you.

544
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,621
Fine.

545
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,537
Fuck 15-year-olds.

546
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,511
Whatever. I'm sick of saying sorry.

547
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,130
I love you.

548
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,633
You say sorry.

549
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,490
I didn't fuck him, Sid.

550
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,930
His mum had sewn his name
into his trousers.

551
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,360
And well,

552
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,169
he got a bit excited.

553
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,530
And he squashed my slug.

554
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:01,573
My slug called Sidley.

555
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,800
So I threw him out.

556
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,016
Look, if he's still bothering you,
Cass, then...

557
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:30,865
Got ya.

558
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,800
Smokin'!

559
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,013
<i>I love you, too.</i>

560
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,170
Deadline is upon us.

561
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,530
I have coursework from everyone
of a very high standard.

562
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,360
Pandora's contribution
is thrillingly abstract.

563
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,370
It simply reeks of emotion.

564
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,696
The girl has great talent.

565
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,752
Surprising.

566
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:39,720
Even Ursula has come through
with a little coaching.

567
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:41,996
All As, without a doubt.

568
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:44,824
Another triumph
for the art department.

569
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,880
All we need is now is yours

570
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,926
and we will have our 100%
record for another year.

571
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,574
It's finished.

572
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,490
Oh. Splendid.

573
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,929
And which emotion have you depicted?

574
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:01,760
Anger, jealousy,
bitterness, tiredness,

575
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:04,400
hope, lust,

576
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,714
love.

577
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:10,640
A veritable feast. So where is it?

578
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:15,084
It's everywhere.

579
00:42:15,204 --> 00:42:18,318
My dear girl,
I'm not sure I understand.

580
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:21,610
It's conceptual.
You just can't see it.

581
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:25,278
- You're saying you haven't done it.
- No.

582
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:27,275
I'm saying you can't see it.

583
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,226
Well, I'm not quite sure
that's going to work

584
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:33,200
for the Anglo-Welsh GCSE Board,
now, is it...?

585
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,570
No.

586
00:42:35,244 --> 00:42:37,290
They'll just have to expel me.

587
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,760
- Goodbye, Madame Deluca.
- Goodbye, Effy.

588
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,696
I was going to tell you
about Georges Braque.

589
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:51,959
He was a very great artist

590
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,319
and also truly remarkable
at oral sex.

591
00:42:56,057 --> 00:43:00,008
Anyway, he gave me some advice
I've always remembered.

592
00:43:00,573 --> 00:43:01,890
What was it?

593
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,960
If they don't like it, fuck 'em.

594
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,490
Ah, Georges,

595
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,050
Georges...

596
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:21,197
Hello!

597
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,936
I'm back!

598
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,690
Hi, Dad.

599
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,951
Hi. They let me come back early.

600
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:39,210
That's great.

601
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,690
Yes, isn't it?

602
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:43,610
- Where's Mum?
- She's asleep.

603
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,320
Well, she won't mind if I go up,
then.

604
00:43:48,446 --> 00:43:50,817
Tired after the flight, you know.

605
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:51,979
Fine.

606
00:43:52,157 --> 00:43:54,520
So. You feeling OK, son?

607
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:57,250
I'm feeling great, Dad.

608
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,280
Good.

609
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,170
That's really good.

610
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,680
What you been up to?

611
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:05,137
Revision.

612
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:07,970
It's good to have you back, Dad.

613
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,530
It's good to be back.

614
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:25,210
Jim.

615
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,610
Came home early.

616
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:28,570
Missed you.

617
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,370
I've been asleep.

618
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,301
Is everything all right?

619
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,410
Think so.

621
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,560
{\a3}Well, I must say...
