1
00:00:01,388 --> 00:00:03,240
I'm Thomas.
I'm so glad to meet you.

2
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:08,556
I'm Freddie.
I met a girl I like today.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,421
She's beautiful.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,000
I just wanted to kiss you.
I want to kiss you now.

5
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:17,680
You're amazing.

6
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,240
- Any of you girls fancy it?
- You're repulsive.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,178
Go on, fuck off home!

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,991
I'm never going to a brothel
with you again.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,224
Synchro: mpm, Arrow

10
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,188
Please come back.

11
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:56,810
Come back.

12
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:08,395
Hi, I made tea.

13
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:12,839
- I didn't mean to surprise you...
- It's OK, Anthea.

14
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:18,717
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you know... Just, just looking.

15
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:20,477
Right.

16
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,415
Whizzer.

17
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,578
Eff's a bit out of it.

18
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,403
She's beautiful... Not like me.

19
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:33,261
Seems like somebody likes you!

20
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:35,224
My boyfriend gave it to me.

21
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,105
I only knew him three days.

22
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:40,737
Now he's gone.

23
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:42,785
But it was fun while it lasted?

24
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:45,799
So much fun...

25
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,569
Yeah, it's called love.

26
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,049
- That's a big word!
- I dunno. Four letters is...

27
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:56,684
But I'm sure it is love.

28
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,359
All you want to do
is kiss them and...

29
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,157
you know, other stuff?

30
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:03,226
Brilliant stuff.

31
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:10,035
Yeah, brilliant stuff.

32
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,639
Maybe this Thomas will hop
on a train and come back to see you.

33
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,056
- You can't get a train from the Congo.
- Congo?

34
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:19,141
Yeah, it's a Democratic Republic,

35
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,320
located on the Equator
bordering Gabon and Cameroon.

36
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,046
Yeah, I remember now.

37
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,816
I really miss him.

38
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:27,269
You think love conquers all, Anthea?

39
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,491
I hope so, sweetie.

40
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,534
Why don't you wake up
the sleeping beauty

41
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,764
and tell her we have something
called "breakfast" in our country?

42
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,816
After that we had to get out
mega-speedily,

43
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:56,563
so we climbed over some spiky fence,
and found ourselves in this field.

44
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:59,494
- Then what did we do, Eff?
- Can't remember.

45
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,422
We either went to the park

46
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,405
and then got chips,
or the other way round.

47
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:06,039
- Which was it, Eff?
- Chips. Oh, yeah.

48
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:09,133
Super cool. Brown sauce
soaks up all the Red Bulls.

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,960
Then we went crazy cos Cook pulled down
JJ's pants and showed us his willy.

50
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,799
Morning, Mum... Yeah thanks.

51
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,119
Super duper great night
at the youth centre.

52
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,439
I made soup, we prayed
and recycled socks.

53
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,354
Soup - for the homeless,
they love soup.

54
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,440
Cream of mushroom...

55
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:29,320
Okey-doke.
Effy says, "Howdy doody."

56
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,480
See you later, alligator.

57
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,244
Did you just...?

58
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:37,765
- That was a pack of lies.
- Oh, you can't tell my mum the truth.

59
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:40,245
She'd only do agony
flip and go ra-ra.

60
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:42,825
Is she speaking English?

61
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,894
She means the truth hurts, Dad.

62
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,760
It's for her own good.

63
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,647
Otherwise, truth...

64
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:54,668
- You all right, love?
- Yeah, I just... I just gotta...

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,300
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

66
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,160
Is someone going to start speaking
a language round here I understand?

67
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,119
Steve, mate?
Am I driving today?

68
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,231
You're doing the International Webcam
and Hard Drive Expo in Poole.

69
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,251
You don't want to miss that.

70
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,584
I can't do it.

71
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:22,400
Jesus! You should have told me,
I fucking love those hard drive events.

72
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,901
- Jim, who are you talking...?
- I need you.

73
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:27,836
OK, I'll get the car keys.
Get you to Poole in no time.

74
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,999
For fuck's sake, I love you!

75
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:33,504
When are you fucking
going to understand that?

76
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,493
Mate, I'm... I'm married.

77
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,905
I'm straight.

78
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:45,092
Don't do dick, no way no how,
but, you know...

79
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,293
I mean, <i>c'est la vie</i>.
Each to their own.

80
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,119
- I told you...
- It's too late.

81
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:02,151
Wallop!

82
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:05,060
Bitch! Bitch!

83
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:10,710
You don't understand! Jim, please!

84
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:13,337
- Listen!
- All those weekends!

85
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,880
Those bendy fucking yoga weekends
in Dartmouth!

86
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,566
You were bending
all right, weren't you?

87
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,756
In all the right fucking places!

88
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:26,504
Just let me...

89
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,344
I just want to explain to you.

90
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,344
You've done enough
explaining, haven't you?

91
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,680
- I'm sorry.
- I love you.

92
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,853
Please don't leave me.

93
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,400
What a mess.

94
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,664
They fuck you up.

95
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,162
They don't mean to, Eff.

96
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,048
But they do.

97
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,472
Not now, Mum.

98
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,119
Bugger it, Eff.

99
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:28,988
You can't half leg it.

100
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,220
And I've got cross-country badge!

101
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,399
Do you think your mum
and funny beard have been, you know...

102
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,275
making monkey?

103
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,971
Yes, Pandora.
They've been making monkey.

104
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,640
Surfed and turfed...

105
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,421
Eff, don't cry.

106
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,640
Does... does this mean you're not coming
to my pyjama party?

107
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:02,559
I'm not crying.

108
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:04,224
Right.

109
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:05,753
But my party?

110
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:08,293
Sure.

111
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,654
Why not?

112
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,482
Let's get totally, totally fucked.

113
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,202
Yeah, that's the thing.

114
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:17,111
My mum's gonna be there and we're
gonna put on pyjamas and play Twister.

115
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,711
It's brilliant fun,
more fun than getting fucked...

116
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:22,427
probably. And then you're all going
to tell me how to do it with Tommo

117
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,497
because I haven't got a clue.

118
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:28,696
Pandora, why are we friends?

119
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,687
Do you ever wonder?

120
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,360
That's super easy.

121
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,493
You're my pal
because you're the coolest ever,

122
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,687
and I'm yours because
I'll totally do anything you say

123
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,520
and none of your boyfriends
ever want to surf me cos I'm useless.

124
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,859
That's it?

125
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,636
Come on,

126
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,418
- let's get hot chocolates.
- Cool.

127
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:57,369
I've been ringing you loads!

128
00:08:57,489 --> 00:09:00,769
You know Danny, he plays for
the Bristol Rovers Reserves, yeah?

129
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:03,273
Yes, nice one, tasty.

130
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,602
This is my new best friend, Effy.

131
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:07,606
Cool tits, yeah?

132
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,260
- Sorry?
- Nice jugglies, babe... perky.

133
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,810
He doesn't mean it,
do you, babes?

134
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,380
Fuckin' right I do!

135
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,064
And I'm Pandora.

136
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,688
Hey kid, you should come up the ground,
watch the lads train, yeah?

137
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:25,869
Cos after, we get some Lambrinis in,
we go lucky in the showers?

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
He's joking, right?

139
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:32,748
Right.

140
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,994
Anyway. Can't wait for
this party tonight.

141
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:37,825
- I've got a shitload of weed and pills.
- Weeds?

142
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,760
- Cool.
- Yeah man. Way safe... Orgy!

143
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,960
You're not coming.
It's girls only. Right?

144
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,009
We're gonna tell secrets
and get intimate, no boys.

145
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,129
Intimate?!

146
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Yes. Nice one!
Take photos, babe!

147
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,308
So I've got Flying Saucepans
and Love Fountains.

148
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,274
- We're gonna fry!
- But, we're doing Twister.

149
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:59,574
- Cool. You can snort that, right?
- Not exactly.

150
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:02,409
- Love Fountains are mint!
- Mum's making brownies.

151
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:04,440
You OK?

152
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:08,192
She's upset because her mum's been
making monkey and her dad's gone ape.

153
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:11,360
Bananas! Cos Beardy Steve's been making
her do the Funky Gibbon and...

154
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:13,960
- I've boobed, haven't I?
- Yes!

155
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,386
I loves the Funky Gibbon!

156
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,138
You're gonna fuck off?

157
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,527
We need girl time.

158
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,909
Practice your ball skills, babe.

159
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:25,030
I'll do that keepy-uppy thing later,
remember?

160
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,013
Mum's done the signal.

161
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,939
So everybody knows
where my party is.

162
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,100
How many people did you invite?

163
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,991
Four. You, Eff, Emily and Naomi.

164
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:15,855
- Why did you invite her?
- Em's says I have to or she won't come.

165
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:18,116
- Sweet.
- Come on.

166
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,695
We can do brownies
and then lick our bowls out.

167
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,091
Do you think she knows
she sounds filthy half the time?

168
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:25,759
Sometimes I wonder.

169
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,229
Blastification!

170
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,171
Drat! Drat! Fiddlesticks!

171
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,554
Panda, we have spoken about shouting
like a goat in the house.

172
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,600
Sorry. Look, Mum. Friends!

173
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:43,493
Still shouting, Panda.
Calm time, please.

174
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm calm.

175
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,676
So... this is Effy.

176
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,879
Effy! We meet at last.

177
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:02,304
Pandora has told me
so much about you.

178
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,426
Yeah, you know...
your missionary work.

179
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:06,840
Yes, I try and do as
much of that as I can.

180
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,054
That's good. There's so
many bad things in the world.

181
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:11,474
Boys, and drugs,

182
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,290
guns, alcohol.

183
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:15,984
Boys. Evil things.

184
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:19,681
I'm glad Pandora's found a channel
she can pour her energy into.

185
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,440
All the seamen like her.

186
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:23,637
Seamen?

187
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,080
Loads of seamen.
Some of them are homeless as well.

188
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,814
We'd all love to see Pandora
get her own missionary position.

189
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,412
Right...

190
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:36,920
Lovely. And this is?

191
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,560
- I haven't heard about you.
- She's a new friend, Mum. Stupid.

192
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,906
Well, that's wonderful.

193
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,608
We're not used to having so many
friends, are we, Panda?

194
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,233
No. And I've got more.

195
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,403
Heaps more.

196
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,012
- Two more.
- Four friends.

197
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:57,760
Goodness. We're going to have
a wild old time, aren't we?

198
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,360
I hope you all like
playing Monster in the Dark.

199
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:02,240
Looking forward to it.

200
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:06,649
I expect you all want to wash
your hands and take your shoes off.

201
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,798
Come on. I'll show you
Mum's special box.

202
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,160
"London's burning London's burning

203
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
"Fetch the engines
Fetch the engines

204
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,120
"Fire, fire!
Fire, fire!

205
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,652
"Making brownies, making brownies
Really yummy, really yummy

206
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:58,040
"Making brownies, making brownies

207
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:04,479
Fucking hell.

208
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,354
Nothing, young lady.

209
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:13,107
I have nothing to say to you at all.

210
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,449
What the fuck is that?

211
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,513
I've never been to a pyjama party
before, so I brought vodka.

212
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:26,572
- Was that right?
- Dunno.

213
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,640
- I don't wear pyjamas.
- Right.

214
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,560
I dunno why she invited me anyway.

215
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,640
- I hardly know her.
- I asked her to invite you.

216
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:41,580
- I thought we sorted this out.
- No, I didn't mean that.

217
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,823
Well, it doesn't hurt
to get to know each other.

218
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:45,258
We're in the same class.

219
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:47,238
We'll be hanging out
for the next 2 years...

220
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,760
You going to tell people
you're gay anytime soon?

221
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,879
What?

222
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:53,442
I'm not.

223
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm not gay.

224
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,163
Telling you, Em.

225
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,232
You haven't thought this through,
have you?

226
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:02,495
So can I just say again?

227
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:05,639
Me, not muff muncher.
Me, cock cruncher.

228
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,801
You getting any cock?

229
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:13,487
I have done.

230
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:17,136
Except he had erectile dysfunction.

231
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:18,866
17 times.

232
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,368
I was getting tennis elbow,
you know.

233
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,116
Can I help you with something?

234
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:36,515
This is a quiet cul-de-sac
and you are disgraceful young women.

235
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,740
So go fuck yourself, tosser.

236
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:44,662
What?

237
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:49,075
More friends! Naomi and Emily!

238
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,838
Calm, please, Panda.

239
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm calm.

240
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,795
We've been so looking forward
to this, haven't we, Panda?

241
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,084
What?

242
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,275
Shoes!

243
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,592
Are you all chums?

244
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,274
Ems and Naomi are real good friends.

245
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,320
- How lovely.
- Really good,

246
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,756
and now they like me as well.

247
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,347
Hang on. Aren't you Katie?

248
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,567
That's the amazing thing! Katie!

249
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,582
They're twins.
<i>C'est incroyable</i>, baby!

250
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:25,639
- Sorry?
- It's French. Thomas taught me!

251
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,951
He's such a blinkin' dream and...

252
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:30,785
Bugger.

253
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,179
Who's Thomas?

254
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,062
You know...

255
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:41,760
Pandora. I do hope you haven't been
defying me on the subject of boys.

256
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,619
He's my boyfriend, actually.

257
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,040
He does... excellent French.

258
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:50,489
Right. Well,

259
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,981
- She knows my opinion on boyfriends.
- They just want to get into my box.

260
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,914
Yes, and I do hope all of you
will respect that in this house

261
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,434
we do not allow unruly males
at parties.

262
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,670
I'm sure your parents
would say the same thing.

263
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,323
Boys. Yuk. Disgusting.

264
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,547
There you go, Katie and Emily.

265
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,231
Completely identical.

266
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,543
Are you interested in
all the same things?

267
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,039
- I'm not sure.
- You like Twister?

268
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,524
- Sorry?
- Twister! It's brill!

269
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,673
It's gonna be twistomatic, baby!

270
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:26,793
Pandora gets over-stimulated.
We do exercises nightly.

271
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,920
I've left pyjamas out for you.

272
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,279
They're pink... and clean.
Very, very clean.

273
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,000
Are they nicely gooey?

274
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,823
I'm certainly hoping so.

275
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,285
Heavenly.

276
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,123
You know,

277
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,480
You know, I'm wondering if if you aren't
a little bit naughty, Effy.

278
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:07,818
I am.

279
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:12,603
I bet you're naughty enough to try these
brownies with me before anybody else.

280
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,525
I'll try anything.

281
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,876
Okay, then. Let's dive in.

282
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,280
I love brownies. I love them.

283
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:29,594
Twister.

284
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,295
Are you shitting me?

285
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,794
Don't worry.

286
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,849
I spiked the chocolate brownies
with MDMA.

287
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,191
- You what?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:45,800
Appreciate it, OK. There's
fucking 40 quid's worth in there.

289
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,956
- You think it's funny?
- It is kind of.

290
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,181
Yeah, enter into the spirit, Ems.

291
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,469
So, Katie, you gonna be nice to me now,
we're Twister pals?

292
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,931
I promise not to grab your minge
and everything.

293
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,850
Hands off the muff and we're sorted.

294
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,085
Gotcha, no buffing the beaver.

295
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,805
No groping the growler.

296
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,612
Don't tickle on my tinkle.

297
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:15,760
- Okay, I won't fluff up your flange.
- You done?

298
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:19,400
We're double done with the DNA dump.

299
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,979
Hey, guys!
What do you think?

300
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,299
Mum made them specially, and look!

301
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:30,880
- Jesus.
- So you can have Sexy Poo...

302
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,040
or Brainy Poo.

303
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:37,865
Except for me, cos I have Panda Poo!

304
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:42,217
Mum and me sewed 'em on.
It was a wacker job, I'm telling you.

305
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,610
- I'm not wearing that.
- Why not? It's a pyjama party.

306
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,120
- What the fuck? Give it here.
- Whizzer poo!

307
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:51,058
Because look what goes with them.

308
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:53,916
Isn't Mum wick?

309
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:08,639
- Are they getting undressed?
- They're not.

310
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,120
Why would they get undressed?

311
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:14,811
Can I remind you

312
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:17,601
that Pandora's party is specified
as a girls-only event.

313
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,490
And you know what that means?

314
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:22,440
Of course I do.

315
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,120
So I'm not 100% sure what it means.

316
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:33,469
So let me enlighten you, Double J.

317
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,310
Pyjama party means only one thing:

318
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,480
- girls getting friendly.
- Friendly?

319
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,744
Real friendly.

320
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,924
Hang on. Even I know
that only happens in overblown

321
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:48,796
and possibly illegal teen dramas.

322
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,174
Mum says there's a lot less sex
going on than I might imagine.

323
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,911
You never experienced
wish fulfilment, J?

324
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:58,171
Never.

325
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,604
They're all in there,

326
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:04,280
girls getting to know each other,
experimenting, getting lubed up

327
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,524
and gagging for forbidden fruit
and we're gonna give it to them.

328
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:09,135
If Freddie was here...

329
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,719
Do you see Freddie?
Did we invite Freddie?

330
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,417
- And why didn't we invite him?
- Because he's a fun-sponge?

331
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:17,537
You got it.

332
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,586
You see?

333
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,570
It's a sign.

334
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:28,318
I'll call the police.

335
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:44,116
Come on!

336
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:46,960
This is a fantasy and I have
to tell you, a poorly constructed one.

337
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,712
Because I have a natural facility
on a climbing wall...

338
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,332
Get in there. Come on,
we need to see them doing it.

339
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,652
For the last time,
they won't be doing it.

340
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,400
They won't be naked, or engaged
in mutual masturbation...

341
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,834
- Check.
- What?

342
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:02,116
I'm requesting a check.
Is that too much to ask of a friend?

343
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:12,212
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

344
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:13,440
What... What?

345
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,440
- They're n... na...
- Please say naked.

346
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,333
- Nearly naked.
- That's good enough.

347
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,200
What the fuck?

348
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
- Come on, Eff, pyjamas.
- Whatever...

349
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:47,683
I can't hang on.
I'm going to slip!

350
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,000
- What was that?
- Nothing.

351
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,925
Tummy. Too much cake...

352
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:01,840
Mum, look. We're pretty in pink!

353
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,233
That's wonderful, girls.

354
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:07,667
I must compliment myself, though.

355
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:10,248
My brownies are usually delicious,

356
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:13,959
but I've really excelled myself.
This is my third already.

357
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,719
I'm gonna have three.
Thanks, Mum.

358
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,081
Yeah, sure...

359
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:22,147
Listen to that.

360
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,096
Can you hear the music?

361
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:35,374
Mum?

362
00:24:35,923 --> 00:24:37,320
Oh, that's beautiful.

363
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:38,840
It sounds...

364
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:42,312
- What's she doing?
- Wonderful.

365
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,291
I'm getting it!

366
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,760
I'm telling you.

367
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,907
That is fucking good shit!

368
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,720
What have you done?

369
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,160
Eat a cake, Panda.
It's gonna be a long night.

370
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm telling you, man.
We gotta fucking get in there!

371
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,480
Freddie says, every time you ask me
to do something, just say no.

372
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,360
- He said that?
- Yes. It's a song

373
00:25:56,684 --> 00:26:00,067
which gives useful lifestyle advice
but it's also a state of mind.

374
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,466
Maybe me and Freds will have words.

375
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:05,154
But somehow, Gay J,
I'm going to this party.

376
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,324
You coming?

377
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:11,718
Just say no.

378
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,543
Suit yourself, Gay J.

379
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,840
Oh, balls!

380
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:22,773
Freds, you gotta get down here!
We've gone to Nine.

381
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:24,345
- <i>Nine?</i>
- Affirmative.

382
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:26,272
It's a Niner. Code Red.

383
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,462
- He's going in.
- <i>Stop him, JJ. Stop him!</i>

384
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,341
Result.

385
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:47,400
- Oh, God...
- Dump her in here! Dump her in here!

386
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:52,640
Shit! Fuck!

387
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:55,680
That was so...

388
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:57,732
So fun.

389
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:08,175
Is she breathing?

390
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:12,827
Safe.

391
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,107
Oh, man!

392
00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:29,760
- Panda, come on! Let me in.
- Go away!

393
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,071
It was a joke.

394
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,634
It wasn't even me!

395
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:35,602
You always bog everything up!

396
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,414
It's always you!
You do everything you like

397
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:41,480
just because you're depressed cos
your mum's getting wacked up the pants!

398
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Well, bogging bog off!

399
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,999
This is my party and I'm upset
because my boyfriend got deported

400
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:49,951
and you're supposed to be playing
and eating jelly

401
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,029
and playing Twister at my party

402
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,478
and telling me how to pop my cherry
with my boyfriend...!

403
00:27:55,598 --> 00:27:57,560
Christ's sake, I'll show you
how to do a blowjob.

404
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,169
I don't want a blowjob.

405
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:00,934
I want my boyfriend back!

406
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,630
I was just...

407
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,840
She's upset.

408
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,080
Do I ever get to be upset?

409
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,064
Do I ever get to be anyone but me?!

410
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,600
- Fuck off!
- Wait. Effy, just...

411
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,999
For Christ's sake!

412
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:31,080
Get Cook out. Don't get arrested.

413
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:38,160
They will not be naked.
I'm going in.

414
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:39,800
Where you going?

415
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:41,935
Wine. I want wine.

416
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,404
Hurry up with it!

417
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:46,495
Get beer, lezzer!

418
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:49,029
All right, all right!
Keep your vagina on.

419
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,005
So... What do you want, Ems?

420
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,070
Pinot Grigio, or...

421
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:08,852
cider oblivion?

422
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:10,546
Anything...

423
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,634
Just give me a fucking...

424
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:17,962
Just... Just give me a...

425
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,141
It's only the drugs, right?

426
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,631
You liked that.

427
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,008
You're gay.

428
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,942
Oh, my giddy, giddy, giddy...

429
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:25,956
aunt!

430
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:12,734
Shit.

431
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:22,120
Where are you, girl?
Which fucking house, girl?

432
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:28,737
What's going on, kidder?

433
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,921
The lads!

434
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:33,615
Shit.

435
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,831
Pyjama party, check it out, lads.

436
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:37,560
Nice one!

437
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,863
You're not meant
to be here, remember?

438
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,560
Come on. Have a heart.
We lost 7-0 again, innit?

439
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,560
You know the lads... Tommo...

440
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:47,240
Marco... How you doing, man?

441
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:50,161
Jonno... Sambo... Keeno...

442
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Danno...

443
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:53,600
Paedo!

444
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:55,585
Nice...!

445
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:15,247
Sorry.

446
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,207
The fucking door's
locked itself, hasn't it?

447
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:48,480
- You should've pulled.
- I will now, won't I?

448
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,715
Is this the cupboard
for mindless sex?

449
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,173
You don't give a fuck
about anything, do you?

450
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,190
Go away.

451
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:20,363
Go away.

452
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:24,849
Please.

453
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,210
I want my boyfriend.

454
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:32,626
Wait.

455
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:34,595
Hang on. Don't push.

456
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,000
- I wanna...
- Wait! There's something here.

457
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,300
What the fuck?

458
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,058
What's going on?

459
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:54,414
Are we...?

460
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,570
Are we next door?

461
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:07,412
We're next door.

462
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:26,360
<i>Hello. I'm Martin.</i>

463
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,362
<i>This is Angela.</i>

464
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,738
<i>And this is how we have sex.</i>

465
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:48,065
<i>- That's lovely, Angela.
- Thank you, Martin.</i>

466
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,669
<i>- Could you rub a little bit harder?
- Certainly.</i>

467
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,674
You! Yes, you.

468
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:03,720
I've called the police, you know?

469
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,254
I'll be giving Angela a report
when she gets back.

470
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:07,414
Right.

471
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:09,652
It's nearly nine o'clock...
Disgusting.

472
00:35:09,772 --> 00:35:12,495
Absolutely shocking,
what you kids get up to.

473
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,879
Shocking!

474
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:47,680
Throw me through the ceiling!
Throw me through the fucking ceiling!

475
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:02,786
Got locked on, Freds.

476
00:36:02,906 --> 00:36:04,560
It's gone to a 12... easy.

477
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,493
It's all right. It's all right.

478
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:11,283
Come on. We're gonna leave, come on.

479
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,929
Yeah? All right?

480
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:22,225
I didn't want to leave without him.

481
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:26,487
It's an international incident.
I thought he was gonna...

482
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,672
- I didn't want to leave without him.
- Fuck him, JJ.

483
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:33,904
You came.

484
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:40,640
JJ gets locked on.
You have to look after him.

485
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:43,140
I thought Cook...

486
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:44,680
Cook's his friend.

487
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:47,360
I think Cook's your friend,
isn't he?

488
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:50,449
Not necessarily.

489
00:36:55,244 --> 00:36:56,920
You'll never guess
what Pandora's Mum...

490
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,443
We're going home, Eff.

491
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:00,822
Where's Pandora?

492
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:05,154
Come on.

493
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:11,291
I didn't mean to fuck everything up.

494
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,880
My parents are splitting up.

495
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:15,782
I'm sorry.

496
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,229
I got trashed.

497
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:24,901
I'm sorry about that.

498
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:26,967
It's shit.

499
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:48,871
All right, Panda?

500
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:56,120
We're the last ones standing.
No-one's got any stamina these days.

501
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:57,891
Right.
Whizzer.

502
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,352
I wanted to play Twister...

503
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,332
and then the girls were gonna
tell me how to do sex.

504
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:15,431
Bummer.

505
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,792
How do you do it, anyway?

506
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,299
You know, you've done loads of sex.

507
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:23,265
No, Twister.

508
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:26,800
Well, you spin the dial...

509
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:29,880
and then you put your hands
and feet where it tells you.

510
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,174
Hand, there.

511
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,121
Right. Now me.

512
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:36,683
Over here.

513
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:40,201
You gotta move that and that.

514
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,670
That!

515
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:58,852
Okay, put your hand on yellow.
Is it on there?

516
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,185
Do you want me to show you?

517
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:21,413
What?

518
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,251
You know...

519
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,902
You really are beautiful.

520
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:34,329
So are you, Mum.

521
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:38,333
I wanted to be...

522
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:41,713
one more time.

523
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:36,407
See ya later.

524
00:43:55,315 --> 00:43:56,315
Any good?

525
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,080
I don't know what you mean.

526
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:00,679
I mean he's a sensational fuck,
yeah?

527
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:04,632
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me, Eff.

528
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,947
Just cos I'm useless,
don't mean I'm nothing.

529
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:10,571
We're friends because you don't
surf-and-turf my men. You said that.

530
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:13,451
He's not yours, Eff.
He'll never belong to anyone.

531
00:44:13,668 --> 00:44:15,699
- Shut up.
- That's why you don't really want him.

532
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,510
- He's not the one you want.
- Shut up!

533
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,533
I know that because I'm your friend.

534
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:21,960
But you don't make
enough effort, Eff.

535
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,638
I'm just there to laugh at.

536
00:44:24,138 --> 00:44:25,538
You don't know me.

537
00:44:26,924 --> 00:44:27,924
My life.

538
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:30,299
My family. My Mum.

539
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,079
Why don't you know anything
about my Mum?

540
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,004
I know everything about yours.

541
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:40,950
You're right.

542
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:44,535
I don't know anything
about your Mum.

543
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:47,221
I'm sorry.

544
00:44:57,521 --> 00:44:58,521
Jesus...

545
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,109
What?

546
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,360
Careful what you wish for.

547
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:04,024
Why?

548
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:13,104
Look, I'm here!

549
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,920
It's me.
Are you not glad to see me?

550
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,233
Mother said I could come back.

551
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,862
What's wrong?

552
00:45:29,282 --> 00:45:30,840
Don't be a twat, Thomas.

553
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,499
Give your girlfriend a hug.

554
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,064
I missed you...

555
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:46,500
I missed you too much.

556
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,205
It's okay.

557
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:53,135
Everything is okay.

558
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:54,920
Everything is A1.
