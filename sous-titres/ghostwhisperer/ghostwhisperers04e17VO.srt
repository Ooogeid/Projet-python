00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Previously on ghost whisperer...</i>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Day of the accident, I saw
jim's ghost step into sam's body.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
You're back.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,400
Do I know you?

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,100
I see the same guy that
you see. It's not jim.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,300
I just know what I see
when I look in those eyes,

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,300
And jim is in there somewhere.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,100
Wait, you're not gonna tell me you think
I'm your husband reincarnated.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,400
I see ghosts.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,700
It's this thing that I do.
It's a really big part of me,

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,300
And if you--If you
don't believe in it, I--

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,600
Hey, you needed a little time
and a little space

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,100
To get ready to tell me this.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,900
Take the all time you need.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,000
No, no, no, no, no no.

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,700
It's easy, ok?
I'll walk you through it.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,100
Do you see the light?

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,900
No?

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,700
All right, we'll try it again.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,300
Ok! Great. So you do see the light. Ok.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,100
So now just press the star key
and enter the code.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,600
Ok.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,700
Good. All right.
I'll see you later. Bye.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Morning.

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,200
Sorry.

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,400
Delia is having some trouble
With our security system.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Ah, that's good.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Oh. Oh, you thought that I--

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,600
"Into the light." You know.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,300
Well, to be fair, It looks similar,
only minus the earpiece.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,400
Do you mind? I really
need some coffee now.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,300
No, it's fine. Help yourself.

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,500
Look, I know that this is
hard to wrap your head around,

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
But I wanna be an open book with you,

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Especially with you.

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,500
Ok. Uh, well, that's good,
Because I got a lot of questions.

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
Well, I have some answers.

38
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
All right, so...

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,500
This is what it looks like, right,
When you talk to them?

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
And how they--
Wait a minute. First of all,

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
Are there any of them
around here right now?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,300
No, but they do visit me here,

43
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,700
I mean, some because they need my help
And they know that I have a gift,

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,500
And others just pop up
when you least expect it.

45
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
And you just talk to them.

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah. I help them figure out
Why they're still earthbound, you know,

47
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,100
Get them into the light.

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
And eli does the same thing.

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,000
In his own way, yes.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Wow.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,600
All part of the day's work, I guess.

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,400
It's not every day. It's just...

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,200
When they do show up,
I feel like it's my job to help.

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,500
Right.

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,100
Melinda, I wanna believe you.

56
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,900
I mean, "a," because
I'm crazy about you,

57
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,900
But, "b," because
it's just so amazing. I...

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,300
Look, I'm off today, and I just--

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,800
I wanna go down and
check in to the job site,

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,300
but can I come back
And just hang out with you and...

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,400
Watch you do what you do?

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Bad idea. What's wrong?

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
No, it--

64
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,000
No, it's just
this is more than

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,500
what I do.
It's who I am.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Hey, no, no. No ghost jokes, I promise.

67
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,900
Cross my heart and hope to die.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Nope.

69
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,600
Not a ghost in sight.

70
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,700
Now, wait a minute.
What about, uh--

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
What about when the lights
went off in the hardware store?

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,700
Power failure.

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, and those boxes that
fell at the post office...

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,200
- Just gravity.
- Yep.

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I gotta say, I'm a little
disappointed so far.

76
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,600
Are you kidding?

77
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
A day without ghosts is like a vacation.

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,100
I mean, it is nice to be able to
run errands without being harassed,

79
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Although the day is young.

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
Hmm. All right, whatever you say.

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,500
Look, I gotta run in here
And grab a check from my boss.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,000
He's, uh, redeveloping this whole place
As a school, grade by grade.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
- Cool.
- Yeah.

84
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,800
???

85
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,700
Oh, wow. Cute kids.

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah.

87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
I do remember likin' them.

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,100
???

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,400
What is it?

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
You look like you've seen a ghost.

91
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,300
3, actually.
There's--

92
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,400
There's one by the tree,
One on the merry-Go-Round, and...

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
One on the swing.

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Really?

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,500
What was this place
before you guys renovated it?

96
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,500
Some kind of clinic, I think.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Ok, everybody,
let's line up. Snack time.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
- * alouette... *
- what?

99
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,400
I think some of the patients
are still here.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
can you see us?

101
00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:05,500
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

102

103
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,900
GHOST WHISPERER S04E17

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,800
Parkdale academy was
providence care clinic,

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,100
Established 1962, and prior to that...

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
It was the valley springs sanatorium.

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,900
A mental hospital,
which would explain the ghosts I saw.

108
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
I know exactly
what you're thinking.

109
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Maybe this was something
she already knew

110
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,400
Or something she once heard
and then she just forgot.

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,900
You had your doubts, too?

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Ah, big doubts.

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,700
Well, what finally convinced you?

114
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,700
I just saw all the
people that she helped,

115
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,600
You know, most of which didn't even
believe her either at first, so...

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,700
Ok. There are ghosts.

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,100
But how can they be threatening?

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,300
Uh, it depends. I mean,

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Sometimes the ghosts can be benign.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,700
Other times,
they're a complete nuisance,

121
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,100
And then the really troubled ones,
They can be dangerous.

122
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
How so?

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,800
Well, in this case, for example,

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
You're dealing with children
Under the age of 10,

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,900
so they could be Influenced by them,

126
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,900
'cause kids that age,
They can see and talk to ghosts.

127
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,400
We grow up, and it goes away,

128
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,400
There's no room in the
rational adult brain.

129
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, I have no memory
of ever seeing ghosts.

130
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,400
Which, in my case, would make
that completely meaningless, so...

131
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Now that their home has
been turned into a school,

132
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
The ghosts could scare
the children or even worse.

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
And that's where you come in.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
What's your next step?

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,300
Well, I have to talk to them,

136
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,000
You know, figure out
what's keeping them here,

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
And then hopefully get
them into the light.

138
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,800
Yeah, but it's a kindergarten.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
I mean, they're not gonna let you in

140
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,500
and let you say,
"Hey, I wanna talk to ghosts."

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,700
How are you gonna do that?

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,500
I think you mean "we."

143
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,800
not at all. We're delighted.

144
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
I mean, all this time
you were working here,

145
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
And you never once
mentioned you had a child.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Well, we don't.

147
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,600
Wait. Not yet.

148
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh. When is your due date?

149
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,900
Oh, look. Not pregnant. Nope.

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,700
Right. We're just planning ahead.

151
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
- Oh.
- Way, way ahead.

152
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
'Cause, you know, we don't even
know if we wanna stay here or--

153
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Move to the city.

154
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Right. And if we do stay here,
you know, what are the best schools?

155
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,500
Schools, yeah.

156
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,000
It just seems
a little crazy, huh?

157
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,900
No, not at all. It's smart.

158
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,000
I wish more parents had your foresight.

159
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,600
So, how long have you been married?

160
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,100
- W-We're not yet.
- 6 months.

161
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,800
He means that we're getting married...

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,300
- in 6 months.
- in 6 months.

163
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,100
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

164
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
Well, let me finish showing you around,

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,600
And then we'll stop by the admissions
office and pick up a brochure.

166
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,100
Go ahead. Thanks.

167
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
oh, hello.

168
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Hey, this is sam and melinda.
They're checking out the academy.

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,900
Hi. Nice to meet you.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
Well, we're all
very proud of the school.

171
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,300
Did they learn that
beautiful french phonetically?

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,900
I didn't teach them. They must
have learned it in music class.

173
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,500
???

174
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
You think a ghost
taught the kids that song?

175
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Well, you heard it for yourself.
It wasn't one of the teachers.

176
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, there's gotta be
a logical explanation.

177
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,900
One of the kids learned it
and then taught the others.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,300
Yeah, I would think the same thing, too,
If I hadn't seen the ghost for myself.

179
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, wait. Since
you didn't talk to her--

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,900
It--Them, what do you do now?

181
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,000
We go and see eli.

182
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,300
'Cause he can hear ghosts?

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,100
No, because the ghosts
were mental patients,

184
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,000
And he's a shrink.

185
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,900
Oh.

186
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,600
All the files from
the valley springs sanatorium,

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,300
They were donated to
the psych department

188
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,800
When the place shut down in '61.

189
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,600
You're telling me you got
all the files for this place here?

190
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,000
Of all the things you need to digest,
I'm thinking that's the least strange.

191
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,700
Right.

192
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
- Yeah. That's her.
- Oh. Wow.

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,000
I pulled pictures of women
who fit the description.

194
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,300
Greer clarkson.
Is that the ghost that you saw?

195
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,700
Well, according to her file,

196
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,300
She was committed shortly
after giving birth.

197
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,100
She said that she was
having dark thoughts.

198
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,400
Sounds like p.P.D.,
postpartum depression,

199
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,100
Which wasn't exactly taken
seriously in the fifties.

200
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,300
It also says here that she was
delusional, that she heard voices.

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Ok, she died in the asylum in '59,
But the cause of death isn't listed.

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Think the hospital might
have had something to hide?

203
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,300
Well, it's possible. Maybe that's
what's keeping her earthbound.

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,800
Or this. Oh, my god.

205
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,700
What? What is it?

206
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,700
It's a therapy journal.

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,700
She writes about
how she drowned her baby.

208
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,400
God, who would do that?

209
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Someone with postpartum psychosis.

210
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
And now she's surrounded by children,

211
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,100
Living children.

212
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
Ok, let's all quiet down.

213
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
We're gonna get in line
for a play break.

214
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,400
Children.

215
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,100
Todd.

216
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
What are you...

217
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I'll be quiet when I am dead

218
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Ok, sweetie. Go sit down.

219
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Rosalyn.

220
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
I think we need to call
todd langston's parents.

221
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,900
He's just done the strangest thing.

222
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,100
- Is he ok?
- I don't know.

223
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
And I'm gonna need help getting
permanent marker Off the dry-Erase board.

224
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,200
You won't believe what he wrote.

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
I didn't even know he could write.

226
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Oh, my god.

227
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
They were all just right here.

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,400
???

229
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,300
The ghost you saw, you're sure
She wants to harm the kids?

230
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
No, but it's possible.

231
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,600
And you're sure it's that lady,
The--The no one who killed her kid?

232
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,900
I could see her face
as clearly as I see yours.

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,700
And you're gonna go into this place
And tell the people who run--

234
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,200
As little as possible, ok?

235
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,700
I know how this sounds to people,

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,900
And I don't know. I try to
keep what I can do quiet.

237
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,000
oh, no.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Jill. Hey, what's happening?

239
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,000
- Hey, melinda.
- Hi.

240
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,000
You don't have anyone here, do you?

241
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,500
No, no, no, no. We're just passing by.

242
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,600
- This is sam lucas.
- Officer.

243
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,400
It's unbelievable.

244
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,800
I don't know who's running the school.

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
There's a whole
kindergarten class missing.

246
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,200
You know, um, sam,
he worked in this building,

247
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,500
So maybe he could help you.

248
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,100
Uh, sure.

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Um, I need to try to find this ghost.

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
- I'll meet you in there.
- All right. Yeah.

251
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
How could a 5-Year-Old
have written this?

252
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,800
How could 14 students leave the premises

253
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,100
Without a single adult or security
camera capturing their exit?

254
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,500
And only one way out.

255
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,100
unit 6, please respond
to village square, main and oak.

256
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,600
We've located those missing
juveniles from parkdale academy.

257
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Copy that.

258
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,300
How the hell did they get there?

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Todd, baby, come here, honey.

260
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,500
Come here.

261
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Todd, you scared me.

262
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,000
How did you get here?

263
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
We have to finish the song.

264
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,100
If we don't sing, she gets so sad.

265
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,400
Honey, who?

266
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,900
Where are they taking them?

267
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,700
Home, I'm sure. Did you do this?

268
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Did you lead these children away?

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Uh, I'm not exactly sure
what's happening right now.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,800
Sorry. I'm just gonna pretend
like I'm talking to you,

271
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,100
So keep looking at me.

272
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
All right.

273
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
I can help you.

274
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
But please don't hurt those children.

275
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,900
I don't want to.

276
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,000
Done such a terrible thing.

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
But you don't have to do this.

278
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,900
You can just let the children be.

279
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,300
They want to be with me.

280
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,100
They heard me singing.

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
They don't belong to you.

282
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
You're dead.

283
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Ok, this place is a school now.
They belong with the living. Just nod.

284
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
They need to be quieter.

285
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,200
Is that why you wrote
that on the blackboard?

286
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,900
"I'll be quiet when I'm dead."
Were you threatening them?

287
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Keep them away.

288
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,200
They mustn't come back.

289
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
It's not safe.

290
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
She's gone.

291
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
I'll get the car ready.

292
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,300
keep them away from what,
The school or from her?

293
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,900
I don't know. I'm just glad

294
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
that the place Is
closed down for a few days.

295
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,300
You know, maybe there is
a--A bad teacher Or--

296
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,700
Or something at the school itself.

297
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Like what, a toxic mold?

298
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,000
The woman killed her own baby.

299
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,900
She suffered from postpartum psychosis.

300
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm just considering our options.
I mean, we know who she is.

301
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,600
We have no idea what she wants,

302
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
And all we know is that she seemed,

303
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
You know, genuinely
concerned about those kids.

304
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,600
Then why did she keep kidnapping them

305
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
And writing death threats
on their board?

306
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Ok, she did not write that. A boy did.

307
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, when he was 5?
Did she possess him?

308
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,200
Or maybe it was automatic writing.

309
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,300
Wh-What kind of writing?

310
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,300
Automatic writing--

311
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,300
Channeling a spirit Without
being completely taken over by it.

312
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
You mean versus possession.

313
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,600
Yeah.

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,500
You know, it's kind of like

315
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,700
if you can believe That a--

316
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,200
A spirit can exist outside a body...

317
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,400
Then is it such a stretch to think
it could push into another body?

318
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,900
How are you doin'?

319
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,800
You know, all right, I'm here
to learn. I'm here to support.

320
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,800
I don't wanna get in the
way of you guys solving this.

321
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,000
Ok, good, because we have to figure out

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,400
How she got those kids out of the school
And stop it from happening again,

323
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,200
Which means we have to go back there.

324
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,700
So, what? We're looking for
another way To leave the building?

325
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,500
But there was only one exit
to the building.

326
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,000
Uh, for the grounds.

327
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,300
Where else would an exit go?

328
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
To the tunnels.

329
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,400
The--The what?

330
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,300
I can't believe I'm gonna
have to tell you this.

331
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
Underneath grandview,
there's a series Of tunnels,

332
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,300
a town under the town.

333
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
And a lot of people died there.

334
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,500
They still think it's their home,

335
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
If you catch my drift.

336
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
Uh, you found this?

337
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,400
No. The only person that's
been down there is melinda.

338
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm sorry. I can't have
your back on this one.

339
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm scared of small spaces.

340
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm not.

341
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,600
Good job getting past
the security guard.

342
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,600
Right.

343
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Sam.

344
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,900
looks like another door. What the?

345
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Do you think the kids found this?

346
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,500
Yeah, or were led to it.

347
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,400
Hang on.

348
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,400
I don't remember that door
being spring-Loaded.

349
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, that's 'cause it wasn't.

350
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,600
What is it?

351
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,500
What's goin' on?

352
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,900
Sing your little song,
greer, if it calms you.

353
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,900
Doesn't bother me a bit.

354
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,600
Soothe yourself,
as you soothed your child,

355
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,300
And say good-Bye to him now,

356
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,900
To all the bad memories,
all the thoughts.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let it all go.

358
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,600
What?

359
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,600
Melinda.

360
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,600
She needs more.

361
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,500
Wait, melinda, what's going on? Stop!

362
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,700
Melinda, melinda, hey.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Hey.

364
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,600
Are you ok?

365
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,700
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

366
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,100
Sometimes I get--
I get visions.

367
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
- What?
- It's like I was greer,

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
and now I know.

369
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
You know what?

370
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
???

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
???

372
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,100
I mean, mental patients haunting
children and then possessions,

373
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,800
And, oh, yeah,
let's not forget the tunnels.

374
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,200
That's a lot to swallow.

375
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,900
Make sense, though.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
The courthouse is right
in the town square.

377
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
The tunnels let them transport
the criminally insane.

378
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, so that people couldn't see them.
But electroshock therapy?

379
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
I mean, how did they get away with that?

380
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,600
Well, in the fifties, it was still
Kind of an experimental trtment.

381
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,100
You know, patients had
different reactions,

382
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,200
And hospitals weren't exactly
Advertising their fatalities.

383
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
It was so sad. She was
just trying to calm herself,

384
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
You know, and she kept
singing that song.

385
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
- Alouette.
- Yeah.

386
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,000
You know what that song even means?

387
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
It's a bunch of french words
that nobody understands.

388
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,400
It's about a bird,

389
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,700
And the refrain means
to "pluck your head."

390
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
That's disgusting.

391
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
No, it's insulting...

392
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,000
To psychiatry...
To me.

393
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,500
To pluck your head. Get it?

394
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,600
All right, fine,
so it's not exactly subtle,

395
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,400
But why do you think she'd be
taking a swipe at her doctors?

396
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,500
Not doctors, doctor.

397
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,400
The one that she keeps mentioning
in all of her therapy journals

398
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Is this dr. Byrd, a calvin byrd.

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,700
So that's the guy that
I saw in my vision.

400
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,500
If it is, he might have done
more than oversee her final zap.

401
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,300
He may have plucked her head,

402
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Got inside of her mind.

403
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,700
Yeah, but that still doesn't
tell me what she wants.

404
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,900
It would help to know
what he found inside of her mind,

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Because if greer's nuts,
we'll never be able to reason with her,

406
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,300
And you'll never be able to
get her into the light.

407
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,400
Hello.

408
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
hey. Hi. It's me.

409
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,200
I know it's late, but, uh, can we talk?

410
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,300
Are you home?

411
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm actually on your front porch.

412
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,700
Well, then come in.

413
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,400
Hey. I just didn't want to, uh,

414
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
scare you.

415
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,000
Right.

416
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
Kind of like I scared you tonight.

417
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,500
No, it's ok.

418
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm really--
I'm ok if--

419
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,500
If you are.

420
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,600
I am.

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm ok.

422
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
Are those bunny slippers?

423
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Sorry.

424
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,500
Really wasn't expecting company.

425
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,600
In fact, I thought
I would never see you again.

426
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,700
I live in your garage.

427
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
You know what I mean.

428
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,900
Melinda, this thing
you went through in the school...

429
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
The vision.

430
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
Did it hurt? I mean,
were you in any pain?

431
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,400
It's kind of like a dream.

432
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,300
But, you know, I mean, I-It
feels real when it's happening,

433
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
But it's also kind of removed.

434
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Just please...

435
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't worry about me.

436
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,700
Have you ever met anybody
who can do what you do?

437
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,500
Besides eli.

438
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,700
Some, but not many.

439
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,300
I just wish you could
subcontract to them right now.

440
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,000
You know...

441
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
You could keep helping me.

442
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,100
Ok.

443
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
All right, where are we?

444
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,800
We think that the ghost died

445
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,400
As a result of electroshock therapy,

446
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
But that doesn't explain
what's keeping her earthbound.

447
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,800
Eli thinks it's more about
her treatment with this--

448
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
This dr. Byrd guy.

449
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,800
Dr. Byrd. Ok.

450
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
What does that have to do
With her warnings about the children?

451
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,100
I don't know.

452
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,300
I mean, honestly I think what drives her

453
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,500
Is her guilt about,

454
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,300
you know, what she did
to her child.

455
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
I'm guessing it was too long ago
for dr. Byrd to give you any insight.

456
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Well, he looked like
he was in his fifties,

457
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
And that was 50 years ago, so...

458
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,100
He's dead.

459
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,600
How old was greer?

460
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
23.

461
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,000
Her husband...

462
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,000
Leighton. You know,
I saw his name in the files,

463
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,100
'Cause he was the-- He was the
person that checked her in. I'm...

464
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,600
Ok, there's a few clarksons. Here.

465
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,500
Leighton died in 2001.

466
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Wait a minute. What's that?

467
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
It's a wedding announcement.

468
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,500
"Douglas clarkson, the son of
leighton and greer clarkson."

469
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,900
Wait. She had another kid.

470
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,600
No.

471
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,200
Douglas was the name of
the child she drowned.

472
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,400
She was committed for killing her son...

473
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,700
But he's alive.

474
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,100
I never knew my mother.

475
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,400
I was 2 1/2 when she died,

476
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,400
So I don't really have
any memories of her.

477
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,800
I know she died in the hospital.
I just don't know the cause.

478
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,000
Hospital?

479
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
That's a kind word.

480
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
It was an asylum.

481
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,100
She died of heart failure.

482
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,500
Why wasn't it in the hospital's records?

483
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,500
I don't know.

484
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
They kept a lot of things
hidden back then,

485
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
My mother being one of them.

486
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
You don't think she belonged there?

487
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,200
My dad didn't know what else to do.

488
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,600
One day, he's reading the newspaper,

489
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
And she's giving me a
bath in the kitchen sink,

490
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,200
And she turns to him,
tells him, "take the baby away,"

491
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
And then she tells him
she needs to be taken away.

492
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,600
Do you know, according to her files,

493
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,900
Says she actually drowned you.

494
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,100
Obviously there was some confusion.

495
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
By all accounts, before I was born,

496
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,200
My mother was a loving,

497
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,600
Smart, sane woman.

498
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,700
You can't blame yourself
for your mother's illness.

499
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,500
"Her dark thoughts,"

500
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,700
That's what my dad said she called 'em.

501
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,700
And she was afraid of hurting me,
But she never did.

502
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,300
Why was she in there for so long?

503
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,700
She never recovered.

504
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,100
She just got worse.

505
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Did you know that
she got electroshock therapy?

506
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,400
Mm-Hmm.

507
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,100
They said she requested it.

508
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,900
She wanted to get better.

509
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
But dad said
she came out of the sessions

510
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,700
Rambling worse than ever.

511
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,500
Says in her files time and time again,
Her sessions with a dr. Byrd.

512
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Has your father ever mentioned him?

513
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,500
No, not a word.

514
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,100
And believe me, I heard him
rant About every other soul in that place.

515
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
So, who is this doctor?

516
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,300
That's what I'm wondering.

517
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,900
I did a search of records at the time,

518
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,900
And there's no mention

519
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,300
at the hospital of a dr. Byrd
Or with privileges.

520
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,400
Well, how could that be?

521
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,100
I don't know. Maybe he was
a figment of her imagination.

522
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,700
Think about it.
The husband always visited her.

523
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,900
He never knew him.

524
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,600
I mean, she was gettin'
Enough shock therapy to kill her.

525
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,900
Along the way, maybe
she lost her rational mind

526
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,400
Wait a minute.

527
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,700
The rational mind.

528
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,500
Ok...

529
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,100
What else does shock therapy do?

530
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,200
It calms people.

531
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,400
It suppresses cognitive areas
of the brain.

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,100
Are you talking about
the part of the brain

533
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,100
That allows people to only believe
what they can actually see and touch,

534
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,700
Like the part I had way too much of?

535
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
He's gotta be in here.

536
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,000
There's gotta be a reason
he's connected to the hospital.

537
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Well, did you check
all these staff records,

538
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
I mean, before greer was admitted?

539
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,600
I did, from 1950 to '59

540
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,100
and '40 to '49.

541
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,500
We go back any further,
I'm gonna be at sigmund freud.

542
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,700
Well, keep goin',

543
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
All the way back if you have to.

544
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,200
Sorry to barge in,
but your door was wide open.

545
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Always.

546
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
You have to see
what eli and I found. Look.

547
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Well, that's him. That's dr. Byrd.

548
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,200
Yeah, but look
what it says at the bottom.

549
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,600
"Dr. Calvin byrd and staff,

550
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
Valley springs sanatorium. April, 1922."

551
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,000
Greer didn't even go into
the asylum until 1956.

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Yeah, but this is the man I saw.
He was a doctor there.

553
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,500
Exactly, so he must
have died not long after that,

554
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Stayed at the hospital,
but out of the light.

555
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Eli says that shock therapy
can rewire your brain,

556
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,900
Take away that part
that says ghosts don't make sense.

557
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
What if she could see him

558
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,000
And he got inside her head?

559
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,900
And pluck it.
He wasn't a delusion. He was--

560
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,000
So greer's mind was
being twisted by a ghost

561
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,500
???

562
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Look, Just to get it straight,

563
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
This ghost that's haunting the kids,

564
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,200
She was haunted herself
by another ghost?

565
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah, and based on her journals,
We know it's when she was still alive.

566
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,400
And this other ghost
was the ghost of a doctor.

567
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,600
That's why he was able
to do so much damage.

568
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,000
She trusted him, you know.
He was an authority figure.

569
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,800
A ghost?

570
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,200
Yeah. He knew how to talk to her.

571
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
I mean, he was probably the one

572
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,500
Who convinced her that
she killed her own child.

573
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,800
Her ability to do this,

574
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
I mean, talk to ghosts,
Was from electroshock therapy.

575
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,500
That's my best guess so far.

576
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Why's he doin' this at all?

577
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,400
I mean, I thought
you said ghosts only haunt

578
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,100
Things that they know,
people they know.

579
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,900
I don't know. He was a doctor, you know.

580
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Maybe he had a--
A god complex,

581
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,800
Or maybe they were connected in some way
That we don't even know about yet.

582
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,600
At least I'm not the only one
who's in the dark.

583
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,100
I have to get in there, ok?

584
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
I need to find out what
she's protecting those kids from.

585
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,200
It's saturday. It's closed.
There's no one...

586
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,400
Here to let us in.

587
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
You'd just break in there,
wouldn't you?

588
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,900
Yeah.

589
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,900
I got a key from the contractor.

590
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,300
Let's go.

591
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,200
Wait. Where are we going?

592
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,400
I mean, can't you just
yell out the ghost's name?

593
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,700
I don't think that's a good idea.

594
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,800
She keeps giving warnings
to people about being quiet.

595
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,200
Why? Can ghosts sleep?
Are--Are we gonna wake one up?

596
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,300
If you make noise,
you can't hear him whispering.

597
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,000
Greer.

598
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,400
Makes him angry when he can't be heard.

599
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,600
Dr. Byrd?

600
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,200
Is that what you were
protecting those children from?

601
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,900
That's why you taught them that song,

602
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,800
So that they could give you a
warning anytime he got close.

603
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't want him to pluck their heads.

604
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,500
That's how he got that little boy
To write on the blackboard, isn't it?

605
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,500
They're so trusting,

606
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,800
And then when he whispers in their ears,

607
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,900
It's hard not to listen,

608
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,100
Even when you can't believe
what he's saying.

609
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,700
Like when he told you
that you hurt your own child.

610
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
Dr. Byrd understood.

611
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,800
I loved my son so much,

612
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,900
Sometimes it hurt to even look at him.

613
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,700
He was so small and fragile.

614
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,000
I don't know why I did what I did,

615
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
Not anymore.

616
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,900
I was sick.

617
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,800
Y-Your son is still alive.

618
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,100
No, I remember holding him in the water.

619
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,700
No, you gave him baths.

620
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,300
You cared for him,

621
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,200
and then when you thought
That you were gonna hurt him,

622
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,900
you turned him over.

623
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,400
No, that's not possible.
The doctor said--

624
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
Well, the doctor lied.

625
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,200
Ok, my friend, he talked to your son.

626
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,200
Doug, he's still alive, and he's
married with children of his own.

627
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Here. Just look.

628
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
But

629
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,400
Why would he tell me those things,

630
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,900
My own doctor?

631
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,300
He wasn't a doctor.

632
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,000
He was a ghost.

633
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Look, you knew to--

634
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,000
To keep him away from those children,

635
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,300
So why would you believe
what he had to say to you?

636
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,000
They don't deserve
to be punished, but I do.

637
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,500
Even if I didn't hurt my child,

638
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,300
I still abandoned him.

639
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,600
That's not true.

640
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
You asked for those shock treatments.

641
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,800
You told your doctors
that you would do anything

642
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,900
Just to get home to be with your son.

643
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
Think.

644
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,900
Please, I know that
you can remember that.

645
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
M-Maybe I do.

646
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,000
Good. Then please just
look for the light,

647
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Because you're ready to move on.

648
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,100
No, no. I-- I can't leave them.

649
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,500
Don't worry about them.
I'll protect those children.

650
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
Not just them, all my friends here.

651
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,300
He whispers bad things to them, too.

652
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,600
The patients.

653
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,000
Where are they?

654
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,300
He's dangerous.

655
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,700
Don't make him angry.

656
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,500
I'll take care of him.
Where are your friends?

657
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,200
It's a bad place down there.

658
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,900
Don't go.

659
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
She's gone.

660
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
What was that about?

661
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Let's go.

662
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,200
The tunnels are through here.

663
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,700
You don't wanna go through that, do you?

664
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,500
Yeah. That's the way that
the kids went to get to the square.

665
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,600
Through a locked metal door?

666
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Greer must have helped them.

667
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,600
I mean, you've seen ghosts
slam doors now, move things around.

668
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
No, I've seen doors slam
and things move around.

669
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,200
I--I haven't seen
ghosts do anything.

670
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Ok, well, whatever it
is that you've seen,

671
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,800
I need to get in here, so...

672
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,100
Hey, melinda, why?
Why now? Why do you gotta do that?

673
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,700
Because there's souls in there.

674
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,900
They need help.
Look, if this is

675
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Too much for you to
absorb in one sitting,

676
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,300
It's--It's ok.
You can go, and I--

677
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,200
Why can't you?

678
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,400
Why have we gotta take this
to the end of the story, huh?

679
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
The story?

680
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,500
Look, if you're tellin' me
that ghosts can,

681
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,700
You know, move things,
if they have mind control,

682
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,400
They can disappear, they can reappear,

683
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
Why can't they just cross
themselves into the light,

684
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,300
And then we're just done here, huh?

685
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,100
You are done, aren't you?

686
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,800
Look, I'm just--

687
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,600
- I'm just tired.
- No, you're done trying.

688
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,300
No, it's not about trying.
It's about some things make sense,

689
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,600
And some things don't.
I'm sorry--

690
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,300
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

691
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
And if you don't keep trying,

692
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,600
You're never gonna
get back what you lost.

693
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,500
Me? We were just talking about ghosts.

694
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,600
Yeah, we are.

695
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,700
Your memories...

696
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
The reason that you can never make
sense of them is they're not yours.

697
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,000
They belong to a ghost...

698
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Ok. Now, look--

699
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,300
Someone who died and
then went into sam's body.

700
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,600
S-Sam? You're talkin'
about sam as if he's--

701
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,900
He's gone.

702
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
He went into the light.
You're not sam anymore.

703
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,100
- Who am I?
- Jim.

704
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,200
My husband.

705
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,300
Or at least, what's left of him.

706
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,800
You may not remember that now,
and you may never Remember that,

707
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,800
but I told you to go into the light,
And you wouldn't,

708
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,000
and then sam's body
Offered a second chance--

709
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Ok, listen, melinda. Look--

710
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Look, I know how hard
it is to accept this, ok?

711
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
But just think about what's happened.

712
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,600
All the random memories, The gunshot,

713
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,100
all those things That you suddenly
remembered about medicine--

714
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
Those things came from jim, and then...

715
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,900
Then there's me.

716
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,800
What you feel...

717
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
What we both feel,

718
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,100
You remembering that
you wanted children--

719
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,800
That all came from someplace.

720
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,200
It came from a life
that you shared with me.

721
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,300
That has to mean something, right?

722
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,700
Yes, it means something.

723
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,600
It means that--
That you lost your husband,

724
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,400
And it turned your life upside down,

725
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,100
And it's worse than anything I lost,
because you know what you lost.

726
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
We have to face facts, you and I,

727
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,600
And the fact is that
what is gone is gone.

728
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm not jim.

729
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
???

730
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,400
In the basement of a former asylum,
You told him everything?

731
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah. What else was I supposed to do?

732
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,200
I don't know. Wait till he
has a couple d drinks in him Or,

733
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,400
you know, right until after sex.

734
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,200
Wait. You haven't had sex yet?

735
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm not telling you that.

736
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,400
What planet are you from?

737
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,200
Don't you know you never
open the closet door

738
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,500
Until you make sex.

739
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,300
Please hold the flashlight.

740
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
Oh, my god!

741
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,500
Oh, my god! You're psycho!
I'm not goin' in there with you.

742
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,700
Dr. Byrd is a shrink.

743
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,000
You don't go into a knife
fight without taking your knife.

744
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,600
Oh, I'm really not that sharp.

745
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,900
Get in there.

746
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
- I don't--
- Go!

747
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,800
Too creepy!

748
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,100
why are you here?

749
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,400
Who said that?

750
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,500
You better show yourself.

751
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,500
Or better yet, show
yourself somewhere else.

752
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,300
Calm down. They're just ghosts.

753
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,800
Way too spooky. Need more lights.

754
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
??

755
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,300
That's much better.

756
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,500
What do you see?

757
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,600
Greer.

758
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,100
Show us the way.

759
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,200
We'll help your friends find the light.

760
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,800
It's the treatment room,

761
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
Where she got her shock therapy.

762
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,500
The doctor's looking for me.

763
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,800
He'll be here soon.

764
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,900
Then we don't have much time.
We need your help.

765
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,800
- How?
- Your friends...

766
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,300
They're troubled. Help us talk to them.

767
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,200
Help them bring the light.

768
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
ok.

769
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,300
He's trapped you here with fear,
fear of the light,

770
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,000
But you don't have to be afraid.

771
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
Time is running out. Just believe us.

772
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,200
What's going on?

773
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
Are we making new friends?

774
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
I trust we're not
forgetting our old ones.

775
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
They all know that
you've been lying to them.

776
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,900
If part of your job was to help them,
You might wanna remember how to do that.

777
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,200
I think I help 'em.

778
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,400
Who brings you news of your loved ones?

779
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,200
Who tells your family
what you want them to know,

780
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,400
Not the true things, the bad thoughts,

781
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,100
The secrets, the nasty
things I know, but keep safe?

782
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,100
You, doctor.

783
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,500
And who really knows you deep down,

784
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
But takes care of you anyway?

785
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
These people? Strangers?

786
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,600
Don't trust them.

787
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,200
They said you lied about the light.

788
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,500
Oh? Did I?

789
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Is there someone here
who wants to go into the light?

790
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
We might.

791
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,100
Then go ahead.

792
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,200
What do you think the light's gonna do

793
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,800
When it knows all
your secrets just like I do?

794
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,100
You'll go into oblivion.

795
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,400
Greer, Look into the light.

796
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,700
Tell them. Tell your friends what you see.

797
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,700
My parents.

798
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,300
My brothers and sisters.

799
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,800
What do you see in their eyes?
Is it judgment?

800
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,000
No. Just...

801
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,100
Love.

802
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,700
Please, tell them.

803
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,600
Over here, everyone. Look inside.

804
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,500
Don't trust 'em. You can't go.

805
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,000
Trust your fears. They'll protect you.

806
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,100
???

807
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,600
You're not gonna trick me
into that hole.

808
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,800
You might find forgiveness there.

809
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,300
Oh, I'll be staying right here,
where you live.

810
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,900
What are you waiting for?

811
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,400
Go.

812
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,600
I have something to do first.

813
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Your mother wants you to know
how badly she feels.

814
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,500
All the time
you spent without her, She--

815
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,500
She thinks it's her fault.

816
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,500
Her fault?

817
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
How is it her fault?

818
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,700
She was happy and
healthy until I was born.

819
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,000
My body,

820
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,700
it just wasn't strong enough.

821
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,100
She still doesn't
realize that doctors then,

822
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,900
They had no idea, no idea
what could happen to mothers.

823
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,500
None of that matters anymore.

824
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,900
Looking at you, I feel so strong now.

825
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,500
But seeing you grown up,
she feels healthy and strong.

826
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,900
I'm all better.

827
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
The bad thoughts are gone,

828
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,500
And the lifetime
together that we missed--

829
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
You'll spend it...

830
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,200
On the other side.

831
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,900
Will you tell him I'll wait for him?

832
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,800
But to take his time.

833
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,300
He has children who need him,

834
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,700
My grandchildren.

835
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I promise.

836
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'll tell him.

837
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,600
Hey.

838
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Hi.

839
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,700
Well, that was a pretty big bombshell
you dropped on me back there.

840
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,800
I know. I'm sorry.

841
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,200
I really wish that
there'd been another way.

842
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Look, I understand this. I do.

843
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

844
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,100
I think I finally do.

845
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,600
I mean, it didn't make any sense
to me before, but then...

846
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,200
I remembered some stuff.

847
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
Well, like what?

848
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,000
Well, first there was the hospital.

849
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,000
You know, every time
I woke up, you were there.

850
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,700
Yeah. I--I was
worried about you.

851
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah. I mean, you were
there every minute,

852
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,900
Whether I was asleep or I was awake.

853
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah.

854
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,200
I kept asking myself,
"why would she do that?"

855
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,400
You know,

856
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,700
unless it was about not me,
but your husband.

857
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,600
Which you said, you know, but
then I remembered some other stuff

858
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,000
Was that you kept talkin'
about that ghost doctor

859
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,000
And how he made people do things
by whispering in their ear.

860
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,900
No. Wait. I--

861
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,100
That's what you did.

862
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,200
You whispered in my ear.

863
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,100
All those hours
you sat by my bed, I mea--

864
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,400
You decided you couldn't accept
that your husband is dead,

865
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,300
So you made up your mind
that his spirit is in me,

866
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
And so you filled my head
with his memories.

867
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,900
You wanted to make it real
for yourself. The gunshots...

868
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,300
Please don't do this.

869
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,900
The paramedic stuff,
wanting to have kids.

870
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,600
The longer that you
don't accept it--

871
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,200
No, no. You have to stop, ok?
It's all a fantasy.

872
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,800
Stop.

873
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,400
You need help.

874
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,800
I wanna be there for you, all right,
But you need professional help.

875
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I'll do whatever it takes.

876
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,200
I'll get the best doctors.
I'll wait for you.

877
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,100
No, I think you've got it backwards.

878
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,600
I think you're the one that needs help.

879
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,600
No, melinda. You're angry right now.

880
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,200
I can't do this anymore.

881
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,900
I can't.

882
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,600
You have a--
A lifetime of memories

883
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,600
buried somewhere, But the obstacle
that you need to move is you.

884
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,500
No.

885
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,700
I tried.

886
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,100
I really, really tried.

887
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
I think you should
just get your things and leave.

888
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,000
- Melinda--
- Good-Bye.

889
