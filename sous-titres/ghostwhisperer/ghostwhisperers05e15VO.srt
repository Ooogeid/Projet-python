00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,704
Previously on "ghost whisperer"

2
00:00:02,704 --> 00:00:03,570
Dr. bedford: i need your help.

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:05,439
You've got to find that book.

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,507
The shadows. what kinds
of shadows are those?

5
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,910
The ones they make from the
parts that get left behind.

6
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:11,545
Parts of what? people.

7
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:12,946
Broken people.

8
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,148
The shadows? they
actually want something?

9
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,250
Well, whatever it is,
they're scary enough

10
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,552
That the book decided
to rewrite itself

11
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,120
To erase any mention of them.

12
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,455
Bedford knew about that book, then?

13
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,623
I'm sure the shadows did.

14
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,624
Bedford's president now.

15
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,125
He'd have total control over it.

16
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,727
Your staff has no
clue where you are.

17
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,129
You could ask my mother
if she weren't comatose.

18
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,365
I visit her every day
since the liver failure.

19
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,866
Leave her alone.

20
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:35,002
I won't let you hurt her.

21
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,770
I will do whatever it takes,

22
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,705
Do you hear me? do you hear me?!

23
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:41,833
Let me know if you
have any questions.

24
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:42,834
Mm-hmm.

25
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:44,002
Wow.

26
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,671
Huh.

27
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:48,886
This is not the usual genteel
stuff you normally carry.

28
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:52,046
True, but there seems to be an interest
in all things military right now,

29
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:54,290
And i found this
collector who has tons.

30
00:00:54,732 --> 00:00:57,549
Well, now you truly have the
"a" to "z" shopping experience.

31
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,518
You have antique
needlepoint pillows,

32
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,920
You've got art deco lamps,
and look,

33
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:03,956
You've got world war
ii gun holsters.

34
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,591
You know what, maybe it'll
bring in more male customers.

35
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,926
Well, have you ever
considered having

36
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:08,860
A vintage wet t-shirt contest?

37
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:10,595
'cause that'll really bring 'em in.

38
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:12,631
Times are tough, i just might.

39
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:13,932
Yeah, i know.
speaking of tough times,

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,001
I have an open house
over on shore road.

41
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:18,103
Ooh, can i borrow these chimes?

42
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:20,205
This would be a nice touch
out on the front porch.

43
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:22,808
That house still hasn't sold?

44
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,142
Listen, i am on my way
over there right now

45
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,377
To make cookies in the kitchen.

46
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,612
I will try anything i
can right now. anything?

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,514
'cause i have some vintage tees.

48
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,216
Very funny.

49
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:32,751
Ok, thank you so much.

50
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,119
I'll see you later! bye! bye.

51
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:35,487
Good luck.

52
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,522
Good luck.

53
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:41,626
Are you all right?!

54
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:45,230
Yes, i think so.

55
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:46,665
Ah, i'm so sorry!

56
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,400
Well, what happened?

57
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,235
I don't know.
i just kind of fainted,

58
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:51,470
I guess.

59
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,005
Well, did you hit
your head or anything?

60
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,173
No, i don't think.

61
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,508
I'm so embarrassed.

62
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,643
Please, don't be.
let me just get you some water.

63
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,380
I just felt so light-headed
all of a sudden.

64
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:02,814
It's never happened to me before.

65
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:04,549
Look, my husband, he's a doctor

66
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:05,650
At the hospital right there.

67
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:06,651
We could just go...

68
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,719
Oh, no, no, thank you.

69
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:08,954
I'm really fine.

70
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:11,623
I just--maybe i haven't
eaten enough today.

71
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,558
I'm so sorry about your vase.

72
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,093
Let me pay for it.

73
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,728
Please, you know what,
i hated that vase anyway.

74
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:17,996
You did me a favor.

75
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,898
E you sure? yeah.

76
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,433
Can i get you a cab?

77
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,568
Uh, no, i think walking
will be good for me.

78
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:26,471
I just gotta shake
this weird feeling.

79
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,140
Thanks again, so much.

80
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,674
No problem. look, just promise me

81
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:32,210
That if you don't feel
better right away,

82
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,512
You'll go see a doctor.

83
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,314
That's a promise. thanks again.

84
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:37,682
I'll walk you out.

85
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,053
Bye-bye.

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,789
Bye.

87
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,708
I swear i already filed this...

88
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:09,081
Ecology...

89
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,519
You know what they say about
people who talk to themselves.

90
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:17,089
Yes. but it's only dangerous

91
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,356
When you start answering yourself.

92
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,592
Can i help you, president bedford?

93
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,793
Yes, i want to give you

94
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,296
The curriculum guidelines
for the next semester.

95
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,035
That's it?

96
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:31,403
That's what you came here for?

97
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,472
Oh, i love what you've
done with the place.

98
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,040
I didn't do it.

99
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:36,708
I'm trying to figure out who did.

100
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:39,144
I don't follow.
i feel like somebody

101
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:41,546
Is actually going through my stuff.

102
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:44,683
Well, perhaps you should file a
theft report with campus security.

103
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,185
Yeah, see, that's the weird part.

104
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,920
There's actually nothing missing.

105
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:50,689
There's just stuff moved around.

106
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:52,491
It's not where i left any of it.

107
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,526
How could you tell?

108
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:57,863
It's like someone's
looking for something.

109
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,598
Something that doesn't
belong to them.

110
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,666
You making an accusation?

111
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,836
Because again, campus security
would be your best bet.

112
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:06,338
You know what i'm talking about.

113
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,772
Do you really think
i'm that stupid,

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,774
That i'd leave "the book
of changes" in my office?

115
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:12,043
Well, what i think of your
stupidity isn't important.

116
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:17,282
Now what is important is that i tried
to warn you what you're up against.

117
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,586
Now i am the least of
your problems, eli.

118
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:30,061
He was loved and he died too young.

119
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,130
Even so,

120
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,900
He had a big impact
on a lot of lives.

121
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:42,574
Giovanni was the best
turtle in the world.

122
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:07,132
You ok?

123
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,166
Yeah.

124
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,434
I'm sorry about giovanni.

125
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,369
I know the two of you were close.

126
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,572
He was a good listener.

127
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,874
You know, i never asked you

128
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,977
Why you decided to name
your turtle giovanni.

129
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,245
Because if he could talk,

130
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:22,280
I think he'd have
an italian accent.

131
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,082
That makes perfect sense.

132
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,452
I love you. see you in the morning.

133
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,388
I don't think he's really dead.

134
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,458
What?

135
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,227
Giovanni. he's not really dead.

136
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,063
What makes you say that?

137
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,832
'cause i remember him so good.

138
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,934
And all the fun stuff we did.

139
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:44,703
I bet he remembers me, too.

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,038
Wherever he is.

141
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,940
Yeah.

142
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,609
I bet he does.

143
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:54,412
So he's not really dead.

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,881
You're a very wise little man.

145
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,750
No, i'm just thirsty.

146
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:01,219
Ok.

147
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,089
I'll get you somemeater, then.

148
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:08,492
Maybe i should call you francis.

149
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,398
Jim?

150
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:50,768
Aiden!

151
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,802
Hey, how did the open house go?

152
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,638
Only 3 people showed.
but the cookies were a hit, though.

153
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:52,572
And not one offer?

154
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,441
Well, i wouldn't exactly say that.

155
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,077
Some lady offered me
$25 for the chimes.

156
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,478
Aha.

157
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,346
What are you doing?

158
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,449
I am not really sure.

159
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,250
Well, i like your honesty.

160
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,953
Sorry, i think there's
a spirit attached

161
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,055
To one of the things
in this collection.

162
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,657
Maybe killed in combat.

163
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,559
Really?

164
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,060
Yeah, and getting
blown up every night

165
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,829
Is going to get old real quick.

166
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,064
I'm sorry, what now?

167
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,833
Long story.

168
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,107
I think you just hit a nerve.

169
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,909
Do you see anybody?

170
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,444
No.

171
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,848
But i think i'm going to have
to go back to the source.

172
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,679
Ok. um...

173
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,047
I'm gonna go.

174
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:41,688
I have stuff to do.

175
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:42,826
Um, i'll see you later.

176
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,498
Bye.

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,178
George?

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,067
No returns, all sales are final.

179
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,569
Uh, i'm not returning anything.

180
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:05,703
Do you remember me?

181
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:07,472
Whoa! oh, yeah.

182
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,040
Oh, yeah, i remember you.

183
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,442
Don't get a lot of customers
that look like you.

184
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,013
It's actually not what
i came to ask you,

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,381
But now i'm curious--

186
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:19,584
Is mastersargeant
really your last name?

187
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,953
No. no, it's masters.

188
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,055
I added the "argeant."

189
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:25,390
I was actually going to
put "at arms" in there,

190
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:26,958
But the sign wouldn't fit it.

191
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:30,028
You know that "sergeant" is
spelled with an "e," right?

192
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:32,397
It is--yeah, i know.

193
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:35,099
Sar--sar--yeah, yeah, i know.
what's your point?

194
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:39,270
Have you ever actually been
in the military, george?

195
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:40,772
Ha, yes!

196
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,173
Spiritually.

197
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,638
Um, and what about physically?

198
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,906
Not so much, no.

199
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,975
I had a little problem
passing the physical.

200
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,577
Ok, look, the collection
that i got from you,

201
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:50,645
I need to know where it came from.

202
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:51,980
And why?

203
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,114
Just need to know.

204
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,439
It's hard to say.

205
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,384
Ok, well, is there
paperwork or anything?

206
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:59,887
Because i kinda need to
know who the owner is.

207
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,522
I buy this stuff from
all over the place--

208
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,024
You know, auctions, flea markets.

209
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,160
All kinds of places.

210
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,494
Right, i do the same
thing with antiques,

211
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:08,796
Except usually i have bills,

212
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:11,098
Receipts, contact information.

213
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,600
Yeah, well, you know,
my customers are not exactly

214
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,535
Sticklers for paperwork
and stuff, so...

215
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:16,737
Anyway, it's all legal,
it's all above board.

216
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:19,640
Right, so there should be a way,
then, for you to--

217
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,110
Yeah, you know what,
i got an army-navy store

218
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,278
Up in flushing,

219
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,280
And they're kind of
expecting a shipment here.

220
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,481
Well, can you just-- anyway,
listen, oh!

221
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,917
Next week, i've got a
sale on barbed wire.

222
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:32,653
Ha, you know, you ought to
invite your friends, ok?

223
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,607
I'm not afraid. i'm not afraid.

224
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:54,975
I'm not afraid.

225
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:56,110
I'm not afraid!

226
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,312
I've got to save my men,
i'm not afraid!

227
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:01,415
Everybody down!

228
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:04,184
I'll go first!

229
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:13,193
Oh, no!

230
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,668
It has to be the ghost of a
soldier who died in an explosion.

231
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,569
He's attached to the
mess kit i bought.

232
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:23,971
You know, someone
should invent a scanner

233
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,572
That not only tells you the
price of what you're buying,

234
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,941
But whether or not there's
a ghost attached to it.

235
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,310
It would save everybody
a lot of trouble.

236
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:31,178
You know what, why did he
sound like a little boy?

237
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:32,813
I don't know.

238
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,882
I think bedford's going through
my office looking for the book.

239
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:37,384
Please tell me that that
book is not in your office.

240
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:39,053
Do you think i'm an idiot?

241
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,954
The book is hidden here,
where no one can find it.

242
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,222
Oh, well, that's good.

243
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,457
Yeah, the bad news is,

244
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,059
I hid it so well,
i couldn't find it, either.

245
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,327
But then i found it.

246
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:48,862
Ok, so let's go back
to the other question.

247
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,698
Oh, well, perfect timing.

248
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:53,133
Ned, what are you doing here?
it's my turn.

249
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,502
Ned and i have been taking
turns holding on to the book,

250
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,071
So it's never in one
place for too long.

251
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:58,138
That's a good idea.

252
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:59,373
Yeah, it was ned's idea.

253
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,974
I'm not surprised.

254
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:03,811
Pretty smart, huh?

255
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,814
I came for the book,
not for dinner.

256
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,552
It's not like i can label it.

257
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,961
Interesting.

258
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:22,863
It looks like the
book added some stuff.

259
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,665
Nothing i understand,

260
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,568
But there's definitely more
here than the last time.

261
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,175
So where are you going to hide it?

262
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:36,410
I think we should stick to the rule

263
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,245
Of not telling each other.
it's safer that way.

264
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:39,446
I just showed you my hiding place!

265
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,215
Well, get a new one.
easy for you to say!

266
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:44,351
Ok, guys, i have a
ghost to cross over.

267
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,387
Oh, right, so haunted mess kit.

268
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:47,521
Where'd it come from?

269
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:48,789
Well, that's the thing.

270
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:50,691
I went to this dealer i've
never dealt with before,

271
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,259
And when i went back
to ask him about it,

272
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,494
He got weird.

273
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:54,895
You know, like he was
hiding something.

274
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,263
So here's what you do--

275
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:58,165
Place an order with him for
the same type of stuff.

276
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,101
Promise him a big pay day,
then follow him.

277
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,302
See where he goes to get it.

278
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,773
Ok. i'm impressed again.

279
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,912
You're too close.

280
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,947
No, i'm not. yuh-huh.

281
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,215
He can see the
headlights in his mirror.

282
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,150
That doesn't mean that he
knows we're following him.

283
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,719
Just back off a little,
will you? trust me.

284
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:55,823
I watch tv.

285
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,758
Where is he taking us?

286
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:01,094
I don't know. i've never
been on these roads.

287
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,329
Hmm.

288
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:03,864
Maybe he's seen us following him

289
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,066
And he's luring us to our deaths,

290
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,634
And no one will ever
find our bodies.

291
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:11,171
Just sayin'.

292
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:14,808
You think he went in here?

293
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,343
Well, if i'd been
able to follow closer,

294
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:18,045
Maybe i would know. now, come on.

295
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,680
What is this place?

296
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:21,181
Well, i've heard about it.

297
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,516
It was an old army base,

298
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:24,418
And then they started shutting
them down to save money.

299
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,759
It was the first to go.

300
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:36,430
Right, i read something about this.

301
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:39,366
Weren't they supposed to build
some houses out here or something?

302
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:40,934
Yeah, well, nothing ever happened.

303
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:43,303
Sad to see it so deserted.

304
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:45,506
Uh, it's not exactly deserted.

305
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,341
Oh, great, it's not
creepy enough out here,

306
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,876
Now we have to have the
lost patrol with us, too?

307
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,178
Have you seen the medic?
we need the medic.

308
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:52,579
I'm sorry, i just got here.

309
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:53,780
Would you please tell him to
get to the tent right away?

310
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:54,982
He's needed.

311
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,684
Will do.

312
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,753
Is there any reason why we can't
pick this up in the morning,

313
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:01,221
When the sun is shining?

314
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,656
Look.

315
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,918
Oh, god! you scared me!

316
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,259
Wait a minute,
what are you doing here?

317
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,659
What are you doing here?

318
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:21,894
Me? i, uh--

319
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,462
You're robbing stuff,
that's what you're doing here!

320
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,897
That's where you get
your inventory from?

321
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,866
You just steal it from the base?

322
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,300
Ok, first of all,
i'm not stealing, ok?

323
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:29,502
It was abandoned,
it's just rusting here.

324
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:30,803
I'm providing a service!

325
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,371
Uh, which you make money from.

326
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,839
Yeah, so what? you know,
i do all the legwork.

327
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:35,441
Nobody even knows about this place.

328
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,776
And i found it!

329
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:38,310
All right, george,
that doesn't even matter.

330
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:39,345
Just drop the stuff, ok?

331
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,313
And don't come back.

332
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:43,315
Does that mean our deal is off?

333
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:44,717
What do you think?

334
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,053
Well, how about we go halfsies?
cash and carry.

335
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,056
Good-bye. oh, god, you suck!

336
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,991
That is so wrong!

337
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,995
Now what?

338
00:15:56,063 --> 00:16:00,299
I don't know. i mean, i guess my
ghost soldier was here, but...

339
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,570
Hey! wait! what?

340
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,772
What? i just saw a ghost!

341
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,407
No kidding. no, no, no!

342
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:09,408
It was a boy, not a soldier!

343
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:11,310
He must know something, come on!

344
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,017
So i made the assumption

345
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,752
That the ghost soldier
had to have been

346
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,269
A part of the base at some point.

347
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,276
Hasn't the base been
closed for almost 20 years?

348
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,253
More like 30.

349
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,887
I found out it closed
in the late seventies.

350
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,560
But the soldier that i
saw in the basement,

351
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,024
He--he was a modern day soldier.

352
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,595
Ok, what about the
ghost kid you saw?

353
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,362
How does he fit in? wish i knew.

354
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,031
I mean, why would an
11 or 12-year old boy

355
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,265
Be haunting an army base?

356
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,867
Do you think he has something to do

357
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,102
With the ghost soldier?

358
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,337
There has to be some
kind of connection.

359
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,772
Why would the ghost
soldier open his mouth

360
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,808
And a little boy's voice come out?

361
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,110
What?

362
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,878
Wow.

363
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,148
It must be really,
really interesting to be you.

364
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,162
I'm not afraid. i'm not afraid.

365
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,598
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid.

366
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,899
I've got to protect my men.

367
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,568
Everybody down, i'll go first.

368
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:20,939
I gotta save my men.
i'm not afraid.

369
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,275
I'm not afraid.

370
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,888
What happened to you?

371
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,418
Mel, come eat something.

372
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,287
You know that will always be there.

373
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,888
I'm just trying to see if
i can find a connection

374
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,557
Between the thing that
blew up in my vision

375
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,026
And the little bomb thing
the ghost boy showed me.

376
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,928
You know, i wish
people could overhear

377
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,763
The conversations we
have in this house.

378
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,399
I just can't get that
kid's face out of my head.

379
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,802
He was so scared; so...vulnerable.

380
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,170
He...

381
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,005
What?

382
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,341
His eyes reminded me of aiden.

383
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,809
Hey, hey, shh, shh, shh.

384
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,144
Here it is.

385
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,446
That's a mine.

386
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,381
Um, vietnam era, maybe?

387
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,117
Yeah, there's the foot plate
thingy that i stepped on,

388
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,221
And that is what the boy showed me.

389
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,956
You said the soldier was modern,
not from vietnam.

390
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,357
Ah, which leads to my theory,

391
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,392
And it's a brilliant one,
if i do say so myself.

392
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,494
The boy was playing
on an abandoned base.

393
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,796
He wasn't supposed
to be there, right,

394
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,298
'cause he snuck in,
that's what boys do.

395
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,566
That's right. right.

396
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,667
So he finds this cool
thing that looks like fun,

397
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,536
But he doesn't realize
it's still a live bomb.

398
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,671
He plays with it, it goes off.

399
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,206
Hmm. ok.

400
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,475
Wait, no, that still
doesn't explain the soldier

401
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,643
With the little
kid's voice, though.

402
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,911
Well, maybe it does.

403
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,279
I mean, sometimes spirits recreate

404
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,847
The last thing they were
doing before they died.

405
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,916
So the kid was playing soldier.

406
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,983
Right. he's confused.

407
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,452
He's scared, so his spirit

408
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,786
Is sometimes rejecting himself

409
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,288
As the thing he was making
believe he was when he died--

410
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,856
A soldier in combat.

411
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,125
Amazing. now come eat.

412
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,927
The only problem with this theory

413
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,596
Is that the ghost kid i saw did not
look like he had been in a bomb blast.

414
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,098
That doesn't make any difference.

415
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,333
You know, the shockwave from a bomb

416
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,668
Can ruin your organs, kill you,

417
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,204
Keep your body completely intact.

418
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,705
Have you checked on aiden?

419
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,273
He's fine. he's in his room,

420
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,408
Playing with his fire trucks.

421
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,110
Ok.

422
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,145
I just have to check now and
see if there's any news reports

423
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,780
About explosions or anything else--

424
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,715
Delia. hey.

425
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,083
What's the matter?

426
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,186
Hey. did you say that
ghost kid you saw

427
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,756
Was a boy around 12 years old?

428
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:51,957
Yeah.

429
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,127
I found this on my car tonight.

430
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,264
He went missing 2 days ago.

431
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,400
That's the same time that
the haunting started.

432
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,302
Ah, that poor family.

433
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,338
I gotta find this kid.

434
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,274
See if i can get his
family some closure.

435
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,147
Um, i just--i'm so glad to
officially be talking to somebody

436
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,748
Who's connected to the base.

437
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,550
Yeah, well, we still
keep an eye on the place.

438
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,006
There's no real staff here anymore,

439
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:21,574
But i rotate in every
couple of weeks.

440
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,247
So the army still owns the base?

441
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,049
Yeah, technically we
still own this property.

442
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,551
I mean, although it's been up for
sale ever since i can remember.

443
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:29,153
What about bombs?

444
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,388
Excuse me?

445
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:32,056
Are there bombs stored here?

446
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,791
Mines, grenades,
that kind of thing?

447
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,659
Well, uh... look,

448
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:37,228
I think a little boy
was killed by one.

449
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:38,529
It's very important.

450
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,133
There is still some
unexploded ordnance

451
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,467
On this base, and it's a bit

452
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,702
Of an embarrassment to the army.

453
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,803
And i will deny it
if you tell anyone

454
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,304
I told you that.

455
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,539
Um, sir, before you go...

456
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:51,475
Ooh!

457
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,213
Can you show me where it is?
show you what?

458
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:57,848
It's over in the storage barracks,

459
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,784
But you'll both need official
clearance to tour the base.

460
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,552
Oh. didn't know you had company.

461
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,853
Come on.

462
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:07,791
Why do you think the
door was unlocked?

463
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,994
Whoa.

464
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,329
I think the kid came in here.

465
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,965
There's no sign of
an explosion here.

466
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,868
And this stuff must all be defused.

467
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,337
There's no way they'd
leave live bombs like this

468
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,773
Just laying out in the open.

469
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,642
Eli, don't touch that!

470
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,278
Ok, the ghost said that
there's unexploded ordnance.

471
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,746
That doesn't mean they're live.

472
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:29,747
Relax.

473
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,548
Even if they're not defused,

474
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:34,618
These bombs are so old,
they're not dangerous anymore.

475
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:35,853
How do you know that?

476
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,791
Melinda, i do have a life
outside the classroom, ok?

477
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,291
Watch this.

478
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:49,033
Oh! hypothesis gone wrong!

479
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:51,022
It happens.

480
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:56,224
What?

481
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,685
The last time that i saw the ghost,

482
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,391
The little boy,

483
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,307
He was crammed into
something small.

484
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,404
And looks like he couldn't move.

485
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,456
You don't think that...

486
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,967
Looks like the poor kid got himself

487
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,403
Locked in that container
and suffocated.

488
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,073
So why am i always finding you
two in the middle of trouble?

489
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,674
What has this got to do with you?

490
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:34,244
We had good reason to believe
that the boy's body was here.

491
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,080
What kind of reason?

492
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,881
You know what kind of reason.

493
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:39,416
You should have called us first.

494
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,719
And said what?
the ghost gave us clues?

495
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:44,655
We'll talk later.

496
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:46,824
Detective simon: so you and ms.
gordon came up here together, right?

497
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,792
That's right.

498
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,895
Uh-huh. ok.

499
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:53,464
That's it for now, dr. james,

500
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:54,631
But we may want to
talk to you later.

501
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,166
Yeah.

502
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,336
He doesn't like me.

503
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:00,871
I can tell.

504
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,539
Now i can get closure
for the family.

505
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:03,907
I just have to find that poor kid

506
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:05,743
And get him to cross over.

507
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,481
Now that's interesting.

508
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,016
Yeah. what's the connection

509
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,852
Between bedford and the base?

510
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,287
Bedford and the boy?

511
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,240
I'll be right back. ok.

512
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,411
I remember you.

513
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:42,880
Sorry, i didn't mean to intrude.

514
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:44,581
Did you know joey?

515
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,317
It kind of feels like i did.

516
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:50,421
I'm so sorry for your loss.

517
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:52,489
That day that i was in your store,

518
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,626
That was the day that
joey went missing.

519
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:59,530
I didn't know it yet,
i thought he was in school.

520
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:01,231
I can't imagine how
hard this must be.

521
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,701
I think i fainted
because somehow i knew,

522
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,305
Deep down,
that joey was in trouble.

523
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:11,742
You were very kind to me that day.

524
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,945
It looked like he had
a lot of friends.

525
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:16,447
He did.

526
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,948
Everyone liked him.

527
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,717
He changed, though,
these past few months.

528
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:22,853
He started playing
hooky from school.

529
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,456
I didn't know where
he was sometimes.

530
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:27,024
He made me so worried.

531
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,527
But he would always show
up back in his room.

532
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:34,431
Did you know about the army base?

533
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:36,400
No, he never told me where he went.

534
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:39,069
Now it all makes sense.

535
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:41,738
Do you know why he
went to the army base?

536
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,208
Yes.

537
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,711
Excuse me, julie. hi. i'm dennis.

538
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:52,082
Sorry to interrupt,
but it's time to go.

539
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,618
You ok? mm-hmm.

540
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:55,986
You sure?

541
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:57,421
Yeah, i'm fine.

542
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:20,878
Yes?

543
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:23,947
Hello, son.

544
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,618
Mother?!

545
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,486
Is that really you?

546
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:31,889
You're--you're out of the coma.

547
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:33,757
...what you need done.

548
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:35,292
I can't hear you.

549
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,794
You have what you need.

550
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,630
What...

551
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:40,631
What?

552
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,065
To get this done.

553
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,434
You have what you need.

554
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,770
Mother, i can't!

555
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,272
You have to!

556
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,873
Do what they want,

557
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:53,076
So you can protect the
rest of your family.

558
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:55,445
You don't know what they're asking.

559
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,614
Who got to you?

560
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,083
You have to make the book

561
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:01,385
Come to you!

562
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:02,953
There's no choice!

563
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,255
Mother, listen to me.

564
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:07,624
Listen to me!

565
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,761
Mother--

566
00:26:10,828 --> 00:26:12,129
Mr. bedford, mr. bedford?

567
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,397
Please listen to me!

568
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:16,333
This is dr. masefield
from rockland memorial.

569
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,402
I'm very sorry to tell you

570
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:19,836
That your mother passed away.

571
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:22,239
When?

572
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:24,074
About 30 minutes ago.

573
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:26,643
We tried your office number.

574
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,779
We did everything we could.

575
00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:30,814
She never regained consciousness.

576
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,649
I'm sorry.

577
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,954
Joey?

578
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:39,656
Joey?

579
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:45,262
Look, i know you must
feel so confused.

580
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,264
I saw your mom today.

581
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,701
She misses you, but she's ok.

582
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:53,637
I could take you
to her if you want,

583
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,206
You know, if you have
anything you want to say.

584
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,080
Dad?

585
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:06,383
It's me.

586
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:09,753
I'm not your dad.

587
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:16,426
Why are you looking
for your dad here?

588
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,862
I...i just saw him, with your mom.

589
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,665
Dennis? that's not my father.

590
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,800
He's my uncle.

591
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:26,670
My dad died in afghanistan.

592
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:29,006
Oh, i'm so sorry.

593
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:30,941
He died a hero.

594
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:32,509
I'm sure he's very brave.

595
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:33,610
He stepped on a mine.

596
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:35,746
But he totally saved
his whole platoon.

597
00:27:35,813 --> 00:27:39,149
You must be proud, but why are
you looking for him at this base?

598
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:44,621
My dad used to bring me here,
before he went away.

599
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:46,823
Only me and him knew about it.

600
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,226
We would play army.

601
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,396
He'd tell me stories
about being a soldier.

602
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,197
You're going to be a war
hero like your old man.

603
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:57,100
Come on.

604
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,669
Where are you going, huh?

605
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:00,370
Can you touch that?

606
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:07,611
Sometimes we would even camp out,

607
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,447
And eat out of mess
kits like real soldiers.

608
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:11,615
What do you think
of being a soldier?

609
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:13,083
I want to be a soldier,
just like you.

610
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:14,651
You'd make a great soldier.
you'd have to cut your hair, though.

611
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:18,255
When he died,
i still liked to come here.

612
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,058
Made me feel like i was...

613
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,694
Like i was still with him.

614
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,563
Do you remember what
happened to you?

615
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:29,132
I found all these bombs.

616
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,734
On the mines,

617
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:33,103
Just like the one
that killed my dad.

618
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:37,174
I figured that something like this

619
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:39,676
Was probably the last
thing my dad ever saw.

620
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:42,846
I just wanted to
take it home with me.

621
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:45,449
Then i heard noises.

622
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,018
Someone was coming.

623
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:50,520
I just wanted to find
some place to hide.

624
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,190
Dr. bedford: leave me alone,
please, just leave me alone.

625
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:55,092
There was a man, came in,
he was whispering.

626
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,227
What do you want from me?

627
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:59,463
I've done everything you've asked.

628
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,982
All right, all right, i'll get it.

629
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:03,862
At first i thought he was with someone,
but i was scared.

630
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:05,469
I've--i've done
everything you wanted.

631
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:08,256
Then something startled him
and he bumped into the door.

632
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:10,209
Who's there? get away from me.

633
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:12,506
All right, all right.

634
00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:13,624
I'll do it.

635
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,830
I couldn't get the door open.

636
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,999
I kept trying and trying.

637
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:19,068
Then it got real hard to breathe.

638
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:21,270
And then i just got
tired and fell asleep.

639
00:29:21,338 --> 00:29:23,372
Someone came and took a bomb?

640
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,075
So there's a live bomb out there?

641
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:27,777
What did this man look like?

642
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:29,845
I only got a quick look at him,

643
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:31,981
But he had white hair and glasses.

644
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,319
Was this the man?

645
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:38,448
That's him.

646
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,716
What is bedford doing with a bomb?

647
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,467
Now. if i could just speak to
detective blair for one second--

648
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,473
You have something to say,
you can say it to me.

649
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:56,723
It's not like i wouldn't love to,

650
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:58,624
But detective blair has
a certain understanding

651
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,626
For our situation.

652
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:01,861
Detective blair has
been transferred.

653
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:03,262
She's no longer at this precinct.

654
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,598
I'm handling her cases now.

655
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,533
Where was she transferred to?

656
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,101
I'm not at liberty to say.

657
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,636
Why was she transferred?

658
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,505
The department didn't consult you?

659
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:13,940
Heads are gonna roll.

660
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:17,076
Look, i know this is
going to sound weird,

661
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:19,412
But the president of
rockland university

662
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,247
Has a live bomb.

663
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:22,348
What?

664
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:23,516
It's a mine, actually,

665
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,718
But it's dangerous,
and he knows it.

666
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:27,753
You're saying that the president
of rockland university

667
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:29,956
Has a bomb that he's
planning to use?

668
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:31,123
Do you have evidence?

669
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:33,159
Define evidence.

670
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:35,761
Ok, you can't be throwing
a word like "bomb" around

671
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:36,862
This day and age.

672
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,465
Look, you don't know me,
ok? but i'm not crazy.

673
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,567
Bedford has a bomb!

674
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:43,135
And he wouldn't have gone
to the trouble of getting it

675
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:45,004
If he didn't have a plan to use it.

676
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:46,372
I think he's unstable.

677
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,407
Where'd he get the bomb?
from the old army base.

678
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:50,142
We cleaned that place out after
they found the boy's body.

679
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,712
Took it before that.

680
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,614
Ok.

681
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:55,982
We happen to know that
a bomb is missing,

682
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,551
We got the inventory from the army,
we're handling it.

683
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,787
Great! then why aren't you
on the way to bedford's?

684
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:03,422
Because this guy here
has been arrested

685
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,124
For stealing government
property. mm-hmm.

686
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:07,893
We found him there pocketing everything
that wasn't nailed down to the base,

687
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,395
So we're going to get
a search warrant,

688
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:10,496
We're going to go
through his house.

689
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:11,764
As soon as we do,

690
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,432
We're going to find that bomb.

691
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:15,801
So the police wouldn't help us.

692
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:18,704
No, and it gets worse.

693
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:20,606
Bedford hasn't been
in his office all day.

694
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:22,241
He went on bereavement
leave yesterday.

695
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,409
His mother died.

696
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:24,610
Well, was she sick for a long time?

697
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:25,778
Maybe that's why
he's been so weird.

698
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:27,947
It doesn't explain
why he took a bomb.

699
00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:30,016
Look, maybe we're the
ones who are overreacting.

700
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,618
Ok, the guy could collect
military memorabilia

701
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:35,021
And then have heard about the
hidden bombs at the base.

702
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:37,056
Oh, come on. you don't believe
that any more than i do.

703
00:31:37,124 --> 00:31:39,058
No. something's up with him.

704
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:40,426
Last time he came into my office,

705
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,094
He was acting all
weird and mysterious.

706
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:45,097
Even more weird and mysterious
than he usually does.

707
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,432
Hey. what are you doing here?

708
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,800
It's your turn to hide it.

709
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,869
Yeah, i don't think right now

710
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,270
Is a good time for me to--

711
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,142
Dr. james.

712
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,044
Hello, hello?

713
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:01,447
I know that melinda's with you now

714
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:04,817
And that ned's on his way,
if he's not there already.

715
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,652
It's bedford.

716
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,856
Now i'm going to ask you
one last time, nicely.

717
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,625
I want the book.

718
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:14,393
Yeah, well, you never asked for it,
technically--

719
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,796
Eli, i'm warning you!

720
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,030
I don't know where it is.

721
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:19,899
Look, i...

722
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:22,635
I don't think you appreciate

723
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:24,904
The gravity of this situation.

724
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:26,906
Now, i know all about your
little hand-off system.

725
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:29,041
Now i am tired of chasing the book.

726
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:32,078
I want you to bring it here now.

727
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:33,813
Yeah, right.

728
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,781
You don't know what
i've been through.

729
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,151
The shadows have turned
my life inside out.

730
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:41,220
Took my mother away from me.

731
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:47,593
I'm not going to shoulder
this burden alone anymore.

732
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,596
You don't want me to drop
what i have in my hand.

733
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,100
Ned,

734
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,103
You're going to bring
me the book now.

735
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,672
Now i've got nothing left to lose,

736
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,207
And if this thing goes off,

737
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:03,642
I don't care what happens to me,

738
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,478
But i would hate to see
it take away someone

739
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:08,080
Who is very precious to you.

740
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:11,350
And if i see one police officer

741
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:13,285
Or any sign that you're not doing

742
00:33:13,353 --> 00:33:17,056
Exactly as i say,
it'll be all over.

743
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:21,560
I hate to rush you, but--

744
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:23,396
Yeah, i happen to
have ned on the line.

745
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:26,432
He had a question about
class next semester.

746
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,867
He's a go-getter, your boy.

747
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,034
Do you want to say hi?

748
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:31,404
Hi--hi, ned.

749
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,467
Bedford...

750
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,569
If you hurt my mom,
i swear to god--

751
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:40,172
Yes, ok, well,

752
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,241
You bring the paperwork
to your mom's office,

753
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:45,077
Quickly, while we're
all still here.

754
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:47,479
Damn it!

755
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:55,554
So is this house yours
that you're selling?

756
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:58,424
No, it's my mother's.

757
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:59,992
She passed away recently.

758
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,761
Oh, i'm sorry.
i know how painful that is.

759
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:04,863
Yes, it is.

760
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,939
Um, why don't i just fill out

761
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:12,014
Some of this basic
information, and--

762
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:13,515
Uh-huh.

763
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:15,836
I'm sure you realize
how difficult it is

764
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:17,285
To sell a house right now?

765
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:21,087
Yes, but i don't think that's
going to matter too much.

766
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:22,656
No, not too much.

767
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,297
I should do it.

768
00:34:30,364 --> 00:34:32,399
She's my mom,
and he's expecting me.

769
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:34,540
No. no way. your mother
would never forgive us

770
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,197
If we let you anywhere
near that bomb, ok?

771
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:37,825
I'll bring it right back out.

772
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:43,276
Mel, is this worth anybody's life?

773
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:47,218
All right.

774
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:48,797
Wait.

775
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,464
I should do it.

776
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,966
I know bedford and he knows me.

777
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,135
Technically, it's my turn
to have the book, so...

778
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,072
I wouldn't mind a little protest.

779
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:01,901
I mean, i'm open
to objections here.

780
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:03,343
Hurry.

781
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,808
I guess that'll do.

782
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,812
Well, why don't you
just come over here

783
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,647
And you can fill everything out.

784
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:15,016
Here. just take that.

785
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,223
Heh... is everything ok?

786
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,293
Ah... i don't know.

787
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,503
It's not supposed to be him!

788
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:42,711
Keep very still now. what is that?

789
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:44,279
Very still.

790
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:45,914
Bedford!

791
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:48,016
Eli, what is going on?

792
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:50,585
I have what you want.
now let her go.

793
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:51,686
Eli, what the hell is going on?

794
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:52,754
Delia, please.

795
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:56,424
Now, i'm going to
hand you the book...

796
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,793
As soon as delia steps out, ok?

797
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:00,695
Ok.

798
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:02,297
Delia.

799
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:03,865
Just walk towards the door.

800
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:05,901
Delia, please.

801
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:10,038
Ok, ok.

802
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:14,509
Eli, come with me.

803
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,945
Delia, it's all right,
just go. just go.

804
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:22,817
Delia! look out.

805
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:25,153
Delia, delia, come over here,
it's all right.

806
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:27,389
Hey!

807
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:29,624
Ned! mom!

808
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:32,594
I'm sorry, eli.

809
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:33,762
I know things have gotten

810
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,130
A little out of hand,

811
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:38,333
But i tried to do
what i think is right.

812
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:40,201
Look, it's not too late.

813
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,304
Just come outside with me.
put that bomb down.

814
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:43,872
We'll get this all
straightened out.

815
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,653
Hmm. i'm afraid it's too late.

816
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:48,244
There are too many moving parts.

817
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:50,567
They're powerful.

818
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,042
More than anybody knows.

819
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:56,284
I was hoping that you'd say we would
walk out together and end this.

820
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:00,259
I'm going to have to ask you

821
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:03,092
To give me the book now, and leave.

822
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:06,652
It doesn't have to end this way.

823
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:08,491
Even for you.

824
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:11,393
Yes, it does.

825
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,451
No, no, this can't be.

826
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:38,892
These pages are all gone!

827
00:37:40,744 --> 00:37:43,440
It's gone, the pages are all gone!

828
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,298
No!

829
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,152
I did everything you asked,
everything!

830
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,336
It's not my fault!

831
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,535
What, what--

832
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:05,738
No!

833
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,935
The book erased itself!

834
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:12,071
You can't blame me for that!

835
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:13,806
Eli, hurry!

836
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,181
No!

837
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:34,939
Ned, are you ok?!

838
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,200
Yeah.

839
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,622
Eli... yeah, i just...

840
00:38:37,622 --> 00:38:38,821
Oh, my god!

841
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,115
Oh, my god.

842
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,073
I'm ok, honey.
are you hurt? i'm fine.

843
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:51,177
It's all right.

844
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,754
Bedford...

845
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:07,093
I want to thank you for your help.

846
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,895
What did i do?

847
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:11,430
Well, you let us know
that there was danger

848
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:14,667
And who was responsible.

849
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,137
It's time for you to go now.

850
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:20,206
You must know that.

851
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,376
Look, i can promise you that your
dad is going to be waiting for you

852
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,478
On the other side of that light.

853
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,446
I know.

854
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:30,917
So then why don't you
want to cross over?

855
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,923
I don't want to leave.

856
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,991
I don't want to be dead.

857
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,230
Well...

858
00:39:44,794 --> 00:39:47,967
Then i'm just going to
have to tell you something.

859
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:52,205
Something that i learned
just a few days ago.

860
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:56,242
You're not dead.

861
00:39:56,931 --> 00:40:00,379
As a matter of fact,
nobody ever dies.

862
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:04,317
You want to know why?

863
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:07,587
Because you're gonna...

864
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:12,491
You're gonna live inside
everybody who ever knew you.

865
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,760
Everyone you ever touched.

866
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:17,830
No matter how little.

867
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:21,734
And...the people who
love you--your mom,

868
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:27,506
Your uncle dennis,
your friends at school,

869
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:30,910
They're never going to
stop thinking about you.

870
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:34,747
Or talking about you.

871
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,749
They're never going to forget you,

872
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,685
'cause that never goes away.

873
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:44,023
You're never going to die
because you were loved.

874
00:40:45,058 --> 00:40:48,661
Because you loved.

875
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:51,998
You're gonna live forever.

876
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:55,101
We all will.

877
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,755
Do you see the light?

878
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:10,994
Good-bye, joey.

879
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:17,533
I'll see you again someday.

880
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,540
What?

881
00:41:57,608 --> 00:42:00,410
I thought i was going to lose you.

882
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,779
Just for a second.

883
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:16,859
Not a chance.

884
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:20,930
Do your homework.
