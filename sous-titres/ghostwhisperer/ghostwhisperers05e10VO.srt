1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:03,973
Hi! am i late?

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,375
No, i was early. hi.
sorry!

3
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:09,045
Chief resident let me get
out a couple hours before.

4
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:11,280
Well, i would have
been here sooner,

5
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:12,782
But i couldn't get
out of the house.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,650
I just kept
going back
for one more hug.

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:15,952
You know,
it's the first time

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,386
We've left aiden
since...

9
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:20,223
I know,
since he went missing.

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,226
But a little
separation anxiety,
that's normal, right?

11
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:24,727
Absolutely normal.
he'll be fine.

12
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,429
Especially
with delia sitting.

13
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:29,365
It's...
[sighs[

14
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:33,469
I know that the shadows
haven't been back.

15
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:35,338
Just--

16
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,906
I don't know,
i keep thinking

17
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,941
Maybe they're
waiting for us
to let our guard down.

18
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,743
Honey, that's not
going to happen.

19
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:42,645
It'll be fine.

20
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,615
So, aiden.
any separation anxiety
on his side?

21
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:46,749
No.

22
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,784
He couldn't wait
for me to leave

23
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,553
So that he could
show his aunt delia
his magic tricks.

24
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,523
That's because
he's like his mother--

25
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,525
Gifted and resilient.

26
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:58,361
Where is eli?

27
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:00,263
I don't care.

28
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,231
oh.

29
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,635
Hi, eli. we were
just wondering
where you are.

30
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,103
sorry.

31
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,704
The behaviorists got into it
with the freudians

32
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:10,273
At the faculty meeting.

33
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,741
It wasn't pretty.

34
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:13,876
I'll be right there.

35
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:16,012
Uh-oh,
i spoke too soon.

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,113
What do you mean?

37
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,714
I'm being busted
by the five-oh.

38
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:19,982
What?!

39
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,417
Smokey's on my tail.

40
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:23,686
You're getting
pulled over?

41
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,454
ok,
you know what,

42
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:26,822
It's probably
your tail light.

43
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,192
i'll never
survive in prison.

44
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,326
I've been
telling you
for a week

45
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:31,527
To get that
thing fixed.

46
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,763
Please tell me
you'll visit me
in the pokey.

47
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,598
Eli, you're not
going to jail.

48
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,500
You're just
getting a ticket.

49
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,202
ringside seats.

50
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,670
Fantastic.

51
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,205
Yeah.

52
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:45,408
?the best in life is free ?

53
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:48,477
Captioning made possible
by abc studios and
cbs studios, inc.

54
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,185
You know why
i stopped you?

55
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:58,521
If it's about
the coffee filters
i stole from work,

56
00:01:58,589 --> 00:01:59,589
I'll bring 'em back,
i swear.

57
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:01,357
No, sir,
it's your taillight.

58
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,060
I know. coffee filters
thing was a joke.

59
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,761
You think
this is funny?

60
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,096
A little.

61
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,397
No?

62
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:10,099
No.

63
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,434
Step out
of the vehicle.

64
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,347
A field sobriety test?
is he drunk?

65
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:25,348
No.

66
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,483
He's just eli.

67
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:34,290
Oh, i would give anything
to know what he's saying
to that cop.

68
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:40,396
I would like to know
what that cop has
a ghost in his backseat.

69
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,466
Be right back.

70
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:48,237
So did i pass, or...

71
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:51,474
I'm writing you a ticket
for your taillight.

72
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,276
seriously?

73
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,443
You can't just
give me a warning

74
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,444
And let me be on
my merry way?

75
00:02:55,512 --> 00:02:56,545
Tell him
to shut up.

76
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,282
Who?
me?

77
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,184
What are you doing?

78
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,222
Uh...

79
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,691
I'm friends
with dr. james.

80
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,627
Step back.

81
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,062
This doesn't concern you.

82
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:15,298
Do what he says.

83
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,335
He's a killer
with a badge.

84
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:28,611
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

86
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,546
Thanks for coming in.

87
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:06,652
Let me guess--

88
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:09,037
Detective blair wouldn't
take care of your ticket.

89
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:11,340
Can you believe it?
she wouldn't even
come down on the price.

90
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,108
She actually
told me i should
cut officer ramsey

91
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,710
Some slack 'cause
he's been through
a lot lately.

92
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:16,678
Meaning the shooting
he was involved in.

93
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,513
Is that
what it was?

94
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,881
Blair didn't
give me any details.

95
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:20,983
She just said
he was on a leave
of absence.

96
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,251
How'd you find out?

97
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,452
I called the station
and asked

98
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,054
If he'd ever killed anybody
in the line of duty.

99
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:28,023
Just like that?

100
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,191
Jeez.
mm-hmm.

101
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,892
Blair's been
holding out on me.

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,962
And here i thought
we bonded because i told
her about our gift.

103
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,999
Anyway, ramsey
didn't kill anyone
but his partner did,

104
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,934
And he just happened
to be there when it happened.

105
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,836
This guy, todd moresco.

106
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,337
He's our ghost?

107
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:43,705
Well, i didn't get
a good enough look at him,

108
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,240
But he's definitely
in the running.

109
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,242
"meth addict shot during
routine traffic stop.

110
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,811
"officer luis simon shot
and killed todd moresco

111
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,080
When the suspect turned
a gun on his partner,
officer ramsey."

112
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,248
Whoa.

113
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,951
Yeah, ramsey went on
a six-month leave of absence.

114
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,819
You think he did
something wrong
during the shooting?

115
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,254
The ghost does.
either way,

116
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:00,956
He's only been back to work
for a few of weeks.

117
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,557
Ok, well,
if moresco's our ghost,

118
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,661
Why is he haunting
ramsey and not
the guy who shot him?

119
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:07,462
Maybe he's haunting them both.

120
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:11,099
It's so nice of you
to do this.

121
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,501
You know what,
it's not a problem.

122
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:14,536
We usually have a bunch
of these neighborhood
watch packets,

123
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:15,704
But i guess
we ran out.

124
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,206
Oh. it's a dangerous world,
even here.

125
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,175
Well, we have to keep
grandview safe.

126
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,110
And we appreciate it.

127
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,813
Oh.

128
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,782
Officer simon.

129
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,252
I'm sorry. i didn't
recognize your name
from the paper.

130
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,220
The drug addict,
the one that you...

131
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,623
Well, you shot him,

132
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:36,958
Right? and he died?

133
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,661
That's right.

134
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:42,764
Must be hard
to move past
something like that.

135
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,299
Well, it is what it is,
you know?

136
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,069
I don't like to second guess
decisions i make on the job.

137
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,604
So you're not
haunted by it?

138
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,873
No, i'm not.

139
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,809
Well, i'm sure during
the investigation

140
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,977
They figured out
that you didn't do
anything wrong.

141
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,346
Well, my partner and i
were both cleared.

142
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:58,380
It was a righteous shoot.

143
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,515
Your partner, he took
a leave of absence.

144
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,284
He did, but it wasn't
a disciplinary move.

145
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:03,618
It was personal,
you know.

146
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:05,354
He had a hard time
dealing with what happened.

147
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,556
Harder than you?
different.

148
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:08,924
See, i didn't
have a choice.
i had to shoot.

149
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,493
Moresco had a gun
pointed at my partner's head.

150
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,994
But for doug,
it was different.

151
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,730
It was his gun.

152
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,798
I didn't know that.

153
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,567
It all happened so quick.

154
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,569
You know, one second
he's telling this junkie
to get out of the car.

155
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:22,804
The next thing you know,
the guy's got doug's gun.

156
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,806
I can't imagine it.

157
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:27,008
It's the worst thing
that can happen to a cop.

158
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:28,744
Having his gun
turned on him?

159
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:29,778
Especially a guy like doug.

160
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,880
He's tough,
always in control.

161
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:33,982
You know, he prided
himself on the fact

162
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,817
He never fired his weapon
in the line of duty.

163
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,855
The fact that it was his gun
that forced me to fire...

164
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,092
Look, everything's here.

165
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,895
You're all set to go.

166
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,597
Thank you.
yeah.

167
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,532
Hey, anne-marie.

168
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,567
How are you?
i didn't realize

169
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:53,835
It was so late.

170
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:55,604
Where's doug?

171
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:58,707
Your father went to get
a ballistics report
at the lab.

172
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,075
He should have
been back there
a half hour ago.

173
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,843
But he'll be here
any minute.

174
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,245
Great.

175
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:06,548
You're not an officer
here, too, are you?

176
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,018
I'm in high school.

177
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,087
This is anne-marie ramsey.

178
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,022
It's my partner's daughter.

179
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,091
Oh, hi.
i'm melinda gordon.

180
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,595
Ok, so,
if we're done here,
why don't we just--

181
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:21,863
You know, it's just
really nice

182
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:24,199
That you come by
and visit your father
after school.

183
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,801
More like
report to.

184
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,370
Nice would be
sipping a skinny
vanilla latte

185
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:30,405
On the square
with my friends.

186
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:35,110
Oh. well.

187
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,344
Bye.

188
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:47,722
Take it to the impound,
thanks.

189
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,324
Will do, officer.

190
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:54,296
Hey!

191
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:57,065
Hey!

192
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,000
No, no, no! wait!

193
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:00,302
Wait, that's my car!

194
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,503
Please!

195
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,172
That's my car!

196
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,176
?but tonight,
can't i go... ?

197
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,478
Mmm.

198
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:10,879
Don't worry
about the car.

199
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:11,913
I'll go down
to the impound lot

200
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,382
And straighten out
as much as i can.

201
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,283
It just must've been
some sort of mix-up,

202
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,185
Because it said
that my tags had expired,

203
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,220
But i always renew.

204
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:19,688
You know,
i remember

205
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,490
That the registration
stickers came in the mail

206
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:22,691
And i thought
i left them on
the kitchen counter.

207
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,826
Maybe i tossed them
by mistake.

208
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:26,194
I don't know.

209
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:27,929
It's just weird to see
your car like that,
you know?

210
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:28,930
And then,
i almost missed it

211
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:30,999
Because officer ramsey
was talking

212
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,501
To the tow truck driver.

213
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:33,602
Ramsey was there?

214
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,837
Yeah, why?

215
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,139
Nothing. it's
probably just--

216
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,673
Just a coincidence.

217
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:39,908
What do you mean?

218
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,710
Well, don't you think
it's a little strange,

219
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:43,044
You're asking questions
about a cop

220
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,413
And then that
very same cop shows up

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,448
When the car gets towed?

222
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:49,184
What? you think
officer ramsey's trying
to send me a message?

223
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:51,753
I think most cops
are hard-working guys
with a tough job,

224
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,389
But there is
the occasional bad egg.

225
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,559
You know
what i'm saying.

226
00:08:57,627 --> 00:08:59,294
Yeah.

227
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:00,796
Yeah, i'll be careful.

228
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:27,656
Officer ramsey:
hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

229
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:29,925
Get back here!

230
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:34,930
whoo! yeah!

231
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:47,175
You're not
todd moresco.
who are you?

232
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,851
He wanted revenge

233
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,586
And he got it.

234
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,147
oh! you are the best.

235
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,182
Ah, it's the least
i could do after
hijacking your car

236
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,483
For the whole day.
thank you.

237
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,686
Besides, i need your
help with something.

238
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,820
I found my ghost.

239
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,989
His name is
dylan hale.

240
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:26,859
Oh, that's the kid
from grandview high
who died last month.

241
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:27,994
You're sure it's him?

242
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,729
Positive. he gave me
a vision last night.

243
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,631
And you know
he was admitted here
before he died.

244
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,499
Of course, which is
why i need you
to ask around,

245
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,834
And find out
what really
happened to him.

246
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,769
Skateboarding accident.
hit his head.

247
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,538
There was no
skateboarding
in my vision.

248
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,239
What did you see?

249
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,841
Dylan was in a car.

250
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,177
He was driving past
officer ramsey's house.

251
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:48,114
Ramsey was angry, and i
mean, really angry.

252
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,215
And i'm just
starting to wonder

253
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,717
If the skateboarding
story is a cover up.

254
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,418
For what?

255
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,753
I don't know,
but if ramsey's the guy

256
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,021
Who brought that kid
into the er,

257
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,723
Then maybe we're taking
the wrong person's word

258
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,091
For what
really happened.

259
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,092
Whoa, whoa.

260
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,893
You think a cop
hurt this kid?

261
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,395
Dylan seems to.

262
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,496
I mean,
he's a cop, right?

263
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,864
They--they're
people.

264
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:05,965
There can be good
ones, bad ones.

265
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah, but, i mean,
killing a kid?

266
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,236
Look, he went
back to work right
before dylan died.

267
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,771
Maybe he went back
too soon.

268
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,840
You're thinking ptsd?

269
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,441
That would make
a man volatile.

270
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,111
I just want to know
where that skateboarding
story came from.

271
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,215
Ok, i will find out
as much as i can.

272
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,349
Thank you.

273
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,518
After i get
your car outta hock.

274
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,193
Hey, uh, buddy.

275
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,562
Um, i've been waiting,
like, 20 minutes
for this car to come out.

276
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,297
Do you think--
you should talk to him.

277
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,633
Sorry. thanks.

278
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,802
Hey.
hey.

279
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,773
Don't tell me.
you couldn't find the car.

280
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,808
No, we found it.

281
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,344
Good. thanks.

282
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:54,313
Thing is, your car
was accidentally tagged
for a drug search.

283
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,449
What?

284
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,484
It kinda got stripped.

285
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,585
Down to the frame.

286
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,654
What do you mean,
down to the frame?

287
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,523
You know your
steering wheel,

288
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,891
Seats, stereo
system, stuff
like that?

289
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,892
Right.

290
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,061
They're
pretty much gone.

291
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,429
Tell me you're kidding.

292
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,097
Sorry, bro,
it's no joke.

293
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,100
But it was totally
our bad, so you will
get reimbursed.

294
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,101
Yeah.

295
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,036
You know, my wife
really liked this car.

296
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,572
At least she'll
get to go shopping
for a new one.

297
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,475
All right, thanks.
yeah.

298
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,210
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

299
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,713
You said
that someone told you

300
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,148
Accidentally to strip
my wife's car?

301
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,149
Yeah.

302
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,451
Who?

303
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,586
That, i don't know.

304
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,154
There's no paperwork
on it,

305
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,556
Which is one
of the reasons

306
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,824
Why we realized
it was a mistake.

307
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,494
A mistake, huh?
yeah.

308
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:42,695
All right.

309
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,397
Thanks.

310
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,765
Yeah.

311
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,805
he made a mistake?

312
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,208
So, he killed my car?

313
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,977
All right. you know
what? that's personal.

314
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,379
I just think you need
to be more careful,
that's all.

315
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,514
Melinda, on phone:
don't worry about it.

316
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,583
I know how
to handle this guy.

317
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,388
Phew.

318
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,259
Officer ramsey?

319
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,727
Hi. melinda gordon.

320
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,462
We met over there
the other night.

321
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,498
Did dr. james get
his tail light fixed?

322
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,133
Oh, you scared him
straight.

323
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,300
You have a knack
for that.

324
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,902
Good to know.

325
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,804
Which is what i'm hoping
that you will do

326
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,472
With the skateboarders
around here,

327
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,474
'cause they're always
in front of my store.

328
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,109
Mostly kids, teenagers.

329
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,410
And you're
concerned about?

330
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,812
Safety.

331
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,747
Especially after that--

332
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,016
That young kid died
in a skateboarding accident.

333
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,951
I don't think
most skateboarding
accidents

334
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:39,952
Are that serious.

335
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,954
Still.

336
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,256
How's his family doing?

337
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,457
I wouldn't know.

338
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,259
That death wasn't
a police matter.

339
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,460
It was an accident,
not a crime.

340
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,662
No, no, right.

341
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,063
Right. it's just
i had--i had heard

342
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,865
That he was in trouble
with the law?

343
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,534
Not that i know of.

344
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,469
Not here in
grandview anyway.

345
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,604
And not that
it makes his death
any less tragic.

346
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,207
No, i--i didn't
mean that.

347
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,214
Ms. gordon.

348
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,484
I've been patrolling
the square for almost
a month now

349
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,452
And i haven't noticed
any skateboarders.

350
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,228
Ahh! that is
a sandwich.

351
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,364
Eli, come right in.

352
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,033
Hello.

353
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,769
Well, since i figured
you're a one-car household

354
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,204
And i just happened
to be passing by,

355
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,072
I wanted to see
if you needed a ride
back to the hospital.

356
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,207
Oh, thanks.

357
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,042
I'm working a double.
it's the worst.

358
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,345
I was going to ride
my bike, but since
you were, um,

359
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,247
Just passing by?

360
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,815
My wife put you up
to this, didn't she?

361
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,017
She felt bad
about monopolizing your car.

362
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,919
You heard what happened,
didn't you?

363
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,321
They didn't
just tow her car.

364
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,522
They trashed it.

365
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,557
I know. who knew
mistakes like that
could happen?

366
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,327
I don't think
anybody made
a mistake.

367
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,628
What do you mean?

368
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,732
I don't want to sound
like i'm overreacting,

369
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,567
But you stirred
something up.

370
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,236
Me?

371
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,237
You and melinda.

372
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,738
Well, that's
kinda what we do.

373
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,940
We stir things up
and then cross them over.

374
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:08,941
Something like that.

375
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,376
Eli, i'm serious, ok?

376
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:11,577
I used to be
a paramedic.

377
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,713
I know a little bit
about cops and how
they work.

378
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,781
Any way you slice this,
there could be trouble.

379
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,617
Ramsey's haunted
for a reason.

380
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,118
Well, let me try
to say it simply.

381
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,887
If ramsey's a good cop,

382
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,822
He's gonna do
a lot to protect his
reputation, all right?

383
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,923
If he's bad cop--

384
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,658
Who might have
possibly killed a kid.

385
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,093
A high school kid.
right.

386
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,428
I hear you.
i'm not saying
stand by and do nothing.

387
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,564
No, you're saying
just don't play games
with my wife's safety.

388
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,532
Yeah, yeah.
i am saying that.

389
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,304
I worry about her, ok?

390
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,705
So do i.

391
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,541
I know.

392
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,277
No, listen. jim.
melinda's my best friend.

393
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,544
I know.

394
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,612
No, you don't.

395
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,884
I haven't had a friend
like that since i was
12 years old.

396
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,219
Someone who
i've looked up to

397
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,421
And i can learn
things from.

398
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,723
I don't want
anything bad to happen
to her, either.

399
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,793
Well then,
hurry up and figure out
what this ghost wants.

400
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,729
Because if this
car thing's a message
from ramsey,

401
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,431
He's on to her.

402
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,666
And you.

403
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,270
He didn't even
bat an eye when i
mentioned dylan.

404
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,338
And this was
after my car

405
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,739
Was mysteriously
destroyed.

406
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,274
I mean, he is
one cool customer.

407
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,343
Maybe he's
not a cool customer.

408
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,711
Maybe he's just innocent.

409
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,012
Seriously?

410
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,248
Since when did
you become a fan
of officer ramsey's?

411
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,716
Since never.

412
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:24,917
But it's possible
he was telling
the truth

413
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,053
About dylan not having
a juvie record.

414
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,255
So, maybe they didn't
know each other.

415
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,456
Look.

416
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,758
I just talked
to detective blair
10 minutes ago.

417
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,327
She told me
off the record.

418
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,095
Whatever happened
between them,

419
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,129
It's personal.

420
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,531
That's why dylan
was at his house

421
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,833
And that's why
he said that ramsey is
out for revenge.

422
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:42,201
Were they neighbors?

423
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,402
Lots of neighbors
hate each other.

424
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,971
No, i checked.

425
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,839
And they lived across
town from each other.

426
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,574
Well, maybe it was
some sort of family feud.

427
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,209
Family feud?

428
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,078
Yeah.

429
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,546
Wait a minute. family.

430
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,282
He has a daughter.
she's in high school.

431
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,550
What if she and dylan
were dating

432
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,452
And that's how he got
on ramsey's bad side?

433
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,253
And then some.

434
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,823
Wow. so,
hats off to dylan.

435
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,325
It takes a lot of cojones
to date a cop's daughter.

436
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,933
Ok, i'll call
you later.

437
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:14,934
Hi.

438
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,902
Hi. uh, i'm melinda gordon.

439
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,205
Yeah, we met down
at the station.

440
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,140
I didn't think i made
a very good impression.

441
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,541
Sorry about that.

442
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,543
That place
kinda brings out
the worst in me.

443
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,945
It's ok.

444
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,648
Sometimes my dad
just gets to me.

445
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,918
He's way overprotective,
you know?

446
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,855
My dad wasn't exactly
the hands-on type, so.

447
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,023
Lucky you.

448
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,492
If dad could have me
home-schooled,
he would.

449
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,227
Thankfully he works,
and my mom,

450
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,928
She took off
a long time ago,

451
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,463
So he's got no choice.

452
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,499
He has to uncage me
for school.

453
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,803
Did you need directions
to the main office
or anything?

454
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,471
No, actually, i was
hoping to run into you,

455
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,173
'cause i wanted
to talk to you.

456
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,308
Yeah? what about?

457
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,510
Dylan hale.

458
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,079
The kid who died
in the skateboarding accident?

459
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,749
What? why?

460
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,718
Did you know him?

461
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:06,886
Everybody did.

462
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,421
It's not exactly
a big school.

463
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,957
Anne-marie,
i understand.

464
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,059
About your dad.

465
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,226
Being on your case
all the time.

466
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,162
It had to have
been hard on you.

467
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,329
Both of you.

468
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,697
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

469
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,199
Were you and dylan dating?

470
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,834
No.

471
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,102
Look, i gotta go.

472
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,806
Ok, look. wait.

473
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,776
This is going to sound
really strange,

474
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,045
But i have a gift.

475
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,513
I see ghosts.

476
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,415
And i've seen
dylan's.
what?

477
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,817
He doesn't
belong here

478
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,418
And there is a reason
that he can't move on,

479
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,786
And i think you know
what it is.

480
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,022
Stop it.
please. he needs
your help.

481
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,591
I told you.

482
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,526
I don't know what you're
talking about.

483
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:28,294
I mean,
she couldn't wait
to get away from me.

484
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:29,495
That's when
she dropped it.

485
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,263
You think dylan
gave her this thing?

486
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:32,798
It has to have
some significance.

487
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,300
I mean, i saw him get
clubbed in the head.

488
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,601
It was so violent.

489
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:37,002
You're sure it was
a cop's nightstick?

490
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,537
Well, i mean, it all
happened so fast,

491
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:39,772
But that's what
it looked like.

492
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,273
But you didn't see
officer ramsey's face.

493
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,441
No. just the stick.

494
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,176
I just wish i knew
where to go from here.

495
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:45,277
I checked around,
and it turns out

496
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,846
One of his friends
brought dylan into the e.r.

497
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,381
A kid named jake olmstead.

498
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,516
Yeah, he's the one
who said it was
a skateboarding accident?

499
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,184
That's what he said.
he just wiped out
at the park.

500
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:53,886
What about dylan,
what'd he say?

501
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:54,954
Nothing.

502
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,622
He was barely conscious
before he died.

503
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,792
Why would his friend
lie to protect
officer ramsey?

504
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,993
Look, i don't know, honey.

505
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,762
Now, i know you really want
to help this ghost,

506
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,864
But i really
don't want you to take
unwarranted risks.

507
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:06,799
And if this guy ramsey
killed a kid,

508
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,067
And he's already trashed
your car--

509
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,535
I'll stay
out of trouble.

510
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:11,170
Don't i always?

511
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,808
Not really.

512
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,111
Dr. james, come in.

513
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,546
Thanks for calling.

514
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,181
I've been reading
your work.

515
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:23,682
Didn't know i had fans.

516
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,184
Eh.

517
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:28,654
I've been studying
how adolescents process
the death of a peer.

518
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,689
Well, how're
the students
handling the loss?

519
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,058
Eh, a lot of them
are struggling.

520
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,827
Some come for help.
others...

521
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:37,530
Wouldn't step a foot
through the door.

522
00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:41,133
What about the kids
who knew dylan well?
you know?

523
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,769
Like his friend
who was with him when
the accident happened.

524
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:45,771
Jake olmstead. right.

525
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,873
Uh, checking in
with jake's still on
my to do list.

526
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,141
Were they tight?

527
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,243
No, actually.

528
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,113
Jake and dylan
were on opposite ends
of the social hierarchy,

529
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,648
With dylan pretty much
at the bottom.

530
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:57,950
So dylan was
a shoved-in-your-
own-locker kind of kid?

531
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,485
Not quite, no.

532
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:00,586
He was a loner.

533
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:02,621
Troubled family life.

534
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:05,124
Acted out.
spent a lot of time
in the principal's office.

535
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:06,392
And jake?

536
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:08,494
Straight arrow.

537
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:10,496
Baseball jock,
but with a brain.

538
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:13,499
Plus, everyone likes him.

539
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,634
How about dylan's
girlfriend?

540
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:17,169
How's she dealing
with this?

541
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:19,338
He had a girlfriend?

542
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:21,607
Well, weren't he
and anne-marie
ramsey an item?

543
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,008
You know anne-marie?

544
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:25,177
I kinda know her dad.

545
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,947
Huh.

546
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:29,415
You got me.

547
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:31,750
It's hard to keep track
of the hook-ups.

548
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:33,652
Don't think
i ever saw her
with dylan, though.

549
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,687
Jake, sometimes.

550
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,655
But not dylan.

551
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:39,725
You know, i don't mean
to overstep,

552
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:44,163
But if you could
use a hand,

553
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,198
I'd be more than happy
to donate my therapy
services

554
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:47,399
For a couple of hours
a week, you know?

555
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,901
Just until
things calm down.

556
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,770
I'd need to clear it
with the administration,

557
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:52,872
But of course.

558
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,139
That's very generous.

559
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:56,475
I could start by talking
to jake olmstead.

560
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:57,610
Great.

561
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:02,648
that's him.

562
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:04,283
I recognize him
from the team photo.

563
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:10,422
Jake, right?

564
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,424
I'm dr. eli james.
and this is
melinda gordon.

565
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,630
What do you want?

566
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:19,331
I'm working
with mitch larson.

567
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:20,366
I'm a psychologist.

568
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:21,534
A grief counselor.

569
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,768
I don't need a shrink.

570
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:24,036
You sure about that?

571
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:25,571
Weren't you
with dylan hale
the night he died?

572
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:28,140
Who told you that?

573
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,309
It was in
the hospital records.

574
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:32,411
Losing a friend can
be very traumatic.

575
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,879
It helps
to talk about it.

576
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:35,347
Look, i don't want
to talk to you.

577
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:39,385
I'm fine.

578
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:41,854
And i'm late
for practice.

579
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,425
I can see why
he's so popular.

580
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,315
You just got something
off that car, didn't you?

581
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:11,183
Good car.

582
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:13,419
I think those kids
are harassing
officer ramsey.

583
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:15,254
You're sure it's not
the other way around?

584
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,622
How can they harass him?

585
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,990
Vandalism.

586
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:20,225
And i'm not just
talking about,
like, tping trees.

587
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:21,827
It was vicious.

588
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:23,128
They tore apart
his house.

589
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:24,196
Wow.

590
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:25,965
Take one cop feeling shamed
and powerless

591
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:27,433
After a shooting incident,

592
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,234
Add a little ptsd,

593
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:30,736
And pow!

594
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:33,138
Vandalism like that
could've pushed him
over the edge.

595
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,149
You're late.

596
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:46,719
Where the hell
have you been?

597
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,621
What difference
does it make?

598
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,189
I'm your father.

599
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:53,759
Who you been with?

600
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,060
None of your
damn business.

601
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:56,562
Don't talk to me
like that.

602
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,831
You want to know
where i was so bad?

603
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:01,734
I was at
a candlelight vigil
for dylan hale.

604
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,702
Now, why would you
do that?

605
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,937
You didn't even know him.

606
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,572
Everybody was there.

607
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,840
It would have looked
weird if i didn't go.

608
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:10,709
I don't care
what it looks like.

609
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:12,177
I saw you talking
to that woman.

610
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:13,178
What woman?

611
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:14,947
Melinda gordon.

612
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:16,248
What'd you say to her?

613
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:17,916
It's none
of your business.

614
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,788
It is my business.

615
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,690
You are my business.

616
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:26,759
I didn't
say anything.

617
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:28,193
Now, leave me alone.

618
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,131
Who's out there?

619
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:34,667
Which one of your idiot
friends is outside?

620
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,374
Dylan?

621
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:46,178
What did you say?

622
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,480
What's the difference?

623
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:50,949
It's done.

624
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:52,551
Nothing will
bring him back.

625
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:58,624
Hey.

626
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:01,260
Gotta watch your
step now more than
ever, anne-marie.

627
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:05,731
I don't want
my little girl
getting hurt.

628
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:16,651
Pb & j, your favorite.

629
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,986
No trading, ok?

630
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,522
Not even if abby
has maple syrup?

631
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,691
Maple syrup?
for lunch?

632
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,226
What is that?

633
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:25,727
That's my sticker book.

634
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,830
Aiden!

635
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:29,931
Those are
mommy's car tags.

636
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,266
Where did you
get these?

637
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:33,902
From daddy. he left them
on the counter for me.

638
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,604
He knows i like
shiny stickers.

639
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:37,105
Aren't they cool?

640
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,941
Yes, very cool.

641
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,843
All right, out
to the bus stop.
come on.

642
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:43,078
I'm gonna hold on
to that.

643
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,281
There you go.

644
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,717
All right?
let me see you.

645
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:49,751
Mwah. handsome.

646
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,987
Knock 'em dead,
big guy.
you, too.

647
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:52,988
I'll walk you to the bus
in a second, honey.

648
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:53,989
Ok, mommy.

649
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:55,991
Eli the chauffeur,
at your service.

650
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:59,027
Look where
the registration tags
for my car have been,

651
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:00,028
Aiden's sticker book.

652
00:26:00,096 --> 00:26:01,430
So they really
were expired?

653
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:03,732
Yeah, and i thought
ramsey had had
my car got towed.

654
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,233
Well, he's still the reason
it got shredded.

655
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:07,202
I'm not sure about that.

656
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,571
'cause jim said
that he was poking
around the hospital,

657
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,206
Asking a bunch of
questions about dylan,

658
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:13,575
And if he had done
something, wouldn't
he have known?

659
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:14,910
Could be he's trying
to figure out

660
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,211
If anyone knew
he was involved.

661
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,412
Yeah, i don't know
about that.

662
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,680
Didn't you get
my text?

663
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:20,081
I hadn't checked today.

664
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:22,083
Oh, well,
jim also found out

665
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,186
That ramsey came
to pick up
dylan's things.

666
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:25,821
His clothes,
skateboard.

667
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,456
Anything that he had
brought with him
at the hospital.

668
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:28,690
Wait. dylan's parents
didn't do that?

669
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,559
Apparently not.

670
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:33,028
What if he's getting rid
of incriminating evidence?

671
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:34,796
Look, weeks
after the accident?

672
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:36,198
Look, remember,
i told you

673
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:38,433
I didn't actually
see ramsey hit him
with the nightstick.

674
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:42,971
Dylan.

675
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,372
Why don't you
believe it? he did it.

676
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,974
He's guilty.

677
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,809
I just think
there's more to
the story than that.

678
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:49,144
You don't understand.

679
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:51,413
You vandalized
his house.
you tormented him.

680
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,714
He had it coming.

681
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:55,417
No one has the right
to come between people
like he did.

682
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:57,185
Not when they're in love.

683
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:01,089
Hello?

684
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:02,390
Hey, mitch.

685
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,658
Yeah, of course,
i remember you.

686
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:05,861
You're my newest--
well, maybe my only--fan.

687
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,663
No, i haven't had a chance
to talk to her yet. why?

688
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,067
Ok, thanks.

689
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,535
Anne-marie hasn't been
to school in 2 days.

690
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:16,872
Has anyone talked
to her father?

691
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,541
They called the house,
no answer. why?

692
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,842
hopefully nothing,

693
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,143
Except he saw me
talking to her

694
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,678
And he didn't
look pleased.

695
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:29,551
Give me a second.

696
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,625
Ms. gordon, i don't
have time right now --

697
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:37,926
I don't want
to start any trouble,

698
00:27:37,994 --> 00:27:39,127
But it's about
your daughter.

699
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:40,195
What about her?

700
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,130
She's missed school
2 days in a row.

701
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:43,632
You're tracking my kid's
whereabouts now?

702
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:45,867
I just want
to make sure she's ok.

703
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,836
I'll deal with it.

704
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:51,473
Look, she's troubled
about something

705
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,574
And i think i can help.

706
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:54,643
I don't. now if
you'll excuse me,

707
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,111
I'm in the middle
of an investigation.

708
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:58,280
Yeah, is that why
you have dylan's things?

709
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,015
Last time
i asked you about him

710
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:02,450
You said that his death
was an accident, not a crime.

711
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:04,553
You said that you
didn't know anything.

712
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:12,928
You need to leave.

713
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,198
Yeah, ok.

714
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,266
Sorry.

715
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:22,170
Eli, on phone:
what do you mean,
it wasn't a nightstick?

716
00:28:22,238 --> 00:28:23,638
It looked like a nightstick,

717
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:25,173
But it was actually
a baseball bat.

718
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,375
Ramsey beat dylan's head
in with a baseball bat?

719
00:28:27,443 --> 00:28:29,110
Melinda, on phone:
not ramsey. jake.

720
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:31,079
Clean-cut
jock jake? why?

721
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:32,080
I don't know.

722
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:33,582
The ghost said
something about

723
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:34,583
If people
love each other,

724
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,817
They should be together.

725
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:37,018
Eli, on phone:
you're thinking

726
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:38,219
This is how jake
stopped their romance?

727
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:41,022
By whacking
his competition
in the skull?

728
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,991
It seems unlikely,
i know.

729
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,428
And if that's true,
why has dylan been
blaming officer ramsey?

730
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:47,796
I don't know, and i'd like
to talk to jake,

731
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:49,664
But i don't have a car.

732
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:51,566
I'll come by the store
after my next class.

733
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,234
Teach quick. bye.

734
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:54,569
Surprise!
surprise!

735
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:58,139
Hi!

736
00:28:58,207 --> 00:28:59,441
Oh, my gosh.

737
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,743
check--
check it out, mom.

738
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:04,212
It's an acadia.

739
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,213
Oh, my goodness.

740
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,481
It's got a remote.

741
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,283
And a camera
so you won't
back into anything.

742
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:10,051
Nice.

743
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,753
it's got
3 rows of seats, too.

744
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,689
So we can carpool with
my whole soccer team.

745
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:15,724
Oh, great.

746
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,425
Yeah.

747
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,760
come on in.

748
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:20,128
I know how much
you loved that old car,

749
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:22,397
But i just remember
it took you about
a year to pick it,

750
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:23,598
So, i hope you
don't mind if we --

751
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:24,933
Mind? why
would i mind?

752
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,635
And i love you.

753
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:28,103
Both of you.

754
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,138
I'm sorry
about your old car.

755
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:32,107
I didn't know they were
stickers for grown-ups.

756
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,608
It's ok.

757
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:34,643
We did good?

758
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,944
You did great.

759
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:37,412
Listen, tonight,
when i get home,

760
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,847
We'll all
take a drive
together, ok?

761
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:41,716
For now,
there's somebody
i need to talk to.

762
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:42,751
Go crazy.

763
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:44,052
Yay!
all right.

764
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,186
I love you,
i love you.
i love you.

765
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:46,888
Ooh, i can't believe
this is for me!

766
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,490
Here, pal.
hang on to that.

767
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:52,093
Ok.

768
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:53,762
i'm excited!

769
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,730
I love you both.

770
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:57,132
Good-bye.
love you.

771
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,072
Well?

772
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,507
We did good.

773
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:08,443
Looks like
we're walking, pal.

774
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:10,478
Ok.
come on.

775
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,191
Hi. um, my name
is melinda gordon,

776
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,592
I'm looking
for jake.

777
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,760
He's not home yet.

778
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:28,196
But i'm bonnie, his mom.
can i help you?

779
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:33,935
I think i've seen you
at the school before.

780
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:35,470
You're one of the moms,
aren't you?

781
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,707
Is that how
you knew dylan?

782
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:40,408
I've only
met him recently.

783
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:41,443
His death was
a shock.

784
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,345
Oh, i know.
it was awful.

785
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:45,480
His parents
still haven't come

786
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:46,948
For the last
of his things.

787
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:47,949
His things?

788
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,250
He'd been
living with us.

789
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:50,518
After his parents
kicked him out.

790
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,420
Oh. i had no idea.

791
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:55,223
I didn't even know
he and jake
were friends.

792
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,092
They were
and they weren't.

793
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:58,126
They used
to play together

794
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:00,328
Because i was friends
with his mom.

795
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:02,464
When did they start
growing apart?

796
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:04,766
I suppose
that was my doing.

797
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:05,767
His father drank,

798
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,435
And when he did,
he was abusive.

799
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:08,536
To dylan?

800
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:10,672
I think so.

801
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,273
Dylan started
acting out.

802
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:15,610
I couldn't blame him,
and i couldn't fix
his situation at home,

803
00:31:15,678 --> 00:31:18,279
But i could keep it away
from my child.

804
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:19,914
So you pulled away.

805
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:21,916
And jake stayed away.
he got good grades,

806
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:23,151
He got into sports.

807
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:25,220
And dylan...

808
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:27,021
Fell off the map.

809
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:29,958
But i guess
he remembered us
being kind to him.

810
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:31,259
Jake, too.

811
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,261
Because when jake learned
he needed a place to crash,

812
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,363
He invited dylan here,
and he accepted.

813
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,599
That must've meant
a lot to him.

814
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,267
So, how did they do
living together?

815
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:40,602
Good, i guess.

816
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,070
At first i was worried

817
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:43,738
Dylan was going to be
a bad influence,

818
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:46,908
Especially
when jake came home
with speeding tickets.

819
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:49,944
But it turns out that
was my fault, not dylan's.

820
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:51,246
What do you mean?

821
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:53,414
Jake was getting serious
about a girl.

822
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:55,283
And i didn't realize
how serious

823
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:58,052
Until i found a box
of condoms in his room.

824
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,955
Unopened, but still.

825
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:03,591
So i called
the girl's dad.

826
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,726
Maybe it
would've gone better

827
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:05,860
If i could've talked
to her mom,

828
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:07,195
But her mom's
not around, so--

829
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:09,197
The girl was
anne-marie ramsey?

830
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:10,298
You know her?

831
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:11,900
Her father, too.

832
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,601
Hmm. yes, well,
he threatened to have

833
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:17,138
Jake up on statutory rape
charges if he ever even
looked at anne-marie again.

834
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:23,344
Then jake got
9 speeding tickets
in 2 weeks.

835
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,612
So then
what happened?

836
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,781
Jake and anne-marie
stopped seeing each other.

837
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,384
Were they ok
with that?

838
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,819
Jake wasn't.

839
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:32,253
I don't know
about anne-marie.

840
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,689
And what about--
what about dylan?

841
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:35,723
Were they friends?

842
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,759
They were, but after
she and jake broke up,

843
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:39,661
I didn't see her
around here anymore.

844
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:42,330
Jake must've been
upset with the way
things ended.

845
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:43,464
He was hurt.

846
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:44,465
And being a teenager,

847
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,000
He took it out
on his dad and me.

848
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:47,769
And dylan?

849
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:50,872
Him, too.

850
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:07,388
Just tell me
what happened.

851
00:33:07,456 --> 00:33:08,857
No, there's no time.

852
00:33:08,924 --> 00:33:10,158
We have to get
rid of it right now.

853
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:11,726
My dad never
goes up there.

854
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,329
It's not your dad, ok?
it's that lady.
uh, melinda whatever.

855
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:16,898
She was just at my house.
she's figuring it out.

856
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:20,468
You have to hurry.
my dad's on
his way home.

857
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,242
Dylan must've known
anne-marie when he was
living with jake.

858
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:28,710
You think he started
crushing on her?

859
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:30,311
Melinda, on phone:
or maybe she fell
for him, too.

860
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:31,312
That's why
he's so angry

861
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,647
About lovers
being apart.

862
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:34,315
Jake must've been pissed
when he found out.

863
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:36,417
yeah,
especially after
he'd taken dylan in.

864
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,485
Hmm.

865
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:39,387
A lovers' triangle
gone bad.

866
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:41,022
Geometry can be so cruel.

867
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,423
But that
still doesn't explain

868
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:44,692
Why dylan blames ramsey
for what happened.

869
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,028
Or why anne-marie
was keeping jake's secret.

870
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:48,730
Yeah, she's the key
to all of this.

871
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,370
it's my dad.

872
00:33:55,437 --> 00:33:56,905
You have to get
out of here.

873
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:02,210
Hold on!

874
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:03,311
What the hell
are you doing here?

875
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:05,146
Dad, please.
don't.

876
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:06,814
Didn't i tell you
to leave my daughter alone?

877
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:07,916
Just back off.

878
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:09,417
Daddy, no.

879
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,121
Is that blood?

880
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:16,758
What the hell did you do?

881
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:19,961
Don't come any closer.

882
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:22,230
Put that thing down.

883
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:23,264
Tell me what you've done.

884
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,599
I said back off!

885
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:28,036
Daddy, no!

886
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:29,270
Daddy, no.

887
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,074
Stop, both of you!

888
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,742
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

889
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,043
Get back here!

890
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:06,612
Whoo, yeah!

891
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,692
Put it down!

892
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,693
stay away from me!

893
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:22,762
Officer ramsey:
drop the bat, jake.

894
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,796
Jake, please!

895
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:24,930
Give me the bat, jake.

896
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,298
You're in enough
trouble already.

897
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,234
Stay away from me!
melinda: hey, jake.

898
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,702
Ms. gordon, please!
jake,

899
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,970
You don't have
to do this, ok?

900
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:32,271
It was an accident.

901
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,406
Give me that!

902
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:37,209
Did you kill that boy?

903
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:39,078
What the hell
did you kids do?

904
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:40,746
It wasn't just us.

905
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:42,081
If it was an accident,

906
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:43,416
You've got to stop
lying about it.

907
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:45,651
Whatever you did,
i'll help you.

908
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,853
Anne-marie, you have
to tell your father
what happened.

909
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,226
Somebody tell me
what's going on.

910
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,498
You think you have
everyone's number,

911
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:01,534
But you don't know
anything.

912
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:04,904
Dylan was the one
who was smashing
your mailbox, daddy.

913
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:06,539
It was dylan.
why?

914
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:09,241
See? you have no clue
about that, either.

915
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:11,777
Did you know
what dylan was doing?

916
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:13,446
No. i had no idea.

917
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:16,115
We only just
found out about it
the night he died.

918
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:20,586
dylan and me,
we didn't really
hang out at school,

919
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:21,987
Even when he was staying
with me, but...

920
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,157
Dylan! come on, man, need
a ride? hop in. come on.

921
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,626
That night, we were
all at a party together,

922
00:36:27,694 --> 00:36:29,528
So we gave him a ride.

923
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:32,264
All right, let's go.

924
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:34,567
i was complaining
about my dad.

925
00:36:34,634 --> 00:36:35,668
That's when
dylan told us

926
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:36,902
It was him
and his friends

927
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,071
Who were playing
mailbox baseball
at our house.

928
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,440
Dude, really?
what the hell?

929
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:43,509
Why?

930
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,778
Why'd you do it?

931
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,646
I never asked him to do it.

932
00:36:47,714 --> 00:36:49,482
No, but he
did it for you

933
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:52,084
Because he knew
how ramsey was
harassing you.

934
00:36:52,152 --> 00:36:53,352
Yeah.

935
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,987
He said,

936
00:36:55,055 --> 00:36:56,989
"i've got
your back, man."

937
00:36:57,057 --> 00:36:58,524
Ok, so, then
what happened?

938
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,326
I wanted jake
to do it.

939
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:02,228
Smash the mailbox.

940
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:05,631
It would make my dad
so mad, and i wanted
to make him mad.

941
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:08,200
And it was
just a mailbox.

942
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,236
At first,
jake didn't want to.

943
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:11,871
Get it, come on, baby,
get it! let's go!
let's do this, hit it!

944
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,106
I had to drive around
the block 5 times.

945
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:16,909
But eventually...

946
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:18,577
Yeah!

947
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,519
Oh, no!

948
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,889
What did you do
to the mailbox?

949
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,658
I needed
the vandalism to stop.

950
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:33,859
That's all i wanted.

951
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:35,561
It happened 5 times.
whoo, yeah!

952
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,130
They'd come by,
smash the mailbox
and drive away.

953
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,367
I was already
feeling like

954
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,369
I couldn't
control anything.

955
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:45,070
The things
i see at work,
you wouldn't believe.

956
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,775
If i couldn't keep
a mailbox on a post,

957
00:37:49,843 --> 00:37:52,845
How was i supposed
to keep my family safe?

958
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,914
When did you realize
what had happened?

959
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,382
The next night.

960
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:58,484
Jake drove me home.

961
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:01,554
That's when i saw
the mailbox wasn't
even dented.

962
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:05,090
Then i saw the concrete

963
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,859
And i lost it.

964
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:08,894
So that vandalism
was you?

965
00:38:08,962 --> 00:38:12,398
Not dylan? you caused
all that damage?

966
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:13,566
It was me.

967
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,267
I had no idea.

968
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,037
And you were acting
so strangely.

969
00:38:18,104 --> 00:38:20,005
And then you
started asking
these questions,

970
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:22,474
I thought
you did something.

971
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,276
I did, dad.

972
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,846
But it was
an accident.

973
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,882
I never wanted
anybody to get hurt.

974
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,585
I just wanted
to feel like i
could protect you.

975
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:34,720
I never asked
for your protection,

976
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:36,222
And i don't want it.

977
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:38,390
Tell her she's wrong.

978
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,491
And so was i.

979
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,961
Wrong about what?

980
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,662
He's nothing like
my father, is he?

981
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,831
No.

982
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:48,000
No, she means
everything to him.

983
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:50,236
And he would never
do anything to hurt her.

984
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:52,471
Dylan's here.

985
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:55,608
He's with us now?

986
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:58,777
Oh, my god. dylan.

987
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,381
Is that why
you punished him?

988
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:03,983
'cause you wanted
to punish your father?

989
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:08,654
I made a mistake.

990
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,657
The anger that he had
toward his father,

991
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,926
He took it out on you.

992
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:15,027
But he's sorry.

993
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,297
I'm sorry, too.

994
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:19,965
Will you tell
him that?

995
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,300
He can hear you.

996
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:24,770
Dylan, man.

997
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,941
I can't believe it.
i feel horrible.

998
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:30,009
I...

999
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,813
I killed you.

1000
00:39:35,882 --> 00:39:37,349
Don't say that.

1001
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,051
It's not like you meant
for it to happen.

1002
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,954
He doesn't blame you.

1003
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:43,055
It was an accident.

1004
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:46,358
All he was doing
was being my friend.

1005
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,626
I'll never
forget that.

1006
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:50,362
All that he cares about
is that you were
his friend.

1007
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,097
He's gonna
always remember that.

1008
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:54,400
Nothing else matters.

1009
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:57,202
How is dylan?

1010
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,505
Can he move on now?

1011
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:04,376
She was my friend, too,

1012
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,011
And i don't want her
to end up like me.

1013
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,547
He's worried.

1014
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,549
That the two of you
will end up like
he and his dad.

1015
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,053
No. god,
please no.

1016
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,656
Look, baby,

1017
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:20,092
I know i've made
a lot of mistakes.

1018
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:22,094
I know it's
not enough

1019
00:40:22,162 --> 00:40:23,629
Just to say i was
protecting you.

1020
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:25,698
No, it's not.

1021
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:29,268
I guess...

1022
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:31,370
I guess i'm gonna
have to give you
some freedom,

1023
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:34,073
And trust you.

1024
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,674
It's just,
when i think
of you getting hurt.

1025
00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:39,211
I don't want you
to get hurt either, daddy.

1026
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,713
But it happens.

1027
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,515
Bad stuff happens.
you can't stop it.

1028
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,619
No, you can't.

1029
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:50,823
But you can
be there for people
when they need you.

1030
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,957
Sometimes that's enough.

1031
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,592
Sometimes it has to be.

1032
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:59,031
So you just want me
to "be there"?

1033
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,566
And that's all?

1034
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:03,836
Sometimes a hug is good.

1035
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:20,652
Will you tell them
i said good-bye?

1036
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,457
I will, i promise.

1037
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,141
What happened?

1038
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,476
You helped him
find the light.

1039
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:48,013
He's gone.

1040
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:50,149
He said to tell you good-bye.

1041
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,503
Did you have
a hard day?

1042
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:14,440
it was ok.

1043
00:42:14,507 --> 00:42:16,542
Long, but ok.

1044
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:19,044
Can i do anything
to help?

1045
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,515
Sometimes
a hug is good.

1046
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:34,560
Mommy, you can
let go now.

1047
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,964
I will, baby.

1048
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:41,733
One of these days,
i will.

1049
