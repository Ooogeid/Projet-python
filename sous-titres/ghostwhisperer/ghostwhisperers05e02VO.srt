00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,901
I feel like i've waited
my whole life

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:09,106
Just to meet you.

4
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:11,976
Is this what our lives
have become?
one giant party?

5
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:13,310
Both: yes!
[laughter]

6
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:15,246
Ooh, dad's gonna get us!
he's gonna get us!

7
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:16,981
Eli: but you feel it,
too, right?

8
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:18,382
Every time i treat
a patient here,

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,583
As soon as i walk
in the building...

10
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,918
Lost souls,
you know?

11
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:22,286
But it's a hospital.

12
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:23,454
People die here.

13
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:25,122
No, i worked
in a lot of hospitals.

14
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,291
There's something different
about this one.

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,293
[electricity flickering]

00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,397
Melinda...

17
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:34,798
Melinda: where are they?

18
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,367
Are they in danger?
aiden isn't,

19
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,501
If he stays where he is.

20
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,503
Aiden...

21
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,439
Just stay where you are.

22
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:44,808
Come here!
you're not safe there.

23
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,410
How do you know?
i just know.

24
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:50,648
Are you ok?
yeah.

25
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,850
I made tyler stay with me,
like i was supposed to.

26
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,218
Who told you that
you were supposed to?

27
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:55,719
I don't know.
the visions i've had,

28
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:58,389
They've been from aiden?
is he a sensitive?

29
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:01,392
The word you're looking for
is "empath."

30
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,861
He can share
other people's feelings.

31
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,996
You don't
want him to know
he's connected to you?

32
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,299
No. if he did,
then he'd know
that his dreams

33
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,500
Aren't really his.

34
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,335
I want his dreams
to belong to him

35
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:13,103
Like any little boy.

36
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,172
[crickets chirping]

37
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:17,608
Melinda: ok.

38
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,544
Time for you
to get comfy
all on your own.

39
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,279
Tomorrow, we're
gonna get up early

40
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:25,416
And we're going
to have your
favorite breakfast.

41
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,585
But for right now,

42
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,221
Here's
your monkey, ok?

43
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:33,624
Good night, baby.
sweet dreams.

44
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:35,292
Here, put your arms
in there.

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,894
There you go.

46
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,096
But i don't want
to go to sleep yet.

47
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:40,631
I'm not tired.

48
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:43,133
Well, you're just
gonna have to give it
your best shot, ok?

49
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,470
But i--i'm thirsty.

50
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:48,205
Uh-uh, don't try to
pull that with me.

51
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,107
Good night.

52
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,842
I'll get the light.

53
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:57,781
It's not even 8:00.
do you really think
he's gonna go down?

54
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,384
Unheard of, right?

00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,895
Jim: wow.

57
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:13,230
He's an angel.

58
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:15,232
Hard to imagine
he's the same little guy

59
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,801
Who just smeared
peanut butter
on my laptop.

60
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:21,338
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

61
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:23,207
You know what this
means, don't you?

62
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,742
We get a gold star?

63
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:28,912
No, we might
actually have some
time...to ourselves.

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,181
Uh, if i didn't have
peanut butter on my laptop.

65
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:32,950
No, laptop's
peanut butter-free.

66
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:34,652
I had a minute when
you were brushing
aiden's teeth.

67
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,220
Wait a minute,
if we just get
the dishes done--

68
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,122
Done! i did them while
you were reading to aiden.

69
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,523
Well, if we can get
the laundry folded--

70
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,225
Also done. clean scrubs,
in your drawer.

71
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,293
I took out the trash.

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,927
I made aiden's lunch
for tomorrow.

73
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,462
You did?
yeah.

74
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,131
Ah, that is such a turn-on.

75
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,932
If you did not have
to go to work tonight...

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,434
I don't.

77
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,803
I got that
intern scott
to cover my shift.

78
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,674
We have a totally free night?

79
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,576
Absolutely.

80
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:01,779
Oh!

81
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:03,647
Come here.

82
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:08,919
Oh!

83
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,734
So, where's
your roommate?

84
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,236
Uh, cramming
for a psych midterm.

85
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,439
Won't be back for a while.

You know, just in case...

89
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:47,458
Don't move a muscle.

90
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:48,692
Oh.

97
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,980
What kind of person
would do this?

98
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:11,448
I don't know!

00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,464
It must be done.

108
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,733
Who are you?

109
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,102
Stop it before it spreads.

110
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,603
Stop what?

111
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,840
If it's not
too late already.

112
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:15,979
Shush, now.

113
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,948
Shush, girl.

114
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,543
Your screams
won't help you.

115
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,544
Whose screams?
Who are you talking to?

116
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,622
[gasping]
this will hurt,

117
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,257
But it'll be over
quickly.

00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:21,860
Jim: so with the robes
and the hushed voices,

125
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:23,929
I mean, is there any chance
they could have been doctors

126
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,764
Performing, i don't know,
some kind of operation?

127
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,532
With a huge, rusty needle?

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,201
Well, you said it looked
like they came from
another era.

129
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:31,036
Maybe it was the era
before sterilization.

130
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,370
Yeah, or no anesthesia.

131
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:34,005
They just kept saying,
"hold still,"

132
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,241
But i could still
feel everything.

133
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,743
And they couldn't see
or hear you at all.

134
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:40,378
You know, it sounds
like one of your visions

135
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,713
You've been channeling
from aiden.

136
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,815
Yeah, he was awake
when i went in
to check on him.

137
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,984
Hey, there weren't
any little needles

138
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,819
In any of his
dreams?

139
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,988
No, he doesn't remember
his ghost dreams.

140
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:53,458
Thank god. you know,
he certainly remembers
his other dreams.

141
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:55,293
You know, a couple
nights ago he was dreaming

142
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:57,629
That he was flying over
a mountain made of ice cream.

143
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:59,531
Now he wants to
learn how to skate--
mommy?

144
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,867
Dad!
aha! whoo!

145
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,468
Hey, do you want
o.j. or milk
with your pancakes?

146
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,637
Milk, please.
you got it.

147
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,305
Hey, i think
we got spongebob

148
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,241
Coming to visit us
for breakfast.

149
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:10,809
Ahh, nice socks.

00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,844
Jim...

151
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,412
I couldn't decide.

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,248
You know what,
i think it's great,

153
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,350
And i am very impressed
with how you're getting
yourself ready.

154
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,818
Thanks!

155
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,520
You're welcome.

156
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:24,122
So, is ned ok?

157
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,790
Ned? why wouldn't he be?

158
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,193
He called before.
didn't he?

159
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,564
Well, someone called.

160
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,766
I just didn't get
the chance to check it.

161
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,335
I think ned
wants to talk to you.

162
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:43,141
Yeah, i-i think
you could be
right about that.

163
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,976
Um, your dad's going
to get the syrup.

00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:57,155
Does this have
something to do
with your vision?

167
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,823
Because as
the only member
of this family

168
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,158
Who doesn't
traffic in ghosts,

169
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,493
I'm kind of
at a loss.

170
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,862
Well, all i know is,
i have a voicemail from ned.

171
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,730
It came in this morning,
my phone was on vibrate.

172
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:08,166
There is no way that aiden
would have known he called.

173
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:10,702
But he did.

174
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,337
What does this mean?

175
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:15,707
That he's going
to continue to amaze us.

176
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,342
And that whatever
has meaning to me

177
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,544
Obviously means
something to him, too.

178
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,981
Yeah, and ned means
a lot to both of you.

179
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,316
Ned: hey, melinda.
it's ned.

180
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:27,285
Something weird
happened at school.

181
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:28,853
A friend of mine's
in trouble.

182
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:31,189
What happened?

183
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,691
Can you come over?

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,493
[exhales]

185
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,063
[indistinct chatter]

186
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,499
It was like this
when we came in,

187
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,168
Only it was wet.

188
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,202
It's nail polish.

189
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,004
Melinda: yeah,
i can smell it.

190
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:49,174
Look, i guess
someone could have
walked in here

191
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:53,545
And hung my doll
and painted the walls

192
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:56,214
In nail polish to make it
look like blood,

193
00:08:56,282 --> 00:09:00,418
But we were right here
when that mirror shattered.

194
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,387
What caused that?

195
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,422
Did you call
the campus cops?

196
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,224
No, we called you.

197
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:10,428
A friend of brianna's
died a few days ago...

198
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,063
A friend
who was angry at her.

199
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,767
Ned told me
what you can do.

200
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,637
So...

201
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:20,939
Is there one,

202
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,408
Here?
no.

203
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,244
No ghost.

204
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:29,414
So, why don't you
tell me about
your friend who died.

205
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,618
Gwen.

206
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:36,955
We used
to be really tight.

207
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,258
She was run down
by a car about a week ago.

208
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:56,474
By then, we weren't
really speaking.

209
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,509
What happened?

210
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,144
I saw her at a party.

211
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,279
She was making out
with a guy.

212
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,415
She had a boyfriend

213
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:06,951
Who was a good friend
of mine, too.

214
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,922
It ticked me off,
so i told a friend

215
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,023
Who told a friend--

216
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,625
Who told her boyfriend.

217
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,327
Gwen was really upset.

218
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,529
Upset enough
to do all this?

219
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:21,199
Actually, there's
one more thing.

220
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,502
Can a ghost send an email?

221
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,872
"hello, my name
is sally stitch.

222
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,774
"i have chosen you.
forward this,

223
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,943
"or you or someone
you love will suffer.

224
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,546
Do not break the chain,
or the suffering
will have no end."

225
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,514
Wow. that's
pretty disturbing.

226
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,183
This gwen's email?

227
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,851
Yep.

228
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,353
I got it a few days ago.

229
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,054
I didn't forward it.

230
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:44,956
Guess that made her mad.

231
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,725
And it came
after gwen died?

232
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,060
Two days after,
according to the timestamp.

233
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,496
So the image of
this girl with her
eyes stitched shut,

234
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,498
Would that
mean anything
to you and gwen?

235
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,233
No.
so it could be

236
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,168
Some chain email
gwen got
and forwarded.

237
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:59,671
Except that's not
all she did.

238
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,374
She's the only one
who could have known.

239
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,576
Known what?
look at this.

240
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,878
At the end of the email,
there are these descriptions

241
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:09,547
Of what happened to people
who broke the chain.

242
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:12,917
"a college student
ignored the email

243
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:14,486
"and found
her best friend luanne

244
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,555
Hanging from a noose in
a blood-splattered closet."

245
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,324
Like your doll.

246
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:22,227
Luanne is my doll.

247
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:25,196
She's a keepsake i've had
since i was six.

248
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,133
Gwen is the only one
who knew she what
she meant to me.

249
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,635
She's the only one
who even knew her name.

250
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,173
[birds chirping]

251
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:37,675
Eli: ghosts are creating
their own emails now?

252
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,177
Aren't they
getting crafty.

253
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:41,079
What's next,
blogging? webisodes?

254
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,515
Well, it's possible gwen
didn't create the email.

255
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:44,450
It's just something
going around--

256
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:46,786
A scary image
she's using to
terrorize her friends.

257
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,320
Ex-friend.

258
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:51,123
Ok, so what would this
email have to do with
two friends fighting?

259
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,426
Maybe it's a way for gwen
to pay brianna back.

260
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,727
For not forwarding it?

261
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,562
For getting her in trouble
with her boyfriend.

262
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,963
I did a little research
on the image

263
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,899
Of someone with
their eyes sewn shut.

264
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,434
Ugh, i hate needles.

265
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:02,935
It's rooted
in some lore.

266
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,336
You said the people
in your vision,

267
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:05,738
They didn't seem to be
of this time, right?

268
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,273
Right.

269
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,275
<i>well, in dante's inferno,
it was punishment for envy.</i>

270
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,911
In scottish folklore,
it was punishment
for intimate betrayal.

271
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:13,913
But i could
only find one society

272
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,881
That actually
put it into practice.

273
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,183
The puritans?

274
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,418
"a zealous offshoot
deems stitching of eyes

275
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,121
Suitable punishment
for those who spread
slanderous gossip."

276
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,556
That look like
anything you saw?

277
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,357
It's hard to tell,
but the clothes are similar.

278
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:26,592
And so is the theme.

279
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,260
Gwen was hurt by gossip.
yeah,

280
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,695
By one friend,
but this email,

281
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:31,130
It's designed
to be forwarded.

282
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:32,598
I mean, gwen punished
brianna when she didn't
pass it on,

283
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,899
So what does she want?

284
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,201
Spread a little fear
on her way out--

285
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:36,769
Make her mark,
so to speak.

286
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,337
Do we know if the email
was sent to anyone else?

287
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:39,905
It was a blind c.c.

288
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,074
You wouldn't do that
unless there were
other recipients.

289
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:44,777
So, this is only
the beginning.

290
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,685
Oh, sick!

291
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,854
Dude, check this out.

292
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,259
Oh, man.

293
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,628
It says
you're supposed
to forward it.

294
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:05,831
[scoffs] yeah.
i'm not forwarding
this to anyone i know.

295
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,700
You sure?

296
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:12,471
What's it say
down there?

297
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,974
Crap that supposedly happens
to people who didn't.

298
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,543
This guy found his dog
dead in a car.

299
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:20,212
This girl's father
bled out in the bathtub.

300
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,981
Intense.

301
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,550
What if it's true?

302
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:26,218
Come on, dude.
it's a bunch of lies.

303
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,787
You sure, man?
i mean, look at this.

304
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,824
A girl, luanne,

305
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,426
Was found hanging
in a blood-splattered
dorm room.

306
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:35,928
[chuckles]

307
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,464
I'd toss it off
to somebody
just to be safe.

308
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,369
You did toss it off
to someone.

309
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,937
You tossed it off to me.

310
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:48,307
Hey. it said i could die.
i'm not taking any chances.

311
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,676
Whooo!

312
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:53,045
[chuckles]

313
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,914
Whatever.

314
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:57,082
It's your funeral.

315
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:03,483
See you, Sally.

316
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,366
This is really
beautiful.

317
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,201
We should do this
more often.
i know.

318
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,504
Fast food never tastes better
than when it's in the great
outdoors, honey.

319
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,339
Now that they've got
the whole square

320
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:11,874
Wired for wi-fi.

321
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:13,075
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:14,576
You were
ten minutes late

323
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,011
And i've been
working
all morning,

324
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,713
And so i just
thought i'd look
at gwen's obit.

325
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,784
What'd you find out?
not much, actually.

326
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,585
I mean, she was
raised by her mom,

327
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,220
Only child,
really good student,

328
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:26,455
Did a lot
of charity work.

329
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,357
I have ten minutes
with you,

330
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,292
And i am talking
about my ghost.

331
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,528
Come on, i get you alone
twice in one week.

332
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:34,897
I'm a spoiled man.

333
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,232
Come here.

334
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,736
Oh! there you are.

335
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:45,974
Man, you two
are hard to find.

336
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,309
Do you know that
your cell's off?

337
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,244
Yeah. i turned it off.

338
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,580
Ok. no reason
to get snippy.

339
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:53,382
I just thought i'd
let you know that

340
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,050
Someone sent me
the sally stitch chain.

341
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:56,919
Who sent it to you?
a student of mine.

342
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,854
It's spreading across
campus like kudzu weed.

343
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:00,055
Somebody you flunked?

344
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:01,924
No. i asked him
to send it to me.

345
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,093
He fractured his ankle
walking into class.

346
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,594
He thought
it was because
he broke the chain.

347
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:07,629
I told him to send it
to me so he would
stop freaking out.

348
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,164
I was right, wasn't i?

349
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,967
No chance
emails are cursed.

350
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:16,605
I'd hate to be proof
that curses exist.

351
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:19,541
Oh, please.
there's always
an explanation.

352
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:22,411
Yeah, i knew that.

353
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,246
Then try explaining this.

354
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,150
Wait.

355
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,285
All these things happened
to people who broke the chain?

356
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,321
Apparently, the chain
keeps breaking.

357
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:37,192
Yeah, but why would
gwen want to cause
all this suffering?

358
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,861
I mean, why would
she be so angry?

359
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:40,529
She said that
her death was
an accident, right?

360
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,700
Wait a minute.

361
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,605
Brianna said
that gwen got hit
by a car.

362
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:52,341
Well, i always
assumed that it was
as a pedestrian.

363
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,675
But she was
a passenger.

364
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,010
Passenger in what?

365
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:57,045
In a car that got
into an accident.

366
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,847
Look, it says
that there's
two victims.

367
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:00,416
Now, what did
the email say again?

368
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,551
"my name is sally stitch,
i'm a nasty little bi--"

369
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,553
The threat.

370
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:08,257
It said that
something bad
would happen

371
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:11,160
To you or someone
you love.

372
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,530
What if it
happened to both?

373
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,302
[monitor beeping]

374
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:25,908
Woman on p.a.:
dr. forest, dial 102, please.

375
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,479
That's gwen's mom.

376
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:34,183
She ran a red light
straight into a guy
taking a left.

377
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,051
What happened
to him?

378
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,053
Minor injuries, he's fine.

379
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,355
I don't understand.
what happened to gwen?

380
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:42,357
She must have gotten
out of the car to go
get help for her mother.

381
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:45,694
She got out straight
into the path
of an oncoming car.

382
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:47,262
D.o.a.

383
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,131
What about her mother?

384
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,999
Been in a coma ever since.

385
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,208
She's here.

386
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:07,416
Gwen?

387
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:11,253
You can see me?

388
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,488
It's ok.

389
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,857
I can help you. i...

390
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,194
I think i understand
what happened.

391
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:21,230
Everyone thinks
it was an accident.

392
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,397
But you don't.

393
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:25,267
You think it was
the email.

394
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,069
[monitor beeping]

395
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:29,271
You got it right
before the accident,

396
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,606
And you didn't
forward it.

397
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:32,941
Not then.

398
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,412
My mom lives
a few hours away.

399
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,148
I was so happy to see her.

400
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,618
Ah, i wish
i lived closer.

401
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,586
We could go to
lento's every night.

402
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:45,854
[laughs] right.

403
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,122
I'd be a blimp.

404
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,057
[both laugh]

405
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:53,228
The minute i opened
the email, i wished i hadn't.

406
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:56,031
I hate those chain things,
you want to just trash them,

407
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,600
But then,
part of you wonders...

408
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:02,237
What if there's
something to it?

409
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,477
I made the wrong choice.

410
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:09,478
Because right after, I hit ****

411
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,054
[alarm sounding]

412
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:23,392
Mom?

413
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,827
Mom, are you ok?
wake up, mom!

414
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,564
Don't do this,
please!

415
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,065
[horn honking]

416
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,301
[brakes squealing]

417
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:37,039
So, you think
because of what you did

418
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,441
With the email,
that caused the accident.

419
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,109
I'm dead, aren't i?

420
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,912
[monitor beeping]

421
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,983
But it's not fair
that she has to suffer
for what i did.

422
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,986
But that's the rule,
of the email.

423
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,754
"forward this,

424
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:55,958
"or you or someone
you love will suffer.

425
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,327
"if you break the chain,

426
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:01,930
The suffering
will have no end."

427
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:04,566
I have to save her.

428
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,268
It's not too late.

429
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:08,770
So, you think if you keep
the email going,

430
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,872
That she'll be spared.
yes.

431
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,543
And i'm sorry
brianna got it,

432
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,512
But i had no choice.
and neither does she.

433
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,382
She has to keep
the chain going.

434
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,618
They all do.

435
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,486
So, wait a minute.

436
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:28,890
All the horrible things
that have been happening
to people in the email...

437
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,359
Are you haunting them?

438
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,394
I didn't start this.
someone sent it to me.

439
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,363
Yeah, but you're the one
who has to make it stop.

440
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,530
You don't understand!

441
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,666
Something scared you.

442
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,901
Was it the same thing
that scared me?

443
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,138
I had a vision

444
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:46,375
That my eyes were
being sewn shut,
like sally stitch.

445
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:50,679
Did you see it, too?

446
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,514
Please.

447
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:55,517
Just don't try
and stop this.

448
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,653
What's it going
to take?

449
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,589
How much fear
needs to be spread?

450
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:02,557
I don't know.

451
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:05,260
But it is not
my fault

452
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:06,695
If people get hurt.

453
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:09,097

to send this,

keep terrorizing people?

to your friend nick's band.

something wrong?

to call you.

Yeah, he's got
a scratched cornea,

But he'll be
all right. there's no
permanent damage.

Just first-degree
burns on her hands.

They'll heal
in a week.

I mean,
they were both lucky.

00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:02,580
The ghost said
that when someone gets hurt,

501
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:04,982
It's going to be my fault.
i guess this is what she meant.

502
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,550
Does she really believe
her mom's going to die

503
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,785
If we break this chain?

504
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,521
I've been checking
that email i got.

Let me tell you,
that list of tragedies
keeps growing.

Bodies are piling up.

507
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,459
Everybody in the e.r.
keeps talking about it.

508
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:18,162
They're blaming it on
household accidents,
twisted ankles.

510
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,666

happened whether

00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,067
They got the email
or not.

512
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:24,368

We have to prove
that she and that email
are not real.

00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:32,710
Any chance
you could figure out
who created it?

[scoffs]
fat chance.

517
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:35,746
Yeah.
i mean, that thing

518
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:38,082
Could have been
going around for months
before gwen even got it.

519
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,917
Yeah, the email's building.
i mean, every time
somebody gets hurt,

520
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:41,519
It just makes gwen's case.

521
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:43,054
What are you
going to do,

522
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,022
Travel the speed of
d.s.l. to prove each
one was an accident?

523
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,826
No. just the one
who turned her into
a believer and a ghost.

524
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:51,162
Wait, gwen's obit
says she died
in a car accident.

525
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:54,031
But we know that she was
disoriented from
the other accident,

526
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,866
Two car accident.

527
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,668
There was a witness.

00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:58,769
The other driver.

529
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:01,105
Can you get your hands
on a police report?

530
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:08,579
Thank you.

531
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,815
I really appreciate you
taking the time to talk.

532
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,516
Well, i was due
a break, anyways.

533
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:13,851
So you're a therapist?

534
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,720
And a grief counselor.
up at the university.

535
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:17,655
Right. you mentioned that
on the phone.

536
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:20,791
The girl, the one that died,
she was a student there.

537
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,760
Yeah. i'm trying to help
some of her friends

538
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:24,261
Make sense
of the tragedy.

539
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,930
Make sense
of a freak accident.

540
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:27,698
How are you supposed
to do that?

541
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,000
Well, sometimes
it can be comforting

542
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,267
If people think
there's a reason

543
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:31,769
Why something
like this happened.

544
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:33,237
A woman runs a red light.

545
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:35,072
Where's the reason in that?
good question.

546
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,707
So, from
your point of view,

547
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:38,776
There's no way
to explain
what happened.

548
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:41,312
I didn't say that.
tell me.

549
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,448
Well, there was a moment
just before the crash.

550
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:47,284
I was making a left,
so i pulled out.

551
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:49,520
Then i saw her coming.

552
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:52,456
But there was still
plenty of time
for her to stop.

553
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:55,393
Normally when
someone runs a red,

554
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,662
You think cell phone
or make-up, a radio.

555
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,498
You know, there's
some distraction.

556
00:26:00,565 --> 00:26:03,868
But she was staring
straight ahead.

557
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:09,607
Her eyes glazed over
like--like she was frozen.

558
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:11,175
Didn't even blink.

559
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:14,812
Whoa!

560
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,415
It was like
she was in a trance.

561
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:23,287
In a trance.
that's what he said?

562
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:26,090
She looked right at him,
but she didn't seem to see him.

563
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:27,491
What would
make her do that?

564
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,527
Plenty of things.
she could have been having

565
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:31,295
What my father called
an "episode."

566
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,963
She could have
gotten her meds wrong.

567
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:34,632
Could have had too much wine
after dinner.

568
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:36,133
Any one of which
can be confirmed

569
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,701
With a little bit
of follow-up.

570
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:39,136
Yeah.

571
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,638
And prove to the ghost
that it wasn't a curse,

572
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:43,307
And i can stop reading
my emails through
closed fingers.

573
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:45,543
What if we can't
confirm it?

574
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,344
What if we can't
find a reasonable
explanation?

575
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:49,146
I got back
to mail with stamps.

576
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:51,148
Shouldn't we be looking
for other explanations?

577
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:53,417
Like what?
like, there's a curse.

578
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,252
See, this is why
i think economics

579
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,088
Would have been
a better choice
of major for you

580
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:59,123
Than anthropology
of the occult.

581
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,358
Come on, you're gonna
tell me you've never
thought about it?

582
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,561
<i>you've read
the book of changes.</i>

583
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:04,929
Yeah, but only
in the bright sunlight

584
00:27:04,996 --> 00:27:06,564
With garlic and a cross
wrapped around my neck.

585
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,065
Because you know
there's more
out there

586
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,467
Than what you can
see with your eyes.

587
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,068
When i can hear it
with my ears, sure.

588
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:13,337
But, ned, come on,
you're not going
to convince me

589
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:15,506
That this email's
carrying some kind of spell.

590
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,641
'cause you don't
believe in anything
you can't see or hear.

591
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,677
I try not to.
yeah.

592
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:23,047
It's not really
an option for me.

593
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,483
I know ghosts
are real even though
i can't see them.

594
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,318
What's hard
for me to believe

595
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:30,387
Is that ghosts are
the only things out
there that i can't see.

how are you doing there?

I'm just checking in.

609
00:28:04,556 --> 00:28:06,357
Looks like i'm going
to be stuck here

610
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:07,491
For another couple of hours.

611
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,227
I wanted to tell you
something. it, uh,

612
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:13,731
Looks like that email chain
finally reached the hospital.

613
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:16,133
Two e.r. nurses,
dave in admitting,

614
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,736
And, well, actually me.

615
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:21,238
I'm thinking
you're probably
still with aiden.

616
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:23,007
Call me now, huh?

617
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:24,775
I won't do anything
till i hear from you.

618
00:28:24,843 --> 00:28:26,644
All right? bye.

Aiden?

623
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:50,134
Are you ok?

624
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,969
Did you have
a bad dream?

625
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:54,939
I don't know.
i don't remember.

626
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,340
Did you?

627
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:57,775
Kinda.

628
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,476
Do you need a hug?

629
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:01,212
Yeah.

00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:08,285
Oh.

632
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,639
[horn honking]
melinda: hey, aiden!

633
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,508
Your lunch.

634
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:22,243
Thanks!

635
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,011
Don't come
with me, mom.

636
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,980
I'm not. i'm just
gonna watch.

637
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,048
Love you guys.

638
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:29,450
Love you, too.
love you.

639
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:30,551
[chuckles]

640
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,220
God, he's so brave.

00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:33,888
[laughter]

642
00:29:33,956 --> 00:29:36,691
Hmm. it's because
he doesn't know
what you know.

643
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:38,559
And he doesn't remember
his dreams.

644
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,328
Hey, i'm so sorry
i wasn't here last night.

645
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:41,662
That sounded
like a bad one.

646
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,264
Yeah, it felt so real.

647
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:44,932
Yeah.

648
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,867
It feels pretty real
to gwen, too.

649
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,070
She gets a creepy,
threatening email,

650
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,738
She ignores
the warning
to forward it,

651
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,573
And wham,
car accident,
she's dead.

652
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,242
Her mother's hanging
by a thread.

653
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:56,577
Yeah, i'm starting
to wonder about
the power of that email.

654
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,312
How's an email
have power?

655
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,981
Well, if there's
a ghost attached to it.

656
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,649
The one who started
this whole thing,

657
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,652
The one's who's feeding off
the fear it spreads.

658
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
Wait, you're talking
about another ghost.

659
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,355
Sally stitch?

660
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,823
It would explain
my visions.

661
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,359
You know, i mean,
ned said that
hundreds of years ago,

662
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:13,928
There was this practice,
this punishment--

663
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,264
Wait, wait, you don't
believe that there
really was a girl

664
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,566
Who had her eyes
and mouth stitched shut

665
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:21,002
And now she's creating
chain emails

666
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,236
To do what?
spread the misery.

667
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,904
I mean, if you can
reach thousands

668
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,773
And millions of people
on the internet...

669
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,575
You can spread
some misery.

670
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:30,778
Wow. but now
the visions are
coming through aiden?

671
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:32,913
I think he was
channeling them to me.

672
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,815
I mean, they stopped
every time that he woke up.

673
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:37,652
Although, they originally
came from her.

674
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:41,188
All right.
so, you think
sally stitch

675
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,392
Caused the accident
that killed gwen
and hurt her mom?

676
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,061
The driver said
that she was staring at him,

677
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,063
Like she was in
some kind of trance.

678
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:51,232
Or if she was
blinded,

679
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,000
Like you were
in your vision.

680
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,369
Ok, see the wheels turning,
but what?

681
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,804
You see, this accident,
it always bothered me,

682
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:58,139
'cause it was
low impact.

683
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,141
But then how does gwen's
mother end up in a coma?

684
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,143
The doctors thought
the same thing, too,

685
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,011
And they sent her
to an m.r.i.

686
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,514
Yeah, so what
were they looking for?

687
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,949
To see if she'd
had a stroke.

688
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,718
I mean,
think about it.
it makes sense.

689
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,286
You said in your
vision you weren't
totally blinded,

690
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:13,454
You saw little
slivers of light?

691
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:14,622
What i saw
through the stitches.

692
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,157
That's what happens
to stroke victims.

693
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,292
Before it goes black,
they see these little
pin pricks of light.

694
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,460
You're brilliant!

695
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:20,795
No. i think
i'm probably wrong.

696
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:22,196
Yeah, but you're still
totally brilliant.

697
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,764
I'm gonna be late.
look, i'll call you

698
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:25,266
If i learn anything
from the hospital.

699
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:26,534
Great.

Hey. what's up?

701
00:31:27,703 --> 00:31:29,670
Ok, so we couldn't
convince the ghost

702
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:31,806
That an accident
was just that--
an accident.

703
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,574
Well, jim is close.

704
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,876
I'm proving
the email's a hoax
by locating its author.

705
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:38,713
Impossible,
right? a needle in
a gazillion haystacks?

706
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,614
Ah, i am sensing
triumph here.

707
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,616
I found it.
hey, i helped!

708
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:45,386
The creator of the email,
the evil mythical sally stitch,

709
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,754
We got a name.

710
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,723
J. miller.
hey!

711
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,257
Ok, well, is this
j. miller alive?

712
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,293
Not just alive, living.
and you'll never guess where.

713
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,496
Right here in grandview.

714
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,998
[siren]

715
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,533
Woman on p.a.:
dr. morris, dial--

716
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,202
Don't be
gender-biased here.

717
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:03,037
Male, female, j. miller
could be anyone.

718
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:04,772
Yeah, except
thankfully a ghost.

719
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,973
Did you ever think
it might be?

720
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,141
For a minute.

721
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,542
A brief, dark minute.

722
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,344
So we get double
brownie points

723
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,513
Finding a living,
non-ghost person
wrote this email?

724
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:14,482
Um, triple if this person
convinces gwen

725
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,417
There's no spell.
[beep]

726
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,786
Well, it may be
a moot point.

727
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,654
I can't access
the employee files.

728
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,990
Well, try harder.
this person works
here, or did.

729
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:24,792
They've got a hospital
email address.

730
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,961
Which would explain
how they knew gwen.

731
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,231
Brianna said they both
volunteered here
over spring break.

732
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:34,402
Uh, except the person
didn't actually work here.

733
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:37,304
Her name's julia miller,
and she was a patient.

734
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,806
Still is.

735
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,708
According to this,
she has a.m.l.,

736
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:42,877
An acute type
of leukemia.

737
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,846
Patient? why would
she have a hospital
email address?

738
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,515
Because she's lived here.

739
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:50,551
Her whole life.

740
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,993
Melinda:
she's just a child.

741
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,628
She really lives here.

742
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,329
Apparently,
the treatments

743
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,231
Make julia
vulnerable
to infection.

744
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,634
That's why
she couldn't leave.

745
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,169
Can you imagine
growing up here?

746
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,870
No, i can't.

747
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:12,239
Maybe that's why
she made up sally stitch--

748
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:13,707
A coping device.

749
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:16,010
A way for her to deal
with the creepiness
of this place.

750
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,344
She put a face to it.

751
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,014
Do you think she has
any idea what she started?

752
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:25,619
I'm going to go
look for her doctor,

753
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:27,455
See what else
i can find out.

754
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,692
I told you this would happen,
but you wouldn't listen.

755
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,327
What happened?
what's wrong?

756
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:35,162
You wouldn't do
what she wanted,

757
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,665
And now she's dying!
who's dying?

758
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,666
My mom.

759
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:40,100
Woman on p.a.:
trauma team to i.c.u.
on six west.

760
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:41,569
Oh, my god.

761
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:50,444
[monitor beeping]

762
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:52,580
Doctor: clear. clear!

763
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,852
[monitor beeping rapidly]
give me one milligram of epi.

764
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,620
[all talking at once]

765
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,134
Jim: hey.
hey, how is she?

766
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,502
Well, it was
touch and go.

767
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,004
But we got her
in the i.c.u.,
and she's stabilized.

768
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,273
Ok, so you were right.
i mean, did the m.r.i.
give any answers?

769
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,509
That's why i wanted
to meet you out here.

770
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,444
I'm really glad
you're helping
this woman, but--

771
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,847
I totally understand, ok?
and i really am grateful
that you're helping me.

772
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:49,848
***

773
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,554
[exhales]

774
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,856
There's a mass
on her brain stem.

775
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:56,326
Cancer?
most likely.

776
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,294
I mean, there's a chance
she might not have even
known she had it.

777
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,963
These things can go
undiagnosed forever.

778
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,598
Ok, so can it cause
a stroke?

779
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:03,566
Yeah, it can cause
like a seizure.

780
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,235
I mean, it's pretty
common with these
kinds of tumors.

781
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:07,904
And then the m.r.i.
showed recent bleeding
into the tumor.

782
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,307
Which would explain
the trance the other
driver described.

783
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,610
Gwen had no idea
about the tumor.

784
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:15,612
Her only explanation
was the email.

785
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,947
I gotta get to her
right away.

786
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,650
[thunder]

787
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,785
[monitor beeping]

788
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,571
[thunder]

789
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,145
Gwen: what
do you want?

790
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,381
I have to stay
with my mother.

791
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,318
Gwen, the email
didn't cause any of this.

792
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,353
Not on its own.

793
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:00,490
You're wrong.

794
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,759
Your mother isn't here
because she got hurt.

795
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:05,228
She's here
because she's sick.

796
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,863
That makes no sense.

797
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,431
She has a brain tumor.

798
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,400
That's what caused
the accident.

799
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,402
She wasn't hit
by a curse.

800
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:13,936
She had a seizure.

801
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,571
You don't know what
you're talking about.

802
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,839
My husband is a doctor here.

803
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,574
It's all true.
i know what happened.

804
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,443
She told me.
she warned me,

805
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,612
And i'm not letting mom
get hurt again.

806
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,014
Who is "she," your mother?

807
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,449
You see ghosts.

808
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,351
You'll find out.

809
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,019
Find out what?

810
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,221
[thunder]

811
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,632
No!

812
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,767
Please!

813
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,340
Gwen, i'm sorry.

814
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:52,008
No, it's not fair!

815
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,977
I did what i was
supposed to, i made
them all forward it!

816
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:59,949
Sweetheart,
you don't
understand.

817
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,718
Understand what?

818
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,820
She's right,
i've been sick.

819
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,758
No.

820
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,394
Mom, no.

821
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,796
I can't believe
you've been sick--

822
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,466
This sick,
and you never told me?

823
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:17,734
Oh...

824
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,244
I wanted to tell you
that night at dinner.

825
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:33,015
But we were having
such a nice time,

826
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,984
And you were so happy,

827
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,086
And i knew that when

828
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,256
I told you, we would
never have that again.

829
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,825
I can't believe this.

830
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,929
And i know you,
sweetheart.

831
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:49,165
I know you would
want to quit school

832
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,768
And do everything
you could to take
care of me.

833
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,870
To help me.

834
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,338
But no one
can help me.

835
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:59,575
And i needed you to
accept that and not
blame yourself.

836
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:04,147
You do blame yourself.

837
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:07,483
I hope now that you can
realize it's not your fault.

838
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,653
So she lied.

839
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,895
Oh, sweetheart,

840
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,230
None of it matters
anymore.

841
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,732
Because...

842
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,068
Because it's time
for us to go.

843
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,006
We can go in there?

844
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:33,876
We can be together?

845
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,978
Yes, sweetheart.

846
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,780
Forever.

847
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,952
Thank you.

848
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:45,655
Be careful.

849
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,890
I will.

850
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,591
Jim, we need to talk. - What?
Before she crossed over,

851
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,515
Gwen was talking
like she kept her
end of the bargain.

852
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,417
She said, "she lied,
she warned me,
she told me."

853
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,718
Who? her mother?

854
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,220
Well, that's what
i thought at first.

855
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:19,589
I mean, paula's
brain tumor would
explain the accident,

856
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:20,857
But not the visions,

857
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,425
Or the email,
for that matter.

858
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,127
Uh, you're losing me.

859
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,796
The little girl
that eli and i saw,

860
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,564
The one who
lives here
at the hospital,

861
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,900
She doesn't seem
like she'd start
a terror campaign.

862
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,335
Wait a minute, that's where
we're going with this?

863
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:33,503
Yeah, i want
to talk to her.

864
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,770
She can't be
in this alone.

865
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,506
[sighs] who's in there
with her?

866
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:37,707
Or what?

867
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:40,309
Gwen said,
"you see ghosts,
you'll find out."

868
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,582
Excuse me,
do you know

869
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,017
Who requested
no visitors?

870
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,619
Was it her parents,
a doctor?

871
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,921
She told her parents
she wants to be left alone.

872
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,823
Ah.

873
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,761
