1
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:09,032
No, not you!

2
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:10,944
No. No. No.

3
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:11,993
Oh, please, not you.

4
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,167
No, i'm here, and i'm
not goin' anywhere.

5
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:19,667
You can't stay.

6
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,801
You know that. You have to cross over.

7
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,300
Jim, no!

8
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,334
Jim, it's you... y-You're back.

9
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:33,767
Do i know you?

10
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:18,801
I know that you did
this to stay with me.

11
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,734
I can't be mad at that.

12
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,601
But you could have gone into the light.

13
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,000
I would have missed you...

14
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:32,767
But at least i would
have known where you are.

15
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you hear me inside there, jim?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,334
Please...

17
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:45,234
Give me a sign if you can hear me.

18
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,133
Hey.

19
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:06,968
Hey.

20
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:10,501
What the heck happened to me?

21
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:12,667
It's a long story.

22
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,534
What do you remember?

23
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,534
I remember you.

24
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,133
You do?

25
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,868
Yeah.

26
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,467
How could i not?

27
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,968
You're here every time i wake up.

28
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:39,334
And?

29
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,133
What more is there?

30
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,934
I mean, i barely know you,

31
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:45,501
But you're here more
than anybody else i know.

32
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,667
Or knew.

33
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,267
He only game to grandview

34
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,901
A few months ago for work,

35
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,267
So he has no friends here to speak of,

36
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,434
And his family's far
away, michigan, i think.

37
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:57,267
So who does everybody think melinda is?

38
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,601
He's an architect, so
melinda's been telling people

39
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,634
She hired him to remodel her garage.

40
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:02,801
And they bought that?

41
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,334
Hey, as long as the guy
doesn't have any memory,

42
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,067
Who's to say it's not true, right?

43
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,167
You should get a few more days rest.

44
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,033
Melinda thinks that jim's soul

45
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,467
Just magically went into this guy?

46
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,334
She says that when sam died,

47
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,968
His spirit went into the light,

48
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,868
And jim's spirit took its place somehow.

49
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,367
Melinda says she's seen it before.

50
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,601
It's called a step-In.

51
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,767
When is she planning on
telling him all of this?

52
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,400
As soon as he remembers
who she is to him.

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,267
She's afraid if she tells him now,

54
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,501
He'll think she's insane.

55
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:35,501
This has got to be one
of the stages of grief,

56
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,367
Eh, just melinda-Style, right?

57
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,033
You wanna look through your stuff again?

58
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,000
The doctor says that...

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,901
Right. The amnesia therapy, huh?

60
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,067
Here.

61
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:50,234
Oh. How sick do you have to be

62
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,767
To not even remember your own face, huh?

63
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,767
You're not sick.

64
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,400
There's no brain damage.

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
You're just temporarily...

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,868
Wait a minute. Right here it says

67
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:02,334
I have an appointment with
jordan, whoever that is, tomorrow.

68
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:05,934
You want me to keep
the appointment for you,

69
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,767
Find out? Sure.

70
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,400
Why are you so nice to me?

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,701
I mean, i'm just a guy you
hired to do a job, right?

72
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,567
But you've been here
every day since i woke up.

73
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,767
Let's just say i knew someone like you

74
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,601
Who was there for me once.

75
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,400
Hey.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,634
What are you guys doing here?

77
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:36,567
What, your friends can't come
and take you out for a nice meal?

78
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,734
Oh, that's... that's nice,

79
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,934
But i'm just gonna turn in.

80
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,200
So rain check?

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Sure.

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,934
Ok.

83
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,834
How long are we gonna
pretend this is ok?

84
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,434
Jordan?

85
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:23,634
Yeah.

86
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,767
Who are you?

87
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,667
Hi.

88
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:31,033
I'm melinda. I'm a friend of sam's.

89
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,834
Where is he? Is he ok?

90
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah. He's fine.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,234
Thank god.

92
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,567
So worried when he didn't
come home last night.

93
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:20,334
Are you... are you sam's girlfriend?

94
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,301
No.

95
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:24,568
God, no. I...

96
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm his sister.

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,267
How do you know sam anyway?

98
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,601
Through his work.

99
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,934
Look, the reason that i'm here

100
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,568
Is there was an accident.

101
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:36,000
He wasn't hurt too badly, but
he's still in the hospital.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What happened?

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
We should go see him,

104
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Talk to the doctors, let them explain.

105
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,634
Ok.

106
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,733
She's staying in his apartment

107
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,000
Until she can get one of her own

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,967
And a job.

109
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,534
He was supposed to meet her

110
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,601
To help apply for a cellphone.

111
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:55,067
I'm so glad you're all right! I'm fine.

112
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,900
Am i a terrible person?

113
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,401
Why?

114
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,334
I'm relieved that he
didn't recognize her,

115
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,534
Because if he did, he might not be jim.

116
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:06,900
Might not be?

117
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Look, i see the same guy that you see,

118
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,167
Different hair, nose,
eyes. It's not jim.

119
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,067
But the day of the accident,

120
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,601
I saw jim's ghost step into sam's body,

121
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,434
And ever since then, he
hasn't appeared to me.

122
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,067
He's gone.

123
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,534
I just know what i see when i look

124
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,167
In those eyes, and jim...

125
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,767
Is in there somewhere.

126
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,201
Do you need anything
before i go? I'm all right.

127
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,167
He just has to be.

128
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:36,767
Paging dr. Becker, paging dr. Becker.

129
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:41,767
He doesn't remember me.

130
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:45,434
Not my name, not my face.

131
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:48,267
It's one stupid thing, he...

132
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,100
He remembers the smell of my shampoo.

133
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,334
He remembers your shampoo?

134
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,201
It's the same almond-Scented
stuff i've always used.

135
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:01,967
He used to tease me
about it relentlessly.

136
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:02,934
Really?

137
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:04,833
How long do you think it'll take

138
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,700
Before he remembers the rest?

139
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,767
Never! That's when.

140
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,267
What?

141
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,767
Nothing. Sure it's nothing at all.

142
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, can you get me that box,

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,301
The one that says "sports"?

144
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,767
You ok?

145
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,167
Yeah. Sure.

146
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,833
How's the guy doin',

147
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,501
The one in the hospital?

148
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:40,301
He died in an accident.

149
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,434
Then he...

150
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:47,134
Was revived when jim's
spirit stepped into his body.

151
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,100
His name was sam.

152
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,634
Is... is sam.

153
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,201
Is he remembering stuff yet?

154
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,867
I don't know. I...

155
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,201
He seems to remember me a little,

156
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,067
But then there's other times...

157
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:03,034
What?

158
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, all of a sudden,

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,401
He likes different foods

160
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,401
Than jim used to, and he can remember

161
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,100
The smell of his sister's shampoo.

162
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,401
Eli says that it's
like a physical thing,

163
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,134
Like some sort of muscle memory,

164
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,367
But if it is jim,

165
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,100
How does he recognize sam...

166
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:22,934
What?

167
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,034
You don't have to stop on my account.

168
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,134
You know, actually you
guys have done so much,

169
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,334
I think i'm good here, so...

170
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,067
I didn't know you had practice today.

171
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:01,700
I thought your shooting
clinic was on mondays.

172
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,034
It's jim's.

173
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:06,434
Do you think it's ok if i
take it instead of donating it?

174
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,201
Yeah.

175
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,668
Of course, honey.

176
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,234
I know you miss him, ned.

177
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:20,301
Melinda told me that you
would play pickup games

178
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,167
With jim practically every weekend.

179
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:28,134
I know we're lucky to
have each other, mom...

180
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:30,100
But sometimes...

181
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,634
Jim was like a dad to you.

182
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,700
I know.

183
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,733
I want you to know

184
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:42,800
That i was happy that you
felt that way about him.

185
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,134
It's ok to be sad, ned.

186
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,501
We all are.

187
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,434
I know.

188
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:56,967
We just all deal with
it in different ways.

189
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,034
Yeah.

190
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,601
Who are you?

191
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,301
What do you want?

192
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,401
You were at the hospital.

193
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,267
You've been following me.

194
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,634
Just tell me what you
want, or i can't help you.

195
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:29,301
The two of you, you're both thieves.

196
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,134
But you won't get to
keep what you've stolen.

197
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:34,634
What have i stolen?

198
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,134
You know perfectly well.

199
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,733
Where did sam go?

200
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:43,867
He was checked out last night.

201
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,067
By who?

202
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,733
I don't know. Maybe if you ask...

203
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,833
Yes?

204
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,467
Hi. My name is melinda
gordon. I'm a friend of sam's.

205
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,767
A client, actually, and
i went to the hospital,

206
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,367
And they told me that
he was on his way...

207
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:02,367
Home. That's right.

208
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:05,067
I'm nancy lucas, sam's mother,

209
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,000
And this is my husband gerald.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,668
Mom and dad.

211
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,601
W-Well, that... that's great

212
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,900
That they... that
they finally found you.

213
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,934
It was so kind of you to look after
sam while he was in the hospital,

214
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,934
But you don't have to be
concerned about him now.

215
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:21,167
His family's here, and we're
gonna be taking him home.

216
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,634
Isn't this his home?

217
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:28,134
Well, sam doesn't even
know his own mother,

218
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,534
But luckily his mother knows him.

219
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:33,534
He'll be coming home with us
until he can find himself again.

220
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:36,434
With you?

221
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,568
Mmm. You're gonna have
to find somebody else

222
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:39,967
To do your blueprints, i'm afraid.

223
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,267
He won't be much help
to you 800 miles away.

224
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,634
Now, if you'll excuse us.

225
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:55,000
The ghost seemed pretty
bent out of shape.

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,568
He kept calling us thieves and saying

227
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,634
That we would never get
to keep what we've stolen.

228
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,733
Hey, was the ghost a
guy in his late thirties,

229
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:01,767
Kind of a high forehead?

230
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,134
Sounds like him. Why?

231
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,234
Alan walters...

232
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:08,201
The driver who caused the accident,

233
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,467
Died on the scene.

234
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,467
So i'm not crazy. That's good news.

235
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,634
Good news? The guy kind of died.

236
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:13,934
No, it's not good news that he's dead,

237
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,134
But that he was a witness.

238
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:16,900
To the accident? To
what happened afterwards.

239
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,733
If he was there, he saw what jim did.

240
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,000
That's why he's calling us thieves,

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,634
'Cause he saw jim go into sam's body.

242
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,634
So good news that you are thieves.

243
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,967
No. Sam went into the
light. That i'm sure of,

244
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,100
But this alan guy, he
must not have noticed.

245
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,601
Why didn't you notice him?

246
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,000
I was a little distracted.

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,634
The important thing is is that
the reason he's haunting me

248
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,401
Is because he knows that jim did.

249
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:37,634
Melinda, i've been in some
very strange bookstores,

250
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,800
Which is why my clothes
stink of patchouli,

251
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,267
And read some very interesting things
on this whole step-In phenomenon.

252
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:44,601
First of all, it tends to be permanent.

253
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:45,934
And second?

254
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,134
Supposedly it's like reincarnation.

255
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:48,201
No. Reincarnation happens at birth.

256
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,301
I've already dealt with that.

257
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,434
Of course you have,

258
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:52,767
But the book says that in both cases,

259
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,967
Memories of past lives are usually lost.

260
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,467
You gotta wonder how
much of the jim you know

261
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,467
Is in the sam that you don't.

262
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,900
If you take him home, the first thing

263
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,800
He's gonna do is remember
how much he hates you.

264
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,601
The doctors said he should
be in familiar surroundings

265
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:09,833
To help him remember who he is.

266
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,334
You mean who you want him to be.

267
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:12,634
You're just upset because he can't

268
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,401
Remember he promised to
let you freeload off of him.

269
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,833
At least he offered to take me in,

270
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,967
Unlike you two, who just kicked me out.

271
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,501
We did not kick you out.

272
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:21,733
We told you that if you
dropped out of college,

273
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:22,800
You'd have to pay rent.

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,401
If you wanted to
continue living at home.

275
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh, i'm not sure
"wanted" is a good word.

276
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,401
It's not like i had a
whole lot of options.

277
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,700
You make your own options.

278
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,568
What are you, a fortune cookie?

279
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,301
I remember something.

280
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:39,134
Oh, sam, that's wonderful.

281
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,401
You see? Having us
around is helping already.

282
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:44,501
What is it, dear?

283
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,534
Coffee.

284
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:47,700
Anybody make any?

285
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:54,034
We were just, talking about
fixing up your old room.

286
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,700
How old am i?

287
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,367
Look at you guys.

288
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,100
This is like a dream
come true for you...

289
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,668
A chance to control him all over again.

290
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:02,867
That's enough, jordan.

291
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:05,501
Look, maybe i-I'll take
a shower first and then...

292
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,568
Sure, and then we'll have some coffee,

293
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,267
And we'll talk about your future.

294
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,767
Right. Something to look forward to.

295
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,668
Puttin' together a memory book?

296
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:41,568
Yeah, kind of.

297
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:43,501
Is it for you...

298
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:44,934
Or for him?

299
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,267
Both, i guess.

300
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,367
I... i was kind of
hoping that maybe jim...

301
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,601
Sam would see it and
it would jog something.

302
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,501
I know you think i'm out of my mind,

303
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,601
But i'm not.

304
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,668
No, i didn't suggest for one...

305
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,167
Hi.

306
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,100
Excuse me. I'm sorry i came,

307
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,267
Straight to your store, but the
hospital gave me your address.

308
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,267
No, it's fine, really.

309
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,634
Good. Because i'm...

310
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,434
Wait a minute.

311
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:13,568
I know you.

312
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,267
You do? Really?

313
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,967
No. You came to the
hospital, didn't you?

314
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:20,134
Yes, but i don't think we actually met.

315
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:21,434
I'm... i'm delia.

316
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,534
I'm sam. Hi.

317
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,234
Well, so they tell me.

318
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,301
Look, i don't know much
about brain functions,

319
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:29,833
But i know i'm not
gonna get my memory back

320
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,434
Unless i relax, and right
now, my family is imploding,

321
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,034
And you're the only person i know

322
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,034
Who's not desperate for me to remember
them, so are you busy right now?

323
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,700
Not... not really.

324
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,800
I went to the deli and
got a couple sandwiches.

325
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,167
You wanna go somewhere?

326
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,034
I got it covered.

327
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,267
Thanks.

328
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,000
Why stop at one?

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,934
I mean, we could... we could
have a whole house full of kids.

330
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:08,134
It would be fun raising them, i think.

331
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,900
It'd be even more fun making them.

332
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:14,301
Don't... don't press your luck.

333
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:22,167
Well, it's like on the one hand,

334
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,867
Sure, i'd like to
remember who the hell i am,

335
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:28,167
But on the other, i don't remember
what it's like to remember,

336
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,568
So i don't feel like i'm missin' much.

337
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,034
I lost you, didn't i?

338
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:36,267
No.

339
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,034
No, sorry. I... i was just...

340
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:39,267
Thinking about something.

341
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,267
A memory, huh? Showoff.

342
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:48,434
Does anything look familiar to you?

343
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,534
I'm afraid not.

344
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:56,467
But honestly, after the way
my family was goin' at it,

345
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,201
Amnesia is my new best friend.

346
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,967
What do you mean?

347
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,900
I mean that from the
looks of it, my old life,

348
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,434
Maybe it's good riddance, you know?

349
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:07,167
Maybe it's better i let
it go and start over again.

350
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:10,501
Yeah, or maybe your old life
wasn't as bad as it seems.

351
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,067
You know somethin' about it i don't?

352
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,800
Look, the truth is

353
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,934
I actually feel at peace right now.

354
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:20,401
I mean, i know i had
problems in my old life,

355
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,733
But suddenly, fwoof, they're all gone.

356
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,800
Is it wrong not to want them back?

357
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,501
I... i think you should...

358
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,967
Do whatever feels right.

359
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,334
Trust your instincts.

360
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,867
Yeah.

361
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:35,733
I still have no idea
why you're so nice to me.

362
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,934
I know. I must have done a
spectacular job on that garage.

363
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,134
Yeah. Heh.

364
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,833
Wait a minute. Could you do that again?

365
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,668
Could you just laugh, 'cause...

366
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,900
That sounded familiar.

367
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,301
What do you say i conk you on the head,

368
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,301
And then you can forget
your worries, too?

369
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:00,634
'Cause then we could just
sit here and enjoy this...

370
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,568
Glorious, oblivious afternoon together.

371
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,934
Yeah.

372
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,434
That sounds good.

373
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,867
Really good.

374
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,501
How do you like seeing
a stranger in the mirror?

375
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,700
I know who you are, alan.

376
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,267
I know about your wife and your son.

377
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,767
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you.

378
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,234
I can help you. It's what i do.

379
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,767
Same way you helped when
your husband stole sam's body?

380
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,301
Jim didn't steal anything.

381
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,767
He stole that family's
chance to mourn their son.

382
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:56,301
Thanks to your jim, they will
never believe that sam is dead.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,134
Right after the accident,
i saw the light, too.

384
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,833
I watched sam go into it,

385
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,201
Almost followed him.

386
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,934
Why didn't you?

387
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,833
'Cause that accident that
we had, it was my fault.

388
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,267
I didn't deserve to go
into the light, not yet.

389
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:14,668
When i saw your husband
take over sam's body,

390
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:16,100
I knew what my purpose was.

391
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,601
I saw how i had to
make things right. How?

392
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,201
By making sure they know the truth.

393
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,534
Who, his family?

394
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:23,501
All of them.

395
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,134
They need to know what you did

396
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:26,434
So they all can move on.

397
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,034
What if i think they're
better off not knowing?

398
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,867
Then you are lying to yourself, too!

399
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,800
And i will make sure they know the truth

400
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,100
If i have to stay here the
rest of your miserable life.

401
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:49,268
Hey. Sorry. I was about to knock.

402
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:52,467
No. No, i... it's... i'm
sorry. It's just i'm...

403
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,500
Little jumpy. It's ok. What happened?

404
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,134
A tree branch broke my bedroom window.

405
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,001
Hey, l-Let me.

406
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,034
All right.

407
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,867
Recycling, right? Ok.

408
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,067
Thank you.

409
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,567
I think i remember how to
replace a pane of glass.

410
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,167
That's ok. You don't have to do that.

411
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,533
Well, i gotta do something.

412
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:17,867
I mean, everybody tells me
to get back to my old routine.

413
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,667
I went back to work this morning.

414
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:23,201
You can imagine how much i
remember about architecture

415
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,901
And then subtract a lot.

416
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:25,867
Sorry.

417
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,901
Maybe my parents were right.

418
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:28,667
Maybe i should go back with them.

419
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,001
At least i'd have a roof over my head.

420
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,101
Wh-What about your apartment?

421
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,301
Ah. The lease is up,

422
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:34,834
And they want a 6-Month renewal.

423
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,667
No income, no job...

424
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,500
There's not a whole lot keepin' me here.

425
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,001
You know, if...

426
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:47,034
If you remember how to fix glass...

427
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:48,867
What about carpentry?

428
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,567
Measure twice, cut one. Sure.

429
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:53,700
It's not much, but maybe

430
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
You could help me finish my garage.

431
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,500
Well, that's very generous,

432
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,667
But i don't think it'll cover my rent.

433
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,767
There's plumbing and a fridge,

434
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,067
And you could live there
while you do the work.

435
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:06,700
You know, just until you...

436
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
Figure out your next move.

437
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,800
Heh. Well...

438
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,667
Maybe i found something to keep me here.

439
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:23,034
Sorry i'm late. I just had to
go over some things with sam.

440
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,667
He's decided to stay in town.

441
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,334
Oh, really? Wh-What's he gonna do?

442
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:28,567
You know, this, that,

443
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,634
Just until he gets back on his feet.

444
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,901
So that's great, but...

445
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,800
Why are you trying to keep our son here?

446
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,034
Because i wanna help,
and because he's...

447
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,567
He's not your responsibility.
We're his parents.

448
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,734
You have no right to
tell him what to do.

449
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,268
I didn't. I just made him an offer.

450
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:46,967
To be your live-In handyman?

451
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:51,234
That's... you know what? I
understand how hard this is.

452
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,167
Don't stand there and
tell us you understand

453
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,167
When you can't possibly.

454
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,834
He needs to be in familiar surroundings

455
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,734
With people who'll
love him and embrace him

456
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,934
No matter how much of
his memory he recovers.

457
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:02,800
I want the same thing
for him that you do.

458
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,600
I just think he should be
able to decide how to find it.

459
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,433
Thank you for your professional opinion.

460
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,067
He's coming home with us.

461
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:42,500
All right, sam.

462
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,034
Let's see what you got.

463
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,368
Great. That's what i remember.

464
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:28,034
"Grandview...paramedic jim clancy
was shot and killed last night.

465
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:32,567
"Clancy is survived by his wife...

466
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,867
Melinda gordon."

467
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,268
Hi.

468
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,600
Am i too early?

469
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
No, not at all.

470
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,101
Let me just go open
up the garage for you.

471
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:49,301
Would you mind if i had
a little coffee first?

472
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,001
Sure. Milk, no sugar?

473
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,567
Black's fine.

474
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:53,867
Thanks.

475
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:58,634
Melinda, look...

476
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,734
Everybody's walkin'
on eggshells around me,

477
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:02,734
And i can't blame them, but...

478
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,167
I really need some honesty right now.

479
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,634
Are you asking me a question?

480
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:13,567
You hired me to do the
remodel of your garage, but...

481
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,634
I'm startin' to get the weird feeling

482
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:19,600
That there's a lot more to it.

483
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:21,767
What is it?

484
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,700
It's just...

485
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:26,667
That's your husband, right?

486
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:34,500
You know, you'd think
i'd recognize his face.

487
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,034
Why would you say that?

488
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:41,901
Well, he must have been
around when i started the job.

489
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,934
Before he died, i mean.

490
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,067
You know about that?

491
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:48,101
Yeah. I read about it in the paper.

492
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:50,234
I'm monopolizing your time.

493
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,201
I'm yammering on and on.

494
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:54,034
You just lost a husband.

495
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:57,567
Why didn't you tell me?

496
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,467
You had enough on your plate.

497
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,034
You don't?

498
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,867
Look, there's something
i have to tell you,

499
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,767
And it's not gonna be easy
for me or for you, i'm sure.

500
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,301
Do you have an open mind?

501
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,467
More like an empty one, but...

502
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,167
Do you believe in the afterlife?

503
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,967
Heaven or ghosts?

504
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,667
Both.

505
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:25,201
What about stuff like reincarnation?

506
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:28,767
Like respect cows because
they might be your ancestors?

507
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:30,334
Sort of.

508
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,600
My husband just died,

509
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,800
And you just had a
brush with death also.

510
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,467
Heh. Wait, you're not
gonna tell me you think

511
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,700
I'm your husband reincarnated,

512
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,268
Because...

513
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:48,134
You're the only sane person
i've met since i woke up.

514
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:51,400
No.

515
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:55,934
No, of course not. I... i just...

516
00:26:55,934 --> 00:27:00,301
I just thought maybe you'd be able
to understand what he went through

517
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:01,934
Since you just kind of died yourself,

518
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:04,500
And i just need to know
he's ok wherever he is.

519
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,934
Whatever.

520
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,501
Ah, your high school yearbook.

521
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:30,868
Oh, my god. You were such a geek.

522
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,367
You know, jordan,

523
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,100
You've been playing the remember
when game for about an hour now,

524
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,934
And i'm kind of getting
the sneaking suspicion

525
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,767
That you're trying to get me to remember

526
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,834
When i said that i'd
lend you some money.

527
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,701
Wow. Major buzzkill.

528
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,334
No, really, i...

529
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh, there you are.

530
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,901
Where have you been?

531
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,067
I started work again.

532
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,267
Oh. For that woman?

533
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:54,267
Whose name is melinda, yes.

534
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,267
Oh, listen, sweetheart,

535
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,300
We wanted to talk to you about this.

536
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,767
Look, i just wanna do
what feels right now.

537
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,267
All of your doctors agree
you need to come home.

538
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:05,267
What i need is for you to stop
pressuring me. I know you mean well...

539
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,367
You're coming home with us now.

540
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,033
We've already bought your ticket.

541
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,234
It's nonrefundable.

542
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,734
Good, because i'm not going.

543
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,801
Finally, the sam i know.

544
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,267
But you should go.

545
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:17,434
Excuse me?

546
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,634
Look, i need to decide my own future.

547
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,868
I... i know that, and i'm ready for it,

548
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,167
Whether i get my past back or not,

549
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,167
But, jordan, you're barely 20 years old,

550
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,968
And you're acting a lot less.

551
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:29,601
You're not ready to
take care of yourself.

552
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:32,033
Do you have any idea how
much you sound just like them?

553
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:35,167
You know, you told me how
much i hated these people.

554
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,167
Yeah.

555
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,467
Sorry. No offense.

556
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,467
But... but to me, they seem like
they genuinely care about us.

557
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:45,033
If i can forget why i
was so angry at them,

558
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,000
Why can't you?

559
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,734
Hello! You lost your memory.

560
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,767
Well, maybe you should, too.

561
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:53,634
Jordan.

562
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:54,634
Jordan.

563
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:56,634
No. Sam, wait.

564
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,300
Don't you run away, too, please.

565
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,200
What's left of my mind is made up.

566
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,367
You're here early.

567
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:18,000
Hey, whatever's wrong,

568
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,701
You don't have to hide it from me.

569
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,601
Trust me,

570
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:25,501
It's not anything you wanna hear about.

571
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,834
Melinda, you gotta
stop thinking like that.

572
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,601
I'm your friend,

573
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,367
And i love you.

574
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,200
I just...

575
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,834
I couldn't lie anymore...

576
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:43,300
So i started to tell sam the truth.

577
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:47,934
Jim...

578
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:51,200
He never doubted anything i told him.

579
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,734
But sam...

580
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,868
You should have seen
the look on his face.

581
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:58,734
It's like i told him i
was abducted by aliens.

582
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,501
I'm so sorry.

583
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:06,033
I know this is probably the
worst pain you have ever felt.

584
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:08,868
What do i do?

585
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,868
You get angry. That's what.

586
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:15,667
You gotta curse the universe
and break some stuff.

587
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:18,367
Breaking stuff, that sounds great.

588
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:21,000
It's the next stage after denial.

589
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,834
Denial?

590
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,701
The stages of grief.

591
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,067
You're just going through
what we all went through,

592
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:32,601
What i went through with charlie.

593
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:35,033
Some people call it denial.

594
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,701
Some call it magical thinking.

595
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:41,434
Whatever it is, it's...
it's completely normal.

596
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,234
Normal...

597
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,167
But not real.

598
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,300
Unfortunately, no.

599
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:50,400
Do you remember jim's funeral...

600
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,734
When everybody started to dance

601
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,601
And i told you afterwards
that jim had made that happen

602
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,167
And you said you believed it?

603
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,634
You said that you could
feel him there, too.

604
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,267
That was different.

605
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,234
That's what you always do.

606
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,334
You talk to ghosts or whatever it is,

607
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,901
And you make people's lives better.

608
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,033
Well, how is it different this time?

609
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:13,167
It's different, because
you aren't helping anyone.

610
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,667
You're not helping sam,

611
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,334
You're not helping his family,

612
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:19,434
And you are definitely
not helping yourself.

613
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:21,167
The last conscious
decision my husband made

614
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:23,400
Was to risk everything
just to be with me.

615
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,634
I am not gonna turn my back on that.

616
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,601
That's great.

617
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,734
Believe he is out there somewhere.

618
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:31,701
You are not listening to me, as usual.

619
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:33,701
As usual?

620
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:35,000
I know it's bizarre.

621
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,133
All right, it's even
hard for me to believe,

622
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,100
But it's what happened.

623
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,033
Jim is not just "out there somewhere."

624
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,767
He's here, in this man's body.

625
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,601
Melinda... no, he took a chance

626
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,901
Out of love and out of loyalty

627
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,868
For the one person who
meant everything to him,

628
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,000
Even though he knows it
doesn't make any sense.

629
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:56,400
That is what love is,

630
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,501
In case you're unsure.

631
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,634
So there's no middle ground?

632
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:05,033
I have to check my
common sense at the door,

633
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,868
Or we can't be friends?

634
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,200
Hey.

635
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,400
What's wrong?

636
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,300
Rough day.

637
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
Me, too.

638
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,868
You moving in?

639
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:53,567
What's wrong?

640
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,400
Well, look, i been thinkin' about this.

641
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,734
You've been amazingly supportive.

642
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,167
But it's just weird.

643
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:01,100
I mean, i don't even know you,

644
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,968
And suddenly i'm movin' into your place.

645
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:05,267
And then what's even weirder is...

646
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:08,033
I mean, how i feel when we're together.

647
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,467
It's ok.

648
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,300
Ah, is it?

649
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:16,701
Heh. The point is...

650
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,934
No matter how painful
this whole thing has been,

651
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,901
I've been given a second chance,

652
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:24,467
And i realized that last
night when i stood up

653
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:25,767
To my parents and my sister.

654
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:27,734
Ok. So, take your time.

655
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:31,634
Do whatever it is that you need
to do to get your memory back.

656
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,033
I don't know if i want to get it back.

657
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,234
Look, i don't know if the guy i was

658
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:42,934
Is the kind of guy i wanna be.

659
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,100
What kind of guy is that?

660
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,567
The kind that has an
affair with a married woman.

661
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,801
Tell him.

662
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,100
You deserve an explanation.

663
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
He deserves the truth.

664
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,834
But all i can give you right now

665
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:11,601
Is that i would have never
cheated on my husband, ever.

666
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,601
Will you tell me what
is goin' on between us?

667
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,133
'Cause i'm confused,

668
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,868
And whenever i'm around
you, i can't think straight.

669
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:21,868
Because i feel so familiar?

670
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:24,234
That's part of it.

671
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:26,167
Do i feel like a friend?

672
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,901
At least.

673
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,067
That you can trust?

674
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,667
I think so.

675
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:35,767
Then trust me.

676
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,267
I just don't know if i can trust myself.

677
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:44,133
Sam, look...

678
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,334
Look, thank you for helping me, ok?

679
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,300
Thank you, but i think
we're better off if...

680
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,501
Maybe i just go away, huh?

681
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,100
Go?

682
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,734
Where?

683
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,734
I guess i'll know when i get there.

684
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,467
Oh, melinda.

685
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,900
Is she here? Where's sam?

686
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,334
Where did you send him?

687
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:24,034
I don't know. Oh, terrific.

688
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,568
The boy can't remember a damn thing,

689
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,100
And now he's out wandering all alone.

690
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,900
Do you really think
that's what he needs?

691
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,800
No. Actually, i wanted him to stay.

692
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,601
Well, what are we supposed to do now?

693
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:35,601
I have no idea.

694
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,100
But if he ever gives
you a second chance,

695
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,134
I hope you don't blow it
like you did the first time.

696
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:40,534
I beg your pardon?

697
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:41,967
I know what it's like to lose someone

698
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,367
And to not know if it's for good.

699
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:47,067
I know that impulse to do
everything humanly possible

700
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,934
Just to get them back.

701
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:51,367
Sometimes impulses are wrong.

702
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,067
Are you a parent? No,

703
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,234
And i'm not a doctor either,

704
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,501
But believe me when i
say that you have to start

705
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,167
Preparing yourself for
the fact that your son

706
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,501
May never remember who he was.

707
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,668
Look, ms. Gordon...

708
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:03,067
And you should be grateful
for that. You know why?

709
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,568
Because you'll actually have a son.

710
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:08,167
At some point, he's
gonna need his family,

711
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,367
And he will call,

712
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,501
But all he's gonna
remember is who you are now,

713
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,668
So wouldn't you want
that to be a good thing?

714
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,167
What is that supposed to mean, exactly?

715
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,434
You've held on to your children

716
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:18,401
So tight that you've lost them both.

717
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:22,301
But there's still time
to maybe get them back,

718
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:25,134
But not if you keep
making the same mistakes.

719
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,800
Hey. Where are you?

720
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,267
At the cafe, doing homework.

721
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:36,034
Oh. I thought i'd surprise you

722
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:37,334
And stop by and take you out

723
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:38,867
For something to eat,
but you're not here.

724
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,034
Where? At the courts.

725
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,767
Isn't your shooting clinic on mondays?

726
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:45,100
Ok, promise you won't get mad.

727
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,900
Well, i promise i will if
you don't start talkin'.

728
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,700
Mom, there's no shooting
clinic on mondays.

729
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,134
What?

730
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:54,900
I used to meet jim there
on mondays to practice,

731
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
But i didn't tell you
it was just him and me,

732
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,100
Because i was afraid if you knew,

733
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,401
You'd make me come and
work at the store instead.

734
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:02,201
Ned, i wish you would have...

735
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,668
Mom, please don't be mad.

736
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,301
I'm not mad. I'm ju...

737
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,767
I have to call you back.

738
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:35,867
Sam?

739
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,100
Hey. Delia, right?

740
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,634
What are you doin' here?

741
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:50,767
Heh. Promise not to laugh?

742
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,934
I have no idea.

743
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:57,034
I was drivin' out of town.

744
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,000
I was leaving...

745
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,201
And then suddenly i got this feeling

746
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,467
That i was supposed to be somewhere,

747
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,833
Somewhere important.

748
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,900
So i just came here.

749
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:12,267
Weird, isn't it? Heh.

750
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:14,867
Yeah. You could say that.

751
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:17,534
I was hoping someone
would recognize me...

752
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:21,067
They could tell me why i had to be here.

753
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,733
It's really you.

754
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,000
Sorry?

755
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:33,733
I think you could be right.

756
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:36,668
I think you are
supposed to be somewhere.

757
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:39,867
Where?

758
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,534
You tried.

759
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:56,067
I will never forget that.

760
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:07,100
If you never forgive
me, i will understand,

761
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,501
But i couldn't just sit
around and do nothing

762
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,934
When this whole thing
was ready to blow away.

763
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:12,067
What whole thing? What
are you talking about?

764
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,568
You and jim, your future together,

765
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,601
Your whole everything.

766
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:15,800
Are you drunk?

767
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,767
No, there is no time to explain, mel.

768
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:18,733
He's outside.

769
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,100
Who? Jim.

770
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,967
I mean sam... jim... sam...

771
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:22,967
Whatever the hell his name is.

772
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,401
But i convinced him to come back

773
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,434
And talk to you, but you have to

774
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:26,467
Figure out what to do next.

775
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:27,733
Where did you?

776
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,568
He was on the basketball
court on the way out of town.

777
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,034
I saw him, i stopped,
and i convinced him

778
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,301
To come back and talk to you.

779
00:39:32,301 --> 00:39:33,967
Why did you?

780
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,568
Because he was waiting for ned,

781
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:39,634
And i finally understood.

782
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,201
What?

783
00:39:44,234 --> 00:39:45,634
That i was wrong.

784
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,501
Ok? About pretty much everything.

785
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:51,700
And i know that we are gonna talk
about this endlessly in the future,

786
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,467
But right now, you have to go outside

787
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,201
And make sure that jim does
not get back on that road

788
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,867
And go out of town.

789
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:01,134
You keep calling him jim.

790
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,634
That's who he is, isn't he?

791
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:09,034
Ok. Stop. Go.

792
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,401
It's ok.

793
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:12,234
Got my best friend back.

794
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:17,467
Ok, quit your blubbering.

795
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:18,467
You made me blubber.

796
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:20,034
Oh, wait a sec.

797
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,568
Delia.

798
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:22,634
There's a stain on it.

799
00:40:22,634 --> 00:40:24,167
You gotta really be presentable.

800
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,867
You got any lip gloss?

801
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,467
No, if it's jim, i don't need lip gloss.

802
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,267
Do you know how lucky you are?

803
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:34,833
You are gonna get a second
shot at your one true love.

804
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,367
Ok. Go.

805
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:39,767
Go, go, go.

806
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:40,934
Ok.

807
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,867
Hi.

808
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,467
Hey.

809
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:52,733
You're back.

810
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:55,534
I apologize for before.

811
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:57,601
I got a little overdramatic.

812
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:58,668
It's ok. I don't...

813
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:01,167
I mean, if i'm on
some search to find out

814
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,501
What feels right in my life, you know,

815
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:05,367
What places and what people,

816
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:06,700
You know, i should take baby steps.

817
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,634
I should start at square
one and not square 10.

818
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:09,668
And if that does...

819
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,167
You know what? Whatever
your reasons are,

820
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,534
I'm fine with it.

821
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:15,833
You don't need to explain anything.

822
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:19,167
Maybe that's best for
now, for both of us.

823
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:21,034
Ok.

824
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,167
Ok.

825
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,467
Can i move this stuff into your garage?

826
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:26,134
Yeah. I'll help you.

827
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,668
Thanks.

828
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,601
Hey, you guys need some help?

829
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:34,267
Sure. Sure.

830
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,401
Did i mention my...

831
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,367
Parents called my sister

832
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:46,267
And apologized for a lifetime
of controlling behavior?

833
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:50,367
And then jordan just got up
and went back home with them.

834
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,800
I had no idea.

835
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, yeah? Because when i asked
them why the big change of heart,

836
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,767
They said that they had talked to you

837
00:41:56,767 --> 00:42:00,201
And that you had talked sense to them.

838
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:02,900
How'd you do that?

839
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,000
I have a few talents.

840
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,100
A few talents?

841
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,800
That's what you're gonna leave me with?

842
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,401
Ok.

843
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:12,934
No explanations.

844
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,134
I'll be right there.

845
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,934
Hey, sam, why don't you...

846
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:21,900
Show me what you're plannin'
to do with the space in here?

847
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,467
Love to, if i can remember.

848
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:24,668
I know what you're thinking.

849
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:27,634
It's a good thing you
didn't listen to me.

850
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,934
I beg your pardon?

851
00:42:29,934 --> 00:42:31,867
If there's one thing
i thought being dead

852
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:34,301
Would make me an expert
on, it was being dead,

853
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,733
But i was wrong.

854
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:38,467
That's your specialty, like you said.

855
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:41,167
I've been at it a while.

856
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,700
I wanted them to have the closure,

857
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,833
But you held out for more.

858
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,733
You gave them their family back.

859
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,301
Are you ready?

860
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,800
To go into the light?

861
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,934
It's been following me around all day.

862
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:06,501
But there is one thing i wanted
to say to you before i went in.

863
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,000
What?

864
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,167
What your husband did
might just be a miracle.

865
00:43:12,234 --> 00:43:13,833
I hope it is,

866
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,967
Because after a lifetime of this,

867
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:18,134
A miracle's what you deserve.

868
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:30,501
Hey, you ok?

869
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:32,800
Yeah.
