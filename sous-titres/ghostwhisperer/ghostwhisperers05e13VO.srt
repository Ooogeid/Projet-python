1
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,636
Sure, I can cover your patient, too,

2
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:06,837
But, um, there she is.

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:08,872
Hey. Hi.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,679
Look, first thing, I love you.

5
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:14,566
Well, that's good.

6
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:15,999
But this is going to be the third
time this week that I do this.

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,888
No! I know, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,096
But half the staff's got the flu,

9
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,700
Half's got some sort of respiratory virus.

10
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:21,700
I just can't get out of here.

11
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:22,705
Not even for lunch?

12
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,907
We can go to the cafeteria.

13
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:24,906
But I gotta work a double.

14
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:26,141
Is this even safe?

15
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,644
I mean, I don't understand

16
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:29,211
The medical profession,
and I feel like doctors

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,579
And truck drivers-- truck drivers?

18
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:32,412
And pilots, you know,
they should get the most sleep,

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,844
You know, not the least.

20
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:38,680
Well, we got vegetarian lasagna today, ehhh.

21
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,682
Help.

22
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,184
Somebody help me.

23
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:43,653
Hey, what's the problem?

24
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,387
Sir, did something happen to you?

25
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:46,787
He had a knife.
Why aren't you listening to me?

26
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,887
Lock the door. Lock the door.
Just lock the door.

27
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:50,255
Call the police.
You should definitely do that.

28
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,324
Sir, we need to examine you.

29
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:54,526
Yeah, let's do that right now.

30
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:56,027
Ok, why don't we examine you.

31
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,195
Just sit down. Help me get him to a chair.

32
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:58,496
He had a knife. He had a knife. Whoa!

33
00:00:58,564 --> 00:00:59,497
He won't stop slashing!

34
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,098
He just kept slashing!

35
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:05,771
Let go of her. He won't stop slashing!

36
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,069
He just kept slashing.
Can we get security down here?

37
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:08,834
His eyes, his eyes!

38
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,369
Are you gonna be all right?

39
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,704
It's going to be fine, sir. Calm down.

40
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,705
Where is security? And the blood!

41
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,174
And the blood, you have to stop him!

42
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,976
There was an officer in peed's
talking with a social worker.

43
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,078
Call over there.
Just get someone who is armed.

44
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,312
Won't do any good.

45
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,080
They can't stop it.

46
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,114
Stop it? Do you know what happened to him?

47
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:26,149
They can't save him no matter what they do.

48
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:28,384
He's a dead man.

49
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:35,156
Child, whispering: Can you see us?

50
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:45,225

51
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:10,561
Hey. Why aren't you listening to me?!

52
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:11,761
Please, someone just listen to me!

53
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:12,862
How is he? I don't know.

54
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,530
The er doctor took over.

55
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:15,798
They want to sedate him,
but they say he's got to talk to police.

56
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,132
Ok, well, you should talk to him first,

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,199
Or get me in there.

58
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,434
Wait, did you see something?

59
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,069
Something and someone. I had a vision.

60
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,337
I saw someone with a knife.

61
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,704
Just like he said.

62
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,839
Except it was a woman.
She was screaming and bleeding.

63
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,874
Do you think someone else was attacked?

64
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,275
Did he say anything about a woman?

65
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:32,144
No, but, I mean, he's in shock.

66
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,379
Oh, boy. Right this way, officers.

67
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:35,847
He said someone is after him.
The patient's this way.

68
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:37,214
Did you see the person holding the knife?

69
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,782
I think it was a man.

70
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,883
Do you think you could describe

71
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,084
The woman in the vision to the police?

72
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:43,152
Dirty blond hair,
an intense cut on her forearm.

73
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,286
I don't even know if she's still alive.

74
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:45,521
All right, that's the something you saw.

75
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,188
What about the someone? Ghost.

76
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:48,790
In his thirties.
It was kind of hard to make out.

77
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:50,258
But he wasn't cut, he wasn't bleeding,

78
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:51,293
He just looked awful.

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,660
What is he, a third victim?

80
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,428
Or the attacker.
Maybe someone that the guy--

81
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:55,862
Robert, his name's robert.

82
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,031
Ok, maybe somebody that
robert killed in a struggle.

83
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,432
Wait, he didn't even know it?

84
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,034
I mean, like, he was being
chased and didn't know?

85
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:03,069
All I know is that the ghost said
there's nothing anyone could do.

86
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:05,671
And that your patient
robert is going to die.

87
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,040
Is he?

88
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:09,241
I don't know. It's tough to tell.

89
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,575
With a knife wound,

90
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,377
Sometimes you gotta open
them up and see the damage.

91
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:13,611
Ok, well, you need to get to him
before he gets into surgery.

92
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,180
That woman could still be out there.

93
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:16,848
Yeah, and she might still
be alive, right? Ok.

94
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,388
So he's stable. I'll notify the e.R.

95
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,656
Good. I'll be back, dr. Myers.

96
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:35,024
Hey, wesley.

97
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,192
What's going on in there?

98
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,893
Dr. Meyers is just finishing up the exam.

99
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,928
He's gonna be fine.

100
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,729
They're not going to open him up?

101
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:41,730
No, we checked him out.

102
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:42,931
He's got lots of abrasions

103
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,632
And some moderate lacerations.

104
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,400
Nothing that looks like a knife wound.

105
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:47,635
What about all that blood he came in with?

106
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:50,004
Well, like I said, he's pretty banged up.

107
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:52,005
Anybody know why?

108
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:54,341
He keeps talking about
some guy with a knife.

109
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,777
Maybe he got knocked around
pretty good trying to get away.

110
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:59,779
I really need to talk to him.

111
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:02,948
Those cops are waiting to
talk to him, too, you know.

112
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:05,884
Yeah.

113
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:08,719
I need to talk to him first,

114
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:12,088
So could you hold them
off for about 5 minutes?

115
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:13,389
You got it. Thanks.

116
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,396
Hey, mr. Wharton, how are you doing?

117
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,900
Who are you?

118
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,902
I'm a doctor. Well, actually I'm the guy

119
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,603
Who threw you in the wheelchair
when you first came in here.

120
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,471
Oh, I'm sorry.

121
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,873
It's just, I'm so tired.

122
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,974
It's probably the adrenaline.
You know, it spikes

123
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,942
And then your body crashes.

124
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,576
They said there's nothing wrong with me.

125
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:41,277
No, not too much. Nothing serious.

126
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:46,015
Look, this attack you've
been talking about...

127
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,516
Was there anyone else who got hurt?

128
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,717
Anyone else?

129
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:49,717
Someone who was with you.

130
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:51,685
You know, a woman, maybe?

131
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,720
Ah, I don't know.

132
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:54,821
All right.

133
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,389
Mr. Wharton?

134
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:00,192
Do you mind if I call you robert?

135
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,627
Look, robert,

136
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:04,562
Someone saw a woman being
attacked with a knife.

137
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,897
Where?

138
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,198
Well, that's what I was
hoping you could tell me.

139
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:11,202
You came in here,
you haven't been cut by a knife,

140
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,303
But it turns out this woman was.

141
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,939
It wasn't a dream.

142
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,641
Wait, you know what I'm talking about?

143
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,776
This actually happened?

144
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:23,378
Robert... Who was she?

145
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,380
Who was she?

146
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,248
Can you tell me anything about this attack?

147
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:29,581
Look, where did it happen? Were you inside?

148
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,617
Were you outside, were you in a building?

149
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,285
Tell me any sounds you heard, anything.

150
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:36,388
The night was just so dark.

151
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:39,291
I just wanted to shut my eyes.

152
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,493
I thought, please,
could I just shut my eyes?

153
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,328
Hey, man, it's the middle of the afternoon.

154
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,063
This went on all night?

155
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:47,331
I don't know.

156
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,432
Who did this to you?

157
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,066
What the hell happened to you?

158
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:52,834
Robert, where were you before you came here?

159
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,770
Where am I now?

160
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:57,838
You're in the rockland memorial hospital.

161
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,406
Who are you?

162
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:00,773
My name's jim, I'm a doctor.

163
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,641
You don't remember coming here, do you?

164
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:05,477
I wake up in places,

165
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:07,579
And I can't remember how I got there.

166
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,948
Was I sleeping?

167
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:13,318
Just now, was I sleeping?

168
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:15,153
No, it's like you're blacking out.

169
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,521
Yeah.

170
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,290
I guess so.

171
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,593
I think so.

172
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,762
Robert, I'm going to ask you a
very important question, all right?

173
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,664
You came in here covered with blood.

174
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,166
Was that blood yours?

175
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,034
I don't know.

176
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,669
Robert, tell me. Did you hurt somebody?

177
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:36,004
Somebody you knew, anybody?

178
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:37,238
A woman? Did you?

179
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,974
No, no, I wouldn't. I couldn't.

180
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:43,210
I hope not.

181
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,014
Am I awake?

182
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,715
I mean, is this place real?

183
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:54,419
Are you real?

184
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,858
You see?

185
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,462
It's in him now.

186
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,364
It's in him now?

187
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,364
What does that mean?

188
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,798
Melinda wasn't exactly sure,

189
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,166
And the ghost didn't
stick around to explain.

190
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,233
Where is she?

191
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,835
She's giving eli the local ghost update.

192
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,336
What do I do?

193
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,206
I want you to find out everything
you can about robert wharton.

194
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,676
You mean, about people he knows who died.

195
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,844
Yeah, but especially the one we hope didn't.

196
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,145
The woman that she saw getting cut.

197
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,947
Yeah. So look at his friends, ok?

198
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,149
But don't rule anybody out.

199
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:30,884
And see if anybody's gone
missing in grandview.

200
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:33,320
If not, nearby towns, ok? I'm on it.

201
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,521
Thanks, man.

202
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,756
Hey, so is detective blair.

203
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,524
She must have gotten melinda's message.

204
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,858
All right, you hear anything, call me.

205
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,859
Ok.

206
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,328
Thanks, man. Take it easy.

207
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,765
So you're sure that this is the man you saw?

208
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,333
Yeah. That's the guy

209
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,235
I saw sleeping on the bench.

210
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,770
And you didn't see anyone with him,

211
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,205
Near him, menacing him?

212
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:57,974
No. But as he was curling up to go to sleep,

213
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,175
I noticed he might be hurt.

214
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,677
So I asked him if he was ok,

215
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:04,779
And he looked at me like totally lost.

216
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,414
And I pointed out the blood.

217
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,949
That's when he ran away.

218
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:10,417
When he realized you saw the blood.

219
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:11,585
Yeah.

220
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:14,121
Excuse me. Sorry, detective blair.

221
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,688
But I was here when the guy

222
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,123
You're talking about was brought in,

223
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:19,158
And he told us he was being chased.

224
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:21,860
Yeah, by someone with a knife.

225
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:24,128
I didn't see anyone.

226
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:27,498
And I'm telling you, the person
he was running from was me.

227
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:28,565
And then what happened?

228
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,400
I followed him. I lost him

229
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,368
For a few minutes, but then I saw him

230
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:34,937
Ducking into the hospital, and...

231
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,607
Here I am.

232
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:41,543
This guy walks into a hospital

233
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,577
Screaming he's been attacked

234
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:43,911
When he's the attacker?

235
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,980
It's a possibility, that's all I'm saying.

236
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,348
I've heard about throwing
suspicion onto someone else,

237
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,250
But come on, be smart.

238
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:53,852
Only do it after the police are onto you.

239
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,322
Or this guy robert could have had
some kind of psychotic break.

240
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,457
Yeah, and really believes
everything he's saying.

241
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:00,858
I really don't think he
has any idea what he did.

242
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,260
And, you know, we have no
idea what he's capable of.

243
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,495
All right, well, can you check his records?

244
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,630
Find out if he's under psychiatric care?

245
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:07,864
Maybe he went off his meds.

246
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,832
He had nothing on him. No wallet, nothing.

247
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,534
Only information we have is
his name and his blood type.

248
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,702
And the blood that was on his shirt,
they're testing it,

249
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,437
So if there was a second type...

250
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,172
Then he might have hurt someone else.

251
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,940
The woman you saw. Or the ghost, right?

252
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:22,076
I mean, there is one dead
person in this scenario?

253
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:23,810
The ghost said you can't save him.

254
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:26,346
Maybe he meant robert
should fry for what he did.

255
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:29,582
But even if he killed both of them,
that's unlikely.

256
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,051
So...Look, I'm not sure.

257
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,586
But I don't think this
guy meant to hurt anyone.

258
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:36,521
I mean, he seems like he wants to help.

259
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,855
Good.

260
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:40,224
'cause I want to talk to him.

261
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,426
We sent officers over to
robert's place of employment

262
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:43,593
And his apartment.

263
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:45,095
He was fired weeks ago. What happened?

264
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,329
Well, over the course
of the last few months,

265
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:48,264
He became erratic and aggressive.

266
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,998
Then he just stopped showing up for work.

267
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,266
That'll get you canned.

268
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,635
Did you find anything in his apartment?

269
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:56,337
Yeah, I mean, did anyone
see him with a woman?

270
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:57,671
A woman who he might have hurt?

271
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,073
The neighbor said he had a
girlfriend, helen reeman.

272
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,841
They lived separately,
but she stayed nights with him.

273
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,343
She was him all the time.

274
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,911
But no one has seen her in over a week,

275
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:07,479
Including the people at her job.

276
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:08,580
Yeah.

277
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,084
I don't understand.

278
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,653
If I'm not hurt, why am I still here?

279
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,921
Yeah, well, we think you're still at risk.

280
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:19,589
You said you've been blacking out, right?

281
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:20,990
I guess, but I don't--

282
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,525
Can't remember.

283
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:24,527
We're just going to run some
tests and see if there's

284
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,563
A medical reason for it. Or...Anything else.

285
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,865
like I'm crazy?

286
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,601
I mean, it's what you're thinking, isn't it?

287
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,769
Do you think you are? Could that explain

288
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:36,070
Some of the things you've done?

289
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:37,605
What have I done?

290
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,008
Who are you?

291
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,009
Hi.

292
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:46,279
Um, robert, this is my wife, melinda.

293
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,680
Sometimes she does special counseling

294
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,849
For certain patients.

295
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,351
I don't know what's happening to me.

296
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,019
Detective blair: What's happening
is your girlfriend is missing.

297
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,220
Helen reeman.

298
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,888
Do you know who we're talking about?

299
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,691
Helen? Yeah.

300
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,993
Of course.

301
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,662
You came in here talking
about a man with a knife.

302
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,630
The doctors think you may be delusional,

303
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:10,600
But I just think you might be confused.

304
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:14,003
And the man with the knife was you.
That sound right?

305
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,937
Oh, my god.

306
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,539
Helen.

307
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:20,908
In my dream, I saw a knife,

308
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:23,577
And it was slashing at someone.

309
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,880
There was blood.

310
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:29,615
I heard a woman screaming,

311
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,317
Saying, "stop!

312
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:34,886
Please stop, I'm begging you."

313
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,888
Then she said she loved me.

314
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:39,991
She was bleeding.

315
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:44,428
Then it was just so quiet.

316
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,929
Next thing I knew, I woke up
and I was covered in blood.

317
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,453
He killed his girlfriend,
and he doesn't remember it?

318
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,921
He must be out of his mind.

319
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,288
Yeah. Or out of his body.

320
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,556
Aiden! Hey.

321
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:05,257
Here's your snack. How was school today?

322
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,525
Good.

323
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,726
Is there anything you want
to tell me about today?

324
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,594
Maybe just one thing? Hmm, nothing.

325
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,730
Can I eat next to my game? I'm playing.

326
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,131
Sure.

327
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:18,235
Andrew wong got a crayon stuck in his nose.

328
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,070
Ooh. Is he ok?

329
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:23,406
Yeah, he's fine. It was purple.

330
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,807
Well, there you go.

331
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:28,710
Honey, it sounds like
you got your hands full.

332
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:29,945
The ghost, the murderer.

333
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:32,580
The missing girlfriend we
still haven't found yet.

334
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:35,916
And the demonic twin.
Tell her about that one.

335
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:38,652
Yeah, he's not a twin.

336
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,721
It was a vision, and it was that guy robert.

337
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:44,223
The patient and maybe murderer?

338
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,758
Yeah. He was holding a knife

339
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:48,127
And had this very hollow expression.

340
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,395
And goat's eyes. You know how goats

341
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,230
Have the slit pupils that go sideways?

342
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,031
Mm-hmm. They're satanic.

343
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:58,534
Ah! How did satan get brought
up in this conversation?

344
00:12:58,602 --> 00:12:59,969
The ghost said it's in him now, right?

345
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:01,671
Maybe what's in our patient

346
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,172
Isn't some kind of psychosis.

347
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,640
Yeah, or maybe he was just in shock,

348
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:06,141
Or had some kind of brain tumor.

349
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,343
I mean, the delusional state
that he shared with me...

350
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:11,244
Or he's sick with something worse.

351
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,512
Something evil.

352
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:14,946
I don't buy it.

353
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:17,081
'cause you don't believe
evil exists on its own.

354
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:18,949
How do you explain the shadows?
The bad parts

355
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,816
Of people left over when
they go into the light.

356
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,751
Aiden's seen it. Ok, ned.

357
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,686
Stop. I know this is what you're into,

358
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,354
And I know you're studying the occult
because you're trying to help people--

359
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:29,489
I'm studying it because
I find it fascinating.

360
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,189
Because both of you

361
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,324
Showed me there's more in this
world than what you can see.

362
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:36,158
Why can't you trust what you saw?

363
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:37,592
Because ghosts are unreliable.

364
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,327
Look, I don't even know who this ghost is.

365
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,995
Let's just start there. Ok, who's the ghost

366
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:43,997
And how is it related to robert?

367
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,898
Ok, fine.

368
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,833
Robert isn't married.

369
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,967
He has no children, and his mother is dead.

370
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,135
What about his father?

371
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:52,569
61, and alive.

372
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:55,503
His name's rudy, and he works downtown.

373
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:57,471
Maybe he knows your ghost. Yeah, thanks.

374
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,342
Where is it? Oh.

375
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,846
Hello?

376
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:04,816
There's a jane doe in the morgue,

377
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:07,153
And she's got lacerations on her arm.

378
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:11,226
Maybe robert should identify her.

379
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,529
It was his girlfriend.
I think he's just trying to help.

380
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,933
They can't let him, it's police
procedure, he's a suspect.

381
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,035
Besides, he's just dehydrated
and confused, exhausted.

382
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:20,937
I can't believe he hasn't passed out yet.

383
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,638
I can't believe I haven't, either.

384
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:23,940
Yeah, what shift are you on?

385
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,841
I can't remember.

386
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,345
Why isn't robert passed out?

387
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:30,713
That's a good question.

388
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,814
Every time he tries to fall asleep,
or he's about to,

389
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,982
He gets agitated.

390
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,517
He goes in and out of being
confused, being himself.

391
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,785
It's strange.

392
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:42,121
So she either jumped off a
bridge or she was pushed.

393
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,356
So if she died from a fall,

394
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,857
Then why did the ghost
show me a knife wound?

395
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,860
Maybe robert went after her
with a knife before he...

396
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,094
Can I see her face?

397
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:53,731
It wouldn't help. She's unrecognizable.

398
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,406
Any of these wounds look familiar?

399
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:05,741
I saw one cut, but not
enough to identify her.

400
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,744
See anything else? Any visions?

401
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,412
No.

402
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,513
Her hair looks similar.

403
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:14,315
Lighter, maybe.

404
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,451
What's weird is if robert killed her,

405
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,585
Then where's her ghost?

406
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,487
I don't know.

407
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,188
Maybe she forgave him and crossed over

408
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,656
Because he wasn't himself.

409
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,625
A few months ago, this guy
had a girlfriend and a job.

410
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,960
And then he just loses his mind,

411
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:31,362
Starts blacking out and he kills her?

412
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,064
She wouldn't go out like that.
She'd be worried about people.

413
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:35,531
Maybe even robert. Yeah.

414
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,932
Hey, I'll be out in a second.

415
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,706
You can see me.

416
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:46,941
Who are you?

417
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:48,776
He's not dangerous.

418
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:50,912
Robert? Are you his girlfriend?

419
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,313
He wanted to be with her forever.

420
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:53,547
He didn't want to hurt her.

421
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,482
Hurt her?

422
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:02,388
Is that you in there?

423
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,423
Or are you just someone else
that he hurt and didn't mean to?

424
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,592
I'm still tired. Isn't that strange?

425
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:10,027
Other spirits say they can't feel anything,

426
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,295
But they're wrong.

427
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:13,463
'cause I can see how sad or lonely they are.

428
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:15,398
And they still love just as much.

429
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,434
I want to help you.

430
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,068
Really, I do.

431
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,570
114.

432
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,772
114, don't go in 114.

433
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,240
Is that an address?

434
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,775
Is that where you died?

435
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,743
You know, just talk to me.

436
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:31,645
Do you know robert?

437
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:35,281
Can you stop him from hurting anyone else?

438
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:37,015
He won't hurt anyone else.

439
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,450
He's going to die.

440
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:39,985
There's nothing anyone can do about it.

441
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:42,987
Wait, another spirit said
exactly that same thing. A man.

442
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,655
Do you know him?

443
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,825
You can see me.

444
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:51,861
He's not dangerous.
He wanted to be with her forever.

445
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,029
He didn't mean to hurt her.

446
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,831
Right.

447
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,266
114.

448
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:59,301
114.

449
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,070
1...14.

450
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,344
How do you know that ghost even

451
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:10,778
Knows our ghost? Or our guy?

452
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,680
I don't even know if our
ghost knows our guy,

453
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,048
Much less that ghost.

454
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,649
Is it me, or does it sound like

455
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,051
We're rapping about a bunch of nut bags?

456
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,519
All these people,

457
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:20,387
And when I say "people,
" I'm including the dead,

458
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,388
Sound totally whackadoodle.

459
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,056
Yeah, I've dealt with crazy ghosts before,

460
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:25,624
But this one's different.

461
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,159
What makes you so sure?

462
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:28,727
It all happened so suddenly with robert.

463
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:30,662
The living nut. Right. A few weeks ago,

464
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,964
He was totally normal.

465
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,732
And then all of a sudden,
he becomes violently insane.

466
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,233
Define "normal."

467
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
I mean, you said yourself,

468
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:38,399
The ghost's girlfriend was totally nutty.

469
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,867
I never said it was his girlfriend.

470
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,669
Hey, guys. Hey.

471
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,136
What's going on?

472
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,604
Well, robert's being scheduled for an mri,

473
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,472
And we're going to check for
any kind of brain abnormality.

474
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,375
Till then, he's being
transferred to the psych ward.

475
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:51,409
I can keep an eye on him there.

476
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:53,078
Or you could talk to his father.

477
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,313
That was my next step. He's here.

478
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,580
He's signing commitment forms.

479
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,882
And, uh, he's not alone.

480
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,883
I was so worried about him.

481
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:02,451
That's robert's father,

482
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,819
And robert's girlfriend helen reeman.

483
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,821
Are you sure? Yeah. I met her.

484
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,722
They came in together.
They're both pretty broken up.

485
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,590
Was she injured?

486
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:12,926
No. She said he wasn't violent.

487
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:14,094
She said he was agitated,

488
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,795
But then he just shut himself off.

489
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,930
She swears he never hurt her.

490
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,731
So why couldn't we find her?

491
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,133
Where has she been?

492
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,768
Ah, looking for robert.

493
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,570
You know, he stopped returning phone calls,
and then about a week ago,

494
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,005
He's gone.

495
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,606
They had met in providence,

496
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:30,674
So that's where she was.

497
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,841
She was checking out old haunts,

498
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,276
Talking to his friends.

499
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,444
While he and his devil buddy
were roaming grandview

500
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,445
Getting bloody.

501
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,713
Look, I'm glad that she's alive,

502
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:38,914
But...

503
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,382
Is she's not the knife victim, then who is?

504
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,484
You know what, I don't think there was one.

505
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,185
The bloodwork came back on his clothes,

506
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,954
And there was only one type on it--his.

507
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,256
And there was this witness,
the skateboarder kid.

508
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:51,024
He said he saw a guy completely disoriented

509
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:53,226
Falling down, totally agitated.

510
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,793
Which would account for the blood,

511
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:55,961
But what about the woman?

512
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:57,295
And why was he running in the first place?

513
00:18:57,363 --> 00:19:00,632
If he's in that state,
could he maybe see a ghost?

514
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:03,634
Well, let's not forget mrs.
Loopy down in the morgue.

515
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,736
Why are they both predicting his doom?

516
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:07,637
My guess is that mri's

517
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,372
Going to come back with a big,
honking death sentence.

518
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,875
Are the results in? Could it be a tumor?

519
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,142
He hasn't even been scanned yet.

520
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,777
You talked to his dad.

521
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:16,945
Is there any history of
mental illness in his family?

522
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:18,480
It's a dead end. Robert was adopted.

523
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,948
Nobody knows anything
about his birth parents.

524
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:21,783
So much for getting the
skinny from his family.

525
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,618
I'm not so sure about that.

526
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,419
The ghost said that we couldn't save him.

527
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,820
Maybe it wasn't a threat.

528
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,822
Maybe he was worried about him.

529
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:49,939
You're his father, aren't you?

530
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,441
Yes.

531
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,342
I wasn't there for him.

532
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,779
He needs me now.

533
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:18,131
You said the ghost was close to the guy?

534
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:19,532
Their foreheads were touching.

535
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,500
And jim said that the patient
had the same nightmare,

536
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,468
Of someone slashing a woman with a knife.

537
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,103
That sounds about right.

538
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:26,405
It sounds about right for what?

539
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:27,673
They call it threading.

540
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,441
I found 3 different references
to it in the library.

541
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:30,976
Why is it called threading?

542
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,644
It's when a ghost weaves images or visions

543
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,312
Into the mind of a civilian.

544
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,680
A civilian?

545
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:37,549
Someone who's not a sensitive,
like you or aiden.

546
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,817
It's supposed to be easier
with physical proximity.

547
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:41,452
How easy?

548
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,454
Well, you don't have to suppress
a person's consciousness,

549
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:44,656
Like with possession,

550
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,190
But it does take lots of energy;

551
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,059
The kind of energy you
need major motion to get--

552
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:50,027
Hate, anger, love.

553
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:51,829
Or guilt.

554
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,830
Well, that depends. How much guilt?

555
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:56,500
Well, in my vision, it was from
the point of view of the slasher.

556
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:59,402
If I had slashed someone,
I'd feel pretty guilty.

557
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,834
Then again, I'm not a slasher.

558
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:02,234
Maybe the ghost wasn't, either.

559
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,133
Which begs the question--

560
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:06,133
Why did he say, "he needs me."

561
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,701
Why would he need his son
to see him slashing someone?

562
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,636
And who was he slashing? I don't know.

563
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,037
It wasn't robert's girlfriend.
I don't think it was

564
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,372
The ghost I saw outside the morgue.

565
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,506
Why?

566
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:15,740
'cause she wasn't cut or bloody.

567
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,108
And you know what,
it was something else she said.

568
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,143
She said, "he didn't mean to hurt her,"

569
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,144
Not, "he didn't mean to hurt me."

570
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,912
Then who's the victim? Yeah.

571
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,947
Who's the woman outside the morgue?

572
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,916
Why are so many of them crazy?

573
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,453
No, I don't mind you asking at all.

574
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,788
Frankly, I wish the hospital
had sent someone sooner.

575
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,823
I know they're busy, but, you know.

576
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:38,426
God forbid you have an issue that doesn't
fit into one of their neat little boxes.

577
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:40,394
Like robert?

578
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,062
Yeah.

579
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,764
Here.

580
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:45,399
Have a seat.

581
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:48,402
Although, to be honest,

582
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:51,270
I'm probably more mad at myself.

583
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,004
For what? Well, I never asked

584
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:56,105
The tough questions until my son started...

585
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:59,908
Till things went so wrong with him.

586
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,310
Do you mind describing what happened to him?

587
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:04,578
Well, first it was simple insomnia.

588
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,647
It started a few months ago.

589
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:07,847
He couldn't sleep.

590
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,348
Nothing would help.

591
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,218
You know, exercise, pills, warm milk.

592
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:13,452
Nothing.

593
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,153
And then the nightmares started.

594
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,821
I heard it in his voice.

595
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,423
We'd talk all the time.

596
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,391
He was different.

597
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:21,592
And it affected his work.

598
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,826
Pretty soon, he lost his job.

599
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:25,995
He started to wander off,
disappearing from home.

600
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:28,164
Like he did when he
showed up at the hospital.

601
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:29,666
Helen, his girlfriend, she left her own job

602
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,833
To try and help, but it was no use.

603
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,602
The longer he went without sleep,

604
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:34,936
The worse it got.

605
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:37,004
You said you didn't ask the tough questions.

606
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:39,706
What questions were those?

607
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:41,307
I don't know if you have your own kids,

608
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,074
Biologically, I mean.

609
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:44,342
None that I know of.

610
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,010
Anyway, I have to imagine

611
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:47,611
It's different when you have your own.

612
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,781
You never worry someone will
come along and lay claim to him.

613
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:52,349
Was the adoption problematic?

614
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,918
No, I don't mean, you know, literal claim.

615
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,720
I mean, what if your child

616
00:22:57,788 --> 00:23:00,323
Decides he wants to connect
with his own people?

617
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:01,924
And, you know, what if he discovers

618
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:03,659
He has more in common
with them than with you?

619
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:05,461
You were afraid of losing him.

620
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,262
So when we adopted,

621
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,431
They asked if we wanted to know

622
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,265
Robert's family's circumstances.

623
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,368
And I said, no, no, I didn't want to know.

624
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,337
That all changed when he got sick.

625
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:16,638
Of course, and I had to know.

626
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:17,705
I wish I'd known sooner.

627
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,206
Known what?

628
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,806
Robert's parents didn't
choose to give him up.

629
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:23,142
It wasn't up to them.

630
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,711
He was a ward of the state.

631
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:29,748
Was this, by any chance, because
robert's father had killed his mother?

632
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,550
How did you know that?

633
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,285
It's hard to explain, but I promise I will.

634
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,753
Do you have any paperwork I can see?

635
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,858
I understand that there are privacy issues,

636
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:42,127
But I was hoping you'd still
want to help the family.

637
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:44,929
You're forgetting that I'm retired now.

638
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:47,064
Especially considering
the gaps in your report.

639
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,465
What gaps?

640
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,933
Robert's adopted father is how I found you.

641
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:50,967
You were the social worker on the case.

642
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:52,635
Yeah.

643
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:55,704
Well, you left his birth
father's cause of death blank.

644
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:57,939
But then you said it was
listed in appendix d,

645
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,341
But there is no appendix d.

646
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:01,143
So maybe it fell out of the file.

647
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:03,979
That's when I realized that the
pages prove that nothing's missing.

648
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,846
See, appendix c is on page 13

649
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,348
And appendix e is on page 14,

650
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,317
Meaning that there was never an appendix d.

651
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:11,618
Was there?

652
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:14,887
What do you want?

653
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:18,090
I want to know what's
missing from the report.

654
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,458
What do you know so far?

655
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,059
His birth mother, marlene,

656
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,893
She died of uncontrolled bleeding

657
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,728
Due to cuts on her forearms. And his father,

658
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,230
Vernon, he was found on
the floor of a motel room

659
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:28,764
Babbling incoherently.

660
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:31,366
Yes, he blamed himself

661
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:34,234
One minute, he blamed his wife the next.

662
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:35,502
He also blamed demons.

663
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:40,606
Yeah, there was talk about demons.

664
00:24:40,674 --> 00:24:43,408
And then he died in a psychiatric
ward not much after that.

665
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,343
Ok, you say you worked with the hospital.

666
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:47,479
Is robert sick? Yes.

667
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:48,613
Why?

668
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:50,915
Is he suffering from insomnia,
by any chance?

669
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,585
What else is missing from that report?

670
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:58,322
No one would have adopted that boy

671
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:00,125
If they knew the truth.

672
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:01,728
The truth?

673
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:03,299
That his father killed his mother.

674
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:04,668
That he was insane.

675
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,005
Because psychosis is genetic.

676
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,274
Because at the time,
it seemed like the worst thing

677
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,375
You could pass on to a child.

678
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,577
At the time? Was there something else?

679
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,614
The doctors didn't even know
that the disease existed,

680
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,584
Not until there was another death
in the family like vernon's.

681
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,120
A woman, robert's sister.

682
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,721
Extremely rare.

683
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,024
It's called fatal familial insomnia.

684
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,392
And if a parent has it,

685
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,561
You have a 50% chance of inheriting it.

686
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,396
So how is it treated?

687
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,598
It's not. There's no cure.

688
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,033
The body can't live without rest.

689
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,435
Yeah, for a few weeks,

690
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,637
Months at the most.

691
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,338
After that, psychosis sets in.

692
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,474
Organ failure.

693
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,141
And death.

694
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,479
It says in the obit lane dokes died

695
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:51,880
Of an undisclosed illness.

696
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,053
Yep.

697
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,355
That's robert's sister.

698
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:00,989
It's the ghost I saw outside the morgue.

699
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,424
She was 24.

700
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:04,559
Her father died in his early thirties.

701
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:06,294
Kids got split up after that.

702
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:09,196
She went into foster care
and robert got luckier.

703
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:11,332
Yeah, if you call that luck.

704
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,833
Coming down with a fatal
disease that I wouldn't wish

705
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,568
On my worst ex-girlfriend.

706
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:15,935
When she said he didn't mean to hurt her,

707
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,570
She was talking about the father.

708
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,472
When she said he wasn't dangerous...

709
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,640
She meant her brother.

710
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,708
Yeah. Obviously, she's still very confused.

711
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:25,211
That's what happens when
most of what you remember

712
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,679
From your final days is hallucinatory.

713
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:28,913
Poor dead looney tune.

714
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,147
Yeah, I have to tell robert.

715
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,216
Tell him what? "hey, good news,

716
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:33,417
"you probably didn't kill anyone.

717
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:35,151
"bad news is visions that
made you think you did,

718
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,019
"are little home movies of dad killing mom.

719
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:38,921
"oh, and by the way,
he and your sister went bonko

720
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:41,590
And died of a fatal disease
that you inherited."

721
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,928
I gotta call you back.

722
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,434
Wake up quick, before it's too late.

723
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:06,594
Hey, hey, hey, whoa.

724
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:08,296
Are you ok?

725
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,300
Depends on which melinda you're asking.

726
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:14,601
Sorry?

727
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:16,669
I'll explain later. What's going on?

728
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,937
Robert's gone.

729
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,639
Gone-gone?

730
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:20,739
Yeah, they searched the hospital.
He's nowhere.

731
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:22,908
He's disappeared.

732
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,711
His name is robert wharton.

733
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,746
I'm his girlfriend, can't you find him?

734
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:34,851
Thanks.

735
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:36,669
I just needed some air.

736
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:38,571
We're sorry to add to your worries.

737
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:41,373
There's no cure? You're sure?

738
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,109
There's no cure?

739
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:45,073
That's what we've been told.

740
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,274
And you think his father is haunting him?

741
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:48,509
Why?

742
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:50,277
Maybe to warn him. We're not sure.

743
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:55,847
What's awful is this is the
first thing I've heard in weeks

744
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,549
That actually makes sense.

745
00:28:57,616 --> 00:29:00,417
When you get used to your
boyfriend's boss calling,

746
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:02,552
Asking if he's drinking for breakfast.

747
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,520
Do you mind telling us what happened

748
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,155
Before he disappeared?

749
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:09,191
You mean after he lost his job?

750
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:13,094
He started calling all times,

751
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,528
Day and night,

752
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:17,164
Asking strange, bizarre questions.

753
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:19,534
Sometimes he'd accuse me of things.

754
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:20,968
He sounded paranoid?

755
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:24,372
At first I thought it was
a bad case of cold feet.

756
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,140
Cold feet?

757
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:29,343
We'd just recently talked
about getting married,

758
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:32,079
Maybe even having kids.

759
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:35,316
Did he ever tell you about
dreams he may have had?

760
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,685
Hallucinations?

761
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:39,553
Yes.

762
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:40,955
A lot.

763
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,723
The second he would close his eyes,

764
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,958
Or sometimes even when
his eyes were still open,

765
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:47,160
He would see these creatures.

766
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:49,462
Uh, I don't remember what he called them.

767
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,731
Demons?

768
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,767
That's right. Demons.

769
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,601
Do you know what that means?

770
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,469
Vernon, his birth father,
said that he saw demons, too.

771
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:01,703
I thought they were all just delusions.

772
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:04,439
Are you telling me that they weren't?

773
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,039
Hey. Hey.

774
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,173
Did you find anything?

775
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,208
Yeah, robert's brain scans just came back,

776
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:12,043
And, um, they don't show any physical damage

777
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,378
Or abnormalities that would
explain the symptoms.

778
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,317
So he has it. It's in his blood.

779
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:23,019
How else would you explain the insomnia?

780
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:25,621
Look...

781
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,222
How long does he have?

782
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,590
Wait a minute, wait a minute, helen.

783
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:31,059
This doesn't mean that he has ffi.

784
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,693
We don't know that yet.

785
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:34,128
There are tests that can
better determine that.

786
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:36,730
But even if he has the disease,

787
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,464
There are remedies for
these kinds of things.

788
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,165
I mean, treatments.

789
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,900
Obscure stuff that no one knows about

790
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,934
Because the disease itself is so rare.

791
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:46,202
Look, there's always hope.

792
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,737
Excuse me.

793
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:56,613
You're making a bad mistake.
You need to leave him alone.

794
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,047
Your son is sick.

795
00:30:58,115 --> 00:30:59,349
Those doctors will make him worse.

796
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,550
How?

797
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,051
They're gonna try to make him sleep.

798
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,719
He needs sleep. He's gonna die without it.

799
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:06,422
No. Sleep is what they need.

800
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,457
Who, the doctors or the demons?

801
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:10,427
Look, in my vision it said

802
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,497
That I had to wake up
before it was too late.

803
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,902
Is that because that's when the demons come?

804
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:16,671
They come when your guard is down.

805
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,907
They wake up when you go to sleep.

806
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,578
No, no!

807
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:25,918
Stop!

808
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:30,888
Uhh!

809
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,658
Uhh!

810
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,432
114.

811
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,203
114.

812
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,704
That's the motel room where she died.

813
00:31:41,772 --> 00:31:42,705
What were you doing there?

814
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,040
I wasn't myself.

815
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,742
Do you understand? That wasn't me.

816
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,310
Of course not. It was a sickness.

817
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,545
No. It was them.

818
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,213
They got inside me.

819
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,614
The demons?

820
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:56,149
My son needs me before he goes to sleep

821
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:58,652
And before they get him, too.

822
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,400
Forget your keys?

823
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:16,801
robert.

824
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,736
You scared me.

825
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,605
Why are you hiding like that?

826
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:24,342
You must be exhausted, too, huh?

827
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,310
So tired of this.

828
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,680
I was--I was so worried.

829
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,982
Why did you run away from the hospital?

830
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,350
I'm afraid.

831
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,286
There's nothing to be afraid of.

832
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,520
But you have to--

833
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,655
I'm afraid of myself, all right?

834
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,889
What do you mean?

835
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,958
I can't control it anymore.

836
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,161
What?

837
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,699
The things in my head.

838
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:51,506
Robert, there's something I
need to explain to you, ok?

839
00:32:51,574 --> 00:32:53,842
Sit down.

840
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:57,747
So I am going crazy?

841
00:32:57,814 --> 00:32:58,948
Because this thing?

842
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:01,317
But the doctors think
there might be treatments.

843
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,718
Which is why you have to
go back to the hospital.

844
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:05,219
No.

845
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,353
I don't like it there.

846
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:07,754
I don't...

847
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:10,558
Robert, please.

848
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,132
No, no. I don't want to hurt you.

849
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,133
I don't want to hurt you.

850
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,869
You won't. I know you.

851
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:25,571
Listen, I just--

852
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:27,839
I've got tea boiling and
I've got to grab my purse.

853
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:29,674
Just come inside. No, no.

854
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,876
I can't. I'm--I'm scared to
be alone with you in there.

855
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,912
Ok, then just wait.

856
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,381
Wait here.

857
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,349
I love you.

858
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,020
I love you, too.

859
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:07,700
You can end it, robert.

860
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:12,871
Just one step, take it, take it.

861
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:23,834
Hey.

862
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:25,502
I just talked to detective blair.
There's no sign of him.

863
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,170
So how long can he live without sleep?

864
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,506
Well, he may not have to find out.

865
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:30,507
What do you mean?

866
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:31,741
I did a little extra research.

867
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,276
It turns out that the root cause of ffi

868
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:35,544
Is a thing called a prion
protein in the brain.

869
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:37,313
It's related to mad cow.

870
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:38,549
But we checked robert's blood samples.

871
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:39,683
And it's not there?

872
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:41,185
Well, the test isn't conclusive,

873
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:43,988
But I'm starting to think this
guy does not have this disease.

874
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:46,824
Which of course raises the question,

875
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,425
Why the hell's he staying up all night?

876
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,226
I think our answer's right in front of us.

877
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,431
Well, in case it isn't,

878
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:58,033
I'm gonna keep checking
with our staff neurologist.

879
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:02,436
Oh, have you seen robert?

880
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:04,371
No, why? God. Where is he?

881
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,539
No, no, no. What happened?

882
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:08,108
I told him the truth about his disease.

883
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,276
No.

884
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,677
He promised me he would
come back and get help,

885
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:12,111
Then he disappeared.

886
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:15,014
If you know where your son is,
you have to tell us.

887
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:17,349
Even if you found him,
you couldn't help him.

888
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,617
What do you mean?

889
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:20,185
Think of his options.

890
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:21,720
Insanity and then death.

891
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:22,988
Or just death.

892
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,256
Is that what you chose?

893
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:25,491
You went to that motel

894
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,526
To cage your own demon, didn't you?

895
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:28,527
I don't understand.

896
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:31,398
I had a vision with demons,

897
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:32,633
But they were me.

898
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:33,901
Just like the demon that
was in robert's room,

899
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:35,169
It was a version of robert,

900
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,436
And you saw that, too.

901
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:38,205
You knew that something
wanted to hurt your family

902
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:40,040
And that's why you locked yourself away.

903
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:41,675
But you wanted to make sure

904
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,543
That it would never
threaten your family again.

905
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,713
And that's why you took the knife.

906
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,202
114.

907
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,770
You said not to go there,

908
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,139
But that's because you never stopped wishing

909
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,807
That your mother had stayed away.

910
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:15,676
How did she know where he went?

911
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:18,811
I remember her dialing...

912
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:20,914
And dialing.

913
00:37:20,982 --> 00:37:24,483
She called all of our friends.

914
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,787
All of his family.

915
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:30,824
She called hospitals. She called the police.

916
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:32,660
I have to find...

917
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:33,995
And then she called the bank.

918
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:35,029
I tried the hospital.

919
00:37:35,097 --> 00:37:37,332
And they told her

920
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:42,002
That was the last place
he used the credit card.

921
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,504
That's how she found you.

922
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:45,405
It's very hard to remember.

923
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:48,242
In my vision I saw you swing

924
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,776
That knife up and away from her, like you--

925
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:52,579
I didn't want her to take it.

926
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,782
I left the door unlocked and she came

927
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:56,783
And she saw me. Stop, please.

928
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:57,984
She knew what I was doing there.

929
00:37:58,052 --> 00:38:00,020
give me the knife.

930
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,121
I need you to go!

931
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:02,122
Please.

932
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,824
She saw the knife

933
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:05,459
And she tried to take it,

934
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:07,727
And I didn't want her to take it.

935
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:10,130
I was just trying to keep
it from her, that's all.

936
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:15,336
Don't. No.

937
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:17,839
Stop.

938
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:19,341
Ahh!

939
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,778
Aah!

940
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,447
Oh!

941
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:24,648
I didn't know that I'd cut her,
I just wanted her out

942
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:25,816
So I could finish what I started.

943
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,319
And then I shoved her out the door.

944
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:31,255
After that, I'm not sure what happened.

945
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:34,323
She was crying.

946
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:39,227
And I wouldn't open the door.

947
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,663
I'd hoped that she'd gotten away from me.

948
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,131
Then she was finally safe, and with me gone,

949
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,299
We'd both have some peace.

950
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,601
I'd hoped that she was safe.

951
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,749
He didn't mean to hurt her.

952
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:06,950
No, of course he didn't.

953
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:09,252
You're right about that.

954
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,386
But what I don't get

955
00:39:10,454 --> 00:39:12,388
Is if robert isn't sick,

956
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:14,357
Why did you suddenly start haunting him?

957
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:16,726
Because he wasn't sick yet.

958
00:39:16,794 --> 00:39:19,062
He was talking about having children.

959
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:20,930
You heard him. And you thought--

960
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:23,500
He was worried our kids would inherit it.

961
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:27,437
And you wanted to make sure
that would never happen again.

962
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:28,971
Where's you son?

963
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,940
He doesn't have to die.

964
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:41,549
Robert, wait.

965
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:42,717
Please wait.

966
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:44,886
Stay away from me. Both of you.

967
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:46,387
You don't have to do this.

968
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:50,959
I don't want to. I don't, but...

969
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:54,429
What if I told you that
you're probably not sick?

970
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:56,397
I have to be.

971
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,265
Why else can't I sleep?

972
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,067
Because someone won't let you.

973
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,735
Someone?

974
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:04,337
Someone who loves you.

975
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:08,239
Someone who's been very
confused for a very long time.

976
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,008
Look, you thought that you
could keep your son awake

977
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,476
By threading images into his thoughts

978
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:17,577
That would keep the demons from
getting him like they got you,

979
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,345
But you're wrong.

980
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:21,179
And they never got you while you were asleep

981
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,580
Because you never slept.

982
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:24,848
No, I remember. I...

983
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:27,616
I'd wake up. I would have done things.

984
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:29,516
You may have had blackouts,

985
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,351
But you never slept.

986
00:40:31,419 --> 00:40:33,920
You couldn't have. You had a disease.

987
00:40:35,355 --> 00:40:36,989
Is my father here?

988
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:38,657
Yes.

989
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:40,659
And your sister.

990
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:43,995
Robert, please come off the ledge.

991
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:46,630
Please come back to me.

992
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:52,936
But the plans we made.

993
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:56,739
Even if I'm not sick, what about our kids?

994
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:59,775
This thing is still in my blood.

995
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:02,744
Don't you know,

996
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:05,746
One of the reasons I fell in love with you

997
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:08,181
Was hearing you talk about your family.

998
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,317
How thankful you were for having parents

999
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,319
Who wanted you so badly.

1000
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,588
They didn't know what I was.

1001
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:18,423
And I do.

1002
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:21,792
And I...Love you.

1003
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,963
Robert, I want what your parents wanted.

1004
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,968
I want a family. And I want it with you.

1005
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,338
Please.

1006
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:38,040
Please.

1007
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,269
Well, they're gonna keep
him under observation

1008
00:42:07,337 --> 00:42:08,504
For about 24 more hours.

1009
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:11,606
And that's just to be sure.

1010
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:15,076
Well, something tells me he's gonna be ok.

1011
00:42:20,547 --> 00:42:22,714
You two can do now if you're ready.

1012
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:28,386
Say good-bye to him for us.

1013
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,725
Mom's waiting for us.

1014
00:42:42,903 --> 00:42:44,503
They're gone.

1015
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:45,771
That is beautiful.

1016
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:52,245
What, all that love?

1017
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:54,681
No, all that sleep.

1018
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:56,116
you poor thing.

1019
00:42:56,184 --> 00:42:57,919
When's your shift over?

1020
00:42:57,987 --> 00:42:59,888
It should be over about now,

1021
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,923
But I can't seem to read my watch.

1022
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:02,958
You know what?

1023
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,693
I'm busting you out of here.

1024
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,027
Oh.

1025
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,934
Delia said that aiden was an angel.

1026
00:43:13,002 --> 00:43:16,804
He only went downstairs
11 times after lights out.

1027
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:19,840
And hopefully it'll get easier for you to...

1028
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:23,540
Sleep.
