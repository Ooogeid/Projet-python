00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:02,403
Melinda: previously
on "ghost whisperer..."
why do your friends shine?

2
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:04,938
Because they don't have faces.
they're made of light. but they're scared.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,306
What are they scared of,
buddy?

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,042
Of the shadows.
what kind of shadows are those?

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,411
The ones they make
from the parts
that get left behind.

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,046
Parts of what?
people.

7
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,547
Broken people.

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,350
I've been trying
to protect you.

9
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,018
You and melinda.
melinda?

10
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,220
I've said too much.
protect her from what?

11
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,221
Is it the shadows?

12
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,288
Stop asking
so many questions!

13
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,324
Don't ask any
questions at all.

14
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,328
her name's julia miller
and she was a patient.

15
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,597
According to this,
she lives here
at the hospital

16
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,365
Her whole life.

17
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,167
No one can know
i'm here.

18
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,668
Why not?
if they find out,

19
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,104
Something bad will happen.
what?

20
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,707
Something really bad.

21
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,638
oh.

22
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,840
You scared me.

23
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,009
That's not easy
to do. um...

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,178
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,479
I'm waiting for aiden.

26
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,981
Ok, well,
he's at school.

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,217
And you don't
belong here, so...

28
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,186
Have i seen you?
it's his closet,

29
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,221
And he said
i could stay.

30
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,958
Yeah, well,
technically it's my house.

31
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,028
And so i decide
who's staying.

32
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:45,905
Julia miller.

33
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,073
The girl practically
lived here.

34
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,174
Yeah, i knew she
looked familiar.

35
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,009
She had leukemia?
well, she died last week

36
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,644
Of pneumonia,
and her immune system

37
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,346
Couldn't stand
the cancer treatments.

38
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,582
Isn't she the one
who sent you those creepy
sally stitch emails?

39
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,184
One of the many
reasons i don't
want her near our son.

40
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,386
Ok, but i thought
you said ghosts
made her do it.

41
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,223
Well, 11 is a little old
to still be seeing ghosts.

42
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,691
But she was dying.

43
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,226
Maybe she was
sensitive.

44
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,061
No, i don't know
how to explain it.

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,128
There's just something
not right about her.

46
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,797
Says the woman
who just found out

47
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,265
Her son was
keeping a ghost
in his closet?

48
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,900
I have a bad feeling
about this one.

49
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,135
Very bad feeling.

50
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,305
Ok. never
a good sign.

51
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,773
Yeah.

52
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,677
It wasn't really
a secret.

53
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,613
I just didn't
tell you about it.

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,048
Yet.
ok.

55
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,650
But you know you should
have told us that
julia was here.

56
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,018
Right?

57
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,319
She didn't
want me to.

58
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,355
Well, then you
were keeping
a secret, bud.

59
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,623
That's how it works.

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,458
We just don't
have secrets
in our home, ok?

61
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,728
Just with other people?

62
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,230
Look, i know
that that can be confusing.

63
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,632
Um...

64
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,267
But it's not--
it's not good

65
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,935
For julia
to be stuck here.

66
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,105
You know? she's supposed
to be in the light
with other ghosts.

67
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,241
I'm sorry, mom.
hey.

68
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,211
Maybe you can
convince julia
to talk to mom.

69
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,245
Yeah.

70
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,314
She doesn't like
talking to mom.

71
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,416
Why not?

72
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,585
She says
you don't like her.

73
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,587
Why makes her think that?

74
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,590
'cause you don't
want me to learn
how to do magic.

75
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,226
Oh.

76
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,362
Um, you know,
i just--

77
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,599
I just don't like it
when ghosts hide in our house.

78
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,901
Right? but what else
is she doing here?

79
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,970
Besides teaching you
magic tricks?

80
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,705
I don't know.

81
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,940
All she wants
to talk about is magic.

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,144
Well, why don't you
just promise to tell us

83
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,745
Next time's julia's here, ok?

84
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,213
I love you.

85
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,815
Love you, too.
ok.

86
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,850
Bath time.
i don't want a bath.

87
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,452
Ok. all right.

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,221
We'll take some of this
into the bed.

89
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:02,308
Julia, will you please
just talk to me?

90
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,876
Look, i'm not angry
with you.

91
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,916
That is not helping.

93
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,078
What do you want?!

94
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,889
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

95
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:06,469
Sync by honeybunny

96
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,311
Julia miller?
isn't she the same girl

97
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,646
Who was sending
all those awful emails?

98
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,047
Well, that's why
i'm worried.

99
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,849
You know, what
if she's a bad
influence on aiden?

100
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,452
Mel, we do the best we can
to raise our kids.

101
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,187
At some point,
they're going to pick friends

102
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:32,788
That we wish they hadn't,
you know?

103
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:33,990
Living or dead.

104
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:34,991
Don't you remember
that ghost that got ned

105
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,593
To shoplift
from your store?

106
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,595
Exactly, but you didn't
believe me then.

107
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,730
Ok, well, i do now.

108
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,100
And i may not have
any advice how to stop
playdates with ghosts,

109
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,869
But i am telling you,
as a mother,

110
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:46,870
You've got to trust
your instincts.

111
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:48,205
You've got to cut it off.

112
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,440
Yeah, but what
if she's staying
here for something?

113
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,776
Or i can help her?
cut it off.

114
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:02,285
Hey. well,
she's here
right now.

115
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:04,554
Hey, mel, this is
david and linda.

116
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:05,789
These are julia's
parents.
hi.

117
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:08,692
Your husband said
that you wanted
to talk to us.

118
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,328
Something
about julia?

119
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:12,362
I'll be nearby.

120
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,363
Thanks.
thank you.

121
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,397
May i?

122
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:16,900
Sure.

123
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,370
I know about your loss,
and i'm so sorry.

124
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,205
It must be
very difficult for you.

125
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,440
Oh, thank you.

126
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:24,841
There's some comfort
in knowing

127
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:26,643
That our daughter's
finally at peace.

128
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:29,312
I don't know
what jim told you,

129
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,949
And i know that this
is going to sound
a little strange.

130
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,485
But i have a gift.

131
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,354
I can see ghosts.

132
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:40,657
Have you seen
our julia?

133
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:41,925
Yes.

134
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:45,829
She's attached herself
to my 5-year-old son.

135
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,198
Can we talk to her?

136
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,968
She sort of shut us
out of her life
these past few months.

137
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,536
She did?

138
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,972
Yeah. we don't know why.

139
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,841
The doctors say
there may have been

140
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,043
Some psychological issues

141
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,979
That resulted from being
alone in the hospital

142
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,281
For so long.

143
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:07,183
We weren't even
with her when she died.

144
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:10,020
Do you think that
maybe why she's still here?

145
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,921
Because she never
got a chance
to say good-bye?

146
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,757
That might be
a part of it,

147
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,026
But i feel like
there's some
unfinished business

148
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,994
That she's just not
telling me about.

149
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,398
What unfinished business
could an 11-year-old have?

150
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:24,668
You know, we're here to
pick up julia's things.

151
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,670
The nurses said that

152
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:31,207
She did a lot of drawing
and writing.

153
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,909
Well, i guess we could
look at some of those
if you like.

154
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,044
See if we could
find anything.

155
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,211
That would be great.

156
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,479
And if you find anything,

157
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,381
Can you just call me?

158
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,516
Thank you.

159
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,917
Thank you.

160
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:47,624
David: it will be
all right.

161
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,959
But i can still
do magic tricks?

162
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:53,596
Yeah, as long
as they're not
ghost magic tricks.

163
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,708
Julia, what's going on?

164
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,077
It's none
of your business.

165
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:10,146
Look, i understand
that this must be
hard for you.

166
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:11,681
If you just let me,
i can help you.

167
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:14,117
I need aiden,
not you.

168
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,986
Aiden, go upstairs
and play, ok? right now.

169
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,122
Ok. bye, julia.

170
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,591
Right now.

171
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,727
I saw your mom
and dad today.

172
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,528
They're very worried
about you.

173
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:28,298
Look, i get
how confusing
it can be to--

174
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,100
You don't get anything.
you're a grown-up.

175
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:33,136
Whatever's keeping you here,
i can help you.

176
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:34,404
Stop saying
you can help me.

177
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,638
You can't.

178
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,374
If you just
let me, i can.

179
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,142
Jim: hey?
what's going on here?

180
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,077
Julia's here.

181
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:44,948
And, uh,

182
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,750
Where is our son,
aiden?

183
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,018
He is upstairs, ok?
and he's playing
and he's fine.

184
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,120
We're just going
to work this out.

185
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:51,855
No. it's not fine.
no, we're not

186
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,391
Going to work
this out right now.

187
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,559
We're going to put
these knives in here,

188
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,461
And i want julia
out of this house.

189
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,331
Julia, can you hear me?
i want you out of my house

190
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,234
And i want you
to leave my son
alone, got it?

191
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,869
Do you hear me?

192
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:06,970
Jim...

193
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,540
Does that mean
she's gone?

194
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,175
For now.

195
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,345
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

196
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,820
So, was julia around
last night?

197
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:26,489
No. i think she's gone.

198
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:27,824
That's probably
for the best.

199
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:28,925
You understand that,
right?

200
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:30,226
Yeah.

201
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:31,828
Is it ok to miss her?

202
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:33,396
Of course it is,
sweetie.

203
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:36,232
Drink your juice,
it's good for you.

204
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,303
oh, my god,
aiden, don't drink that!

205
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,771
Aiden!

206
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,162
Aiden?

207
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,338
Aiden!

208
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,474
Aiden!

209
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,476
Jim, i can't find aiden!
hmm?!

210
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,511
Aiden?!

211
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,379
Jim: i'll check
outside!

212
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,949
Aiden!

213
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,417
Baby!

214
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,285
Jim: aiden! aiden!

215
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:31,354
Aiden, where are you?!

216
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:39,996
Aiden!

217
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,165
I can't find him
anywhere.

218
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,334
Oh, my god.

219
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:46,436
Jim, i have searched
every inch of this house.

220
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:48,505
Honey, honey,
calm down.
it'll be ok.

221
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:50,740
I'm going to call
the police,
we'll call everyone.

222
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,012
Hello?
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

223
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,414
My son is missing!

224
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,769
Melinda, honey.

225
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:10,671
Have you heard
anything?

226
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,740
No, nothing.
listen, i sent you
a picture.

227
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,709
If you could just
send it to everyone you know.

228
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,077
Ok, sure.

229
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,812
Where's jim?
he's, i don't know,

230
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,081
Driving the neighborhoods,
waking up people.

231
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:21,549
The police on their way,
and eli, he went straight

232
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:22,817
To detective blair.
all right.

233
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,151
Well, do you think
it's julia?

234
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,987
She took him. i know it.
the mcallisters, the taubs,

235
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,389
I went as far
as the playground.
nothing.

236
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,857
She's not going to take him
somewhere we've looked.

237
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,560
He's five. technically,
how far can he get?

238
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:33,894
I mean, can a ghost even
move him like that?

239
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:35,596
He'd be moving on his own.

240
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:37,231
Then that means
he's in walking range.

241
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,133
Why is he doing this?
he knows better.

242
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,334
He probably
felt sorry for her.

243
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:42,002
Or she tricked him,
i don't know.

244
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,437
But if i have to stay
in this house for five
more minutes without him,

245
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:44,638
I'm going to lose my mind.

246
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:45,873
Look, i'm going
to go to main street

247
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:47,675
And i'm going to go west
and south, all right?

248
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:48,709
You guys go south
and east, please.

249
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,878
I'm just gonna stay here,

250
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,446
In case the police come
or anybody calls.

251
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,948
I'll be here.
do you have your cell phone?

252
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:55,883
Yeah, in my purse.

253
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,918
Where are my car keys?

254
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,253
Mel...
not now.

255
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,821
Detective blair
needs to ask you
some questions.

256
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,823
Look, you have the photo
and delia and eli

257
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,225
Will catch you up
on everything.

258
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,526
Right now,
nothing else matters.

259
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,861
All right, well,
the police are
already canvassing,

260
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,329
But there are details
i need to hear from you,

261
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,764
Specifics that could help us
find your child.

262
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,565
He's with a dead little girl
who doesn't care

263
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,235
Whether he lives or dies.

264
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:16,570
Does that help you?

265
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,339
A dead girl?

266
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,141
A ghost.

267
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,942
Throughout the years,
the cases we've
helped you with,

268
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,911
The bodies we've found,

269
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:26,814
It's because melinda
can see spirits
and i can, well--

270
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,784
It's just a lot
to explain.

271
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,652
Ok.

272
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
Ok.

273
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:35,256
Just give me a chance
to filter the right
information

274
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,158
To my officers.
thank you.

275
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,672
I don't understand.

276
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,174
Where are we going?

277
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:54,408
It's a surprise.

278
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:55,810
It's going to be fun.

279
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:59,113
I'm not supposed
to go anywhere but
school on my own.

280
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:01,248
You'll be home soon.
they won't even miss you.

281
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:03,317
When you show them
the things i'm going
to show you,

282
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:04,451
They'll understand.

283
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,920
I don't know.

284
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,521
I know some
really good magic.

285
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,226
You can do things,
things you don't
even know about.

286
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:14,395
Ok, come on.
you have to get on.

287
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,565
Does it cost money?

288
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,201
See that mom and those kids?

289
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:22,336
Go with them,
but stay right behind them.

290
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:23,637
The bus driver

291
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,873
Will think
you're with them.
come on, hurry.

292
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,495
He's not at school.

293
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,030
They checked the grounds
and surrounding areas.

294
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,465
He's on a bus.

295
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,401
A city bus. white,

296
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:29,336
With red stripes.
i couldn't see
a logo or a number.

297
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:30,571
Where did you see--

298
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,407
Please, don't ask me
how i know that.

299
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:35,142
I was going to ask you
where the bus was going.

300
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,377
If you saw where
it was headed.

301
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:37,745
Any direction,
any landmarks.

302
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,213
No.

303
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:42,616
I've got an update.

304
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:45,586
Check city busses,
driscoll county
transit line.

305
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,722
Aiden!

306
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,257
I'm talking about
any county bus

307
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,592
Within five miles
of this area.

308
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,260
Notify the drivers,
pull them all over.

309
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,595
I don't care.

310
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:55,763
We're looking for a boy
with a blue backpack.

311
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:57,231
Ned!

312
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,099
I'm sorry.
my cell was off

313
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,668
And i slept
on campus last night.

314
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,169
It's ok, honey,
you're here.

315
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:04,171
Did you hear anything?
no.

316
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,372
Well, there's
a couple outside

317
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,640
That are looking
to talk to melinda.

318
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,676
She just left.

319
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:12,546
Well, then i think maybe
we should talk to them.

320
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,717
Eli: are those julia's
things from the hospital?

321
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:17,785
Yeah, we--
ahh.

322
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:21,055
Julia did a lot of
writing and drawing

323
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:24,625
To keep herself
company.

324
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:25,626
Um...

325
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:27,227
It's hard to, ahh...

326
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,297
Um--

327
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:31,498
Why don't you tell us

328
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,534
What you found.

329
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:38,072
She wrote down
her thoughts and...

330
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,274
Some of them
were so dark.

331
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:43,577
She wrote about
something she did,

332
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:46,613
Something terrible
to a friend of hers.

333
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,782
She said...

334
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,251
Mrs. miller.

335
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,554
Aiden's been missing
for over two hours now.

336
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,655
He's five.

337
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:57,458
You have to tell us
what your daughter did.

338
00:15:57,525 --> 00:16:00,361
She was so lonely.
she made things up.

339
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:01,695
Please. we need to know.

340
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,331
Um, she, uh,

341
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,334
She talks about this
one friend.

342
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:10,504
It was a girl.
she didn't say who,

343
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:13,540
But julia seems
to think that,

344
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:14,942
Um...

345
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,911
She claims
she killed her.

346
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,718
Excuse me.

347
00:16:28,423 --> 00:16:30,090
Melinda?

348
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:31,925
Are you driving?

349
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:34,028
Pull over
for a second.

350
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,697
There's something
you should know.

351
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:42,903
Bus driver:
this is woodland avenue.

352
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:45,806
This stop for transfers
to green line, westbound.

353
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,754
Come on, aiden, hurry.

354
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:06,960
Where are we?

355
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,262
We'll just take
a shortcut.

356
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,264
Follow me, ok?

357
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,801
Do you know
a secret or something?
yes.

358
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,470
But first, i'm going
to show you something.

359
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,138
I'm going to teach you
how to disappear.

360
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,875
Officer on radio: dispatch,
this is one, zero, two.

361
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:24,878
Boy with blue backback
boarding green line
westbound bus.

362
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,780
I'm in pursuit.

363
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,084
President bedford?

364
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,452
Professor james.

365
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,120
What are you doing here?

366
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,156
that's a good question.

367
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:15,125
Wait, you know something
about melinda's son?

368
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:16,894
I don't know where he is.

369
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:19,630
I just know that
you're barking up
the wrong tree.

370
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,932
How?

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,368
I've spent some time
at that hospital.

372
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,969
Your mother.
you visit her every day.

373
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,938
And i've learned
a few things.

374
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,508
That girl, the ghost...

375
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:34,945
She's not what
you're up against.

376
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,514
I don't understand.
she didn't take aiden?

377
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,184
She did, but only
because she's scared.

378
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:41,585
She's a scared little girl.

379
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,988
She's watched too many
of her friends waste away.

380
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,223
And after they died,

381
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,726
Something she had to watch
even worse.

382
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,361
Worse how?

383
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,662
Eli, i warned you.

384
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,331
I warned you to stay
out of their business.

385
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,133
Who? the shadows?

386
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,835
What's all this
really about?
i don't understand.

387
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,203
The shadows
get you installed

388
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,371
As the university
president,

389
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:01,939
And they're responsible
for this dead girl

390
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,107
Somehow?

391
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:05,008
Melinda was warned
to leave julia alone.

392
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,343
She should listen.

393
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,778
What, the message
in her kitchen?

394
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,280
She tried to get
that girl to cross over
into the light.

395
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,448
Is that a bad thing?
what do the shadows

396
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:12,483
Have against
going into the light?

397
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,685
I'm taking a huge risk
just being here.

398
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,020
Hold on!
are you saying
the shadows

399
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,355
Had something to do with
what happened to aiden?

400
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,157
All i'm saying
is if you and melinda

401
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,126
Aren't careful,
they will.

402
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,495
They will.

403
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,669
If i'd have known
he was on his own,

404
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,104
I wouldn't let him
get on the bus.

405
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,672
Who did he get on with?

406
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,074
I saw him get on
with his family.

407
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,909
No, look,
i'm his family,
all right?

408
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,278
I'm his father.
this is my son.

409
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,347
See? you sure this is
the boy you saw?

410
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,615
Yeah, that's him.

411
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,450
I already
told the police.

412
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,853
Look, if it's
any consolation,
he seemed ok.

413
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:50,854
Thanks.

414
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,689
Except...
except what?

415
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:55,759
Well, at one point,
i noticed the seat
next to him was empty.

416
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,127
But he was talking.

417
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,328
To himself, i guess.

418
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,897
To be honest,
that's the only reason

419
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,198
I gave him
a second though.

420
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,400
But then, i've got
to keep my eyes
on the road.

421
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,203
Do you remember
where he got off?
did you notice?

422
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,838
I'm pretty sure it was
along woodland avenue,

423
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,173
The stop by
the highway.

424
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,474
By the on-ramp?

425
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,476
The stop's a way
from the entrance.
yeah.

426
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,644
There's not much else
there--another bus stop,

427
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:14,978
Some woods.

428
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,313
Oh, man. thanks.

429
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,649
Look, mister...

430
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,417
I'm sorry.

431
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,821
Don't be.
i'll find him.

432
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,423
Delia: have you
found anything?

433
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,593
Just kid's stuff.
a lot of poems about

434
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,562
Being alone, sick, angry.

435
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:32,863
She hated ivs.

436
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,897
And some of the nurses.

437
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,299
And all of her medicine.

438
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,305
How are we supposed
to do this?

439
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,707
Bit by bit,
until we find out
what's keeping her here.

440
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,576
What's keeping her here
is that she was a bad kid

441
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:48,145
Who hung out
with bad ghosts.

442
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,780
I mean, right here
it says that sally stitch

443
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,649
Was a real ghost
and that julia did
everything she asked.

444
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:53,817
And bedford said
this girl

445
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:54,952
Isn't the one we should
be worrying about.

446
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,386
Why are you taking
his word for anything?

447
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,689
I mean, look at this.

448
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,424
Julia goes on and on
about killing a friend.

449
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:04,294
And this whole journal
is full of the words
"it's my fault."

450
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:06,663
I mean, you tell me.
how do you get

451
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:10,100
A child sociopath
to let go of aiden
and go into the light?

452
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,769
Sociopaths
don't feel guilt.

453
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:14,605
Delia: yeah,
they don't have
friends, either.

454
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,874
Have you really
looked at these books?

455
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,176
It seems that
many of them

456
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,678
Belong to a girl
named lily.

457
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,815
I saw that name
somewhere else.

458
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:27,818
Here it is.

459
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,586
This weird food list.

460
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:30,787
Let me see it.

461
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,190
Like some kind of haiku poem.

462
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,193
This isn't a list.

463
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,395
This is a diet.
for lily.

464
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,835
Ned: "tuesday, ketchup.
wednesday, bacon."

465
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,136
Bacon and one lemon.

466
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,472
That's it?
for the whole day?

467
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,708
"thursday, cure berries
from the magic bush

468
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,510
By the dolphin
fountain."

469
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,012
That fountain's in
the back of the hospital

470
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,647
In the garden.
there's some bushes
back there,

471
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,649
But i doubt they're edible.

472
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,652
Cure berries.

473
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,590
Don't you see?

474
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,294
hello.

475
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:12,462
Delia: mel,
i don't know if you
want to hear this.

476
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,098
But maybe, just maybe
julia miller

477
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,633
Isn't as bad
as we thought.

478
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:17,901
Melinda: i would love
to hear that.

479
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,337
It's possible she killed
her friend by mistake.

480
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,973
By doing something
the shadows
asked her to do?

481
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,309
By making some kind
of potion to cure her friend

482
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,977
Out of bacons, lemons, and--

483
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,211
It's not important.

484
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,846
What's important is,
i think she might have

485
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,548
Picked the berries
that have killed
her friend.

486
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,717
Didn't you once
have a nightmare

487
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,218
Where you nearly
poisoned aiden?

488
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:36,520
I had a vision.

489
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,121
I could see a girl.

490
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,523
I don't know
if it was julia
or her friend,

491
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,291
But they had
gotten sick.

492
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,826
Eli: bedford
said something
about julia

493
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,395
Having a bunch of friends
at the hospital

494
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,730
Like, waste away.

495
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,266
Maybe she tried
to do something about it.

496
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,368
I hope you're right.

497
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,576
Aiden: how long
do i have to wear this?

498
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,745
Julia: not much longer.

499
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,981
Are we getting close?

500
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,183
Just keep going straight.

501
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,318
The ground's pretty flat.

502
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,988
We're almost there.

503
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,075
You can take off
your blindfold now.

504
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,252
I don't know
this place.

505
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,754
Are we at
the train station?

506
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:45,055
Sort of.

507
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,590
Is this a surprise?

508
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,025
Yeah.

509
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,194
Why did i have
to cover my eyes?

510
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,030
I, uh,

511
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,999
Just thought
it'd be more fun.

512
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,802
I'm hungry.

513
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,271
I guess you don't
have any snacks.

514
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,874
Why isn't there
anyone here?

515
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,309
I thought there'd be
kids here.

516
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:08,979
Kids love
this place.

517
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,482
It's happy.

518
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,650
Safe.

519
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,519
It's getting dark.

520
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,754
I want to go home.

521
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,356
We can't.

522
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,524
I can't.

523
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,492
We can find a grown-up
and call my mom.

524
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,727
She'll send me away.

525
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,828
Just to the light.

526
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,196
You'll like it.
it's nice.

527
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,798
You don't know that.

528
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,366
You don't know anything,

529
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,668
And neither does she.

530
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:37,741
Why is your voice
sounding mean?

531
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,309
I--i can't go home,

532
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,211
And i can't
go into the light.

533
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,580
If i do,
they'll get hurt.

534
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,382
Who?

535
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,085
All the spirits
that were nice to me.

536
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:49,419
The good ones.

537
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,620
Ghosts don't get hurt.

538
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,122
My mom says
they can't feel pain.

539
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,523
She's wrong.

540
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:54,524
We do.

541
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:56,560
How?

542
00:24:56,627 --> 00:25:00,363
It's an uh-oh feeling.
you know, like when

543
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:01,732
You've done
something wrong.

544
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,867
It's all you can
think about.

545
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,803
The bad thing you did.

546
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:08,972
All of the bad things
you did.

547
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,675
And it grows
and grows until
that's all you are.

548
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,777
You're nothing else.

549
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,347
It eats you up
completely.

550
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,752
It's coming for me.

551
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,020
I know it.

552
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:00,873
This is it,
this is it. aiden!

553
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,908
Aiden, can you hear me?

554
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:04,109
Aiden!

555
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:05,544
The bus driver
said it was this stop.

556
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,012
Aiden!

557
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,581
Aiden, no matter what
julia said,

558
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,183
It's not all right to hide.

559
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:14,153
Aiden, if you can
hear my voice...

560
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:16,388
Damn it.

561
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:23,595
What the hell
is that?

562
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:33,272
Aiden?!

563
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:34,740
Aiden!

564
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,042
Aiden, i know
this is yours! aiden!

565
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,846
jim?

566
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:43,849
Hey! did you find him?
jim: no.

567
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:46,218
No, but he was here.
he was here by this bus stop.

568
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:47,853
Look, i just found
a little silver car

569
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:49,088
That he must have
just dropped.

570
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:50,989
I called the police.

571
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:52,324
Are you sure
it's his?

572
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,460
Yeah. because...

573
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:56,261
It's got the little
scratch on it

574
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,030
Where i showed him how
to use the sliding board
for a jump.

575
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:02,234
Honey, when we find him,
i swear...

576
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:03,502
I know.

577
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,205
You're never going
to leave the house again.

578
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:07,906
Where did you find
the toy?

579
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:09,374
Just at the edge
of the woods.

580
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:10,609
He must have been
playing with it

581
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:11,910
On the bus when
he dropped it.

582
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,412
She probably led him
into the woods.

583
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,547
You know, to keep him
out of sight.

584
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:16,715
All right,
i'm going in there.

585
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:18,550
Ok, well, just call me
if you see anything.

586
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:20,686
You know it.
i love you.

587
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:22,488
I love you, too.

588
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,869
What do the shadows
want with my son?

589
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:37,970
Carl: i don't know.

590
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:39,204
I don't
have time, carl!

591
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,472
I'm aware of that, melinda.

592
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,241
No, bedford
just told eli

593
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:43,842
That they
threatened my son

594
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,711
If i crossed julia
over into the light,

595
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,212
Which means they were
the ones who moved
that furniture.

596
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,447
What i don't
know is why.

597
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:49,615
I don't know, either,
melinda.

598
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:50,949
How can you
not know?

599
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:52,251
What the hell
are you seeing, carl,

600
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:53,318
When you're doing
all this watching?

601
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:55,787
Not the shadows.
i told you that.

602
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,956
Ghosts can't see
the shadows.

603
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:00,859
No one i know sees them,
except...

604
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:01,860
Aiden.

605
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:03,428
He sees those others.

606
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:04,530
The shinies.

607
00:28:04,597 --> 00:28:06,598
And if those beings,
whatever they are,

608
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,635
Fear the shadows,
i'm guessing--

609
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:12,905
Guessing they co-exist
on the same plane.

610
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:16,175
Really? carl, that's
the best you can do?

611
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,712
we hear rumors.

612
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,414
We hear whispers.

613
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:23,682
What?

614
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:26,685
Whatever they are,
wherever they live,

615
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,887
These shadows
are very interested

616
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:30,489
In children, melinda.

617
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:32,691
Especially ghost children.

618
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,293
Why?

619
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,462
No one seems to know.

620
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,831
Are you telling me

621
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:43,101
That the shadows
want to turn my son
into a ghost?

622
00:28:44,337 --> 00:28:47,706
I told you,
i don't know.

623
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:52,778
Then at least tell me,

624
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:54,379
Do you have some idea
where he went?

625
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:58,116
I can't--i can't.
he's hidden from me.
how?

626
00:28:58,184 --> 00:29:00,886
I can't see clearly.
my vision,

627
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:04,556
It's filled with pictures
from my past.

628
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:08,594
Everywhere i look,
it's like an endless
slide show

629
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,529
Of every mistake
i made in my life.

630
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:12,297
It's like a sickness of guilt.

631
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,266
Is that why
you seem so weak?

632
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,736
Oh.

633
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,972
It's the shadows.

634
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,907
If that's true...

635
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:24,643
Do everything you can,
melinda,

636
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:25,811
Not to anger them.

637
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:28,180
I will do anything
to get my son back.

638
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:29,581
Just don't anger them.

639
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:32,818
I will do anything.

640
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:35,654
hello?

641
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:37,122
Jim: mel, i just talked
to detective blair.

642
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,690
She's going to send
a search party
up to these woods.

643
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:39,958
Ok, well,
did you find anything?

644
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,727
It's weird.
i found a little
yellow school bus,

645
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:43,128
And i'm pretty sure
that it's aiden's.

646
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:45,430
something else shiny.

647
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:46,565
What are you getting at?

648
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,667
Last night,
in the kitchen, um,

649
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:49,868
Everything was shiny.

650
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:51,370
You know, remember?

651
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:54,139
Remember, aiden said
that the shadows
and the shinies,

652
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:55,641
That they hate each other?

653
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,743
Well, what if julia
put all that stuff
out there because

654
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,177
She was trying
to keep the shadows away

655
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:00,512
And attract the shinies?

656
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,647
Wait, do you think
that's why

657
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:03,482
They brought
these toys with them?

658
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,117
I don't know,
maybe. carl--

659
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,619
Carl?

660
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:11,323
Wait a minute. oh!

661
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:12,924
Melinda,
i found another one.

662
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,293
It's a little
tiny train.

663
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,728
He's not dropping
that stuff on accident.

664
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:18,563
So what do you think,
he's leaving a trail
of bread crumbs?

665
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:19,731
He's trying to tell us
something.

666
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,466
The car, the bus,
the train--

667
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:22,668
It all has
to do with travel.

668
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:24,169
Wait a minute,
travel town.

669
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:26,104
Remember that place?
it's nearby here.

670
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:27,873
But it shut down
a couple years ago.

671
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,841
The ghost
wouldn't know that.

672
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:31,310
She's been in the hospital.

673
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:34,212
It is right
where i'm headed.

674
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,580
I'll meet you there.

675
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:47,626
Julia: don't go!
don't leave me!

676
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:50,062
I want to go home.

677
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:51,163
There must be a phone,

678
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,898
Or a grown-up
to ask for help.

679
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:55,834
It's getting too dark.
it's not safe.

680
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:58,236
This isn't
the train station.

681
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,272
What is it?

682
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,740
It's travel town.

683
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:04,276
I used to come here
with my parents.

684
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:06,411
Why didn't you
tell me that?

685
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:09,414
I didn't want you to know,
or your mom would find out.

686
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:10,549
How would my mom
find out?

687
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:13,051
She never told you?

688
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,653
She can see
what you can see.

689
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,789
It's like
she's spying on you.

690
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:18,890
I've watched her.

691
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,392
She can see it all.

692
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,365
Where you going?

693
00:31:26,432 --> 00:31:28,533
There's a light
over there.

694
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:43,215
Aiden: hello?

695
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:44,616
Hello?

696
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:48,186
I don't
like it here.

697
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,021
I want to go
some place safe.

698
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,491
My mom says
ghosts are safe
in the light.

699
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:54,693
You should go in the light.

700
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:55,794
You sill trust her?

701
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:58,430
After she lied to you?

702
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:01,400
Just look around
and see if you can
find the light.

703
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:04,403
It's too dark
in here.

704
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:12,477
I can feel them.

705
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:15,280
They're here.

706
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,256
Stay close to me.

707
00:32:24,323 --> 00:32:26,425
Aiden!

708
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:27,459
I'm scared.

709
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:30,462
I'm scared,
i'm scared!

710
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,398
I can't see them!
where are they?

711
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:35,801
Close your eyes.

712
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,570
I'm scared,
i'm scared!

713
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:41,373
Keep your eyes
closed.

714
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:51,817
What's happening to me?!

715
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,025
I can still see
everything!

716
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,493
All the bad stuff.

717
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:11,470
All the bad stuff
i've ever done!

718
00:33:11,537 --> 00:33:13,472
It's everywhere i look!

719
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:18,910
It's everywhere.

720
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:20,011
I hate you
for putting me here!

721
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,447
I just want to die!

722
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:24,983
No!

723
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:26,885
Aiden: no! please, no!

724
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,654
It eats you up completely.

725
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:33,725
No! stop!

726
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:44,477
Aiden, get out.

727
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:46,147
And your backpack, quick!

728
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,985
Hurry, aiden, hurry!

729
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:16,108
Where are you?

730
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,344
Come on!

731
00:34:20,113 --> 00:34:21,414
Julia:
what's happening?!

732
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:22,548
Aiden:
the shinies...

733
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:24,617
They won't come in.
they're too scared.

734
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:27,920
The other shadows
are keeping them out!

735
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:30,823
I need help!

736
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:33,853
Aiden: are you ok?

737
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,989
It was so awful!

738
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,999
Melinda: aiden?
aiden!

739
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,301
Jim: mel!

740
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:50,836
Aiden!

741
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:52,204
Mom, dad!

742
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,074
Oh, my god!

743
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,477
My baby!
aiden, are you all right?

744
00:35:58,545 --> 00:36:00,045
Oh, little buddy!
we're so happy to see you!

745
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:02,014
Oh! honey!

746
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:03,349
Are you ok?!

747
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,750
Oh, you really
scared me, man.

748
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:05,918
You really had us scared.

749
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:07,486
I know. me, too.

750
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:09,488
Come here.

751
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:12,925
Oh, what were you thinking,
you crazy kid?

752
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:15,027
Cop: is he ok?

753
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:31,076
Jim: hey, officer.
yeah, we got him,
he's ok.

754
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,714
Melinda: it's safe
to come out now.

755
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,583
Are you sure?

756
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:39,885
Aiden says
there's no shadows.

757
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:42,955
And there's some people
that you need to see.

758
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:52,932
It's ok.

759
00:36:58,338 --> 00:36:59,705
Mom and dad?

760
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:01,240
Linda: is she here?

761
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,544
They came to say
good-bye.

762
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:07,546
It's time
for you to go
into the light.

763
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:09,048
No, i can't.
i can't do that.

764
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:10,983
Because you were
told that something
bad would happen

765
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:12,618
To your ghost
friends if you did.

766
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,954
Did aiden tell you that?

767
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:17,223
He was worried
about you.

768
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,291
He saw what happened to me.
i know.

769
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,093
But i'm going
to make sure that
your friends are ok.

770
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:22,127
How?

771
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:24,396
By getting some help
from my friends.

772
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,432
I want you
to meet them.

773
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:30,936
Julia: what will you do?

774
00:37:31,004 --> 00:37:33,272
Well, we have
some things
the shadows don't.

775
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:34,573
We have a book,

776
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:37,309
And we have lots
of ghost friends
of our own.

777
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:38,744
We'll find a way.

778
00:37:38,812 --> 00:37:41,013
But right now,
we need to get you
into the light.

779
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:44,416
Julia, hi. my name's ned.

780
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:45,818
I hope you don't mind,

781
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,920
But we read some
of the things you wrote
in the hospital,

782
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:48,921
About lily.

783
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,656
Eli: and we pieced
everything together.

784
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:52,091
And we want you
to understand--

785
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:53,826
You didn't
hurt your friend.

786
00:37:53,894 --> 00:37:57,563
Jim: julia, when
you were in the hospital

787
00:37:57,631 --> 00:37:59,298
And you made those potions,

788
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,800
You weren't just
playing doctor.

789
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:04,236
You were trying
to make a real cure
for your friend lily.

790
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:06,672
I mean, something
the regular doctors
couldn't do.

791
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,173
But i didn't help her.

792
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:10,876
I made her more sick,
and then she died.

793
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,846
She thinks
that she made her
more sick,

794
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:15,314
And that's why
she died.

795
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,349
Oh, that's not true, honey.

796
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:19,318
You only think that
because she went
into the hospital

797
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,253
After you gave her
your potion.

798
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:23,656
But she was sicker
than you knew,

799
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:24,790
A lot sicker.

800
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:26,125
What do you mean?

801
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:27,893
She doesn't
understand.

802
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:30,296
Uh...

803
00:38:30,363 --> 00:38:32,531
Lily had the same thing
you had, darling.

804
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,333
Lily had leukemia.

805
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:36,335
But you told me
she had a bug.

806
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:38,871
She remembers you
calling lily's
disease just a bug.

807
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:40,773
Darling, we--

808
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,742
We didn't know
that you'd given her
that potion.

809
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:47,046
We didn't realize
that you'd thought
you'd made her more sick.

810
00:38:47,113 --> 00:38:49,415
But why didn't you tell me
she had leukemia?

811
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:52,585
She just wishes you could
have told her the truth
about lily's disease.

812
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:54,286
Oh, baby.

813
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:56,622
We were afraid
that you would think

814
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,390
You might die
like she did.

815
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,392
But i did.

816
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,494
But she did.

817
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:04,396
Yeah.

818
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:06,565
Not for years.

819
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:11,070
In all that time,
you had hope.

820
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:12,605
I thought lily had hope, too.

821
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:14,573
I thought i gave it to her.

822
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:16,976
She feels guilty.

823
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:18,043
She feels like
she gave lily

824
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:20,346
A false sense of hope.

825
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:23,115
Don't you know,
sweetheart?

826
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:26,085
You gave her something
better than hope.

827
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:28,954
You gave her a friend.

828
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,389
Lily's parents told us

829
00:39:30,457 --> 00:39:32,224
That those last months
you spent together,

830
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:35,728
Those were
the happiest times
she ever had.

831
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:45,004
She sees it.

832
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:46,639
She sees the light.

833
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:53,278
I'm afraid something bad
will happen to my friends.

834
00:39:53,346 --> 00:39:55,280
Julia,
look into the light.

835
00:39:55,348 --> 00:39:56,782
Try really hard.

836
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,584
You might see
some of your friends.

837
00:39:58,652 --> 00:40:00,853
Once you've crossed over.
aiden: really look.

838
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,088
You can make them
appear.

839
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,024
Just like magic.

840
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,662
There she is.

841
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:11,030
I see lily.

842
00:40:11,097 --> 00:40:14,033
She's smiling at me.

843
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,068
Lily's there.

844
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:19,805
Go in, darling.

845
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:23,842
Wait for us.

846
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,045
We'll be there soon.

847
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,916
Bye, mommy.

848
00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:33,052
Bye, daddy.

849
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:44,496
?seasons change ?

850
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:48,434
?treetops sway ?

851
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:49,635
She's gone.

852
00:40:49,703 --> 00:40:52,571
?i am young today ?

853
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:57,943
?children play ?

854
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:01,647
?sidewalk games ?

855
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:04,516
?as i dream ?

856
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:08,120
?away ?

857
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:10,589
?that someday
i'll float away ?

858
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:12,624
Ok, now remember--
anyone, person

859
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:13,892
Or a ghost tries
to tell you
to do something

860
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,860
That you know
is wrong...

861
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:17,095
I know, mommy.

862
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:18,963
I won't.

863
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:21,132
It's important, aiden.
i know.

864
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,067
I'm sorry i scared you guys.

865
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:24,636
You really did.

866
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:27,372
But we're proud
of you for wanting
to help someone.

867
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,874
Just remember
that most of the time

868
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:31,876
Helping somebody is not
a little person's job.

869
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:34,045
It's a big person's
job, ok?

870
00:41:34,113 --> 00:41:36,414
I get it.
all right.

871
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:38,316
Can i have my backpack?

872
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,620
There you go.

873
00:41:46,258 --> 00:41:49,827
Percy. i didn't know
she packed percy.

874
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:52,297
Who did? julia?

875
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:53,665
But wait a minute--

876
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:55,333
Julia didn't want us
to find you, so...

877
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,669
If you didn't
pack your backpack,

878
00:41:57,736 --> 00:42:02,173
Who packed the toys
that left the trail
for us to find?

879
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:04,542
The shinies.

880
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,810
They led us to him.

881
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:07,812
They--they knew you were
going to be in travel town.

882
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,814
They had to.

883
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:11,716
Because julia
blindfolded me.

884
00:42:11,784 --> 00:42:14,252
So they couldn't see
the stuff i saw.

885
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,987
Like usual.

886
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,689
What do you mean?

887
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:19,490
Julia told me the truth.

888
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:22,026
That you can see
everything i see.

889
00:42:22,094 --> 00:42:23,895
Melinda: not everything.

890
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:26,397
Just some things?
which ones?

891
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:28,499
I don't really
know how it works, baby.

892
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,635
I--i think it's just
the things i need to see.

893
00:42:30,703 --> 00:42:32,470
But you said no secrets.

894
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:33,838
Why'd you
keep them from me?

895
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:37,041
I hated doing that.
i really did.

896
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:39,043
It's just,
sometimes moms and dads,

897
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:41,446
They--they have
to keep secrets.

898
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:44,315
You know, to make
the world feel
a little bit safer.

899
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:46,250
But it isn't.

900
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,187
Jim: hey, aiden,
mostly it's safe.

901
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:50,888
Really. it's just,

902
00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:52,357
There are some
places that--

903
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:53,958
Like where the shadows live.

904
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:55,893
Yes.

905
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:58,730
Like where the shadows live,
and we shouldn't go there.

906
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:00,231
Not ever.

907
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:03,034
But what if we have to?

908
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,570
I hope we won't.

909
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:08,840
You don't have
to tell me.

910
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,775
Oh, ok.

911
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:12,076
Come on, baby.

912
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:13,644
Scoot down.

913
00:43:13,712 --> 00:43:15,713
?straight for the stars ?

914
00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:22,714
