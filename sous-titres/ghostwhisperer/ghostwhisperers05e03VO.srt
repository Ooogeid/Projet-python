1
00:00:33,657 --> 00:00:34,924
I hate to tell you this,

2
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,659
but he does not want to be a doctor when he grows up.

3
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:39,295
He let me know this morning he would like to be a mail carrier.

4
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,030
From a doctor to a mail carrier.

5
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:43,032
Who works for the Pony Express.

6
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:45,368
Wait a minute.

7
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:46,803
Were there any ghosts involved in this last night?

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,604
No, we were just watching an old western on tv.

9
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:50,273
You know what, not everything is paranormal.

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,808
Some things are just normal.

11
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,643
Not usually between the two of us.

12
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:58,114
Come on, it's heartburn from that damn keen-wa stir-fry.

13
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,550
Your little health nut friend better start working on his English.

14
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:02,919
I told him "no peppers," not "mo' peppers."

15
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:05,621
Ray, I know you scarfed a foot-long from the street cart.

16
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,156
There's mustard on your tie.

17
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:08,891
What is Eli's dad doing here?

18
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,892
Mr. James?

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,227
What? Melanie?

20
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,562
What the hell are you doing here?

21
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:14,731
Melinda. This is my husband. He's a doctor here.

22
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,632
- Are you ok?  - I'm fine.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,235
I mean Case here's worked up over a bout of indigestion.

24
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:21,237
- It's nothing.  - He's having trouble breathing,

25
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:22,405
Chest pains.

26
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,040
Feeling any numbness in your left arm

27
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:25,174
or any pain in your jaw?

28
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:27,176
Of course I'm numb and in pain. I'm old.

29
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:29,946
But I'm leaving here before you charge me for talking to you.

30
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,748
Mr. James, you could be having a heart attack, ok?

31
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,649
An actual coronary. I need a wheelchair.

32
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:35,251
Look, my coronary is fine.

33
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,588
I just need to get back on the "shut up, Casey" diet.

34
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,690
The only reason I do it is so she'll stop nagging me.

35
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,258
I pay her to keep the books,

36
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:45,928
Not harass me every time I look longingly at...

37
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:47,096
A damn French...

38
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:48,464
Mr. James?

39
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:49,832
It's gas.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,933
Everybody, stand back.

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,404
Wait a minute. We need a cardio work-up now.

42
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,907
Mr. James, you're gonna be all right.

43
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,542
- Go, go. Take her.  - Casey!

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,743
We'll look after him.

45
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,173
I got your message. What's going on?

46
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:03,746
Your dad might be having a heart attack.

47
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,581
- Dad!  - Don't "dad" me.

48
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,283
It's not a heart attack. I just need a bromo.

49
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,419
He came into the shop after lunch complaining of chest pains.

50
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:12,522
He should have retired years ago.

51
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:13,473
Are you kidding me?

52
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:16,651
The screen door king's not abdicating anytime soon.

53
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,960
Hi. Um, I'm Casey.

54
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:19,962
My mom and Eli's dad are business partners.

55
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,697
Right. We met at the grand reopening.

56
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,099
God, I sure hope he's ok.

57
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,667
He's fine. Excuse me.

58
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,903
Now, come on, take your mind off it.

59
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,946
You're Eli's mom.

60
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,281
Evelyn.

61
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:41,083
I'm sorry. I've never been very good at charades.

62
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,418
I don't understand.

63
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:44,844
Eli told me that you died 7 years ago.

64
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,255
We both thought you went into the light.

65
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,491
Nope, not me. Not yet.

66
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,278
Well, if there's something keeping you here,

67
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:51,190
you know that Eli can help.

68
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,929
I mean, did you know that he can hear you?

69
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:55,097
Oh, yes. People gossip on this side,

70
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,400
And I check in on him from time to time,

71
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:00,870
But you never know what you might pop in on, so.

72
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,972
Well, haven't you ever wanted to talk to him?

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,740
Of course I have.

74
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:07,643
But what man wants to be haunted by his mother?

75
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,445
Besides, I need your help.

76
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:11,714
Ok, but Eli's your son.

77
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:12,934
I mean, it might be good for both of you...

78
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,144
It's not for me. It's for Ray.

79
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:16,519
He's not well, you know.

80
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,921
He's going to be on this side soon.

81
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,636
Very soon.

82
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:23,226
I should call my mom.

83
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,094
That's gonna be really hard for Eli.

84
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,596
Exactly.

85
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,266
And he'll want to help his father.

86
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:32,168
That's the kind of man he is.

87
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:34,737
But that wouldn't be the brightest idea.

88
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:36,172
The two of them have never real...

89
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,773
Oh, no.

90
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,443
Cut the chit-chat.

91
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,111
Let's get the hell out of here, huh.

92
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,779
Come on, I'm as fit as a fiddle now.

93
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,748
Let's go. Chop-chop.

94
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:46,949
What's wrong?

95
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:49,685
I think my dad's...dead.

96
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,153
You don't know that.

97
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,289
What the hell?

98
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:57,860
Eli,

99
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:00,798
Your dad went into full arrest while he was being evaluated.

100
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,165
We did everything we could.

101
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,867
I'm so sorry, Eli.

102
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,036
Oh, my god.

103
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:09,338
Oh, Eli.

104
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,007
Wait.

105
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,935
I'm...I'm dead?

106
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:16,212
But I'm still here?

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,770
That's usually how it works.

108
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,182
What?

109
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,417
Eli.

110
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:23,052
Ok, smart guy.

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,887
If you know so much about death,

112
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,022
Where the hell is your mother?

113
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:31,027
Get him into the light. Fast. Soon. Now.

114
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:32,361
Well, can't you help me?

115
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,529
I mean, Eli's your son.

116
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:34,597
He just lost his father.

117
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,832
Oh, no. Just please, handle it.

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,101
And as far as our little chat,

119
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,086
I was never here.

120
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:27,894
You want some more wine?

121
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,029
No, thanks.

122
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,531
I have to go home tonight,

123
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:33,833
Start reading dad's will,

124
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,234
planning his funeral.

125
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,782
I'm still shocked he trusted me to be the executor.

126
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,872
I take it you two didn't get along?

127
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,374
Not exactly.

128
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,410
Dad wanted me to be the next Screen Door King,

129
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,479
Not some touchy-feely shrink.

130
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,181
He thought I was a flake.

131
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,983
The last couple of years we barely spoke since I told him about the ghosts.

132
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,318
He didn't believe you?

133
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,120
He wanted me to prove it by talking to my mom,

134
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,254
But she's gone.

135
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,823
And now he's off looking for her.

136
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,658
What did he say right before he disappeared?

137
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,626
Just that he wanted to see my mom.

138
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,396
I tried to tell him that she's already waiting for him in the light.

139
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:04,831
He never listens to me.

140
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,899
Anyway, I guess I should call Case.

141
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,501
She said she'd help with everything.

142
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,502
Hey, what's the story with that?

143
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,762
You guys had a major vibe going on.

144
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:11,897
Yeah, but what's the point?

145
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:14,044
Every woman I've dated the past 6 years bolts

146
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,975
as soon as I bring up the ghosts.

147
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,678
Hey, there might be one that surprises you.

148
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,679
Easy for you to say.

149
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,813
Baby, what are you working on?

150
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,115
Aw, is that you and your daddy?

151
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,184
It's Uncle Eli and his dad at a lake.

152
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,120
And this is the cabin.

153
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,689
We used to have a house at the lake.

154
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,792
Spent every summer up there with Casey and her folks.

155
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,960
What's that?

156
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,233
I think it means "stop."

157
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:45,000
Aiden, the sitter said that you started this before school.

158
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,441
I thought Uncle Eli might be sad today.

159
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:52,096
Ok. Um, why don't we finish it in the morning? Right?

160
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:53,846
And for now, brush those teeth.

161
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,425
Come on, little man. Oh. It's the time.

162
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,786
Don't you find that creepy?

163
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,955
How did he know I had a lake house?

164
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,658
The same way that he thought you were gonna be sad,

165
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,628
- He knew your dad was sick.  - Spooky.

166
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,600
My mother died up there... aneurysm.

167
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,203
Dad found her on the bathroom floor,

168
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,205
Sold the place right after.

169
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,974
Were things good between your parents when she passed?

170
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,009
Who knows?

171
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,582
But obviously, she was at peace,

172
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:27,013
Or otherwise, she'd be hanging around here. Why do you ask?

173
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,615
I was just wondering. What about your mom's family?

174
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,218
- Any issues there?  - My mom's family?

175
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,221
None that I'm aware of. Why?

176
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,958
Uh, it's just, you know, covering all the bases.

177
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,873
I just lost my father, sort of,

178
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,646
and you're asking about my mom?

179
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,002
She came to me this afternoon.

180
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,005
My mother? She's still here? What did she say?

181
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,107
Just that she wanted me to help your father go into the light.

182
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,378
But look, she really didn't seem like she wanted to go with him. So...

183
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,314
Wait, wait. What? Why not?

184
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,150
I don't know. I don't know, but I'll figure it out,

185
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,219
And I'll get them to cross over, ok? I promise.

186
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,654
Evelyn's still here?

187
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,324
Heh. I guess that's another thing you got wrong, boy, huh?

188
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,603
Ok. You know what? Mr. James, really, If you could...

189
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:17,376
Oh, no, no. I spent all day looking for a damn light. Thanks to you.

190
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:19,665
And now I find out that she's still hanging around?

191
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:24,604
No, I gotta find her. Evelyn? Evelyn!

192
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,405
Feel free to retract your offer.

193
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,579
It's almost like he's still here.

194
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,818
Not at the moment.

195
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,254
Look, I don't even know if I can do this.

196
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,923
Ok, come on. Let's just find his suit and go. Ok?

197
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,859
I'll even take it by the funeral home if you want.

198
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,128
You're the best.

199
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,968
The doctor told him he should stop drinking. Typical dad.

200
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,238
Yeah, he still had one Manhattan a day. Said he liked the ritual.

201
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,474
Well, then I say we have one in his honor.

202
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,942
Might make this a little bit easier.

203
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,011
I like the way you think.

204
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:10,483
So, uh, is your girlfriend coming to the funeral?

205
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,252
Oh, that'll be a little bit hard since she's nonexistent

206
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,321
Oh, you...you broke up?

207
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,292
16 times. 16 different women.

208
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,185
Really? Your dad said you were

209
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,096
seeing somebody pretty seriously for the past few years.

210
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,465
Well, then he's confusing me with the son he wish he had.

211
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,637
Or ignoring the one that he did, mm-mmm, terminally single.

212
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,172
How about you?

213
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,142
Dad said you're engaged to some airline pilot?

214
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,226
Chad? Uh, no.

215
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:42,381
Turns out he had a girl in every airport.

216
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,116
Plus, that was ages ago.

217
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,185
I mean, I've been out a couple times since,

218
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,288
But...Ray must have been confused.

219
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,325
Or something. Here you go.

220
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,299
To the screen door king

221
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,266
and to seeing you again.

222
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,558
They seem like such a happy family.

223
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:09,799
As happy as anybody, I guess.

224
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:12,015
And, uh, this one was taken at the lake house?

225
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:14,837
Our two families spent a lot of time up there back then.

226
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,807
And that is our Casey and Eli.

227
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:19,475
Those two loved going up there.

228
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,876
When Ray and Evelyn bought it,

229
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:21,977
He made all the screen doors,

230
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,113
And I said they were good enough to sell.

231
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,916
Don's the one who suggested we start a business.

232
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,050
The four of you?

233
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,386
Oh, no, no, no. This was all Ray and Anne's.

234
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,421
I'm retired. Public Defender.

235
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:36,158
Don worked such long hours, and I needed something to do, so.

236
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:38,623
- This is Eli's mom?  - Yes, Evelyn.

237
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:40,663
She passed away before we met.

238
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,532
She was a lovely person.

239
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,968
So I've gathered.

240
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,437
Look, this is gonna sound like a strange question,

241
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:49,756
But was there any reason that

242
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:52,975
she would have been angry with her husband before she died?

243
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,944
That is a strange question.

244
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:58,047
It's just that Eli's been so torn up about the whole thing.

245
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:00,716
And last night he was... he was wondering

246
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,117
If his parents are together now.

247
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:04,220
Why wouldn't they be?

248
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,956
I mean, if you believe in that sort of stuff.

249
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:11,660
Of course. Um, sorry to have bothered you.

250
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:13,496
And I'm sorry for your loss.

251
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:22,938
That's the screen door that Ray made for the lake house.

252
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:26,809
Anne, where are you?

253
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:29,912
I'm sorry, Don. I'm stuck at the shop a few more hours.

254
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,833
Ray!

255
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,885
Are you ok?

256
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:40,872
Yeah. I'm fine.

257
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:43,893
Thank you for your time.

258
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,166
What are you looking for?

259
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:53,202
My dad's favorite cufflinks.

260
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,337
The ones with the little screen doors on them.

261
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:02,211
Oh, that's so pretty. Was that your mom's?

262
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,547
I guess. I've never seen it before.

263
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:08,517
Who knew my dad was so sentimental?

264
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,721
Remember this song?

265
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:14,356
How could I forget?

266
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,435
Eighth grade.

267
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,748
What in the Sam Hill are you two monkeys doing? Knock it off.

268
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,419
I guess you never learned to dance.

269
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,171
No,

270
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,526
but I did learn how to kiss.

271
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:37,473
That was weird.

272
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,075
Yeah, it's like my dad all over again.

273
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:41,777
My damn corpse is still warm,

274
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:44,947
and you're already drinking my liquor and making moves.

275
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:46,749
How about a little respect for the dead?

276
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:47,950
I do respect you.

277
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:52,321
I respect you, too. I...are you ok?

278
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,356
Yeah, I just got to...

279
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:56,258
I gotta find my dad's good tie

280
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:57,793
So we can get out of here.

281
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,497
Eli, where are you? Call me.

282
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:04,433
You're not nearly as trustworthy as they say.

283
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,403
I asked you to get Ray into the light,

284
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,238
not put your nose where it doesn't belong.

285
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:10,606
I'm trying to help both of you.

286
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:11,740
If you could just talk to your husband.

287
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:13,609
Oh, no. I gave him my life,

288
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,344
I'm not giving him my afterlife, too.

289
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,012
Look, is it because of what happened with Anne?

290
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,580
I had a vision.

291
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,283
I know about Ray's affair with her. I guess you do, too.

292
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,452
Eli and his father have enough issues

293
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,120
without you stirring the pot.

294
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,622
You stayed in your marriage

295
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,791
even when you knew, right?

296
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,860
You wouldn't have done that if you didn't love your husband and your son.

297
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:33,796
A mother protects her family.

298
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,497
You of all people should understand that.

299
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:37,633
Now, please, I'm begging you,

300
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,435
leave it alone.

301
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,852
So now he's haunting you?

302
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,132
All day.

303
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,071
Something's going on.

304
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,973
He's trying to come between Casey and me.

305
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,675
It turns out he's been lying to us both all these years,

306
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:10,311
making up relationships to keep us apart.

307
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,813
I mean, why would he do that?

308
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,616
And then I found this stashed in his trinket box.

309
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,643
Was it your mom's?

310
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:19,387
That's the thing, I don't know.

311
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,165
Anne, where are you?

312
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:24,626
I'm sorry, Don. I'm stuck at the shop a few more hours.

313
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,033
You just got a hit. What is it?

314
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:35,215
American. Platinum and gold.

315
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,038
Probably from about 40 years ago.

316
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:38,840
Spare me the antiques roadshow.

317
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:40,241
You know something, don't you?

318
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,643
I don't...I don't think you're gonna like it.

319
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,860
I'm a shrink. I think I can handle it.

320
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,048
Your father...

321
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,417
I think he had an affair.

322
00:15:53,556 --> 00:15:55,423
It's platinum, huh?

323
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:56,991
Think it's worth anything?

324
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,328
I'm sorry that I had to tell you this.

325
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,498
Dad?

326
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,066
My dad was cheating on my...

327
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,301
On your mom.

328
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,303
Maybe that's why she didn't want to see him.

329
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,171
But why doesn't she want to see me?

330
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,178
And what right does he have to interfere with my love life?

331
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:15,577
It gets worse?

332
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,111
A lot.

333
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,281
Um, I think that the affair was with Casey's mom.

334
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,616
Anne?

335
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,052
Oh, god. Kill me.

336
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,154
Casey's mom? When?

337
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:27,660
I'm pretty sure it's before you were born,

338
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,244
but I think that's why he doesn't want you to see each other

339
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,465
because there is a chance...

340
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:31,777
Chance of what?

341
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:33,661
Well, if the affair was with Casey's mom.

342
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:38,366
You're saying that Casey could be my sister?

344
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:39,467
It's possible.

345
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:40,602
Technically she would be your half sister.

346
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,024
But you probably shouldn't be dating her.

347
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,807
It's Casey. Oh, my god.

348
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,041
Ok, all right. Stop.

349
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:50,845
Look, at least we know why they're stuck here.

350
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:52,413
Right, and if they don't want to talk about it,

351
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:55,450
Then there's someone who might.

352
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,919
I'm not gonna give her the choice.

353
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:02,290
I can't believe Anne did that to my mom.

354
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:03,725
Her best friend.

355
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,126
I can't wait to get her cornered.

356
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:06,261
I'm just gonna like...

357
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,563
Why don't you just let me do the talking, ok?

358
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,565
Oh, you're dad's here on the steps.

359
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:12,901
What are you doing here?

360
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,602
Are you spying on your mistress?

361
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,670
Watching her take a shower?

362
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:16,812
- Eli.  - What?

363
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:19,040
Leave it to Dr. Phil to get it wrong again, huh?

364
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,742
I'm looking for my wife.

365
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:21,791
Oh, cut the crap.

366
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,328
I know all about what happened

367
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:25,013
And what went on with you and your little girl...

368
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,548
Oh, hi, Mr. Sullivan.

369
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:29,384
Are you ok?

370
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,885
Why are you shouting?

371
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,989
Melinda just said something that I took the wrong way. Sorry.

372
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,557
I overreacted.

373
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,026
I forgive you.

374
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:39,327
Thanks.

375
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:42,330
Um, we actually just came to speak with Anne.

376
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,065
Oh, well, she's not home.

377
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,163
What's going on?

378
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,402
Why don't you ask him the same question, huh?

379
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:49,370
Better yet, ask casanova here

380
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:52,541
- About the time I kicked his butt into next week.  - What?

381
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,981
You know what, maybe we could just talk to you.

382
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:58,146
- Is he ok?  - He just needs a minute.

383
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,282
I didn't want to tell you this, Eli,

384
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,054
But I caught Don and your mother...

385
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,856
up at the lake house.

386
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:11,192
I confronted him. It got pretty ugly.

387
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,196
What's wrong with you, huh? Ray.

388
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:17,198
Why would you do this to me, huh?

389
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,100
- Why?  - Ray!

390
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:20,568
Ray! Relax.

391
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:21,669
What's wrong...

392
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:31,972
So go on, ask him how he got that scar on his hand.

393
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,350
Mom?

394
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,754
My mom?

395
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:41,622
What...what about her?

396
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:43,891
Are you two ok?

397
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,427
You know what, this is gonna be incredibly awkward,

398
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,364
But I think Eli here has some questions.

399
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:50,932
Come on. Come on, sit down.

400
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:54,669
You and my dad got in some big fight, right?

401
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:57,105
That's how you got that scar on your hand, right?

402
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,506
How do you know that?

403
00:18:58,574 --> 00:18:59,674
Did Ray tell you?

404
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:01,476
Why don't you?

405
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:04,712
Eli, your dad was a good man.

406
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,848
And he loved your mother to a fault.

407
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:08,349
To a fault?

408
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,853
Well, he was jealous.

409
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,188
And while Ray and Anne were building up the business,

410
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,184
He got in his head that

411
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:19,060
something was going on between your mother and me.

412
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:20,728
Was there something going on?

413
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,633
I let it go a long time ago.

414
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:28,654
And you should, too. Just let them rest in peace.

415
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:30,671
The thing is they can't.

416
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,774
Look, I know that you're gonna find this hard to believe,

417
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,409
But I have a gift.

418
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:36,155
And so does Eli.

419
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,780
I can see ghosts and he can hear them.

420
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,982
My parents spirits are still here.

421
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,718
They can't move on until we clear up what really happened.

422
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,616
Look,

423
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:52,827
I know what happens to a person when they're grieving.

424
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:54,262
Yes, but it's... It's not that.

425
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,764
Look, yesterday I touched that screen door

426
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:59,167
And I saw Ray at the lake house.

427
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:02,870
And then your wife calling you with a bunch of excuses.

428
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:03,871
Wearing this.

429
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,640
Will you two listen to me?

430
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,041
Evelyn admitted it.

431
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,342
He's lying.

432
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,344
Mom admitted it?

433
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,815
That's between your parents.

434
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,851
And with all due respect, Melinda,

435
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,187
I don't know what some screen door may have told you,

436
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:22,623
but I'm telling you, don't dredge up the past.

437
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:24,559
Too late for that.

438
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,061
Good-bye.

439
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:30,679
You two are pathetic.

440
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,335
Look, I don't know who had an affair with whatever or whoever.

441
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:35,736
It's all T.M.I.

442
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,714
I mean, what's next, car key parties,

443
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:38,929
wife swapping?

444
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:40,408
Maybe.

445
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,176
Somebody's lying. And whoever was cheating...

446
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:45,313
I know, I know. Casey could still be my sister.

447
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,448
But only by half.

448
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:51,819
You sleep, little baby.

449
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:55,456
We've got to help your uncle Eli.

450
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:57,558
Where did you see that red shape?

451
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:31,783
You know, you're a really good friend.

452
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:34,310
Thanks for calling.

453
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,345
That was Delia.

454
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:38,028
They were gonna take the red eye

455
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:39,287
after their cousin's wedding,

456
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:40,950
But I convinced her not to.

457
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,230
Ok, You have the look. I'm scared.

458
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,504
I've got some not so good news.

459
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:48,857
Give me a second.

460
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,627
Ok, hit me.

461
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:52,594
All right.

462
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:55,192
First off, Aiden's drawing is not a stop sign,

463
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,303
It is a bathroom tile covered in blood.

464
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,034
The coroner said mom died of an aneurysm

465
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:00,753
and hit her head on the sink when she fell.

466
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,802
Yeah, I know, but I had a vision about her death,

467
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:04,112
And she wasn't alone.

468
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:05,596
She wasn't?

469
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:07,104
Whoever it was, they just left her.

470
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,934
You mean without helping her or even calling an ambulance?

471
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:11,269
Well, after they cleaned up.

472
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:13,604
And there was candles and flowers in the tub.

473
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:15,473
Oh, my god.

474
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,561
The affair was still going on.

475
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,229
Don was trying to cover it up.

476
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,106
I didn't see his face, but whoever it was was wearing gloves.

477
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,008
Like they were cleaning up a crime scene?

478
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,342
She died of natural causes.

479
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,977
Yeah, I know, but maybe they fought

480
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,278
And that triggered an aneurysm.

481
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,189
Or maybe he didn't even kill her,

482
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,983
But he just, you know, panicked afterwards.

483
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,084
Wait a minute. Wait.

484
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,853
What makes you think it wasn't my dad?

485
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,321
I mean, they were married.

486
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,790
And even though it makes my eyes bleed

487
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,525
to think that they went up there to...

488
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,395
Yeah, but why would your dad clean up?

489
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,365
Unless...

490
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,454
Oh, no.

491
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:50,546
Incoming.

492
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:51,870
What if he knew it was still going on

493
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,338
and he went to confront her?

494
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,510
Are you suggesting that my dad had something to do with her death?

495
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,378
That's crazy.

496
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,715
There's got to be some reason that she doesn't want to see him.

497
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,783
But if he did do it, why does he want to see her?

498
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,319
It's Casey.

499
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,854
She must have called a dozen times.

500
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,389
You're gonna have to talk to her eventually.

501
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,425
Not until I find out who's our daddy.

502
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,227
And now thanks to you, whether or not he's a murderer.

503
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,702
Dad?

504
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,803
Are you here?

505
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,673
Look, it's your funeral today.

506
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,608
You want to be buried in peace, right?

507
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,844
Come on, dad, talk to me.

508
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:37,627
Ok, but I just don't want to hear any more of your cockamamie theories,

509
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:39,036
Ok?

510
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,489
I need to talk to you about mom and Don.

511
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:47,525
Is that why you've been trying to keep me and Casey apart,

512
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,360
because you're not sure that you're my father?

513
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,632
Honestly, I don't know.

514
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,034
Well, that explains why you've always been so hard on me.

515
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,849
Oh, come on, don't shrink me, boy.

516
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:01,312
I raised you the same way as my old man raised me.

517
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,327
When did you find out Don and mom?

518
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:04,858
Years ago.

519
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,544
It was before you were born.

520
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:08,956
Mom said she broke it off?

521
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,274
Yeah. I forgave her.

522
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:14,865
I need to ask you about the night she died.

523
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,695
I told you.

524
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:23,151
Busybody Mrs. Pilnick called the caretaker

525
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,520
and said she saw the lights on and

526
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,712
mom's car parked out front.

527
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:33,395
So he called me and I drove up there.

528
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,733
I found her.

529
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:42,504
She was just lying there.

530
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,387
And then what?

531
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:48,956
You cleaned up the flowers and candles

532
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,879
so I wouldn't find out about mom and Ray?

533
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,440
Whoa, what candles and flowers?

534
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,390
Dad, come on.

535
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,864
Maybe you were trying to protect her reputation.

536
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:56,318
What the hell are you talking about?

537
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:58,320
Melinda, she had a vision. And in the vision...

538
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,445
You mean about the night your mother died?

539
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:03,067
Ok, you two, enough.

540
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,093
Evelyn?

541
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,578
Well, you are a sight for dead eyes.

542
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:08,872
Where have you been?

543
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,314
Mom? It's really you?

544
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,967
It's me.

545
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:14,470
I'm so sorry to barge in on you like this,

546
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,639
But really, what's the point of dredging all this up?

547
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:17,740
It was so long ago.

548
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,643
What's all this about candles and flowers?

549
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,111
At my funeral? How nice.

550
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:23,412
Got to go.

551
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,813
No, you stay put.

552
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:26,849
Wait a minute.

553
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,158
Candles and flowers.

554
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,800
It was just like the first time that I caught you two up there.

555
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,922
Please, I'm begging you.

556
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,258
Don and Anne got over it. We should, too.

557
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,393
Anne knew about it?

558
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,748
None of it was easy.

559
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:41,196
That snake was with you the night you died?

560
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:42,431
And you're still protecting him?

561
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,799
Honestly, it isn't like that.

562
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,234
What is it like then?

563
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,469
We'll talk when you calm down.

564
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:48,871
Evelyn!

565
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:49,905
You come back here!

566
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:51,373
Stop fighting!

567
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:52,374
I'm sure it was just...

568
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:53,375
No, no, no.

569
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,443
You're still hanging around, huh,

570
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,245
just waiting for him.

571
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,982
The man who left you for dead on the bathroom floor.

572
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,818
Fine.

573
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,553
You want your precious Don?

574
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:10,092
I'll bring him to you.

575
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:13,962
Dad.

576
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,764
Wait!

577
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,847
Anne?

578
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:24,099
Please forgive me.

579
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,868
I never meant to hurt you.

580
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:37,899
My dad was shocked to find out the affair was still going on.

581
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:39,507
So he wasn't the one who cleaned up.

582
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,184
Ok, so we're back to Don.

583
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,127
Here me out.

584
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,715
It couldn't have been Mrs. Pilnick who called the caretaker.

585
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:46,041
Who's Mrs. Pilnick?

586
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,279
The lake busybody.

587
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,900
Dad said that she had called the caretaker

588
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,272
who called him the night mom died.

589
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,573
But that was in November.

590
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:56,362
And Mrs. Pilnick spent the winters in Boca.

591
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:59,346
So somebody must have pretended to be her on the phone.

592
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:01,214
A woman.

593
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:03,250
Wait a minute..

594
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,218
There's a blonde in Aiden's drawing.

595
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,720
It's Anne.

596
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,455
Mom said she knew.

597
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:11,406
Ok, well, did she know that they started up again?

598
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:12,478
Makes sense.

599
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:14,327
She could have went up there to confront mom.

600
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:16,278
So they fought, there was a struggle,

601
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,732
And that brought on the aneurysm.

602
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,571
I don't think my dad got that update.

603
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,339
What? What is it?

604
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:27,908
Looks like he might have hurt Don.

605
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,543
- There's blood and....  - Blood?

606
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:32,191
Yeah.

607
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:34,224
Strawberry.

608
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:35,882
It's jam.

609
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,035
Somebody's here. I gotta go.

610
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,687
Wait...

611
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,024
Eli, what are you doing here?

612
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:47,209
Oh, uh, just looking for your parents. They're not here.

613
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,432
Are you sure? Let me just...

614
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,630
Positive. Yeah.

615
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:53,215
Well, they didn't answer their phones, either,

616
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:54,263
Which is typical.

617
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,870
They must have gone out for breakfast before the funeral.

618
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,905
Hopefully not a place with knives.

619
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,240
What?

620
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:03,576
Eli, what...why are you acting so weird?

621
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:07,914
Sorry, I just have to give a eulogy

622
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:10,083
that I haven't written yet.

623
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:12,087
Yeah, I thought you wanted my help with that.

624
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:15,201
You know, I've been calling and texting you.

625
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,090
Did I do something wrong?

626
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,034
No, of course not. No, no.

627
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:21,770
God, I'm...I'm such a ditz.

628
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,806
Here you are going through something so major

629
00:29:23,873 --> 00:29:26,208
and I'm being all selfish and making it about me.

630
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:27,509
Sorry.

631
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:30,512
I must have misread you the other day, that's all.

632
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,729
And besides, we have too much history. Right?

633
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:36,018
I mean, we're practically brother and sister, so.

634
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:37,820
Yeah, no.

635
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:41,156
Trust me, I'm really not trying to think of you that way.

636
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:43,959
Um, anyway, we're late. We should go.

637
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:45,194
I'll drive. Let's...

638
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:57,739
Ah, it's his voicemail again. Where is he?

639
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,174
Maybe he found his parents again.

640
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:00,341
Hopefully Casey's.

641
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:01,951
I guess Ray did something drastic.

642
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:04,273
I checked all the emergency rooms and the local hospitals.

643
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:05,640
Neither parent were admitted.

644
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,649
Did you check the morgues?

645
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:09,823
Ooh, finally.

646
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,488
- Are they here?  - Who, my parents?

647
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:16,124
Yeah.

648
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:17,692
Uh, I haven't... I haven't seen them yet.

649
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,793
Any of them.

650
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,929
Ok, now I'm worried.

651
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:22,363
You and me both.

652
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,999
We come here today to honor Raymond James

653
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:29,420
as he joins his wife Evelyn in eternal peace.

654
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,772
We should be so lucky.

655
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,378
Their beloved son Eli has asked to say a few words.

656
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:36,852
Eli?

657
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:52,327
What can I say about my dad?

658
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:57,555
Except that he was larger than life.

659
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,677
Especially when it came to

660
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:03,902
the way he loved my mom.

661
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:13,072
You all know my dad was a little crazy.

662
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,783
Love can do that to a person sometimes.

663
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:20,788
It can make a person do really stupid things.

664
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:22,991
But love can be a pain, too,

665
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:27,806
Because, you know, we can't choose we fall in love with.

666
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:30,999
The heart just goes where it goes

667
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:34,602
and it's not always a recipe for happiness.

668
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,717
You've got a hell of a nerve showing your sorry face at my funeral.

669
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:46,981
My god.

670
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:49,444
I'm overcome.

671
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:51,425
- Dad.  - Don, are you ok?

672
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:53,532
You tell him I'm just getting warmed up.

673
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:55,390
Stop it!

674
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:59,727
Jim, could you just stall?

675
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,663
Yeah.

676
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,098
You guys, follow me.

677
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:07,035
We'll be right back.

678
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:08,336
Thank you.

679
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,205
Let's go.

680
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:12,530
Ok, so I didn't believe you about all this ghost stuff,

681
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,677
But I swear, Ray's been trying to kill me all morning.

682
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:19,414
A ghost? Dad, what's going on?

683
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,249
Make it stop, please.

684
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:22,584
You can do that, right?

685
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,285
I can try. I mean, Ray is with us.

686
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:25,462
What?

687
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:29,257
Casey, look, Melinda can see ghosts and I can hear them.

688
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:30,758
And I know this sounds crazy,

689
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,694
but my parents are stuck here

690
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:35,165
because you and I might be related.

691
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,232
Is Evelyn here, too?

692
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:39,133
She is now.

693
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:40,902
Well, it's about damn time.

694
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,203
I haven't been losing my mind.

695
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:45,100
She really has been haunting me all these years.

696
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,008
Yeah, because you left her for dead.

697
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:48,676
Or maybe you even caused her death

698
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:50,378
when you confronted her about the affair.

699
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,247
No, no. Eli, stop it, please.

700
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:53,314
You have it all wrong.

701
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:54,812
Affair?

702
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,285
Will somebody please tell me what's going on?

703
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:58,987
I told you to leave it alone.

704
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:00,822
You see the mess you've made.

705
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:02,189
You don't even deny it, do you?

706
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,295
How could you do that?

707
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,426
Leave her alone. She didn't do anything.

708
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:08,596
- She hurt you, mom.  - No! She was...

709
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:10,505
Protecting me.

710
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:13,234
Protecting you from what?

711
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,205
Ray.

712
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:18,806
What?

713
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,509
I was unfaithful.

714
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:24,078
But not with Don.

715
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:27,715
Evelyn.

716
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:29,817
What are they saying?

717
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,920
Evelyn's confessing.

718
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:36,324
She was unfaithful, but not with Don.

719
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,761
She's telling the truth.

720
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,865
I was protecting her.

721
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:46,434
Because she did have an affair.

722
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:51,439
With me.

723
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,193
Evelyn.

724
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:09,762
What the hell is...

725
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,299
I'm so sorry you had to find out like this.

726
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:16,335
I lived a lifetime of guilt and shame.

727
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,371
Death gave me perspective.

728
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:22,108
My only regret is that I deceived you.

729
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:26,530
-I couldn't love you the way you deserved.  -No, no. That's not possible.

730
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,516
Now, look, I caught you and Don red-handed. I mean...

731
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:33,691
No, but I just let you think you did.

732
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:37,346
Evelyn wanted Ray to think that the affair was with Don.

733
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,719
Mom, is this real?

734
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:44,122
It is, sweetie.

735
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:46,524
Years ago, Evelyn and I...

736
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,884
We'd go up to the lake house to open it up for the summer.

737
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:55,288
One thing led to another and

738
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:57,168
we fell in love.

739
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:59,704
And that's where you went to be together?

740
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,607
The night Evvy gave me that necklace,

741
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:04,676
Ray showed up.

742
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:07,946
I'm sorry, Don. I'm stuck at the shop a few more hours.

743
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:11,082
There's lasagna in the freezer.

744
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,587
Bye.

745
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,421
Ray!

746
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:19,780
It was Ray coming up the steps whistling.

747
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:27,432
Ray?

748
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,258
Evvy?

749
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:46,417
It all happened so fast.

750
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:47,986
I saw Ray in my rearview mirror.

751
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,223
And all I saw...

752
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,718
All I saw then was Don's car.

753
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:57,195
Anne was driving Don's car.

754
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:58,696
That's why he thought it was him.

755
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:00,298
And I let him think that.

756
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,867
I could barely handle the truth myself.

757
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,334
How could I expect you to?

758
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,838
Yeah, but look, Don never denied it.

759
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:09,841
I mean, why the hell would he even go along with it?

760
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,479
Don, my father wants to know why you let him believe it was you.

761
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:19,951
It's because you knew, didn't you?

762
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,837
I suspected.

763
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:24,756
And when Ray accused me,

764
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:27,392
It just all sort of made sense.

765
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:32,163
But my family was important then.

766
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,377
And they are now.

767
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,169
I didn't want to lose you.

768
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,505
I felt the same.

769
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,474
So when Evvy died,

770
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,944
I let our secret die with her.

771
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,712
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

772
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:50,014
Neither did I, Ray.

773
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:52,875
Especially after the way you reacted.

774
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,688
I'd never seen you so angry.

775
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,957
And even worse, so hurt.

776
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:03,995
How do you think I feel now?

777
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:08,539
You were there the night Evelyn died.

778
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,936
A few days before I'd broken it off again.

779
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:13,805
Gave her back the necklace.

780
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:16,341
But then she called me from the lake house

781
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:17,342
And I drove up to see her.

782
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,824
I knew I shouldn't.

783
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:20,511
The thing is,

784
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,781
I died hours before she got there.

785
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:34,225
I hit my head on the sink when I fell.

786
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,226
Evvy!

787
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,661
Just like the coroner said.

788
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,735
Evvy.

789
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:46,537
She didn't have a pulse.

790
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:47,739
Her skin was so cold.

791
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:49,007
Evvy! Oh, my god.

792
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:50,341
- She was dead. - No!

793
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:51,876
I didn't know what had happened.

794
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:53,978
I knew that if anybody found her like that,

795
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:55,647
with the candles and the flowers...

796
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:59,250
I panicked. I hid everything.

797
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:09,394
I hated leaving you like that, Evvy.

798
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,163
I just didn't know what else to do.

799
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:16,100
Please tell her I'd have done the same thing.

800
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,402
I was dead.

801
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,305
Why put our families through anymore pain?

802
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:22,106
She understands

803
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,808
why you did that.

804
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:27,445
No wonder you were so upset when she died.

805
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:31,416
I thought I was protecting her.

806
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,619
Ray and Eli and you, Casey, and Don.

807
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:38,423
I carry that guilt with me every day since.

808
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,425
But you called the caretaker

809
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,060
so that somebody would find her.

810
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:46,230
I couldn't bear the thought of her just lying there dead like that.

811
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:51,135
So our marriage was just some lie?

812
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:53,905
It's not that simple.

813
00:38:53,972 --> 00:38:55,773
I just...

814
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:58,409
I couldn't change who I am.

815
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,179
What is it? What are they saying?

816
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:05,149
They have some stuff to figure out.

817
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:08,519
So do we.

818
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:13,091
Let's go home.

819
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:22,233
I do love you, Ray.

820
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:26,604
So much that I wanted you to be able to die in peace.

821
00:39:26,672 --> 00:39:28,172
And if there is another life waiting,

822
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,243
I hope to be honest with myself and the people I love.

823
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,011
What you're saying is that

824
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,149
you could only truly be happy if...

825
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,862
if I would have just stepped aside?

826
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,253
Not this time around.

827
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:44,822
I wasn't strong enough for that.

828
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,992
But Eli, you said it yourself,

829
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,628
the heart goes where it goes.

830
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:54,869
This life is done now.

831
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:57,461
But I just hope...

832
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:01,203
Can you ever forgive me?

833
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:07,196
Honestly, I... I don't know.

834
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:13,536
But maybe...maybe you can help me get there.

835
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:17,307
Maybe.

836
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,315
Oh, my.

837
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,818
It's so beautiful.

838
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:34,651
Are you ready to say good-bye?

839
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:37,226
I don't think I can.

840
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:39,662
What is it, sweetie?

841
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:44,067
I know that you two have to move on,

842
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:47,570
and I know some day I'm gonna join you,

843
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:49,174
But right now, after all this,

844
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:52,241
I just feel like there's so much I don't know about you.

845
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:53,843
Ray, maybe we should stay.

846
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:54,877
What?

847
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,717
Well, we can't leave him like this.

848
00:40:56,717 --> 00:40:57,981
Not right now.

849
00:40:58,048 --> 00:40:59,349
He's a grown man.

850
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,267
Mom, don't just stay because of me. You shouldn't.

851
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:04,053
What better reason would there be?

852
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:06,122
Evelyn, we're gonna miss the bus.

853
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,057
The light's fading. Come on.

854
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,026
It'll be back.

855
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,962
And so will we.

856
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,494
I still just can't believe my mom was gay.

857
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:30,446
You know, that might not have been the word she would have used.

858
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:33,983
I've counseled so many patients in her situation.

859
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:36,452
Maybe if she just would have told us.

860
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,754
It would have been hard,

861
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,255
But we would have worked through it.

862
00:41:39,323 --> 00:41:40,490
You still will.

863
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:42,392
And when they're ready, they'll move on.

864
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,294
But hey, the good news is you and Casey can be together.

865
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:47,363
She still hasn't called.

866
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,465
We're supposed to get together later for a drink.

867
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:51,934
You know, you might want to change.

868
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:53,903
Why?

869
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:57,507
I know what'll happen. We'll go out on a few dates, if I'm lucky.

870
00:41:57,574 --> 00:41:59,676
She'll tell me she's really starting to like me

871
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,377
and she thinks what a unique guy I am,

872
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:04,547
but the ghost thing freaks her out.

873
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:06,282
Not if she's the right person.

874
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,651
We'll see.

875
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,153
Anyway, thanks.

876
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,625
It's Casey. I should...

877
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:18,594
Hey, Case.

878
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,452
Yeah.

879
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:24,934
Well, yeah. I like you, too.

880
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,003
A lot. And I...

881
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,374
Unique, huh?

882
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:34,811
So I've been told.
