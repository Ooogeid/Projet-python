1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,030
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,760
Hey,you remember that time I was grinding up

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,860
All the egg shells with the fake blood?

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,430
For your Haitian Voodoo thesis?

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,730
"Vodou." in Haiti, it's "Vodou."

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,690
Forever.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,590
If you'll have me.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,660
Melinda Gordon...

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,500
Oh,will you marry me...again?

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,300
Yes!

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,860
I thought you didn't want to do anything formal.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,500
I mean, a seating chart?

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,860
Uh,would save my life.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,030
If I don't have one,

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,630
my mom might have to sit next to Jim's mother.

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,090
And that would be bad.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,830
Wait,your mom is coming?

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,860
Yeah. She found out from one of my friends

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,260
That Melinda is seeing someone new.

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,430
Yeah,and if she finds out that I'm marrying this new guy

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,100
And I didn't invite her...

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,790
Why would you even think of inviting her?

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,460
'cause she's Jim's mom!

24
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,230
Who thinks that Jim is dead,

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,690
Like most of your guests, by the way.

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,230
Look,if everyone knew that I was Jim,

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,030
Then we wouldn't have to get married, would we?

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,990
That's obvious. Look,my brain hurts.

29
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,360
Look,we've discussed this,ok?

30
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,130
How can I possibly tell everyone the truth? And P.S.

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,300
How long did it take you to realize that ghosts were real?

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,460
Ok,you make a good point.

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,790
Yes. This is Jim's baby,

34
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,730
And Sam is just this wonderful guy

35
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,990
Who's going to help me raise it,ok?

36
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,400
What about Jim's mom?

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,460
And Sam's, for that matter?

38
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,060
Ok,look. We will tell my mom eventually.

39
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,612
And Sam's mom,

40
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:32,030
We'll jump off that bridge when we come to it. Don't worry.

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
See ya.

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,690
All right,I'm gonna do these errands,

43
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,890
And then I'm gonna work on my med school apps.

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,400
See ya.

45
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,430
Good-bye!

46
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,200
Bye! Ha ha. See ya, Ned.

47
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,300
- How's it going?  - Good.

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,130
Is that a baby bump you got going there?

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,030
Ned! What is wrong with you?

50
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,760
Were you raised by wolves?

51
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,890
It's ok. I'm showing it off. I like it.

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,360
Ok,then let me make a note of that for the dressmaker.

53
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,930
Ned,how's the study group?

54
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,530
We're studying, but technically we're not a group yet.

55
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,960
Oh, Serena's not here yet?

56
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,690
Late,as usual.

57
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,860
I swear,I left plenty of time,

58
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,660
But my keys,they got locked in the car,

59
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,100
And I put them in my bag, so it wasn't my fault this time.

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,200
Did you bring the chapter notes?

61
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,790
Yeah, they're right here in my notebook.

62
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,500
Oh, my god, where is my notebook?

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,400
God, why is this happening to me?

64
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,160
Poor Ned. He's really worried about this test,

65
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,260
And that poor girl brings nothing but excuses.

66
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,830
She brought a little bit more than that.

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,200
What?

68
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,560
No.

69
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,130
I'm just saying,

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,460
She might be telling the truth about it not being her fault.

71
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,200
Mom? You home?

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,200
Dad?

73
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,690
Serena, honey,

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,890
I'm gonna be home late tonight.

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
There's a plate in the fridge you can reheat.

76
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,300
Your dad... I'm not sure what time he's...

77
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,730
Serena?

78
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,930
Ray?

79
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,530
Serena?

80
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,560
Serena?

81
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,960
Baby, where are you?

82
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,830
Serena?

83
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,660
This is Ray, leave a message.

84
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,530
Ray,it's Karen.

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,260
I'm at home, and I'm trying not to freak out.

86
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,430
Serena's not here. I've looked all through the house.

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,230
I can't figure out where she is.

88
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,237
Damn it! Why can't you pick up your cell?

89
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,238
Hello.

90
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,230
Hello. This is karen Westen, Serena's mom.

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,560
Is this Delia?

92
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,930
Yeah. Is everything ok?

93
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,560
I don't know.

94
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,460
When is the last time you saw Serena?

95
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,500
Um, she left here about 2 hours ago,why?

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,760
Is she not home yet?

97
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,660
I just got home from work, and her stuff is here.

98
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,360
And she's not,  and the window's open.

99
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,160
Ok, ok, have you tried calling her cell?

100
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,130
Yes, her cell phone is sitting right in front of me!

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,890
Could somebody have broken in and stolen... taken my girl?

102
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,360
Ok, what about her father? Is he there?

103
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,330
Are you alone? Um...

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
I think he's still at work.

105
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,660
I just...I- I don't know what to do.

106
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,300
Um, ok, listen, I want you to get off the phone with me

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,330
And call the police right away. I'm gonna come over,ok?

108
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,100
I hope you don't mind me asking,

109
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,630
But can you think of anyone or anything

110
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,030
That might be causing Serena distress?

111
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
You mean, something that might...

112
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,100
Make her want to run away?

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,760
Could be anything.

114
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,930
Something at home, or has anyone close to her

115
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,100
Died or been hurt?

116
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,590
No, no. We're all healthy.

117
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
No friends from school?

118
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,460
Still no word from your husband?

119
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,990
Oh, I got him this... this cradle

120
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,830
That he could put his cell phone in and charge it,

121
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,560
And he just... he keeps forgetting.

122
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,130
We should turn on Oak Lane.

123
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,330
Serena has some friends that live over there.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Ok.

125
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,590
Hey,I think I see her.

126
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,590
Serena?

127
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,030
Serena?

128
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,990
Serena, baby!

129
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,030
Serena,baby,thank god we found you.

130
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,360
Are you OK?

131
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,690
Where have you been?

132
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,330
What happened?

133
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,100
Is this blood?

134
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,660
Honey,look at me!

135
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,760
What...

136
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,360
What is happening?

137
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,100
Serena!

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,230
Mom!

139
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,130
It's gonna be okay,baby.

140
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,860
I don't remember.

141
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,790
Was it like someone was whispering to you?

142
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,890
You know,telling you that you needed to do things?

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
I told you, I don't remember.

144
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,060
I was just in my room studying

145
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,960
and then I got a little sleepy,

146
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,330
and then I was on the street in my bare feet.

147
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,160
Sweetheart...

148
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,660
How do you feel?

149
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,860
Mom,I'm fine!

150
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,490
Everybody keeps freaking out, but,you know,

151
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,260
I just sleepwalked a little bit,OK? People do that.

152
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,590
What about all this red stuff all over you?

153
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,860
It's not blood,mom,OK?

154
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,930
The ambulance guys just said it was some sort of weird red clay.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,890
But from where?

156
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,190
There's no soil or anything around here like that.

157
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,830
Maybe I felt like throwing a pot in my sleep.

158
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,130
- OK,it's...  - You're right.

159
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,260
Let's...let's get you up to bed,

160
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,560
and we will forget that this ever happened.

161
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,360
Serena,sweetheart, are you ok?

162
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,560
I was at the sub's office working with half the department.

163
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,030
I'm sorry,I should have given you the number.

164
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,290
There's seven, you say? That's great.

165
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
Your aunt's awesome for getting you that.

166
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,190
I'm gonna take off, ok?

167
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,630
All right.

168
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,130
Hey,Serena, how's it going?

169
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,730
Pretty great.

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,900
Um,I just... I wanted to let you know

171
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,460
that I'd be happy to take any of your study group chapters,

172
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,900
if things are intense at home or whatever.

173
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,930
Mind keeping it down

174
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,460
so the whole planet doesn't find out about what happened last night?

175
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,730
Sorry.

176
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,900
Well,that was weird.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,490
Plumeria.

178
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,630
Those must have been sphinx moths.

179
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,290
- What?  - Uh, nothing.

180
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,160
Just be sure to wash your hands.

181
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,390
These flowers are poisonous.

182
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,130
Front door and back door both use the same key.

183
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,230
I gave you 4 copies.

184
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,460
Thank you.

185
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,000
Uh,until we figure out what happened last night,

186
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,490
I just can't be too careful.

187
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,030
I think I might be able to help you with that. Um...

188
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
I have a gift.

189
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,630
I can see ghosts,

190
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,290
and I've seen a ghost attached to your daughter.

191
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,060
I...

192
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,800
I don't understand.

193
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,460
Sometimes spirits can influence people,

194
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,460
kind of like hypnosis, which would explain the sleepwalking.

195
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,490
If she's jumpy, forgetful.

196
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,590
Yes.

197
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,560
What's unclear is why,

198
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,700
which made me wonder...

199
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,500
If the spirit is trying to protect Serena

200
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,730
from something or someone here at home.

201
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,330
Would you like to come in?

202
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,190
Yes.

203
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,330
Did you,um,

204
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,530
put these in my locker?

205
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,860
Um,no.

206
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,630
Uh,sure.

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,290
OK, like anyone else would know what these mean.

208
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,490
Um,are those plumeria?

209
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,030
And there were moths with them.

210
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,490
Sphinx moths,I-I think.

211
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,830
Does that mean what I think it means?

212
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,390
I don't know.

213
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,830
It just...It feels like someone's trying to send me a message.

214
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,160
You think?

215
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,060
I just...

216
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,030
I wish I could tell them that it's ok.

217
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,030
Look,I understand. You can tell me the truth.

218
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,130
Me?

219
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,830
No one else knows what this stuff means except you,Jonathan.

220
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,600
I understand.

221
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,700
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,460
Look,I thought it was crazy at first myself,

223
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,760
But...

224
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,630
I mean,last night, the sleepwalking, was that you?

225
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,190
And...and in my bedroom?

226
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,400
Serena! Just stop it,OK?

227
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,530
Why are you being so weird?

228
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,030
I won't tell anyone.

229
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,160
I would never betray your secret.

230
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,860
You're freaking me out!

231
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,830
Jonathan...

232
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,790
Just leave me alone, freak! Understand?

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Mom?

234
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,101
In the living-room,honey.

235
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,730
Why didn't my key work in the front door?

236
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,030
Did you change the locks?

237
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,560
What's going on?

238
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,730
Melinda was worried about you,

239
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,800
And she had some interesting things to say.

240
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,100
She'd like to ask you a few questions.

241
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,430
Something happen with dad?

242
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,530
We'll talk about that later.

243
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,060
You did it. You finally kicked him out.

244
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,690
- Serena...  - You know what,

245
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,030
I can come back later,

246
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,560
and if I learn anything, I'll give you a call.

247
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,690
I hope you don't think you fooled me like you fooled yourself.

248
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,330
You can't trust dad. He's a liar,ok?

249
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,100
You can't trust anyone.

250
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,960
So the bad news is, the father's cheating.

251
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,900
The good news is, it's nothing more than that.

252
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,660
So instead of a protective ghost,

253
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,330
We're back to a scary ghost.

254
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,200
Would it be too much to ask,just once, for a helpful ghost?

255
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,100
Yeah,they usually go straight into the light.

256
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,660
I don't think that this ghost is bad,

257
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,530
I just think he's trying to protect Serena.

258
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,830
'Cause he chalk dusted that kid who was mean to her?

259
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,260
Well,he put all this nasty stuff in her locker

260
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,100
And then tried to make her feel bad about it.

261
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,630
Did you learn anything about who the kid is?

262
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah,his name's Jonathan.

263
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,020
Ned did some asking around,

264
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,000
and I guess he's kind of a loner.

265
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,660
Were they dating?

266
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,895
No one thinks so.

267
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,360
Is it possible that Jonathan didn't do anything?

268
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,200
I mean,the ghost could have put that stuff in her locker,right?

269
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,430
Yeah, it's possible.

270
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,460
This is a powerful ghost.

271
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,200
Well,I just need to get the whole story.

272
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,030
Great idea, but from who?

273
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,530
The ghost isn't exactly...

274
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,030
Hello?

275
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,430
Um,sorry to come by so late.If you're closing the store...

276
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,230
It's fine. I can keep it open.

277
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,730
Thanks.

278
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,360
Did you just hang up on me?

279
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,830
Hello?!

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
So my mom told me that you guys talked.

281
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,960
You know, about the dead guy.

282
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,290
Yeah. Look,I know that it can be scary,

283
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,290
But we just need to figure out...

284
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
So they're real?

285
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,800
Like,they're really real?

286
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,460
And they're right here with us,

287
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,690
Like part  of this world?

288
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,860
Like,they can touch things and touch us?

289
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,200
In their own way,yeah.

290
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,530
So they can,like, hypnotize you?

291
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,760
Well,that's not exactly what's happening,

292
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,490
But the effect is the same.

293
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Look,we just need to figure out who it is that's haunting you

294
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,930
So we can help them move on.

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,760
Oh. You mean they can't stay.

296
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,000
It's best if they don't.

297
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,610
Look, just try really hard to think about

298
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,760
if you know someone

299
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,890
Or remember anyone who might have feelings for you.

300
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,490
The guy who died, you mean?

301
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,200
What makes you think it was a guy?

302
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,690
Oh,well,isn't that what you told my mom?

303
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,230
I might have.

304
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,850
But does it ring a bell?

305
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,400
I mean, a guy who died?

306
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,060
I'm...I'm not sure, really.

307
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,160
What did he look like?

308
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,260
She said that you saw someone.

309
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,630
I did. Yeah, he was young, about your age.

310
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,530
Really?

311
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,660
Weird.

312
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,000
Well,I wonder if this guy knows Jonathan,too.

313
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,960
Jonathan?

314
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,095
Yeah, Ned was saying

315
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,160
that after Jonathan put all that stuff in your locker,

316
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,790
That he yelled at you in class.

317
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,080
Did you two date?

318
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,500
I mean,'cause it could be somebody who's jealous...

319
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,360
No,no,Jonathan and I,

320
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,430
We were just into the same, like, movies

321
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,530
And books and stuff, but that's it.

322
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,660
That's not what the ghost seems to think.

323
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,730
What ghost?

324
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,000
The ghost that we're talking about.

325
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,930
Or did you think that we were talking about something else?

326
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,360
It's...you know, it's getting really late

327
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,000
And I told my mom that I wouldn't be too long,

328
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,230
So I'm just gonna go, but thank you.

329
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,160
Hello?

330
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,160
You have reached my apology line.

331
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,490
Please leave an apology

332
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,730
For rudely hanging up on me at the beep. Beep!

333
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,000
Ok,I'm sorry. Serena came in

334
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,490
And I didn't have much time.

335
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,490
Try and sound like you mean it. Beep,beep,beep!

336
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,500
All right,it was extremely rude.

337
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Will you please listen?

338
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,660
I mean,how many times do we meet someone who's being haunted

339
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,460
Who wants to stay haunted?

340
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,760
- Not often enough.  - Yeah,she came in here

341
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,090
With all these questions about being haunted,

342
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,530
But never once how to stop it,

343
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,830
And then when I actually mentioned the word "ghost,"

344
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,630
She acted like we were having 2 completely different conversations.

345
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,830
Ok,that's odd.

346
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,360
And I think that she's covering something up,

347
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,430
Because I think this Jonathan guy is involved somehow.

348
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,050
Ok,let's make a list,

349
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,330
starting with weird, random things that we don't understand.

350
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,560
Like sleepwalking, sphinx moths, plumeria flowers,

351
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,730
Flying dust, red clay soil...

352
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,430
What,now it's vampires?

353
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,990
Zoe?

354
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,530
Vampires? No, we're talking about a ghost.

355
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,760
Ghosts and vampires.

356
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,430
And the last time I saw you,

357
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,030
you were asking me about voodoo.

358
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,260
What has happened to you?

359
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,880
- Eli, are you there?  - Ok. Let's take a walk.

360
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,830
Eli!

361
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,360
Hello?

362
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,460
Eli?

363
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,260
Did you just hang up on me?

364
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,730
Touche?

365
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,790
I don't believe it.

366
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,160
You can't not believe it.

367
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,230
How many times have we argued about this?

368
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,730
How many times did you tell me this stuff was real?

369
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,660
Well,now I'm finally agreeing with you.

370
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,930
I want them all back!

371
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,830
What,the cds?

372
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,100
I know you thought it was weird,

373
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,590
Splitting them alphabetically,but...

374
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,760
The hours and hours that we spent arguing about this.

375
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,230
I want them all back.

376
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,660
Well,it's kinda funny when you think about it.

377
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,690
It's not funny. You think it's funny?

378
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,060
No, not at all.

379
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,260
Eli!

380
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,790
You seem angry with me.

381
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,860
No, no, don't.

382
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,620
Don't be sad. Come on,

383
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,220
Please don't be sad.

384
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,260
I'd rather have mad, please.

385
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,690
Come on, look at me.

386
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,150
Look at what a jerk I am.

387
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,450
What a total, worthless, crap-ass jerk.

388
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,450
- But you're not.  - I'm not?

389
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,890
A person can't help what they believe.

390
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,650
And it's too late.

391
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,390
It's too late?

392
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,520
It's too late?

393
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,290
So what's all this with vampires?

394
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,920
I thought you talked to ghosts.

395
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,290
I don't know anything about vampires.

396
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,690
You mentioned vampires.

397
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,490
You listed 5 distinct aspects of vampire myths...

398
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,290
Sleepwalking, moths, flying dust...

399
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,850
Ok,whoa,hold up, wait one second.

400
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,790
What does all that have to do with vampires?

401
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,850
Except the sleepwalking,which I remember from one of the draculas.

402
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,632
Eastern European tradition says

403
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:51,320
Vampires sleep in soil of their home country,

404
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,850
Hence your red clay.

405
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,260
And in Malaysia, they believe that the plumeria flower

406
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,190
Attracts creatures of the night.

407
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,450
- And the thing about bats...  - Bats?

408
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,920
I never mentioned bats.

409
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,860
Lots of cultures believe vampires transform themselves

410
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,020
Into airborne entities like bats and moths,

411
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,620
But also, lighter things like dust and smoke.

412
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,860
So my ghost is a vampire.

413
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,260
I don't know what you're dealing with,

414
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,860
But what you're describing is basically

415
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,650
Elements from a classic vampire seduction scenario.

416
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
- Seduction?  - Yes.

417
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,860
Seduction, when somebody uses someone's vulnerabilities

418
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,120
To lure them into a relationship that only brings them pain.

419
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,820
Oh. That.

420
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,860
Please!

421
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,520
It's ok, I... I'm glad you're here.

422
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,820
It's ok. I understand if you're angry.

423
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,620
I shouldn't have said anything to Melinda...

424
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,690
Or you.

425
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,260
Ok.

426
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,190
Good.

427
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,260
You're still here.

428
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,750
Show yourself to me?

429
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,490
Ok,so Ned called and said that Serena was in school today.

430
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,520
Nothing unusual, except she seemed very happy and relaxed.

431
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,090
A teenage girl happy and relaxed?

432
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
We better call someone.

433
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,160
Ok, help me out here.

434
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,650
This ghost thinks he's a vampire?

435
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,890
I don't know, but he's convinced her of that.

436
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,390
All right, now show me this very interesting young man.

437
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,260
Well,this is Jonathan,

438
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,560
The guy got dust in his eyes in Serena's class.

439
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,650
What about him?

440
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,460
Well,I don't know.

441
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,990
Except I caught a small glimpse of him at Delia's apartment,

442
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,920
But the ghost kinda looks like this guy.

443
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,320
You said the ghost had red eyes.

444
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,420
And Ned said the kid's eyes red in the chalk dust.

445
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,760
Eli, wait...

446
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,390
And you said Jonathan's not a ghost,

447
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,660
Which means...

448
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,520
Should we start looking for wooden stakes?

449
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,150
Ok, there's no such thing as vampires.

450
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,020
Believe me, I would know.

451
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,950
- Tell that to Zoe.  - Ok,look,

452
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,390
Forget whether there really are vampires or not.

453
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,790
Can someone explain to me why a teenage girl

454
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,460
Would want to be stalked by one?

455
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,560
Are you kidding me?

456
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,990
Have you been to a multiplex or a bookstore recently?

457
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,090
Oh, I get there's that whole deal,

458
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,490
But what's the appeal? I don't get it.

459
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,760
I... They live forever.

460
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,720
They ache, they yearn and they desire forever.

461
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,220
Right. So that's what she gets from consorting with a vampire?

462
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,620
An eternal ache?

463
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,590
No, she gets undying love.

464
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,560
Come on. You understand this?

465
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,920
Of course she does.

466
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,850
What I did?

467
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,220
Jumping into this body?

468
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,890
Come on. I'm just a pigheaded fool who wouldn't quit.

469
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,790
That's what every woman wants?

470
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,590
Yeah.

471
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,120
Well,then is it really fair you don't share me with the world?

472
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,120
Come here.

473
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,260
Point being, undying love's in short supply

474
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,950
in a broken home like Serena's.

475
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Well,more important point,

476
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,360
We still don't know who this guy is.

477
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,460
No Grandview teenagers meeting the ghost description died recently.

478
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,920
You know what, she's lived here her whole life.

479
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,950
Maybe we should be looking at people who moved away.

480
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,220
Hey. Where to?

481
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,990
Zoe said that vampires like

482
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,520
To keep soil from their home country close.

483
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,820
Yeah,like the red clay that was on her after she sleepwalked.

484
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,990
Wait a minute, there are red cliffs

485
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,660
- Just south of Bridgeport. - Good call.

486
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,990
Andrew Carlin.

487
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,850
From Bridgeport, died about 5 weeks ago

488
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,190
And formerly resided in Grandview.

489
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,190
- Does he look like the ghost?  - Yeah.

490
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,220
Said that he had a blood disease,

491
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,660
Which would explain the red eyes.

492
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,150
Or maybe he got bit,

493
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,820
And that would explain why he started sleeping upside down.

494
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,290
Ok, you keep working on that theory there,Van Helsing,

495
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,890
And I am going to go talk to Serena.

496
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,320
Hey,have a minute?

497
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,120
Now's not really a good time.

498
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,020
I know about Andrew Carlin.

499
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,120
Andrew? What about him?

500
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,990
Well,I know that he's dead,

501
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,560
And I think you know that.

502
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,120
Andrew died?

503
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,660
You didn't know?

504
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,190
How would I? He moved away like 2 or 3 years ago.

505
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,360
Well,I thought you two were really close.

506
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,990
I mean, we were friends,

507
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,320
But obviously not as good as I thought.

508
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,660
So you didn't keep in touch after that.

509
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,835
He wrote a few emails,

510
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,950
but I was never really good at answering them,

511
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,560
And after that, like,nothing.

512
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,520
Look, I'm sorry that I have to ask this,

513
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,520
But were you and Andrew into vampires?

514
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,990
Was that something that the two of you shared together?

515
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,490
Look, I really have to go.

516
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,920
Well,whatever it is that's going on,

517
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,420
I think you're going to want to hear me out.

518
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,390
Look,I really don't think you know what you're talking about.

519
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,290
Andrew wasn't into vampires, ok,

520
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,820
he was into yearbook.

521
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,360
That's how we knew each other. We did yearbook together.

522
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,720
So he just wanted you to think that he was a vampire

523
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,190
Because you're into that stuff?

524
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,590
It doesn't make any sense. Andrew?

525
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,820
Wait, the part that doesn't make any sense is Andrew?

526
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,590
So what,you thought it was Jonathan?

527
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,420
Is that why you confronted him in class,

528
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,760
Because you thought he put all that stuff in your locker?

529
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,360
You said that you two like the same books and movies...

530
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,590
Look,it's not just that,ok?

531
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Jonathan and I both have really screwed up families.

532
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,090
He just...he gets it.

533
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,660
Ok,this is partially my fault,

534
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,150
Because I...I was talking to you about ghosts,

535
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,850
And you thought that I was talking to you about vampires,

536
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,820
And I made you think that they were real, but they're not.

537
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,490
I know what I saw.

538
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,260
I know what I felt.

539
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,950
Ghosts can be powerful.

540
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,720
Ok? They can make us believe things.

541
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,990
But he was with me last night!

542
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,650
I didn't see him, but I know he was there.

543
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,590
I'm sure Andrew was there.

544
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,720
He was at your locker making sure that you got those flowers.

545
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,650
And he was there making sure that Jonathan paid

546
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,420
For trying to hurt you.

547
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,360
That's why Jonathan won't talk to me anymore.

548
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,490
I really am a freak.

549
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,260
Please.

550
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,090
There's a boy out there.

551
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,790
Another boy who has very strong feelings for you.

552
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,420
You can help him go into the light where he belongs.

553
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,120
I can't.

554
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,390
Come here.

555
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,650
Mmm,what are you doing to me?

556
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,290
I gave you eternity.

557
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,160
Doesn't she deserve the same?

558
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,920
Who,Serena?

559
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,320
What gives you the only right to happiness?

560
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,560
What are you talking about?

561
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,560
You cheated death once.

562
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,360
Doesn't mean you will again.

563
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,750
Serena is mine.

564
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,560
One way or another, I'll have her.

565
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,060
Wow.

566
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,590
That's all I can say. Wow.

567
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,650
Have you contacted Andrew's family?

568
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,960
Now that is what I call a dream.

569
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,550
Eli,please focus.

570
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,820
I really need your help,all right?

571
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,320
Look,I'm on my way to Serena's.

572
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,650
I don't have time to track them down.

573
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,650
Ok,but could you just talk to me again?

574
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Just let me put on a little mood music first.

575
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,860
Eli! What?

576
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,020
The ghost said that he's going to have her

577
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,020
One way or another,ok?

578
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,450
In case that means having her dead,

579
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,120
I gotta get this guy into the light,

580
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,350
Especially 'cause she's so vulnerable at home.

581
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,890
I thought you said that the parents decided to try therapy.

582
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,990
- Eli! - Ok!

583
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,620
Ok,I'm calling them now. Relax.

584
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,490
Yeah,I'll relax when I know that Serena's ok.

585
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,160
All right.

586
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,790
I know I'm the one that messed up.

587
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,820
I made you two suffer,a lot.

588
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,060
And that's wrong.

589
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,450
And without getting into some stuff that you don't want to know,

590
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,590
Let's just say that your mom did some things

591
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,790
To push me away.

592
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,250
Karen,is that fair to say?

593
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,620
Yeah.

594
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,090
So how about it? Fresh start?

595
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,890
Can everyone do that?

596
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,690
No way. Forget it.

597
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,060
Serena,honey,please!

598
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,760
Mom, it's bull. He doesn't deserve it.

599
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,660
You know what? Your father is asking for a second chance,

600
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,960
and I think we should give it to him.

601
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,420
That's not fair!

602
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,690
It may not be, but that's what love is.

603
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,890
No, it's not.

604
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,320
Love is supposed to mean more than that.

605
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,390
You don't just leave it and come back to it like daddy did.

606
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,260
Love is something you never quit.

607
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,720
Sweetheart...

608
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,330
We are a family, and family is forever,

609
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,800
And there is nothing else like that.

610
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,160
You're wrong.

611
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,960
Andrew?

612
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,600
Are you doing this to torture me,

613
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Or do you really care?

614
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,830
Andrew,I never got any of these.

615
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,630
They're just drafts?

616
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,530
Why didn't you send them?

617
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,330
You were there the entire time, you never quit.

618
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,700
I wish I could just see you.

619
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,600
How?

620
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,330
Serena,sweetheart?

621
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
We need to talk to you.

622
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,960
We're coming in...

623
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,730
Oh,my god!

624
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,060
All right,call any of her friends that you can think of,

625
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,360
And I'll let you know if I hear anything.

626
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,230
- Thank you. - Ok.

627
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,500
Hey,eli.

628
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,160
She's gone? She ran away?

629
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,460
Well,at least there's a chance that she'll change her mind.

630
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,960
As opposed to she's sleepwalking over a cliff.

631
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,530
So what did you find out about our ghost?

632
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,100
I finally got through to his mother.

633
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,860
I just hung up a few minutes ago. I said I was Serena's dad.

634
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,330
And?

635
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,830
And she remembers it like Serena said,

636
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,130
They did yearbook together.

637
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,860
But then after that, stories get different.

638
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,360
Well,how so?

639
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,315
Well, Andrew told the parents

640
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,560
that he stayed in touch with her after they left Grandview.

641
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,260
He kept pictures of her on his desk,

642
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,330
Sent them updates on her life,

643
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,760
Claiming they IMed all the time.

644
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,660
Ok,was there any red clay near Andrew's house?

645
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,095
No. And can you imagine how weird

646
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:22,460
she thought I was to ask.

647
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,630
Ok,well,what about where he was buried?

648
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,530
Damn, you're good. Almost as good as me.

649
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,900
All right,I called the cemetery right after I hung up with them.

650
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,230
You ready to write down an address?

651
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,100
Andrew?

652
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,430
What's it like where you are?

653
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Is it lonely?

654
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,660
It's so lonely here, I don't want to be lonely anymore!

655
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,260
Then go inside.

656
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,230
We can talk when you're with me.

657
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,460
So where is he buried,exactly?

658
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,900
Andrew's parents said there's a family crypt,

659
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,560
But you should hurry, because it's tight.

660
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,160
There's only a few shelves for cremated remains.

661
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,100
So there isn't much air,then?

662
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,800
- She wouldn't last long. - Ok.

663
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,260
So then which crypt?

664
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,930
I don't know. Just look for the one with his name on it.

665
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,360
How long can that take?

666
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,230
I can't keep my eyes open,Andrew.

667
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,730
Where are you?

668
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Why won't you just give me a sign?

669
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,030
I'm right here,Serena.

670
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
You'll see me soon.

671
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,030
Very soon.

672
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,560
Where is she?

673
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,200
She wants to be with me.

674
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,800
That's why she came here.

675
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,130
You don't really believe that,

676
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,530
Or else we wouldn't be having this nice conversation.

677
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,960
What conversation?

678
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,830
The one where you pretend that you don't feel bad

679
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,000
For killing a girl that you supposedly love.

680
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,100
I don't want her to die.

681
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,330
But she has to.

682
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,660
It's the only way that we can be together,

683
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,930
You know, for someone who isn't actually a vampire,

684
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,330
You're doing a great impression.

685
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,530
I mean,the sneaking around,the hypnosis, the smokescreen...

686
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,900
Shut up! You don't know anything.

687
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,730
I know what's going to happen when she's finally dead.

688
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,560
She's going to look back at her young, full life,

689
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,030
And she's going to realize that she gave it all up for a lie.

690
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,260
What lie?

691
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,660
That you loved her.

692
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,360
You don't love her, Andrew.

693
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,700
Love is selfless.

694
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,560
You're only doing this for you.

695
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,660
I do love her.

696
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,900
I've always loved her.

697
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,600
Then prove it.

698
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,930
Where is she?

699
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,400
Oh, my god!

700
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,260
Serena!

701
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,030
Sweetheart, could you just wake up?

702
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,260
Please? Please?

703
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,030
Ok,here.

704
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,300
All right, you're going to be all right,

705
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,400
Just breath.

706
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,930
All right, let's get you out of here, come on.

707
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,000
Sweetheart!

708
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,630
Honey,are you ok?

709
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,300
Are you all right?

710
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
He led her here

711
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,230
Hoping that she would join him.

712
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,360
He realized he had made a mistake,

713
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,400
And then he helped me find her.

714
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,960
And she went along?

715
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,230
He didn't sleepwalk her or...

716
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,660
Or use hypnosis?

717
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,600
No.

718
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,900
You would rather be dead than come home?

719
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,230
I didn't think of it like that.

720
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,130
I don't know what I was thinking. I just...

721
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,500
She was alone.

722
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,730
Andrew says she was alone.

723
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,260
Alone?

724
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,260
But she has a family.

725
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:31,230
So many people are so much more alone than anyone knows.

726
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,830
He says not just Serena.

727
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,560
Most of us are more alone than anyone knows.

728
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,000
We feel like we're on the outside looking in,

729
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,930
Like we're freaks

730
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,930
Or maybe even monsters.

731
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,760
Till we meet someone who understands,and...

732
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,130
There's nothing more powerful than that.

733
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Does that make any sense?

734
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,800
Yes.

735
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,230
I am so...

736
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,530
So sorry.

737
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,100
I just... I didn't think.

738
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,300
And to just expect you to give me a second chance...

739
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,245
I understand.

740
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:20,630
Melinda...

741
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,530
Will you please tell Andrew that I'm really sorry?

742
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,260
He was always one of my favorite people.

743
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,300
I just...I never guessed that I meant more than that to him.

744
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,760
I was afraid to tell her the truth.

745
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,800
Because if she didn't feel the same way...

746
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,230
He was afraid that you would break his heart.

747
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,630
I hope I didn't break it again.

748
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,500
No.

749
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,700
No,I think you helped put it back together.

750
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,260
Yeah.

751
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,500
Melinda told me that there's a place that you can go

752
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,230
Where you won't be alone.

753
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,460
He knows.

754
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,130
He sees the light.

755
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,560
I'm gonna be there someday myself, I hope.

756
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,060
You promise you'll look for me?

757
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,960
Yeah.

758
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,960
He's gone.

759
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,730
I'm so sorry!

760
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,600
It's all right, baby.

761
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,460
Come on, Eli, you have to have an opinion.

762
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,000
DJ or band?

763
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,260
DJ. Always.

764
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,430
And make sure he spins vinyl,

765
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,850
But no sixties, no motown,

766
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,000
and no open mic.

767
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,560
And no fun.

768
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,130
I mean, what kind of weddings do you go to?

769
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,460
Same kind you go to.

770
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,160
Boring.

771
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,100
I wonder where Zoe is.

772
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,200
I mean, she wanted to know how this vampire thing went.

773
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,630
Didn't she say that she might miss it

774
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,060
Because she's got a lot of work to do?

775
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,900
Well,I just thought since Melinda was here...

776
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,760
Melinda?

777
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,300
Are you here?

778
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,460
Melinda!

779
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,530
What? Huh?

780
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Yes,yes,vampires.

781
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,430
Yeah, it's just... It's just a dream.

782
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,430
Wow,is it really that late?

783
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,700
Oh, look at that. It is.

784
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,130
You know, Eli, when we're with you,

785
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,930
- The hours fly by. - Fly.

786
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,660
Do you mind if we,um...

787
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,530
I mean, we can stay a few more minutes

788
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,060
To see if she's coming.

789
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,100
Just...will you get a room for god sakes?

790
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,330
Ok, thank you.

791
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,100
You're not fooling anyone.

792
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,560
This place reeks of pheromones.

793
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,800
Ok, well, what about the check?

794
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,660
Don't worry, it's my turn.

795
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,160
Don't give me the pity eye.

796
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,930
Look, I see a couple of guys I recognize

797
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
From the econ department over at the bar,

798
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,030
And boy, can those geeks get crazy.

799
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,000
Might have to clear out my whole morning.

800
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,460
Ok. Have fun.

801
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,800
See ya.
