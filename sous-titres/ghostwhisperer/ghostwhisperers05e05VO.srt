1
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:07,579
Is it just me or is this one of
the scariest movies ever made?

2
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:11,049
Oh, yeah, compared to the
cartoons we usually watch.

3
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:16,488
No! Don't go in there.

4
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:24,785
Mommy...

5
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,733
Aiden, you scared your daddy.

6
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:30,836
What are you watching?

7
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,361
Nothing.

8
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,484
Just a silly movie
about...hungry people.

9
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,210
Isn't it past your bedtime?

10
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:40,842
I can't...I can't sleep.

11
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,447
Why not? Did you have a bad dream?

12
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:45,506
No. I need flash.

13
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:47,619
Flash?  Flashlight flash?

14
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:48,893
I thought you, uh, lost him.

15
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:51,145
Yeah, I thought you didn't
need him to sleep anymore.

16
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,420
But I need flash back.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,630
Well...

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,406
How about a snuggle
with your mommy instead?

19
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,853
Ok. But not a "gotta go" snuggle,

20
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,170
A "forever" snuggle.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,333
You got it.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,901
Good night, sport.

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,135
Let's go!

24
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:06,771
Come on, forever snuggle! Let's go.

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,079
First session with Nathan Weiss.

26
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:19,155
Referred to me by Dr.
Ulrich at university medical.

27
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:20,962
At patient's request,

28
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:22,940
session taking place at his residence.

29
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,590
The sweetest place in the county.

30
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:28,994
This guy's software
really must be selling.

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,252
Omit the last remark.

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,614
Can I help you?

33
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:40,700
Hi. I'm Dr. Eli James.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,988
I have an appointment with Mr. Weiss.

35
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:44,543
Identification.

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,412
There you go.

37
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,261
Do you have your signed paperwork?

38
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,662
Paperwork?

39
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,598
Consent to privacy on top,

40
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:56,601
Non-competition in
trading on the bottom.

41
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,736
How long will you be on the premises?

42
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:02,144
It depends. I'm not a very fast reader.

43
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,244
I didn't think your security
guard was ever gonna let me in.

44
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,712
I know. It's embarrassing, really,

45
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,213
But, see, I gotta keep security tight,

46
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:11,816
Especially when I'm about to
release a new line of software.

47
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:14,449
I read about that. You
should know, I'm a fan.

48
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:17,755
I can't get through my day without
your video conferencing app.

49
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:21,692
You know, actually, we narrowly
avoided having that program pirated.

50
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:23,928
Is that why you moved
the business to your home?

51
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:24,908
No, I just work better here.

52
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:25,855
Excuse me, Mr. Weiss.

53
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,732
You know, this is gonna be great.

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,848
We'll have a meeting about
this tomorrow. Thanks.

55
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:33,404
See, the thing is,
I'm having some issues.

56
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,151
Uh, like, for example,

57
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:38,109
I feel like someone
is always watching me.

58
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,160
I can relate.

59
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:48,553
Listen, I, uh, I read a paper

60
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,871
that you published about
using behavioral therapy

61
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,659
to treat paranoia in the short term.

62
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:58,830
And, uh, that's what I'm
interested in. Short term.

63
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:02,033
The security, the locks, the...

64
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:04,402
Uh, yeah, it's not just
about trade secrets.

65
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,144
I...I'm paranoid.

66
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,807
With a little undercurrent of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

67
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,414
Oh, hell.

68
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:20,384
See, lately, with everything
riding on this launch,

69
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:25,356
I have not been able to
manage my, um, uh, um, habits.

70
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:29,418
Look, any anxiety-based disorder will
escalate due to your stress level.

71
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,729
There are medications
that you can take...

72
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:31,974
No, I don't... I don't want to medicate.

73
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,598
Ok. With hard work and time...

74
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,023
Well, that's all fine and good,

75
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:37,355
Except the time part. I don't have any.

76
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:40,800
Listen, are there not any...any
tricks that you can teach me

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,682
To just help me control
this for now? I mean,

78
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:46,077
I have this press conference
announcing the launch this week.

79
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:50,007
I mean, I...if I have a panic
attack in front of the whole world...

80
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,695
There's no quick fix for
what you have, Nathan.

81
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,621
If you get me through this
week, I'll buy you a boat.

82
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,693
A very fast, large boat.

83
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:00,854
I like boats.

84
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:03,924
Ok. Let's get started.

85
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,303
Patient exhibits extreme
anxiety, paranoia,

86
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:11,164
and impulse control issues.

87
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,533
But on the plus side, I
think he's going to invite me

88
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,535
to his annual party in Aspen.

89
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,371
Cancel christmas plans,
keep December open.

90
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,959
Who's out there?

91
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:37,956
Come on, come on, come on.

92
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:39,816
Where are you, Bruce?

93
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,556
Come on!

94
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,146
Come on, come on, come on.

95
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,752
Bruce, what's going on out there?

96
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:50,380
Sir, this is A.R.S. Alarm service.

97
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,794
Can I please have your password?

98
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,168
November.

99
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:56,035
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.

100
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,083
We received a signal
that you have an intruder.

101
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,424
Can you verify this?

102
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,795
I don't see anything on my cameras,

103
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,539
but my motion detectors are
lighting up all over the place.

104
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,347
No, this can't be. They're in my house.

105
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,757
Sir, I've dispatched a patrol
car and notified the police.

106
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:16,018
Can you get to a safe place?

107
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,336
I...I'm in my safe room.

108
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,556
Wait, they're jamming my system somehow.

109
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:22,955
I'm losing every one of my feeds.

110
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,983
I need help up here right now!

111
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,968
I hear footsteps.

112
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,539
They're...They're in my bedroom.

113
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,374
They're right outside my door!

114
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,654
The police are on their
way, sir. Try and stay calm.

115
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,265
This can't be happening.

116
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,927
They're getting inside!

117
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,647
They're in the room with me!

118
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,326
Wake up. We overslept.

119
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,393
How did that happen?

120
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,561
Our trusty alarm clock never went off.

121
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,243
Because he was up half the night?

122
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,731
so was I.

123
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,204
Come on, sleepyhead, wake up.

124
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,241
You don't want to miss the bus.

125
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:06,752
Aiden? Aiden?

126
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,068
Jim, is Aiden down here?

127
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,669
No. I thought he was
still upstairs in bed.

128
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,338
I can't find him.

129
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,439
Aiden?

130
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,940
Buddy? Where are you?

131
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:21,970
Aiden, where are you, now? It's not
a good time to be playing around.

132
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,523
- Where could he be? 
- I'll check the yard.

133
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,282
And then I'm calling the police.

134
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:28,130
Wait.

135
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,358
Aiden?

136
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,095
Did you find flash yet?

137
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,630
Baby, what are you doing down here?

138
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,933
It just felt safe.

139
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,430
Safe from what?

140
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,691
Was there a ghost?

141
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,160
I don't know.

142
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:51,762
It just felt safe.

143
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:53,764
Come here.

144
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,004
He couldn't sleep.

145
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:01,338
He didn't feel safe in his bedroom.

146
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:04,008
And this is all pretty new for him?

147
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:07,344
Well,he definitely went through the
typical being scared of the dark phase,

148
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,846
but that went away a while ago.

149
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:10,347
This just feels different.

150
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,683
He'll probably be back
to his old self soon.

151
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,752
What makes you so sure?

152
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:20,024
Eli, if you know something, spill it.

153
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:22,526
Ok, Aiden's channeled
living people before, right?

154
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:24,194
I don't know the rules. He's an empath.

155
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:25,829
Living or dead doesn't seem to matter.

156
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:28,532
But he's more inclined to pick
up things from people he knows,

157
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,734
Maybe like you or...me?

158
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,303
And you're his favorite uncle.

159
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,638
So what living person
are we talking about?

160
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:35,940
I can't say.

161
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:38,799
It's my new patient.

162
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,778
My very important new patient.

163
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,046
Like career-defining important.

164
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:43,881
Ok. So who is your new patient?

165
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:45,382
And what is Aiden picking up on?

166
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,017
Does it have to do with a ghost?

167
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:49,219
I didn't hear any ghost.
That's all I'm saying.

168
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,488
I'm not gonna violate
my patient's privacy.

169
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:53,454
Or my shot at a chance
to ride on his new jet.

170
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,087
Ok, so what am I
supposed to do with Aiden,

171
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,393
Put him in therapy, too?

172
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:57,895
Of course not.

173
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,330
Unless he starts adding new patterns,

174
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:00,631
like counting steps or

175
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:01,865
checking and rechecking things.

176
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,667
Wait a minute. Counting and checking?

177
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,510
Are you talking about
obsessive-compulsive disorder?

178
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,631
Is that what your patient has?

179
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,393
Whoa, nobody said anything
about any disorder.

180
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,369
This whole conversation
has been hypothetical.

181
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,860
And even then, it's just
because you're my friend.

182
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,528
Ok, so, I know that you
have to protect your patient,

183
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,297
But I have to protect my son.

184
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:19,863
Great.

185
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:21,302
He probably knows
we're talking about him.

186
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:22,851
Your patient? How would he know that?

187
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,229
Because he's a computer genius

188
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:26,307
who's paranoid enough
to probably bug my phone.

189
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,042
Hey, that doesn't put my mind at ease.

190
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:30,411
Ok. Look, let me just
work with this guy.

191
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,379
Aiden will get better soon, ok?

192
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,349
I see anxiety cases like this every day.

193
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:45,292
You sleep on that cot
in your panic room?

194
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,061
You don't see that every day.

195
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:48,596
What?

196
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:50,546
Nothing.

197
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,567
Tell me about last night. What happened?

198
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,402
Well, that depends on who you ask.

199
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,071
The guard at the gate saw nothing.

200
00:11:57,138 --> 00:12:00,007
The police said they found
no sign of forced entry.

201
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:02,977
And yet my entire security system
is lighting up like mardi gras.

202
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:05,102
Cameras, motion detectors.

203
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,750
You've had an intruder?

204
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,183
Yeah. According to all my equipment.

205
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,305
But there wasn't a speck
of physical evidence

206
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:13,854
that any living thing set foot in here.

207
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,956
Any living thing.

208
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:18,293
Look. Look at this.

209
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,495
See this? This is... this
is what I kept seeing.

210
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:23,864
One camera... back to another.

211
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,599
And listen, listen.

212
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,634
Listen.

213
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:32,573
Are those footsteps?

214
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,185
Look, is it possible that
somebody broke into your system

215
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:40,349
And not your house?

216
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:42,349
You know, like a competitor or a hacker?

217
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,885
No. No, no. My security
system is closed.

218
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,386
No one could hack into this.

219
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,522
I mean, this whole thing is just...

220
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,923
There's no explanation.

221
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:51,354
Ok, so bottom line is,

222
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,772
we don't know who or what did this.

223
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,908
Who or what?

224
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,658
We don't know.

225
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:57,622
Which may be a good thing.

226
00:12:57,622 --> 00:13:00,641
Because I'm here to help you with
your response to stressful events,

227
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:01,809
Not the actual events.

228
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,778
Ok.

229
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:06,271
Ok, what... and what does that mean?

230
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,803
Ok. I want you to try something.

231
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,520
I want you to turn off
all the security monitors.

232
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:18,125
Come on. This constant surveillance
is really feeding your anxiety.

233
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:20,127
We need to modify your behaviors,

234
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:23,330
to retrain your brain so you can
just ignore these compulsions.

235
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:24,932
Take the first step. Come on.

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,634
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

237
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,436
Especially after what
happened last night.

238
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,713
Why not? What's the
worst that can happen?

239
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:31,874
Nathan!

240
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,874
What are you really afraid of?

241
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:40,548
Baby, what are you doing?

242
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,477
You've opened all the drawers.

243
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:45,186
Your flashlight is not in there.

244
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,420
I know.

245
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:49,527
Ok, so then why are you
looking through the drawers?

246
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,959
Something made me.

247
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,643
Fine, fine, ok? You win.

248
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,712
Good. Turning it off.

249
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,660
Look, it's off.

250
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,182
That's a good first step.

251
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,384
All right, now, let's take the next one.

252
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,420
Answer the question.

253
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:22,139
What are you afraid of?

254
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,892
I know you want to lock
that door right now.

255
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,594
It's part of your illness.

256
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,683
You feel compelled.

257
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:29,930
But you have to tell yourself
you don't have to do it.

258
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,332
But I do. I do.

259
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,467
- I just...'cause I have to. 
- Why, Nathan?

260
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:36,103
If that's the answer, then tell me why.

261
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,522
What's the worst that can
happen? Tell me, Nathan,

262
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,425
And I will let you lock that door.

263
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,942
Why, Nathan?

264
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:52,019
Aiden, why are you...

265
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:09,103
Why, Nathan?

266
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,104
Tell me!

267
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,105
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,170
Why?

269
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,442
What will happen if you
don't lock that door?

270
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:17,611
Someone will die!

271
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,213
Someone did.

272
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,254
Did you see that?

273
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,889
See what?

274
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,691
I was just playing.

275
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,693
Is that ok?

276
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:33,827
Yeah.

277
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,776
I thought...I thought
I was keeping her safe.

278
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,913
I just want to let you know that...

279
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,080
Morning.

280
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,582
If Aiden had a few
bad dreams last night,

281
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,917
It's because I'm a genius.

282
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,118
Excuse me?

283
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,353
As a therapist, it's
progress through pain.

284
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,755
But it's progress.

285
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,456
My patient went deep.

286
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,258
We really dredged up some stuff.

287
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah, I know. His little sister died.

288
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,972
You don't really get
over something like that.

289
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,507
It's true, you don't. You...

290
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:40,809
Wait a minute.

291
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,210
How did you know?

292
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:43,645
I had a vision.

293
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:46,305
Nathan was finding his
sister in the morgue.

294
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,276
You know his name?

295
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,317
I never told you that.

296
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,056
Have you been following me?

297
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:53,419
No. His parents were in the
vision and they called him Nathan.

298
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,657
And you'd have to be pretty
dumb not to figure out the rest,

299
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,493
because the computer genius, rich
enough to have a private jet...

300
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,384
Oh, my god, I'm so sued.

301
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,987
I signed 9 disclosure documents.

302
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,598
Eli, will you please stop whining?

303
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,455
Who can keep a secret better than me?

304
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:06,768
Certainly not you.

305
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,136
I'm not saying another word.

306
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:09,600
Not till I get a lawyer.

307
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,368
Yes, you will. You'll help
me cross this ghost over,

308
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,382
'cause that helps
your client and my son.

309
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,239
Yeah. I'm just helping my client.

310
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:20,377
In a totally unethical, I could
lose my license sort of way.

311
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,646
Eli, don't you want to
know what else I found out?

312
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,848
Nathan's sister Rachel was
abducted from their home

313
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,416
while their parents were out.

314
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:27,411
Yeah, Nathan told me.

315
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,832
But he said the killer was
caught and put away for life.

316
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,293
So then why is she haunting him?

317
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:32,653
Was any of this his fault?

318
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,952
He sure thinks so. He was
supposed to be watching her,

319
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:36,026
But he didn't check the locks.

320
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:37,594
And that's how the killer got in.

321
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:40,187
So maybe she blames him the
same way he blames himself.

322
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:41,562
She was 9 when she died.

323
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,199
Maybe she's stuck being
mad at her big brother.

324
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,502
Maybe she can't stop punishing him?

325
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,921
Is that why he went to the
morgue, to punish himself?

326
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,874
No, it's more like he couldn't
accept that it happened.

327
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,208
Not till he saw her there.

328
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:54,218
He's been obsessed with
security ever since.

329
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:56,846
It probably hasn't helped having a
ghost haunting him all these years.

330
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,715
But lately he says it's
getting a lot worse.

331
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,617
The hauntings or his state of mind?

332
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,586
Both.

333
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:04,176
Right away, Mr. Weiss.

334
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,056
So you must be Melinda.

335
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:08,022
Eli here seems to think

336
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:11,892
you're gonna help me get through
my press conference for my launch.

337
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,664
Yeah, but it's, uh,

338
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:17,025
Well, it's a non-traditional approach.

339
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,005
For special occasions like yours.

340
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,209
Ok, well, listen,
whatever...whatever it's gonna take.

341
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,007
I mean, my...my anxiety has been so bad

342
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,809
The last couple of months, I
mean, I thought I was gonna have to

343
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:28,149
quit this business
completely. I mean, uh...

344
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,548
Well, we don't think that it's
work stress that's plaguing you.

345
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:33,417
See, Melinda has a gift.

346
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,151
And I do, too.

347
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,353
Sort of.

348
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,854
Or half a gift.

349
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:39,356
Anyway, I...

350
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:41,277
We can talk to ghosts.

351
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,749
I can see spirits,

352
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,552
And Eli can hear them.

353
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,301
And we think there's a
ghost attached to you,

354
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,399
which would explain your
intruders and the noises,

355
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,601
a lot of things that
have happened to you.

356
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,387
You are asking me to believe

357
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:57,971
that ghosts can hack mainframes

358
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,911
and corrupt video.

359
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,855
From my experience, they
can do way more than that.

360
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,248
Ok...

361
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:06,816
So this ghost...

362
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,801
Any ideas who it is?

363
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,755
We think that it's your sister Rachel.

364
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,097
Well, uh, if she's haunting me,

365
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:18,395
It's because I deserve it.

366
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:24,002
No. What you deserve is to be
able to make peace with her.

367
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,899
Your safe room...

368
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,830
You said you felt like
someone was in there with you.

369
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,899
Maybe someone was.

370
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,102
That's as clear as the audio gets.

371
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,536
Clear as a buzz saw.

372
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:39,950
You gotta jack up the sampling
frequency way up. Move over.

373
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,809
That's the pounding we
heard during the session.

374
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,347
Zack and Shane have
been running the tape

375
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:45,592
trying to identify specifics.

376
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,309
Assuming these are footsteps,

377
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,450
I slowed down the recording to try
and pull out the intruder's gait,

378
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:53,286
maybe determine a shoe
type or height/weight ratio.

379
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,966
Can you hear me?

380
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,135
Do you know where you are?

381
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,608
Can you, uh,

382
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,550
Could you give us a minute, please?

383
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:31,224
Your sister, did she die in a hospital?

384
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,859
No. No.

385
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:36,129
She was found dead in the woods
a couple miles from our house.

386
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:38,832
What...what does this
have to do with a hospital?

387
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,002
I'm not sure, but I need
you to do me a favor.

388
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:45,205
Instead of slowing down the
audio, can you speed it up?

389
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:46,653
Yeah.

390
00:21:00,564 --> 00:21:02,756
I know that sound.

391
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:05,325
Ok, what does that mean?

392
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,261
I think we've got the wrong ghost.

393
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,706
You never forget that sound.

394
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:22,343
The first time we ever heard
Aiden's little heart beating.

395
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:23,615
I thought that's how I remembered it,

396
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,057
But I had to be sure.

397
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:26,329
What do you mean?

398
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,271
The ghost attached to Eli's new patient,

399
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,266
She's been haunting him with a
double heartbeat like this one.

400
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,902
A baby's, mother's, probably her own.

401
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,355
So the ghost is pregnant?

402
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:38,736
I think so, in which case she
isn't Nathan's 9-year-old sister.

403
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:39,811
Well, then who?

404
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,913
I don't know. Something
tells me Nathan should.

405
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,182
I mean, there'd be no reason
to haunt him with her pregnancy

406
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,173
if it wasn't somehow
connected with him, too.

407
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,232
Connected like he's the dad?

408
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,722
Let's hope that narrows the field.

409
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:54,663
Well, that was pleasant.

410
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,294
You said you
wanted one-on-one.

411
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:57,695
What did he say?

412
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:58,963
Nathan's single, 40,

413
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,164
and famously wealthy.

414
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,899
He's been hit with
paternity claims before,

415
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,301
But never by a ghost.

416
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,607
Did he give you any
names or possibilities?

417
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,412
Of the women he's been involved with?

418
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:09,307
He's gonna email me a list.

419
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:11,809
My guess, it's gonna
be a very long list.

420
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,813
What, you're surprised
because he's a little geeky?

421
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,315
No. He's a shut-in, right?

422
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:19,650
I mean, a total workaholic.
How many girls can there be?

423
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:20,985
We just have to find the one who's dead.

424
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,653
And we are getting close.

425
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,821
Please.

426
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:24,922
Leave this alone.

427
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,601
Who are you? Why are you here?

428
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:32,834
He's gotta get out of that house.

429
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:35,766
Excuse me. You two should move along.

430
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,335
This is a restricted area.

431
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:38,769
Right.

432
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:42,896
The ghost said he needs
to get out of the house.

433
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:45,316
Looks like Nathan was
stepping out plenty.

434
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:47,051
Yeah, but the ghost
isn't any of these women.

435
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,919
This is the last photo.

436
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:50,721
It's almost 6 months old.

437
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,383
You know, maybe that's why Nathan
started shutting himself in,

438
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:55,240
Because he started feeling haunted.

439
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,287
Or maybe he just got tired

440
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,162
of having his every
move being documented.

441
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,330
Not that I'd mind.

442
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:01,999
Especially if every move was with her.

443
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,000
Or her.

444
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,668
Wait, wait. That's it.

445
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:06,317
That's it. Whoever the ghost is,

446
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,759
If she were involved with Nathan,

447
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,607
It was probably before
his company took off,

448
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,375
before he was in the public eye.

449
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:13,344
Back in his garage days.

450
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:15,197
You know, that's where he
wrote his first program,

451
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:16,515
His mother's garage.

452
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:19,416
We should have talked
to his mom, find out.

453
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:24,021
I'm so sorry that Nathan has
locked himself away again.

454
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,857
I was never able to help him with that.

455
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:28,893
Maybe you'll have more success.

456
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:32,487
It's a challenge raising a genius

457
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:34,265
when you aren't one yourself.

458
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:36,500
Believe it or not, I can relate.

459
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,126
The doctor said that his habits,

460
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,505
You know, the counting and the knocking,

461
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:44,308
were all a part of that
and he'd outgrow it.

462
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:46,200
But I knew different.

463
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,679
He wasn't like that
before his sister died.

464
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:51,715
It must have been hard on all of you.

465
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:53,317
Then later...

466
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:56,053
It was around the time
he graduated college...

467
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,322
I thought, well, maybe
the doctors are right,

468
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,032
because he was a happier
person, for a little while.

469
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,627
Because he met someone special.

470
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:05,396
He told you about Amy.

471
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:07,665
Not a lot.

472
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:09,266
I have a picture.

473
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,138
No, it's here.

474
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:19,376
There.

475
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:23,380
This is her. Amy Warner.

476
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,518
They do look happy.

477
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:30,654
They were. The way he talked about her,

478
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:33,190
The way he smiled all the time.

479
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,392
I was practically planning the wedding.

480
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,961
But it didn't last.

481
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,809
No, I never knew what happened.

482
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,864
He refused to talk about it.

483
00:24:40,932 --> 00:24:43,867
It's probably the last
time I ever saw him...

484
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:45,236
Truly happy.

485
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:46,670
And that was 20 years ago.

486
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:50,541
After Amy, he just went
back to his first love.

487
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:51,542
Work.

488
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,043
Yeah. He moved home with us,

489
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:55,479
Locked himself in the
garage with his computer.

490
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:58,315
Well, you read the
papers. You know the story.

491
00:24:58,383 --> 00:24:59,717
What about Amy?

492
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:01,635
Did you keep in touch with her?

493
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,320
That would have been nice.

494
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,055
No, I never saw her again.

495
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:08,826
Amy Warner died 8 months ago

496
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:10,861
after a long fight with breast cancer,

497
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,380
And according to a log her
friends and family kept,

498
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,831
It was a bitter fight.

499
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:14,965
How so?

500
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:17,334
She sold her house to
pay for her treatments

501
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:18,727
and still didn't have enough.

502
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,838
The medicine ran out with the money.

503
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,172
That's awful.

504
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,409
But maybe that explains
the hospital vision you had.

505
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:27,077
She was pregnant in my vision.

506
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:29,713
And the obit said that she was
survived by a husband and a son,

507
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:31,048
Garrett.

508
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:32,716
The child that she was talking about?

509
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:33,851
A 21-year-old
child.

510
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:35,707
Nathan started his company 20 years ago

511
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,071
after he split with Amy.

512
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,559
So the math could work.

513
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,124
Nathan could be the biological father,

514
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:43,000
and Amy could have raised
her son with another man.

515
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,257
Where's Garrett now?

516
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:45,625
Of course, you're already on that.

517
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,198
He graduated from M.I.T. last spring,

518
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:49,900
Summa cum laude on a full scholarship.

519
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:52,583
Microchip off the old block.

520
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:56,940
Yeah. And brains wouldn't be the
only thing they have in common.

521
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,810
You know, it looks like Garrett shares
Nathan's desire for privacy, too.

522
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:01,212
I can't find a face page,

523
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:03,314
A recent blog mention, not even a photo.

524
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:05,316
What 21-year-old isn't
all over the internet?

525
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:07,551
One who doesn't want to be found.

526
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:08,952
Look, I better go.

527
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,626
I have a condo to show in the morning.

528
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:12,823
Yeah, I gotta get Aiden to bed.

529
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,825
You know, it looks like
he might be stalling.

530
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:18,562
We got to get you upstairs.

531
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,321
But he needs help.

532
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:21,363
Who does?

533
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:23,801
The man in the tiny room.

534
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:25,636
Uncle Eli's friend?

535
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:27,838
Who's the other person in the picture?

536
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:29,106
His little boy.

537
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:31,775
Aiden, do you know
where his little boy is?

538
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:33,677
In his daddy's house.

539
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,412
And he's really angry.

540
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,644
So if Nathan's son is
there up at the house,

541
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:50,012
does that mean he's a ghost, too?

542
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,281
I don't think so. I
couldn't find an obituary

543
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:53,499
on Garrett Warner

544
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,053
or Garrett Brock, Amy's husband's name.

545
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:56,885
What about amy's husband? Could
he tell us what's going on?

546
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:58,287
I tried to call him at his office,

547
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:00,038
They said he was out of
the country, unreachable.

548
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:01,790
So for now we have
to go on what we know.

549
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,293
Which is what? We have a
ghost that isn't talking to us,

550
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,961
We don't even know what
their son looks like,

551
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:08,430
And how did Garrett get
into Nathan's house, anyway?

552
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:09,713
I practically had a cavity search,

553
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,151
And I'm a shrink.

554
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:13,954
We know that Garrett just
graduated from M.I.T.,

555
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:15,205
So what does that tell you?

556
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:16,505
He's a lot smarter than me.

557
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:19,808
Everyone who's working in the fortress
is writing software for Nathan.

558
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:22,533
So an M.I.T. grad would fit right in.

559
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,929
So Nathan's feeling of being watched,

560
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,173
that wasn't just a ghost?

561
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,648
His son is working there.

562
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:28,784
His angry son, according to Aiden.

563
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:31,653
What's he angry about? He's
a college grad with a job.

564
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:33,955
With a millionaire father who
couldn't be bothered enough

565
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:35,824
to cough up money to save his dying mom.

566
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:37,229
Well, when you put it like that.

567
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:38,827
Can you blame him?

568
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:41,330
He's a boy who just lost his mother.

569
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,332
How could anyone blame him?

570
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,635
Amy, blame him for what?

571
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:47,336
What is Garrett doing at Nathan's house?

572
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,470
I don't know.

573
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:49,671
I see him looking at his computer,

574
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:50,906
but I don't know what he's doing.

575
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,876
You said he needed to
get out of the house.

576
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,191
You meant Garrett, didn't you,

577
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:55,882
because he's planning
some sort of revenge?

578
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,814
Otherwise, why not just tell
Nathan that Garrett is his son?

579
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:00,582
Or are you angry at Nathan, too?

580
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,585
I tried keeping them apart.

581
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:06,021
But it was too late. There's...

582
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,323
There's too much to explain.

583
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:10,058
But I thought if Nathan stayed
in that room every night...

584
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:11,360
He'd at least be protected.

585
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,183
You didn't tell him the truth, did you?

586
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:18,173
That's why he's so angry, because
you never got the chance to explain.

587
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,698
Garrett found his birth certificate
in my things after I died.

588
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:25,542
But he doesn't know

589
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:28,278
I never told Nathan he had a son.

590
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:31,597
He thinks his birth
father chose to neglect us.

591
00:28:31,597 --> 00:28:34,068
Please, just help us with Garrett.

592
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,218
We can talk to him for you.

593
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:37,907
We can get him to stop
doing what he's planning.

594
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,835
There's no time.

595
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:47,429
We gotta find that kid.

596
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:55,268
See anyone who could be his son?

597
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:57,198
They all look like reporters to me.

598
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,486
Hey, everyone. Welcome
to the press conference.

599
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:02,197
Your press packets can be
located at the back table.

600
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:05,645
Just make sure you pick one up
at the end of the conference.

601
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,682
Why didn't she contact me?

602
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,183
I...I would have paid
for her treatments.

603
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,818
I would have spent every dime I had.

604
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,854
That's why we're here.

605
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,288
The reason she didn't contact you...

606
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:19,191
And I am so sorry for
dumping all this on you...

607
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,663
You have a son, Nathan, with Amy.

608
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,305
She was pregnant when
the two of you broke up.

609
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,534
I have a son?

610
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,702
Are you sure?

611
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,870
His name is Garrett.

612
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,204
He's 21 years old.

613
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,339
We think he's here.

614
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:35,808
Right here in Grandview?

615
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,778
You might want to take a calming breath.

616
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,488
The employee files are
in that folder there.

617
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:46,552
Wait a minute. You're sure that
he's working here, in my home?

618
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,861
I've never heard his name.

619
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:50,476
He's a smart kid. He's probably
not using his real name,

620
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,059
even though it's his stepfather's.

621
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,383
We couldn't find a pic,
but we know his age.

622
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,542
And we have a pretty good idea
of when you might have hired him.

623
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,304
Is there a quick way
to scan recent hires?

624
00:29:58,304 --> 00:29:59,407
He would have applied
after his mother died

625
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,599
in the past 8 months.

626
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:01,767
Uh, yeah.

627
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,135
15 minutes, Mr. Weiss.

628
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,705
Listen, you're gonna have
to figure out a way to stall.

629
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:09,041
This is unbelievable. Why would
she not tell me that I have a son?

630
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,824
Here we go. Zack Dorin.

631
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:13,779
Date of birth lines up with
Garrett's, and you hired him recently.

632
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:14,914
Wait, we met him.

633
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:17,059
Yeah, he was analyzing
the security audio.

634
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,019
Do you know where he is right now?

635
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,512
No, I don't. This is unbelievable.

636
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:22,321
I've got a press conference, people
expecting me to sell software, and...

637
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,659
Ok, I'm gonna go look for him outside.

638
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,008
Wait a minute. Hold on.

639
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:29,462
If he's here, I will find him.

640
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:19,419
Nathan Weiss will be about to turn.
Thank you all for your patience.

641
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,580
What does Garret want with me?

642
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:23,249
I don't know, but whatever it is,

643
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,184
He's been planning it for a long time.

644
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:27,419
Garrett's confused.

645
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:29,321
That makes two of us.

646
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,672
He thinks he can hide from me.

647
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,020
He's not thinking clearly.

648
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,697
I can't believe he
slipped right past me.

649
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:35,432
Well, Garrett obviously
doesn't want to be found.

650
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:37,255
Yeah, well, people said I was nuts

651
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:39,598
to wire this whole place for video.

652
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,900
Who's laughing now?

653
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,968
Hopefully not Garrett.

654
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:05,184
Why can't I find him?

655
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,059
I've got cameras in
virtually every room in the...

656
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,527
except here.

657
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:14,864
It's all right, it's
ok, it's ok, it's ok.

658
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:21,307
Come on, come on, come on.

659
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:22,969
Something's wrong.

660
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:24,876
That door is offline.

661
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,149
What?

662
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:30,382
There he is.

663
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:38,357
Garrett!

664
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:39,425
Garrett!

665
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:53,792
Garrett, no.

666
00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:56,652
Garrett, you think you're
hurting your father,

667
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:58,303
But this will ruin your life.

668
00:32:58,303 --> 00:33:00,253
Time to spread the wealth, Nathan.

669
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:02,290
Garrett?

670
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:06,450
Garrett!

671
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,021
Open the door! Come on!

672
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,190
No, no, no, you're not
gonna get a signal in here.

673
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,424
These walls are too thick.

674
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,194
But there's gotta be a
way out of here, right?

675
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:16,872
He cut the land line, too.

676
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:25,838
Oh, no.

677
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,311
What is that?

678
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:33,579
What's happening?

679
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:36,115
He must have started an electrical
fire when he cut those wires.

680
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,809
That smoke is toxic.

681
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,590
There's gotta be ventilation.

682
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,450
No, that is the ventilation right there.

683
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,681
And if he's cut all those wires,

684
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,757
Then that smoke alarm
is not alerting anyone.

685
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:47,344
Well, how long until they
start to miss you out there?

686
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:48,761
Too long.

687
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,562
We'll die in here.

688
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:01,403
Here! Help me put this
over the vent, all right?

689
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,473
Come on!

690
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,507
Ok.

691
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:07,676
This is not gonna buy
us enough...enough time.

692
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:09,377
It doesn't matter. We can't give up.

693
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:12,128
I never meant for any of this to happen.

694
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:15,383
What about Garrett? Is this
all just a part of his plan?

695
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:17,519
Is Amy here? What is he trying to do?

696
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:20,355
It's some kind of robin hood
plan to get back at Nathan.

697
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:23,125
I watched him typing. I think
he's leaking Nathan's software

698
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:24,212
to give away free to everyone.

699
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:25,951
But he never meant any physical harm.

700
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:29,160
Well, then help us! Please go find Eli.

701
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,113
Let's go, come on.

702
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,307
Come on, come on.

703
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:45,407
You gotta go in there. Garrett's inside.

704
00:34:45,407 --> 00:34:47,547
They're trapped in the panic room.

705
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:50,485
Nathan needs your help!

706
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,327
Garrett!

707
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:59,287
Get away from there. You're done.

708
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:00,671
No, wait. I'm trying to help them.

709
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:03,282
No! He's the only one who
knows how to get Nathan out.

710
00:35:03,282 --> 00:35:04,994
Let him go. He can help.

711
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:06,861
They need air!

712
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,442
Hurry, Garrett, quick!

713
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,253
I'm trying, I'm trying!

714
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:24,086
I got it!

715
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,785
You nearly killed us.

716
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,189
What the hell do you think you're doing?

717
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:37,257
I don't know.

718
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:39,749
I don't know.

719
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:41,527
Let's go.

720
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:52,347
Now, if charges are brought,

721
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,616
what kind of penalties
would he be facing?

722
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,284
None of this should have happened.

723
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:57,619
If I knew how to stop it...

724
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:59,711
Well, you could have stopped
it from ever starting.

725
00:35:59,711 --> 00:36:01,723
Why didn't you tell
Nathan you had a child?

726
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:03,625
Well, it was complicated.

727
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:06,261
Even I didn't know
about Garrett at first.

728
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:11,967
I was walking home from work

729
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:14,202
when I started feeling
lightheaded and weak.

730
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,682
I'd been having a hard
time keeping anything down.

731
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:19,312
I thought it was a stomach virus.

732
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,623
Then I collapsed.

733
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,081
Someone got me to the hospital.

734
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,082
Can you hear me?

735
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,917
Do you know where you are?

736
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,086
The doctor said I was
severely dehydrated...

737
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,058
And that I was pregnant.

738
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:35,693
You were running, and
the next thing you knew,

739
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,361
You were hearing your baby's
heartbeat on the monitor.

740
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,063
Why didn't you share
any of this with Nathan?

741
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,598
I planned to, but by the time

742
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,733
I got home to our
apartment, Nathan was gone.

743
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,059
He'd packed up his stuff and moved out.

744
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,065
Why?

745
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:48,506
You'd have to ask him that.

746
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,547
All right, I'm gonna
post Garrett's bail,

747
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,549
My lawyer will represent him.

748
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,051
But whatever happens next

749
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,585
is out of my control.

750
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,819
We all need to talk.

751
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,427
Of course I remember that night.

752
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:10,865
What I still don't understand

753
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,930
is why she didn't call me,

754
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:15,599
Tell me that she was in the hospital.

755
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,137
Would you even have been there?

756
00:37:17,137 --> 00:37:20,333
Were you already gone? You left me.

757
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,045
Nathan, first you have to
tell Amy why you left her.

758
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,710
I tried to call her office that night,

759
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:30,012
and they said that she had been
gone from work for quite a while.

760
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,075
And, uh, many hours later,
Amy still wasn't home.

761
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,802
It wasn't like her not to call.

762
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,636
So I panicked.

763
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:41,522
I started calling her friends,

764
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:44,142
I called the police, I
even called the morgue.

765
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,431
And I kept having this
part of me that was saying,

766
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,733
Don't worry, everything's gonna be ok,

767
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,706
There's gotta be a good
explanation for this.

768
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:54,478
But there was this other part.

769
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:57,956
That lived in fear, ever
since your sister went missing.

770
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:01,939
And I thought, I never want
to go through that again.

771
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,281
I'll never go through that again.

772
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:08,021
I...I called him at work the
next day and tried to talk,

773
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,529
but before I could
even get a word out...

774
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:11,132
She's saying that she tried to explain.

775
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:12,361
No, I wouldn't let her.

776
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,700
No, I told her that we were done

777
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,262
and that there was nothing left.

778
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:20,470
But clearly there was.

779
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,391
A lot.

780
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,602
And I missed it all,

781
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,771
Trying to protect
myself, trying to be safe.

782
00:38:28,628 --> 00:38:30,241
There's nothing safe about love.

783
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,343
What can I say? I'm
an emotional cripple.

784
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,445
I'm not fit to hold on to anyone.

785
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,148
He thinks he's so good
at shutting himself off.

786
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,415
He's not.

787
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,877
Just look at his pass code.

788
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,753
Amy doesn't believe that.

789
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,552
Neither do I.

790
00:38:44,552 --> 00:38:46,991
When we were locked in,
I saw your security code.

791
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,626
I saw it, too.

792
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,327
It's November.

793
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,030
The month you broke up.

794
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,598
How can you say that you're
not fit to hold on to anyone?

795
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,433
You've been holding on
to her this whole time.

796
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,271
If he could just understand what
Garrett was really trying to do in there.

797
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:05,009
She wants you to tell Nathan the
real reason you came to see him.

798
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:10,481
When I found out that he was my father,

799
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:11,949
I read all about him.

800
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,018
I saw pictures.

801
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,020
I looked in the mirror.

802
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,889
Is this his chin?

803
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,125
Are these his eyes?

804
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:25,812
You know, what parts
of me came from him?

805
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,165
And would he recognize it?

806
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,834
They're alike in other ways, too.

807
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,369
They're so smart,

808
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,471
Ambitious,

809
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,473
Generous.

810
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,944
She says you're like your
father in all the best ways.

811
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,999
You're both very generous.

812
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,415
That's not what I thought at the time.

813
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,548
I read that Nathan wanted his first
software program to be open source.

814
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:50,499
Free to everyone.

815
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:54,892
Since mom died because she
couldn't afford her medicine...

816
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,027
I guess it seemed kind of poetic.

817
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:00,991
Make him pay by giving away something

818
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:03,767
that he thought should have been
given away in the first place.

819
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,904
That's right.

820
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,607
You're right.

821
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,908
I sold out.

822
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,711
I got a lot of homes

823
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,779
and nice toys...

824
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:18,048
Not much else.

825
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:20,522
I think amy's hoping

826
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:23,287
now that you'll realize you
have much more than that.

827
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,389
You know, every once in a while,

828
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,792
I hire someone who reminds me of me.

829
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,062
I see this kid who is smart

830
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,198
And driven.

831
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,834
And, yes, a bit pigheaded.

832
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:43,407
It's usually mixed feelings,
having yourself mirrored back.

833
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,745
But not this time.

834
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:58,255
Will you tell Nathan I'm sorry
I never trusted his heart?

835
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,190
But I do now.

836
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,592
I will.

837
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,130
And tell Garrett goodbye.

838
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,066
And that I love him.

839
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,065
Green.

840
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,105
I'm home.

841
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,002
Just in time to tuck someone in bed.

842
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,871
I come bearing gifts, huh?

843
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:48,825
One for you...

844
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:51,185
I've got something great for you.

845
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:52,913
Cool!

846
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,279
Doctors use it

847
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,247
to look into people's eyes.

848
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,782
Look, I know it's not flash,

849
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,018
But if you have trouble sleeping...

850
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,653
I don't need flash to sleep anymore.

851
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,321
Really? No more being afraid?

852
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,191
Nope. But they're gonna love this.

853
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:11,762
They?

854
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,349
Where did all that come from?

855
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,609
They like to move stuff around.

856
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:27,444
Look.

857
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:28,903
They found flash.

858
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:31,115
They who? Aiden, who
are you talking about?

859
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,182
My friends.

860
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,385
Your friends.

861
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:35,619
Are they here now?

862
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,121
They were here a second ago.

863
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,390
I thought you could see them.

864
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:40,724
No. No, I haven't.

865
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,559
Are they ghosts?

866
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:44,862
No. They're different.

867
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,863
Different.

868
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,664
How are they different, buddy? Tell us.

869
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,301
Well, they like this
stuff because it's shiny,

870
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:52,393
Like them.

871
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:55,406
Can I give them some paper clips?

872
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:56,767
Yeah.

873
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:59,743
Sure, sport. My desk, center drawer.

874
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,747
They're shiny?

875
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:04,882
Not ghosts.

876
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:08,225
Maybe they're just
imaginary friends, huh?

877
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:11,998
Honey, what's going on?

878
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:14,854
I don't know.
