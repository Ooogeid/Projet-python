1
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:04,608
Hello? Ned: Hey, is this sonja?

2
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:06,042
Yeah, who is this?

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,645
Ned and noah from the "ned and noah show"

4
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:10,992
On wqry campus radio.
How's it going tonight?

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,916
Actually, I'm sort of
cramming for a midterm.

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,779
So what's up?

7
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:18,448
Well, we have your boyfriend
aaron here in studio with us.

8
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:19,993
Hey, sonja.

9
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,647
Aaron?

10
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,796
What are you up to now?

11
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,402
He has something he wants to tell you.

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,147
Is it ok if we broadcast your conversation?

13
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:28,215
I guess.

14
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:29,281
But what's going on?

15
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:30,738
Don't worry, sonja.

16
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,000
We've got two ticketsto seey

17
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,598
Ifou'll just hear him out.

18
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,236
Ok. Cool.

19
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:37,444
Oh, you guys are lifesavers.

20
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:39,051
This estate auction just
popped up out of nowhere.

21
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:41,458
Hey, free wine, I'm yours.

22
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:42,731
Hey, which station is he on?

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,407
Um, wqry,

24
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:46,982
88.1.

25
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,957
Oh, my god, we missed the beginning.

26
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,632
I am a terrible mother.

27
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,269
Since when does ned have a radio show?

28
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:53,776
Since he took that broadcast arts elective

29
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:55,583
And his professor liked him so much

30
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,488
That she gave him the six to midnight shift.

31
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,661
There it is.

32
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:59,798
Aaron, man, if you want those tickets,

33
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:01,235
You better get to the point.

34
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,841
Aaron, what do you mean
you're not coming home?

35
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,511
Go on, aaron, tell her.

36
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,883
He sounds good, doesn't he?
The next howard stern.

37
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,252
She needs to hear it from you
before she finds out the hard way.

38
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,581
I want to break-up.

39
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:11,349
It's over.

40
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,716
Is this a joke?

41
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:13,882
Sorry, sonj, it's just,

42
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,719
There's no other way to say it.

43
00:01:15,787 --> 00:01:17,088
What kind of a show is this?

44
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:20,328
Wait a minute, you're dumping me,

45
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:21,765
On a radio show,

46
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,903
For some concert tickets?

47
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,472
Well, you get two ticks, too.

48
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,610
On the other side of the arena, of course.

49
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:29,113
Who the hell is she?

50
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,117
Yeah, aaron. Who's the lucky girl?

51
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:33,455
Sonja, there's no one else.

52
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,459
That's not what you told us.
You said you met her at some party.

53
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:38,867
The party at doozy's house? When I was sick?

54
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,136
Ding ding ding. Go on, aaron.

55
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:41,472
No name, no tickets.

56
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,612
Ok, ok. It's lisa.

57
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:44,813
What?!

58
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:49,547
That skank you work with at copy town?!

59
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:50,783
Oh.

60
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,655
That's really great, aaron.

61
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:55,290
You know what, you deserve

62
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,127
Whatever disease she gives you.

63
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:00,198
I can't believe you're doing this
to me on a freaking radio show.

64
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:03,270
Ok, sonja, hang on a sec.

65
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:04,572
Hello? Hello?

66
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:06,978
Hello? I think we lost her.

67
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,387
That's supposed to be entertainment?

68
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:13,957
I guess these days it is.

69
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,592
That was pretty horrible. Yeah.

70
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,327
No wonder he never wants
me to listen to his show.

71
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:18,796
I can't even believe he thinks that's funny.

72
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,733
What has happened to him?

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,101
Well, he went to college.

74
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:23,571
That poor girl. She seemed so upset.

75
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,207
Or she's a pretty good actress.

76
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,275
You think she was faking it?

77
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:27,543
It was probably a joke.

78
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,845
They were probably all in on it.

79
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,715
Yeah, well, still,
I think it's mean-spirited.

80
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,217
It's one thing for him to be getting

81
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,853
A perfectly useless degree

82
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,889
In the occult sciences, and another thing

83
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,225
For him to be wasting all his time on this.

84
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,094
Um, I agree.

85
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:42,599
But it's actually
anthropology of the occult.

86
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,069
And it's not totally useless.

87
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,540
Especially if we want to find
out what's up with the shadows.

88
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,342
No, I know, I am sorry.

89
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,113
I--how is aiden doing with all of that?

90
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,715
He seems over it.

91
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:56,386
Like his visions, I mean,
he's just laughing and playing

92
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,821
And I'm worrying.

93
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,757
Yeah, well, I get that.

94
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,327
I swear, I don't even know
who my kid is anymore.

95
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,430
Like I said, he went to college.

96
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,067
Yeah, but that doesn't give him an out.

97
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,470
He almost never calls me back.

98
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:12,108
He thinks a quality conversation
is when he texts me something

99
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,244
That's more than a sentence long.

100
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,745
And when I finally do get to see him,

101
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,781
He's always with some new girl.

102
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,085
You think maybe that's the
real reason you're upset?

103
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:25,125
I'm upset because I taught
him to be better than this.

104
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,226
Hey, delia,

105
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:27,728
It was probably just a joke, you know?

106
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,630
He'll be all right.

107
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,470
I know.

108
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:37,274
Thanks for listening.

109
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,076
Be sure to tune in again tomorrow night.

110
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:41,011
And here's a tune to sign us off.

111
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,752
You were awesome.

112
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:51,691
I knew my theater major
would come in handy someday.

113
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,527
Are you still free later?

114
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:56,597
Hmm, I can clear my busschedule.

115
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:59,201
Excuse me. I want to talk
to whoever's responsible

116
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,003
For that show tonight.

117
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,471
I guess that would be me.

118
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,073
Well, then you should
be ashamed of yourself.

119
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,841
Do you have any idea the
pain you are causing people

120
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,475
With stunts like that?

121
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:08,976
It was just a harmless prank.

122
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,944
There is nothing harmless about
destroying people's lives,

123
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,045
To what, what, get a laugh?

124
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:15,379
Everything you kids said tonight,
everything,

125
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:16,580
That's what happened to me!

126
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,682
But we made it all up.

127
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,182
Oh, the party at doozy's?

128
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,350
That was my story!

129
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,785
I had a really good marriage,

130
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,186
And then I got a phone
call just like that one.

131
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,757
What, you think this is funny,
humiliating people?

132
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,361
Listen, m'am, it was a joke.

133
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:32,230
What, you thi'm sorryis funny,
humiliating if we offended you.

134
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:33,431
No, you're not.

135
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:36,233
Because that would require a conscience,

136
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:39,036
Which obviously none of you kids have.

137
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:44,873
Well, that was random.

138
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:49,443
Where'd you guys get the
idea for that, anyway?

139
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:51,411
Yeah, no, ned wrote it.

140
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,779
I thought you wrote it.

141
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,280
It was on the computer
with the song playlist

142
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:57,982
And the other pranks.

143
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:07,923
oh, my god!

144
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,859
What's going on here?!

145
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,728
Noah, dude, you're bleeding.

146
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,768
What the...

147
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:29,310
What was that?

148
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:32,480
I wish I could tell you.

149
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:35,917
Child, whispering: Can you see us?

150
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:44,986
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

151
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,334
Non-fat double mocha for you.

152
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:12,102
Americano with shaved carob for you.

153
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,403
Great minds...

154
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,237
Thank you. I need the caffeine.

155
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:16,772
I didn't sleep last night.

156
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,907
I kept thinking about--

157
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,875
Hey. I brought coffee.

158
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:23,911
The evil entity that
took over my son's body.

159
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,379
Well, you're welcome.

160
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:27,046
We listened to your show.

161
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:30,283
Show? More like a public flogging.

162
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,519
I'm glad you liked it.
It's not real, you know.

163
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:34,019
We were ad-libbing off of an old script.

164
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,787
Maybe, but it was still mean.

165
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:40,091
I can't argue with that.
Somebody else thought so, too.

166
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,225
Somebody dead.

167
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,393
What happened?

168
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:43,761
This woman, she was ranting about

169
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,363
How a prank just like the one we did

170
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,765
Ruined her marriage.

171
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:48,666
Wait, you saw a ghost?

172
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,134
No, she was alive.

173
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,302
But as soon as she left,
the studio went nuts.

174
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,371
Noah's ears started bleeding,
and then the word

175
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,506
"killers" popped up on my laptop.

176
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:58,208
We're pretty sure they didn't mean the band.

177
00:06:58,275 --> 00:06:59,942
And did you get the woman's name?

178
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,577
She was way too busy yelling at us.

179
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:03,045
Hold on.

180
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,713
You're just diving in to help him?

181
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:07,482
Mom, noah's ears were bleedings.

182
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,317
So where did you get the idea for the prank?

183
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:12,385
That's the thing. I thought
noah wrote it, he thought I did.

184
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,652
It was jt there on our computer

185
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,820
With the rest of the program

186
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,654
For the broadcast.
Looked like an old transcript

187
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:19,222
Of a stunt from when the
station was commercial.

188
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,624
But all the names were sketched out.

189
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,159
So maybe the ghost resurrected
it to torment this woman?

190
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:27,761
Were these pranks staged back then,
or were they real?

191
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:28,997
I think maybe both.

192
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,499
I don't know, I've got noah going through

193
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,966
All the old transcripts, but so far...

194
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,301
Let's see.

195
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,438
Wqry was a commercial station
until about six years ago.

196
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,174
When the owner donated it to the university.

197
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:41,008
I wonder if anybody was
killed because of that prank.

198
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,609
Well, it wouldn't surprise me.

199
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:43,810
Sounds like whatever set that woman off

200
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,812
Might have stirred the ghost up, too.

201
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,481
Hilarious, right?

202
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,983
Ok, here's your first lead.

203
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,151
The station's most popular show was

204
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,852
"drivin' home," with dj dean olsen.

205
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,854
Looks like he did telephone pranks, too.

206
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,222
Where is he now?

207
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,856
It says he abruptly quit at the height

208
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,824
Of his popularity about eight years ago,

209
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:00,892
But doesn't say why.

210
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,794
Probably moved to a bigger market.

211
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,262
No.

212
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,930
Not exactly.

213
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,434
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Jeez.

214
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:12,736
We're here.

215
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,846
You sure this is the right place?

216
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:29,015
I found it on the penthius satellite map.

217
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,385
It's a camper in the woods

218
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,826
Excuse me.

219
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,862
Hello?

220
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,599
Hello?

221
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,508
Aah! Don't-- don't do that!

222
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:01,111
Sorry. We were hoping

223
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:02,512
To talk to you about your radio show.

224
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,513
What?

225
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,612
It's about wqry.

226
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,281
Wonder why what?

227
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:08,682
Wqry?

228
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,516
We need to talk to you.

229
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:14,052
Sorry. I forget these are in sometimes.

230
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,054
All right, what's this about?

231
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,621
Your show on wqry.

232
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:21,256
Yeah, well, if you're fans, get over it.

233
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:22,591
Show's over.

234
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,092
I spent the past eight years of my life

235
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,195
Trying to get away from it, so...

236
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:28,763
'cause strange things have been happening?

237
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,465
Like things you can't explain?

238
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,300
Who are you?

239
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,602
Yeah, we must have done
thousands of those calls.

240
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,671
I don't-- I don't remember every single one.

241
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,174
Husbands leaving wives for another woman,

242
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:43,276
Wife leaving for another man,

243
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:45,945
Husbands leaving for another man.

244
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,080
Yeah, your angry lady could be anybody.

245
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:50,148
The calls you did back then,
were they real or staged?

246
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,549
A little bit of both.

247
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:52,817
Even when the callers were in on it,

248
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,852
You never knew what might come popping out.

249
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,620
So if it was real,

250
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,021
This lady's husband must have dumped her

251
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,890
On your show for another woman. Yeah.

252
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:01,758
Which narrows it down to a gazillion.

253
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,026
Only this time, somebody died.

254
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,727
Died?

255
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,662
And we're guessing they're blaming you.

256
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,664
How could a dead person be blaming...

257
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,102
So, wait, are we talking ghosts here?

258
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,237
Yeah, we are.

259
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:19,706
So it's real?

260
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,441
Everything that's been happening to me,

261
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,410
It's real? I'm not-- I'm not crazy!

262
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:25,378
No. You're haunted.

263
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:28,447
By someone you rubbed the
wrong way on the radio.

264
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:32,217
Can you tell us how it started? Yeah.

265
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,452
The same way you said happened to you.

266
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,187
The board just went haywire.

267
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:37,255
It kept playing the same song over and over.

268
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:39,257
"in my place" by coldplay.

269
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,791
Hey, how did you know?!

270
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:43,627
Ok, so, yeah, ok, it is real. It's just,

271
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:45,128
Even after I left the station,

272
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,797
Everywhere that had a speaker

273
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,066
Or electricity would play that song!

274
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:52,301
Is that why you're not
hooked up to any power?

275
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,002
Why you've been camping out

276
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,103
For the last eight years?

277
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,270
You wanted to get off the grid?

278
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,405
Can you imagine what it's like

279
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:58,939
To go without music,

280
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:02,242
When it used to be my whole life?

281
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,743
Look...

282
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:05,778
We can help you.

283
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,846
We can get this ghost to leave you alone.

284
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,415
But we've got to find the woman
who came to the studio last night.

285
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,450
I'd love to help you, believe me,

286
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,418
But we've had a lot of cds.

287
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:15,853
Compact discs?

288
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,454
No, collateral damage.

289
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:18,922
People who get caught in the crossfire.

290
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,423
But no one who actually died.

291
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:21,491
That you know of.

292
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,230
It's happening to you now.

293
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,866
And it won't stop.

294
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,803
It never stops!

295
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:37,905
You have to leave! Get out of here! Go!

296
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,272
Leave!

297
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,741
Please leave!

298
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,481
Aiden, remember how mommy told
you that if you make a mess,

299
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,948
You have to clean it up?

300
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:52,150
Why are toys a mess?

301
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:54,819
Because they're all over the living room.

302
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,954
Come on, let's get these upstairs.

303
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:59,857
And then you can finish your drawing.

304
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:05,427
Aiden, did you hear me?

305
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,197
What's wrong?

306
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:11,432
You're bleeding.

307
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
What?

308
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,404
Oh.

309
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,372
Oh, well, you know what, baby? It's ok.

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,208
Right? Look at me, I'm ok.

311
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,519
What are those?

312
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,955
Daisies?

313
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,191
It was his undoing.

314
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,259
Who's?

315
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:03,440
You're listening to the "ned and noah" show,

316
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,443
Rockin' rock u. Till midnight.

317
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,278
Tj, do you want to tell
us about the next song?

318
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:10,616
Let's just say this one goes
out to someone pretty cool.

319
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,752
I'm pretty sure that the
ghost had a violent death.

320
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,254
There was blood and hair stuck in the glass.

321
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,387
A head injury, maybe?

322
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,588
Yeah, that would explain the hair.

323
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:21,522
So the husband comes back

324
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,691
After the radio prank,
and things get violent.

325
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:24,825
But if she killed him,

326
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,693
Why would she be here yelling at you?

327
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,529
She said it was exactly like
what happened to her, right?

328
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:31,197
So we're pretty sure her
husband went on the air

329
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:32,732
And told her he's leaving
her for another woman.

330
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,234
Daisy. No, thanks.

331
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,268
Not my favorite flower. No, no, no.

332
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,603
Aiden's picture. Maybe it wasn't a flower.

333
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:40,704
Maybe it was a name.

334
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:43,140
I mean, he said that it was his "undoing."

335
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:46,609
Undoing? What 5-year-old says "undoing"?

336
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:47,944
It was a vision dream thing, all right?

337
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,012
Look, maybe she was the other woman.

338
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,280
Or his wife.

339
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:53,915
Ok, so the ghost is her husband,

340
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:57,385
And he's angry because he thinks
that the radio show killed him?

341
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,853
How? A head injury.

342
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,755
Will you pay attention?

343
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:03,223
How are you doing with those transcripts?

344
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,658
I'm still looking.

345
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:06,226
All the others ones have
participant's names,

346
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,494
Phone numbers, so if we find it...

347
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:09,495
If?

348
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:10,696
The station's archives

349
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:12,030
Are like the last scene from "raiders"--

350
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:13,899
Miles and miles of boxes.

351
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,969
Are you hearing this?

352
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,304
It's the same song as before.

353
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:21,438
Everybody... Second man: Has...

354
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:22,606
Dirty... Third man: Laundry

355
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:24,373
Fourth man: Even...

356
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:26,441
Fifth man: Your host, ned banks.
What the hell?

357
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,143
First man: Ned slept... Second man: With...

358
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,479
Shut it off! I can't!

359
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:31,480
Ned... Second man: Slept...

360
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:32,481
Third man: With... Woman: Tj's...

361
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:33,549
Second woman: Roommate.

362
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,355
Ned?

363
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,124
Is that true?

364
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,659
I can explain.

365
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:48,127
Save your breath.

366
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,329
Tj, wait...

367
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,466
Tj!

368
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,467
Hold on!

369
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,702
Oh!

370
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,204
Ned!

371
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,338
Ned!

372
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,907
Funny, huh?

373
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,062
jim! Where is he?

374
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:16,129
Is he ok?

375
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,497
Hey, he's fine, he's ok.

376
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,765
We gave him a few stitches.

377
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,333
No concussions, all right?

378
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,468
Oh, well, that's good,
because I'm going to give him one.

379
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,837
All right, I'm going to let you two talk--

380
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,205
Quietly, please.

381
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:30,173
And, ned,

382
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:32,142
Be a little more careful out there, ok?

383
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,377
I'm fine, mom.

384
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:37,145
No, actually, you are anything

385
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,313
But fine.

386
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,614
I heard your show.

387
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,082
Is it true?

388
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,452
What that creepy voice said
about you and tj's roommate?

389
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,854
Look, it's really no one's
business but mine and tj's.

390
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:48,921
And her roommate's.

391
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,990
What's gotten into you, ned? Nothing.

392
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:52,224
We've been hanging out for a few weeks.

393
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,458
It's not like we're a couple.

394
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,293
Oh, does she think you are? No.

395
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,095
I mean, I don't think so.

396
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,930
How should I know?

397
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:00,931
It doesn't even matter to you?

398
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,933
You think it's just cool
to be hanging out with tj

399
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,701
And then sleeping with her roommate?

400
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:05,769
It was one time,

401
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:06,870
And vivian didn't tell her, either.

402
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,706
Well, exactly. Which just proves

403
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,674
That you both know that it was wrong. Mom!

404
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,576
I'm in college. This is what people do.

405
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:13,810
Really? You think because these are

406
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:15,212
Your, what, formative years,

407
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,347
That you can just go ahead
and hurt people's feelings

408
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,049
Just so long as you get something out of it?

409
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,617
Well, I got news for you, ned.

410
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:23,353
These are tj's and vivian's
formative years, too.

411
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,354
It's not like I'm going around--

412
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:25,656
Do you want to be that guy?

413
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,858
That guy that teaches
girls that guys are jerks

414
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:29,727
And can't be trusted?

415
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,996
Noah.

416
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,498
Hey.

417
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:36,699
Yeah, I'm fine.

418
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,535
You sure?

419
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:42,672
Great, thanks.

420
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,374
Noah found the transcript.

421
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:46,576
He said it's practically
verbatim the one we used.

422
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,511
Except the couple was married

423
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,679
And the wife who got dumped,
her name's maggie carson.

424
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:52,747
Could you please not change the subject?

425
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,049
I'm not done with you yet.

426
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:57,753
Neither is a really pissed off ghost.

427
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,655
Hey, melinda. I got a name.

428
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,294
Uh, maggie carson?

429
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,695
Stevens.

430
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,996
What can I do for you?

431
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,196
My name is melinda gordon.

432
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:16,495
And I'm actually here to talk to you

433
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:17,963
About your visit at the radio station.

434
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,233
I didn't give them my name,
so how'd you find me?

435
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,102
It's a long story, but the short version is

436
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,970
Is that we were going through old
transcripts at the radio station,

437
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:28,471
And we took a lucky guess.

438
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:31,537
I'm here to apologize on
behalf of the station.

439
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,104
Well, you're about eight years too late.

440
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,033
I'm sure it was a terrible time for you.

441
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:37,401
Terrible? Doesn't really come close.

442
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:41,471
Being dumped live on the air,
it's humiliating.

443
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,706
I never thought that those pranks were real.

444
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,407
I mean, I always assumed

445
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:47,475
That one person was in on it
to win some kind of prize.

446
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,377
I guess in your case the prize
was a trip to the bahamas?

447
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,113
Yeah, well, my ex-husband's the
one who got a prize, all right.

448
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:55,649
He ended up marrying the
woman he left me for.

449
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:59,152
This is going to sound strange,
but is he still alive?

450
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,320
Why are you asking me that?

451
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:03,222
I'm just pretty sure that somebody died

452
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,290
After what the dj did with your call.

453
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:06,557
The only thing that died that day

454
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,094
Was my marriage, and if--

455
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:12,396
Damn it, not again.

456
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:14,397
Oh, that's happened before?

457
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,699
Oh, it's just this stupid radio.

458
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,433
It's got a mind of its own.

459
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,934
Well, does the song mean anything to you?

460
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:20,102
No, I've never heard it before.

461
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,570
Wait a minute, did your radio

462
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,371
Just turn itself on the other night?

463
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,241
And that's how you heard the
show in the first place?

464
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,443
Ok, who are you?

465
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,579
Hey, you all right?

466
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:38,784
Hello?

467
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,986
I'm sorry.

468
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,756
Totally lost my train of thought.

469
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,024
Um, anyway--

470
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,825
Look, I don't know who you are,

471
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,159
But you're really creeping me out.

472
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,195
So please, I think you should leave.

473
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,967
Hey.

474
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,368
Do you want your old job back?

475
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,069
No, my wireless is down,

476
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,637
And I just wanted to search those names

477
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,105
That you texted me. Oh!

478
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:06,140
Look at this-- maggie
stevens' ex-husband's name

479
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,608
Is jack carson.

480
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,810
He remarried. His second, her first.

481
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,512
Which means maggie was telling the truth,
the prank was real.

482
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,246
You doubted her?

483
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,548
Well, she just got really tense

484
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:16,782
When I mentioned somebody had died.

485
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,882
I think she knows more
than she's letting on.

486
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,950
Who did jack marry?

487
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:21,185
Uh, daisy manning.

488
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,888
Daisy. That explains aiden's drawing.

489
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,457
Yeah, but how could she
have been his undoing?

490
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,727
There's absolutely no record
of jack carson's death.

491
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,528
What about daisy? Is she still alive?

492
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:34,031
Ok, I'm checking it now.

493
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:37,133
I can't find any obituary.

494
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,867
So our ghost isn't jack or daisy,

495
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:41,069
But ned told me that dj
mentioned collateral damage.

496
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:43,705
Was there anybody in daisy's
life before she married jack?

497
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:44,705
Ok, let's find out.

498
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:49,009
Then let's nail this ghost.

499
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:50,711
Nobody hurts my kid.

500
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:54,414
Even if he is a two-timing jerk.

501
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,818
Bingo. You were right.

502
00:19:57,886 --> 00:19:59,587
So daisy was engaged before,

503
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,589
To a man named bruce adler.
Look at the date.

504
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:03,857
A month before the broadcast.

505
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,191
Ok, hang on.

506
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:13,264
And guess who's been a missing person
since the day of the radio show.

507
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:16,533
Yep. We got our ghost.

508
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,005
So I spoke to a supervisor

509
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:29,173
And I got us upgraded to a royalty suite

510
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,840
With a private balcony.

511
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:32,007
Nice.

512
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:34,909
Guess I better pack my tuxedo.

513
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:37,344
Hey, did you leave the stereo on?

514
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:40,545
Wasn't me.

515
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,147
Uh, daisy, you're bring your wedding dress?

516
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:47,382
What?

517
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:51,785
Wait, that's not your--

518
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:55,154
No, that's the one I bought
when I was engaged to bruce.

519
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:58,089
It's been packed away in the garage.

520
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,426
Then how the hell did it get here?

521
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,536
Aahh!

522
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,526
Hi. Excuse me,

523
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:18,760
My name is melinda gordon.

524
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:20,128
You must be jack.

525
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,930
I'm sorry, do I know you?

526
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:25,835
No, I was hoping to talk
to you or your wife.

527
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,736
Does she know you?

528
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:30,406
No.

529
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,808
Wait, I'm sorry,
this isn't a very good time.

530
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,742
I can see that.

531
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:40,213
Um, I need to talk to you about bruce adler.

532
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,983
Does that mean anything to you?

533
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,451
Oh, my god.

534
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,222
You're saying a ghost did all of this?

535
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,890
I haven't seen bruce,

536
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,124
And I don't have proof that he's dead,

537
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:56,192
But that's my guess.

538
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:57,526
He's dead.

539
00:21:57,594 --> 00:21:59,127
I've always known it.

540
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:00,295
How?

541
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:02,597
Because bruce wouldn't just disappear.

542
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:05,599
He had a life, he had a job, he had parents.

543
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,501
He wouldn't blow out of his
office one day and just vanish.

544
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:09,635
We were engaged.

545
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,737
So you two were happy together.

546
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:13,038
Yeah!

547
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,574
I'm sorry, I'm just a little confused.

548
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:18,075
Because didn't you leave bruce

549
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:19,877
So that the two of you could be together?

550
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:22,046
What are you talking about?

551
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:23,747
I read a transcript at the radio station.

552
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:27,383
On air you told your wife that you
were leaving to be with daisy.

553
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:31,253
How do you know about that?

554
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,754
The ghost has been using the radio station

555
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:35,222
To haunt people. He dug up your call

556
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,891
And tricked the new djs
into playing it on air.

557
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,193
Ok, jack, what call?
What is she talking about?

558
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:42,695
Wait a minute, you didn't
know about the radio show?

559
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:43,830
No.

560
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,565
You told your wife what?

561
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:46,599
Ok, I can explain.

562
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,033
Thank you for trying to help us,

563
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,835
But I really think that you should leave.

564
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,203
The ghost is angry.

565
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,804
He blames what happened that day, your call,

566
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,205
For his death.

567
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,041
There's one song that keeps
playing over and over again,

568
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,509
And the dj who got you to do this,

569
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:01,577
He's been tortured by it for years.

570
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,512
What song?

571
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,647
Coldplay, "in my place."

572
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:09,316
That's the song that was
playing when the picture broke.

573
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:12,284
Ok, so does it mean anything to you?
Is it your song with bruce?

574
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:14,153
No.

575
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:15,454
Ok, so you've never heard it before

576
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:17,489
When strange things have
happened like today?

577
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:20,291
Nothing like this has ever happened.

578
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,494
Why would he punish us?

579
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:23,695
We didn't do anything wrong.

580
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:25,530
We fell in love.

581
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:29,198
After you separated from your wife.

582
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:32,334
Look, I freelanced at the
place that jack worked.

583
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,603
I left one day because I got a phone call

584
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:38,039
From the police saying
that my fiance was missing.

585
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:39,940
I couldn't sleep.

586
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,876
I couldn't function, for days, for weeks.

587
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,145
I never even went back to that place.

588
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,213
It was months before I ran into jack again.

589
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,548
By then, I'd split up with my wife.

590
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:52,918
Look, I don't know what my husband
told some stupid radio show.

591
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:54,953
But if you can really talk to ghosts,

592
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,022
You tell bruce. You tell
him we did nothing wrong.

593
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,257
Nothing.

594
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,026
So that's it?

595
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:05,561
The husband didn't explain anything?

596
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,962
He showed me my way to the door

597
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,130
As if I'd never been kicked
out of a house before.

598
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,965
Do you think that they were lying?

599
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,566
I think she didn't know
about the radio stunt.

600
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:15,335
How is that possible? I don't know.

601
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:16,903
I mean, maybe they didn't
have any friends in common.

602
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,838
You know, daisy never back to that office.

603
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:20,206
They didn't have very many listeners.

604
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:21,373
Yeah, but if they were a couple--

605
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:22,641
Well, maybe they weren't.

606
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,842
Maybe she was telling the truth.

607
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,376
Listen, they would not be the first cheaters

608
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:26,844
To claim that they only hooked up

609
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:29,046
After both parties were free.

610
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,247
Hmm. Is it possible

611
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:31,782
That the ghost didn't know

612
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:33,817
That they wound up together? Yeah, but how?

613
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:35,418
I mean, even if they waited out of decency

614
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:37,653
To tell their friends
once bruce went missing.

615
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:38,821
You know, he's a ghost.

616
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:40,822
I think he would have known.

617
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,157
Then how come the ghost
is just haunting the dj?

618
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,491
I'd have to ask him that,

619
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,826
But he doesn't seem to
want to come to the party.

620
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:47,560
Hmm. Some party.

621
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:48,861
Listen, I'm parking.

622
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:09,178
Help...Help!

623
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:31,231
Melinda!

624
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:33,066
What happened? Are you ok?

625
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:36,502
I'm fine. I think I know how bruce died,

626
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,736
And maybe where he is.

627
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:38,770
You had a vision?

628
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,738
I know I should be used to this, but...

629
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,340
Daisy said that her fiance
just blew out of work suddenly,

630
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,341
And he works at duncroft electronics.

631
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:46,909
Where is that? It's off of amherst road.

632
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:49,444
Ok, and he thought that his fiancée
was heading for the bahamas.

633
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,779
So what street would he take to the airport?

634
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,614
Probably the teason expressway.

635
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,383
It's got some bad curves,
but it's the fastest way.

636
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,752
Right. And it runs along the river.

637
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,655
Hi, I need to speak to detective
blair. It's important.

638
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:06,459
It was so weird.

639
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,494
I mean, the car was completely submerged,

640
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:10,195
But that song was still playing.

641
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:12,998
And while he was dying.

642
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,265
Well, I guess aiden was right.

643
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,866
You know, daisy really was bruce's undoing.

644
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,368
I'm still not sure aiden
gave me that vision.

645
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:20,536
I mean, I think the ghost wanted me

646
00:26:20,604 --> 00:26:22,105
To know that he suffered, and not alone.

647
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:24,340
Are you sure that there weren't
two people found in that car?

648
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:25,674
Just this one.

649
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:27,609
But I heard a woman screaming.

650
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:29,177
I don't know what to tell you, honey.

651
00:26:29,245 --> 00:26:31,312
That car they found him in,

652
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,814
The doors were locked,
the windows were open.

653
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:34,815
It was registered to bruce adler.

654
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,483
Until the cops get the dental records,

655
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:38,552
They can't notify the family.

656
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,742
Maybe they need dental records,

657
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:08,977
But I don't.

658
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,845
That's the ghost.

659
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:19,889
Jack, hi.

660
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:22,058
Hi, um, can I talk to you?

661
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,726
Yeah, sure.

662
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:26,828
After you'd left,

663
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:27,895
Daisy was really upset.

664
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,663
I'm sorry to hear that.

665
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,998
But the haunting that you experienced,
it's only the beginning.

666
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:36,499
the thing is, daisy was telling the truth.

667
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,334
About how the two of you got involved.

668
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:39,335
Yes.

669
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:41,137
So then why would you go on air

670
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:42,838
And tell your wife that you were leaving her

671
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,173
For another woman?

672
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,275
A woman you coincidentally married.

673
00:27:46,342 --> 00:27:48,075
Do you get my confusion?

674
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,010
Your wife's, the ghost?

675
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:52,146
Wait, you talked to my ex,

676
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,947
Maggie? Yes.

677
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:57,283
And you say bruce died because
he heard us on the radio?

678
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:00,119
I think he was going to
the airport to stop you.

679
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,754
Or to talk to his fiancée.

680
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:05,156
It all seemed so harmless.

681
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:06,957
Harmless?

682
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:11,294
All right, jack, are you ready to do this?

683
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:14,129
I'm going to get your wife on the line now.

684
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,763
You said she's at work, right? Jack: Yeah.

685
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:16,997
hello?

686
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:18,665
Mags, it's me.

687
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:19,766
Hey.

688
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,768
You ok? No, I'm not.

689
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:23,003
I have something to tell you.

690
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,504
Are you alone? What do you...

691
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:26,539
I told my wife that I was leaving her.

692
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:29,841
Well, you know, you saw the transcript.

693
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,976
What do you mean you're
not coming home tonight?

694
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,777
Maggie, I--

695
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,312
Things haven't been going well,
and I'm leaving.

696
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,381
Things haven't been going well?

697
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:39,682
What are you talking about?

698
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,917
I want a divorce.

699
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,318
It's over.

700
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:43,386
I can't believe this.

701
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,555
You're telling me this over the phone?

702
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,056
I'm sorry, it's just--

703
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:49,591
There's no other way to say it.

704
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,529
So she was in on it?

705
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,063
We were instant messaging back and forth

706
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,565
The entire time.

707
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:58,933
But she told me that it was a horrible shock

708
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,335
And that it ended your marriage.

709
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,004
In a way it did.

710
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,906
Things were never the same after that call.

711
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:05,673
Our trip sucked. It was like

712
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,209
I opened the door for every
doubt she had about me.

713
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:10,412
So wait a minute. Maggie lied to me?

714
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,347
Why would she do that?

715
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:14,748
All I know is that she
can be very convincing.

716
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:16,317
Who is she? What?

717
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:18,285
Maggie, there's no one.

718
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,154
Tell her about the trip, jack.

719
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,855
The one to the bahamas.

720
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:23,857
Wait, you said that-- the one you're taking

721
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,292
With your girlfriend. Tell her!

722
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,593
What's happening? Who is this?

723
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:29,863
Hey, maggie, this is dj dean olsen at wqry.

724
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:31,865
I know this is upsetting,

725
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:34,365
But this is your chance
to get all the details,

726
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:38,333
Like who your husband's going to
be rolling around in the sand with.

727
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,703
You're taking her on vacation
the day you leave me?

728
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:43,904
Who is she?!

729
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:48,006
Maggie, let's meet. We'll talk.

730
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,108
Oh, now you want to meet!

731
00:29:50,176 --> 00:29:52,009
Why, so you can lie to me some more

732
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:53,243
About all the late nights?

733
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:54,777
Maggie, really, this is enough.

734
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:56,544
Late night?

735
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:58,612
Jack, didn't you tell me there
was one very late night?

736
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,212
At some party?

737
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,413
The party at doozy's house!

738
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:04,749
When I was home, sick! Jack,

739
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:07,118
Your wife needs to know. She has a right.

740
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:09,186
And don't forget about our deal.

741
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:11,221
Full disclosure, no holding back.

742
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,922
So who is she? Come on.

743
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,591
A hammock and clear blue waters

744
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,259
Are waiting for you and the woman you love!

745
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:19,527
The thing is, I didn't know
why she brought up that party.

746
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:21,395
I thought she was just playing along.

747
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:23,097
But I still had to name someone

748
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:24,364
Or good-bye, bahamas.

749
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:25,965
And the trip that you wanted to take

750
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,766
With your wife maggie. To get it,

751
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,234
I named a girl who worked in my office.

752
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:30,869
I said I was leaving her for daisy.

753
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Why would you do that
if you weren't involved?

754
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:35,376
She was the first person
that popped into my head.

755
00:30:35,443 --> 00:30:38,581
I know it's hard to believe
with us married and all,

756
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,951
But it was random.

757
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:44,790
He just kept pushing me
and pushing me for a name.

758
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:47,493
And so did your wife.

759
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,664
Even though she knew it was a prank.

760
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:56,734
Even thought your instant
message told her to stop.

761
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,070
Did you know daisy was engaged?

762
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:01,404
Yeah.

763
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:02,772
So did my wife. I--

764
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,841
I guess that's why she
seemed like a safe choice.

765
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:07,942
Did she know her?

766
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:13,814
The whole floor would go
out for drinks sometimes.

767
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:18,085
Daisy brought bruce,
maggie would usually join us.

768
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:20,920
Was she jealous of her?

769
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:24,290
I could not have a
conversation with a woman,

770
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:27,425
Any woman, without maggie
grilling me with questions.

771
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:30,328
But I was faithful, I swear.

772
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:34,334
so she never got the
answer she was looking for.

773
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:36,436
And she thought she could get somebody else

774
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:38,137
To get it out of you.

775
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,208
Like a radio dj.

776
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:49,246
Somebody parked in front the
other day asking for directions,

777
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:50,915
Radio blasting.

778
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:54,485
I was cringing, nothing happening.

779
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:56,118
I went to the store,

780
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:58,087
Music floating throughout the sound system,

781
00:31:58,154 --> 00:32:00,355
Song after song.

782
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:03,624
But not that song. The ghost song.

783
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,359
Either he has changed his playlist,
or he's done with me.

784
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:08,027
We think he's done with you.

785
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,863
Unfortunately, he's moved
on to his ex-fiancée

786
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,531
And her new husband jack.

787
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,900
Wait a minute, he married that girl?

788
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,868
Daisy. You remember the call now?

789
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,036
I read the transcript you found.

790
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,139
We think until the ghost realized
they're actually together,

791
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,474
He was either dormant or
happy to haunt just you.

792
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,075
After he died,

793
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:28,177
He probably saw that the
callers were still together.

794
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:29,578
Hmm.

795
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,879
At least for a little while.

796
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,414
And then he saw his fiancée
crying her eyes out,

797
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:36,050
Missing him, and realized
he had died for nothing.

798
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,485
Not for nothing.

799
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:39,419
For my ratings.

800
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:42,322
How can I help them?

801
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:44,857
You said you've been over
the transcript, right?

802
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:46,492
Yeah. It sounded like

803
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,826
The bit where he's leaving her

804
00:32:47,894 --> 00:32:50,161
Was just you goading him into an admission--

805
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,428
A real admission.

806
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:52,563
Well, yeah. That's what his wife wanted.

807
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,134
You're sure?

808
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:58,235
You remember?

809
00:32:58,303 --> 00:32:59,469
Well, even if I didn't,

810
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:00,904
These pieces have a rhythm.

811
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:02,372
You know, you do 'em.

812
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,640
Somebody's looking for a name.

813
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:08,743
If this guy wasn't a friend of the
station or professional actor--

814
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:09,878
He wasn't. Right.

815
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,913
Then his wife put us on his tail.

816
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:13,081
She called the station,

817
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,816
She let us know about her suspicions.

818
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,485
She basically turned us loose on him.

819
00:33:17,553 --> 00:33:20,054
That's how it works.
Sometimes we use people.

820
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:21,889
And sometimes, they use you.

821
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:28,660
Uh, sorry, we're, uh, we're closed.

822
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:31,596
I'm not here for a hair appointment,
and I think you know that.

823
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:33,466
Well, I got a thousand things to do.
I gotta get home.

824
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,600
You lied to me, which is fine.

825
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,400
'cause who am I really, except a stranger

826
00:33:37,468 --> 00:33:39,234
Who's trying to help you. Help me how?

827
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:41,036
By digging up the most
painful moment of my life?

828
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,671
And which moment was that?

829
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:45,940
When your husband admitted that he
found some girl in the office cute?

830
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:49,909
Or was it when you heard her fiancé's
car run off the road and into the river?

831
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:51,110
You're out of your mind.

832
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:52,211
I saw what happened.

833
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,646
I heard your voice screaming.

834
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:55,147
Did you realize what song was playing

835
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:56,548
In the background when he died?

836
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:01,953
How did you do that?

837
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,221
I didn't. Bruce did.

838
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:07,257
Maggie, you started this.
I'm just asking you to finish it.

839
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,292
How? By talking to bruce.

840
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,061
I don't know any bruce!

841
00:34:13,963 --> 00:34:16,198
Ok, well, you're lying about that, too,

842
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:19,133
Because your ex-husband said that you
guys used to hang out after work.

843
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:20,268
Well, I don't remember that.

844
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:21,602
Ok, well, do you remember

845
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,804
Being on the phone with him
right after the radio prank?

846
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,806
I mean, it was you who told
him to turn on dean's show.

847
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:28,040
I mean, really, did you think
that he was going to be able

848
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,474
To stop something that
wasn't even happening?

849
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,376
Shut up, shut up!

850
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,534
Bruce, what are you doing?

851
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,539
Oh, my god, oh, my god, get me out of here!

852
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:08,241
Maggie, I'm trying, just hold on.

853
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,012
Her jealousy killed me.

854
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,081
Now she can drown in it.

855
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,518
Please!

856
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:35,715
Maggie, just hang in there!

857
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:37,550
I turned off the water main.

858
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:54,564
I got it!

859
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:00,067
Anyone in there?

860
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:02,803
We're in here!

861
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,753
I don't know how I'm going
to explain the water damage

862
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:23,421
To the owner of the salon.

863
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:26,823
I know, I got bigger problems.

864
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:29,058
So then why did you do it?

865
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:31,160
'cause even though I knew it was crazy,

866
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:33,328
I never trusted my husband.

867
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:36,431
You know, I'd heard that show before.

868
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:37,532
Dj dean.

869
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,835
God, I thought the callers were so pathetic.

870
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:45,305
And then I thought, you know,
this could work for me.

871
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:48,808
If I could get a third party,
a stranger, really,

872
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,410
Just to talk to my husband,

873
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,645
Maybe he'd tell the truth.

874
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,481
And I'd finally, finally believe him.

875
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,483
Or ifinally be over.

876
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,783
So you called bruce after the show.

877
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,451
Yeah. Just like you said.

878
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,786
I heard the accident.

879
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:07,522
God, it was awful.

880
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,392
And then I called an anonymous
tip into the police,

881
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:12,859
But I couldn't even tell them where to look.

882
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:16,029
I mean, I didn't even know what
kind of car he was driving.

883
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,146
And his cell phone went dead.

884
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,014
But I didn't know he died,

885
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:42,316
I swear. I mean, not at first.

886
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:45,084
And you saw that he was
missing in the papers.

887
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:46,452
When we got back from our trip.

888
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,988
Our horrible trip.

889
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:51,490
But by then, I knew it was too late,

890
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:53,760
For everything.

891
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:56,596
Your husband said he was faithful.

892
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:59,365
Why didn't you believe him?

893
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:03,836
My mother divorced my father

894
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:06,338
When I was three months old.

895
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:09,174
She said she was afraid
he'd get her pregnant again,

896
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:12,910
Like I was the worst thing
that had ever happened to her.

897
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:15,845
That could ever happen to anyone.

898
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:18,181
That's not how jack felt.

899
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:19,715
He did eventually.

900
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:22,384
And you know, I knew,
every time I questioned him

901
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:26,354
About where he was, who he'd been with.

902
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:28,922
She was begging him to love her.

903
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,758
I was driving him away.

904
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,460
But I couldn't stop.

905
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:38,829
Bruce is here.

906
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,536
I didn't even want daisy
to take that job.Ow.

907
00:38:47,604 --> 00:38:49,805
Any job, really, where...

908
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:52,941
Where'd she be around other guys.

909
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:56,144
That's crazy. I mean,
you can't ask that of any girlfriend.

910
00:38:56,212 --> 00:38:58,980
He's saying that he was jealous, too.

911
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:02,216
you know, we were all out one night.

912
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:03,617
Whoa!

913
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:06,419
And jack and daisy, they were laughing.

914
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,623
It was some inside office joke.

915
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,459
Bruce and I could not have been
further from their thoughts.

916
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:14,728
I caught maggie's eye,

917
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:17,930
And gave her a look like, you believe this?

918
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:20,099
To let her know, yeah, there's trouble,

919
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,901
And I see it, too.

920
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,969
I gave you the opening.

921
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:28,506
But it only took one call from her saying,
"turn on the radio."

922
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:32,075
I just thought,

923
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:34,942
If nothing else, they were getting closer.

924
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,010
And I just--I wanted bruce to help,

925
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:39,312
Like, to help me stop it.

926
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:40,779
I didn't need to listen.

927
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,380
Climbed in the car to confront them.

928
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,815
I could have called daisy myself, but...

929
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,018
I'd always thought that
whatever we had wouldn't last.

930
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,721
That it would end with her
leaving me for someone else.

931
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,757
Someone better.

932
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,792
He blames himself.

933
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,961
For giving ihis fear and feeding yours.

934
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:03,097
They're always there.

935
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,468
The love you want,

936
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,269
You can't get that from someone else--

937
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:12,137
Husbands, girlfriend.

938
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:15,240
Even if your parents gave it
to you now, it'd be too late.

939
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,310
He's saying that the love you need to find

940
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:19,944
Isn't romantic love;

941
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,947
That you can't find it with somebody else.

942
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:25,149
That sounds grim.

943
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:29,819
Tell her it's all around her.

944
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:31,621
It's in her heart right now,

945
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:33,455
Waiting for her.

946
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:35,957
I will.

947
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,859
Maggie, you made their being together real

948
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,095
By believing so hard.

949
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:44,965
But believing can make
good stuff happen, too.

950
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,166
If you just try.

951
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:49,869
He said that if you can believe in happiness

952
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:52,004
The same way that you believe in bad things,

953
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,273
You'll find it.

954
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,007
It's all around us.

955
00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:59,410
I see that now.

956
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:06,316
It's beautiful.

957
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,017
You see the light?

958
00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:10,553
Yeah.

959
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,554
Do you?

960
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:15,123
No.

961
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,125
But you trust that it's there?

962
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:21,861
It's a good feeling, right?

963
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,864
It's a great feeling.

964
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:42,546
He's gone.

965
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:57,758
Hi, maggie. I want to apologize.

966
00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:00,094
We never meant you any disrespect...

967
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,865
So, we've been having some pretty
weird technical difficulties here

968
00:42:04,932 --> 00:42:07,300
Wqry this past week.

969
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:09,802
But I'm happy to report they
have all been taken care of

970
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,605
And that we are back in the
business of rocking rock u.

971
00:42:13,673 --> 00:42:16,574
The funny thing about technical errors

972
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:20,277
Is that you can usually figure out
exactly what caused the problem,

973
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:23,280
And fix everything up as good as new.

974
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:26,549
Is that you can usually I wish the
samwere true for human errors.Roblem,

975
00:42:26,617 --> 00:42:29,518
Wouldn't it be great if
when we really screw up,

976
00:42:29,586 --> 00:42:31,887
Weould figure out exactly what
made us act like a jackass

977
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:33,555
In the first place?

978
00:42:33,623 --> 00:42:36,290
And repair the damage.

979
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:38,792
Of course, w'd all be better off

980
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,129
If we could avoid making stupid
choices inhe first place.

981
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:44,864
Take a minute, think about
the collateral damage

982
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:47,933
Thate're causing in sebody else's life.

983
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,668
As it is,

984
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:52,070
All we have is, "I'm rr"

985
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:55,239
And belie me,

986
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:58,174
I am.

987
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,444
Sweet dreams, grandview.

988
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,517
Hello?

989
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:10,918
Hey.

990
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:13,786
I just wanted to tell you that...

991
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:16,922
I'm really proud of you.

992
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,258
Really? Yeah.

993
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:22,660
Really.

994
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:25,395
Maybe we can get dinner one night this week.

995
