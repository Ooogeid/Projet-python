1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,565
Come on, let's just go to the marina, we'll rent a sail boat

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,200
and spend the whole day on the water.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,460
Hey. Please, stop it.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,560
It's not fair,ok,to Delia.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,360
We haven't been out in 3 days,

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,560
And she's,you know, at the store alone.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,000
3 days? What's that?

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,200
After what we've been through, we deserve a week.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,770
Look,why don't we take the train to ocean city?

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,270
There's that little inn we used to go to.

11
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,870
We could spend the whole day there by ourselves.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,770
What's wrong?

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,200
Nothing. It's just...

14
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,800
Waking up with you and talking to you,

15
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,970
I never thought I'd get to do that again.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,140
Well,we're doing it.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,305
I'm not going anywhere.

18
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,740
We just have to get back to normal.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,300
Normal?

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,040
All right,guys. Let's unload this equipment.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,000
Little redecorating, and this'll work just fine.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,200
Oh,what about the town square out front?

23
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,670
- It's available until midnight.  - Perfect.

24
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,370
What's going on, and who are these people?

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,070
Ok,you'll never believe. That is Cally O'Keefe.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,470
She is the creator and the head writer of Hope's Edge...

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,370
And they wanna film right here in the store.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,700
Hope's Edge?

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,900
Yeah,the soap opera.

30
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,940
Uh,I used to watch it at the station with the guys.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,140
Well,F.Y.I., she prefers Daytime serial.

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I think we should get rid of all of those here...

33
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,300
And she's directing this one.

34
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,270
Apparently it's the tenth anniversary of the show.

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,600
They're filming the whole thing right here in Grandview.

36
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,970
Hello. Back to earth. Did you actually say yes?

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
No. Of course not.

38
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,040
We can always tell her no.

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,370
I just think it would be

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,770
great publicity for the store.

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,140
Yeah,but what's gonna be left of the store

42
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,440
when they're done?

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Eh,good point.

44
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,200
Hey,Cal. Hmm?

45
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,440
Oh...my...

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,440
God.

47
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,440
Oh,my god.

48
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,570
Easy,kid

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,670
Can we talk about the scene in the cemetery?

50
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,040
The language feels a little cruel.

51
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Well,you're not yourself,remember?

52
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,440
Look,just...just give me 2 seconds,

53
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,200
and we'll talk about it.

54
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,140
Who is that?

55
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,070
You are so hopeless.

56
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,600
That is Grant Harper.

57
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,570
Yeah,he plays the surgeon on the show.

58
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,700
Yeah,and he just got diagnosed with this brain tumor,

59
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,340
so he's having blackouts all the time.

60
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,770
Oh,my god, and he's still working?

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,740
Oh. No,not on the...

62
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,540
No,it's his character on the show.

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,240
He plays Dr. Troy Dolden,right?

64
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,670
So he has this on-again,off-again

65
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,670
love-hate relationship

66
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,900
- with Celeste... - Celeste.

67
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,140
Barrington,and... she's the owner of the hospital.

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,940
And he has these blackouts, and he...he becomes evil,

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,770
but he can't remember after it happens.

70
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,770
I... It's really addictive.

71
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,040
Yeah,I...I just don't think the fans

72
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,770
Wanna hear me talk to Celeste that way.

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
I will look at it. Promise.

74
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,270
Uh,don't you have that photo shoot right now?

75
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,440
- Yeah.  - Come on.

76
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,200
It's perfect.

77
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,240
We'll take it.

78
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,240
Oh. That's,um...

79
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,570
Oh,gosh. Cally,I'm sorry.

80
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,940
This is my business partner I was telling you about.

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,940
This is Melinda. Hi.

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,100
And this is her,um... wow.

83
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,100
Sam. Sam.

84
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,000
This is Sam. And,uh,this is Duff.

85
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,140
Faraday, first assistant director.

86
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,170
Hello. Nice to meet you.

87
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,440
You have such lovely things in your store.

88
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,670
Oh,well,thank you. Anyway...

89
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Oh,and,Duff,we need to make sure we get these guys

90
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,710
V.I.P. Passes to the thing at the university tonight.

91
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,610
What thing?

92
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,210
An evening with Hope's Edge.

93
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,710
We're screening highlights from the show.

94
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,380
Some of the cast members are gonna do a Q&A.

95
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,810
- Oh,i...I don't know if i... - Cool.

96
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,940
Oh,we would love to go.

97
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,440
Ok. Well,I'm just a little worried

98
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,880
about losing a whole day of business,so...

99
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,910
Compensation's in paragraph 6.

100
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,710
Really? For one day.

101
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,840
Plus a day of prep, with an option to extend,

102
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,380
plus 50% in case Cally goes over schedule.

103
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,580
Nobody's going over schedule.

104
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,210
You know what? Take as long as you need.

105
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,610
So... I haven't seen you much for the past 3 days.

106
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,580
P.S.,you're glowing.

107
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,610
Any connection?

108
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,210
Let's just say everything's fine.

109
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,040
Excuse me,sir. You dropped your hat.

110
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,210
I didn't realize...

111
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,880
Eli. Knew it.

112
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,440
Hey,look, they invited the whole faculty,ok?

113
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,280
And my mom's a big fan,

114
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,410
So I thought I'd come down and get an autograph.

115
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,580
Yeah,mm-hmm.

116
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,010
For her. Not for me.

117
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm not the only one. See?

118
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,110
Hi-ho,everyone.

119
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,740
I'm Duff Faraday.

120
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,580
And as first assistant director on the show,

121
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,210
It's my job to keep things moving along,

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,440
so welcome to an evening with Hope's Edge.

123
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,680
First of all,let's say hello to our exec producer,

124
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,440
creator,head writer, and frequent director,

125
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,640
And,yes,they are all the same person.

126
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,710
Cally O'Keefe!

127
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,010
Thank you,Grandview.

128
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,240
It's a pleasure to be here. I'm...

129
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,910
Oh ho ho. Yes. Yes.

130
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,840
And next up, here they are,

131
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,780
Daytime's dynamic duo.

132
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,010
And,yes,we are introducing them together,

133
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,610
because...whew... wouldn't wanna

134
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Start a fight between these two.

135
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,910
Here they are,

136
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,610
Dr. Troy Holden and Celeste Barrington.

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,640
Say hello to Suzanne Zale and Grant Harper!

138
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,480
You see that?

139
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,740
They love me.

140
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,080
Love to hate you, you mean.

141
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,780
Thank you,Duff.

142
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,110
This is such a treat for us.

143
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,180
You know,I actually discovered Grant

144
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,610
right here on this stage when he auditioned

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
for my first play way back in grad school.

146
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,280
Don't you mean your only play?

147
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,110
So this is an honor for us.

148
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,240
Sorry I'm late.

149
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,540
I was indisposed.

150
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,540
Before we show you highlights from the past

151
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,380
10 seasons of Hope's Edge,

152
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,940
I would like to open things up for your questions.

153
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,640
Oh,this ought to be good.

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Yes.

155
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,880
Hi. My name's Janet,

156
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,840
and I'm president of the Grandview chapter

157
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,880
of the Hope's Edge fan club.

158
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,140
And I don't mean to be disrespectful,

159
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,710
but what were you and your writers thinking

160
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,610
when you decided to ruin the character of Dr. Holden?

161
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,340
Excellent question,cal.

162
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,280
That's the whole brain-tumor, blackout thing.

163
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,880
Got it.

164
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,110
To tell you the truth,

165
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,010
after the last 10 years of Dr. Holden being so flawless,

166
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,710
sometimes to keep a story fresh,

167
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,180
you have to take some risks.

168
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,275
And now spoilerfest.com says

169
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:02,110
you're gonna kill him off for good

170
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,380
Is that true?

171
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,240
Is Grant Harper leaving the show?

172
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,580
- What? - No way.

173
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,210
Look,I don't wanna be confirming or denying rumors...

174
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,280
But I will say,

175
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,480
In TV, there are a lot of reasons

176
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,580
you might have to write a character out...

177
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,080
A salary dispute, an actor breaks out

178
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,080
and the network wants to give them their own series,

179
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,580
or sometimes the actor just wants a change.

180
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,180
And in any of those circumstances,

181
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,510
you might have to kill the actor.

182
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,910
Well,you guys know a thing or two about that.

183
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,440
Ok,ok,we were gonna save this for the end,

184
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,680
but,uh, look on the back of your programs.

185
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,540
There's a form where you can enter a contest

186
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,280
To win a walk-on part on our 10th anniversary special.

187
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,640
No,here. Wait, I wanna do it!

188
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,240
A part in the show. No way.

189
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,010
You guys check that out, and we'll,uh, roll the video.

190
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,660
Thank you.

191
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,240
Rolling, any second now. Video.

192
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,410
We got a surprise guest.

193
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,540
Players are in place.

194
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,010
Stage is set.

195
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,010
Just no video? Tell you why. You...

196
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:17,916
- What's wrong with the lights? - What's with the lights?

197
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,010
Guys, guys

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.

199
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,780
We're experiencing some technical difficulties.

200
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,910
And now someone's gonna go out with a bang.

201
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,840
There you go.

202
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,610
It was definitely a warning.

203
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,870
Something about killing actors?

204
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,810
Wait. The ghost wants to hurt someone?

205
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,970
On the show?

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,030
Because we cannot let that happen.

207
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,200
Obviously.

208
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,770
Uh,any clue as to the woman in the spotlight?

209
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,370
I didn't get a look at her,but

210
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,970
I'm happy to dive right in on this one.

211
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,230
And so you can go hang out with the cast and crew.

212
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,730
You can count me in.

213
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,530
Guys,please remember that we don't know

214
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,430
if we're dealing with a murder or a suicide here.

215
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
I mean,the guy was shot in the head.

216
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,000
Ok. Was he cute?

217
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,600
Well,did he look famous?

218
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,030
Do you think he could have ever been on the show?

219
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,130
That's him.

220
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,030
Miles Maitland.

221
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,470
The guy who the theater's named after?

222
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,770
Yeah,1975 to 1997.

223
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,470
He was a grad student in the acting program.

224
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,230
said he had a promising future.

225
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,600
until they robbed me.

226
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,330
We can help you. What happened?

227
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,670
Ask them.

228
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,370
Uh,what's going on?

229
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,030
He's blaming someone from the show for his death.

230
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,670
What is this guy's connection to hope's edge?

231
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,400
You know,Cally just said that she met Grant

232
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,930
here when she was in grad school.

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Maybe they knew him from back then.

234
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,030
So we're going to need to redress that counter,

235
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,030
and I want books everywhere.

236
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,630
Oh,and I'm going to need to swap out those shelves for red ones.

237
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,900
We'll put them back,of course.

238
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,570
Oh,it's no problem. Whatever you need.

239
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,129
Could we also check the lighting over here?

240
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,700
Why did they rent the store

241
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,270
if they just keep changing everything?

242
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,070
Well,it's supposed to be some kind of antique store

243
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,430
that specializes in the occult.

244
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,000
Ooh,that sounds juicy. I swear,

245
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,530
Hope's Edge is the best show on TV,really.

246
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,385
You really want that walk-on part,

247
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:48,500
don't you, Mr. Suit and Tie?

248
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,530
No more than you, Missy Brand-new 'do.

249
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,900
You know what? Let's just focus on the task at hand.

250
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,430
We have a ghost to cross over.

251
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,330
Fine.

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Ok,here we go,

253
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,670
From April,'97.

254
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,800
"Rockland University student Miles Maitland,22,

255
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,770
"was shot and killed onstage in front of

256
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,200
"an audience of 300 theatergoers Friday night

257
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,370
"during the performance of the comedy play Dead to Me."

258
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,270
Shot and killed onstage?

259
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,270
Yeah.

260
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,800
And guess who wrote the play?

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,470
Cally O'Keefe.

262
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,700
It gets worse.

263
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,130
Guess who played the lead.

264
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,000
Grant Harper. That's our connection.

265
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,330
It says a blank gun fired and malfunctioned

266
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,330
and killed Miles early in the second act of the show,and...

267
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,570
What?

268
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,500
The actress who shot him was Brook Dennis.

269
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,700
Should I know that name?

270
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,030
No, but she's a theater professor here at Rockland.

271
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,600
I've never met her, but I've read all about her productions.

272
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,300
Well,why don't we go and talk to her?

273
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,770
After I do a little fact-finding with the police.

274
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,970
Ok,according to the police,

275
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,270
the gun was an old snub-nosed revolver

276
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,730
that had been in the theater prop department for years.

277
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Now,detective Blair told me

278
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,570
that the barrel was corroded

279
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,630
and that the blank had some extra powder in it,

280
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,670
so at close range, the wadding could have launched,

281
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,770
caused some serious damage.

282
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,170
By which you mean death.

283
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,170
Think about it.

284
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,470
You gun someone down in front of 300 witnesses,

285
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,170
make it look like a tragic accident.

286
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,530
It's the perfect murder.

287
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,900
Brook Dennis.

288
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,100
Our shooter.

289
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,100
"Our shooter." Don't you mean actor?

290
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,270
Wasn't this the woman in the spotlight last night?

291
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah. Was she even charged?

292
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,000
Well,Miles' death was considered an accident.

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,170
They never found any motive.

294
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,600
But there were 3 people in the play...

295
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,270
Miles,Brook, and Grant Harper...

296
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,500
Plus Cally, who wrote and directed,

297
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,370
And all their fingerprints were found on the gun.

298
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,430
So anyone could have tampered with it.

299
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,630
Or everyone.

300
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,070
You don't think that...

301
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,870
Conspiracy?

302
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,930
To commit murder.

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,870
So 3 people conspired together

304
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,930
on a diabolically goofy plan to kill a guy

305
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
in front of hundreds of people for no reason?

306
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,900
Yeah,ok,it sounds a little far-fetched,

307
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,600
but the ghost obviously blames them all.

308
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,500
Otherwise,why would he point a spotlight at all of 'em?

309
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,770
I don't know.

310
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,570
But I also don't know why he would wait so long.

311
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,830
He died 10 years ago.

312
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Well,maybe that little reunion onstage woke him up.

313
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,170
I mean,maybe he was haunting the theater.

314
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,270
Or Brook, who worked there

315
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,600
and happened to pull the trigger.

316
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,600
Maybe the conspiracy is a conspiracy of silence.

317
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,870
Brook killed Miles,

318
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,600
Whether on purpose or by accident.

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,830
The other two know why, but kept quiet.

320
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,170
Unless that's too goofy a theory for you.

321
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,330
No. Actually, that one, I'd believe.

322
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,830
No,Celeste. You'll be fine.

323
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,370
It's our relationship that's not gonna make it.

324
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,000
You can't mean that.

325
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,930
Doesn't change the fact

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,370
That you slept with my father.

327
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,070
So what? So you're cutting me out of your life?

328
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,230
Of course I hid your child from you.

329
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,500
I did it because I lov...

330
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,370
So what are you sayin'? This was good-bye sex?

331
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,400
Why?!

332
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,970
Why?!

333
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,500
How quickly love turns to hate.

334
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,900
How quickly love turns to hate.

335
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,500
How quickly love turns to hate.

336
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,670
Well,I know you by reputation around campus,

337
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,030
Professor James.

338
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,670
Oh. Well, please call me Eli,

339
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,930
And I hope that's a good thing.

340
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,570
Mostly.

341
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,270
Um,would you like to sit down?

342
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,870
- Let me move this.  - I got it. I got it.

343
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,530
Oh,thanks. Just put it by the door for the recyclers.

344
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,470
Is it broken?

345
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,630
Uh,possessed is more like it.

346
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,230
Heh. You guys are gonna think I'm nuts.

347
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,830
We might not,uh...

348
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,830
So what happened?

349
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,430
Well,first it turned itself on,

350
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,970
and then it just started flipping through scenes

351
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,870
from that soap opera that's shooting in town.

352
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,170
What scenes? Do you remember?

353
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,070
Uh,just the 2 main characters

354
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,130
breaking up over and over again.

355
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,500
Anyway,I'm sure that you didn't

356
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,000
come here to talk about my television.

357
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,100
What did you want to see me about?

358
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,530
Uh,Miles Maitland.

359
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,530
What about him?

360
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,770
You may find this hard to believe...

361
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,130
But we think that Miles is haunting you.

362
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,870
We've talked to his spirit.

363
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,330
You talk to ghosts?

364
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,570
And I can see them.

365
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,170
Look,you have to believe us,OK,

366
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,330
because we've seen Miles and your TV,

367
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,300
and this could be just the beginning.

368
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,930
Yeah,that's really strange.

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,670
Because ever since Grant and Cally have been back in town...

370
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,630
I felt Miles was here.

371
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,370
But,you know, I...I just thought it was his memory.

372
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,930
Do you remember what happened the night Miles died?

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,330
How could I forget? I...

374
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,730
I shot him.

375
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,030
Sorry,babe,but if you're asking me to beg for my life...

376
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,670
All I'm asking is that you

377
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,800
don't get blood on my new berber.

378
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,230
What happened after you shot him?

379
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,930
Um,well,Grant and I, we finished the scene like always.

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,900
Miles used to complain that he had to lie perfectly still

381
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,800
throughout the entire second act.

382
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,770
Anyway,uh, we didn't know Miles was dead until curtain.

383
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,800
Call 9-1-1! Close the curtain!

384
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,730
Miles! Miles.

385
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,330
He must have been dead or dying

386
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,500
for at least 30 minutes.

387
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,900
I always wondered if he heard them laughing the whole time.

388
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,670
You said he was shot in the side, not the head?

389
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,600
When I saw him, he had a bullet wound to the temple.

390
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,770
Oh,yeah,yeah. The makeup. Of course.

391
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,000
Um,the trick was that he would play part of the scene in profile,

392
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,630
And when I shot him, he would turn to reveal the wound.

393
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,830
You know,it always got a really big reaction.

394
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,300
Listen,I'm sorry,

395
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,230
But,uh,this is really hard for me to talk about.

396
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,500
You know?

397
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,230
The gun firing like that...

398
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,000
And it was a bad night to begin with.

399
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,170
What do you mean?

400
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,170
Some producers made a deal with Cally

401
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,470
to take the play to the city.

402
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,870
I'm sorry. I fought for you.

403
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,430
It was gonna be everyone's big break.

404
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Let's just finish the show.

405
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,170
But Grant heard a rumor that

406
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,770
Miles was replacing him as the lead,

407
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,770
So he confronted Cally about it at intermission,

408
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,970
And she had no choice. She had to tell him the truth.

409
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,970
You can use this anger for a future role.

410
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,730
And Miles,he wasn't the most gracious winner,

411
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,670
So when we went back onstage,he...

412
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,500
started ad-libbing lines and changing the blocking

413
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,570
and just really trying to rub it in Grant's face.

414
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,700
It was heartbreaking.

415
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,830
You seem pretty protective of him.

416
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,130
Grant,I mean.

417
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,370
Yeah,I was.

418
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,000
You see,we...we'd been dating,Grant and I.

419
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,170
But something changed when we both got cast in the show,

420
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,700
and we broke up.

421
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,070
You know, I was pretty sure that he was having a thing with Cally.

422
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,930
Of course, after Miles was killed,

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the play never went to the city,

424
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,300
And Cally took a job writing for a soap in l.A.

425
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,730
Within the year, she had created Hope's Edge,

426
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,730
and she brought Grant onboard.

427
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,430
And everyone lived happily ever after.

428
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,300
Well,who knows?

429
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,900
I think we all carry that night with us.

430
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,570
I know I do.

431
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,730
I think she's lying.

432
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,100
Well,then she's a good liar.

433
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,230
Of course she's a good liar. She's an actress.

434
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,370
Ok,so then if he thinks it wasn't an accident,

435
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,070
why is he showing her scenes from the show,

436
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,200
and what is it that he's trying to tell her?

437
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,400
"Hello. I know you killed me."

438
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,400
Plus those scenes were with Grant Harper.

439
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,370
That's what she said, right?

440
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,130
Maybe Miles thinks they were in it together.

441
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Right,so then why isn't he haunting Grant,

442
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,270
and why isn't he here telling us that we need to call the police?

443
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,930
Well,the police couldn't find any proof.

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,070
Miles is getting justice the only way he knows how.

445
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,830
That doesn't make any sense to me.

446
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,700
Where are you going?

447
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,900
Watch TV.

448
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,030
Troy,listen to me.

449
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,830
He told me just before he lost consciousness.

450
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,430
He said that he was happy.

451
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
We are gonna get through this.

452
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,830
Hey. What a nice surprise.

453
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,270
What are you doing home?

454
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh... I think the ghost

455
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,200
is using scenes from the show to try and send a message,

456
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,870
so I'm watching old episodes.

457
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,900
Plus they're shooting at the store. It's closed.

458
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,930
Oh,you got a cold?

459
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,100
What's going on? What...

460
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,800
Wait a minute. Are you crying?

461
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,570
Uhh. I kinda got sucked in,ok?

462
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,470
There's so much sadness and loss.

463
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
That's great. I love it.

464
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,370
This is the episode where Dr. Holden's father is on his deathbed

465
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,570
and Celeste Barrington doesn't even let him know.

466
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,030
Until after his father's died.

467
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,930
And now Dr. Holden will never know

468
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,970
who his real mother is.

469
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,900
You're right. It's addictive.

470
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,830
Wait a minute. So the... the ghost is using this soap somehow?

471
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,830
Yeah. He's trying to tell Brook Dennis something.

472
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,470
I take it that Grant harper and Suzanne Zale's characters,

473
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,730
They break up a lot?

474
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,630
On,constantly. Oh,yeah,yeah.

475
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,830
They're like bitter enemies

476
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,430
that can't get enough of each other,you know?

477
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,430
If she ever knew how many women who've thrown themselves at his feet,

478
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,630
And if he ever knew how she keeps him under her thumb,eh...

479
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,930
- But why?  - I don't know.

480
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She's a control freak,

481
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,580
And he's afraid to go after his dreams,

482
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,250
But they love each other.

483
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,350
It's entertaining.

484
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,250
Wait. Ooh. Oh.

485
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,520
Here's a link to today's episode.

486
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,850
Ahh! I'll make popcorn.

487
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,080
Camera.

488
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,520
Action!

489
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,320
Dr. Holden, if the board finds out what you've been up to...

490
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,980
The only thing the board is gonna find out now is the truth,

491
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,020
that you've been lying to them for the past 8 years.

492
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,620
Cut it! Cut!

493
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,780
- It was perfect.  - What the hell? What's go...

494
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,080
We got looky-loos.

495
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,150
Duff! Please.

496
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,880
Sorry,folks. You're in the shot.

497
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,180
Oops. I'm sorry.

498
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,950
It won't happen again. Ok.

499
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,850
Setting back to one!

500
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,150
That was so embarrassing.

501
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,880
I wonder what they're shooting.

502
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,850
You really wanna know?

503
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,580
Come on, come on.

504
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,020
Go. Go.

505
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,700
Ok,so I found this little script.

506
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,600
It has all the pages that they're shooting today.

507
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,900
I guess they call them sides.

508
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,030
Well, all I know... uh-huh.

509
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,230
Is the rumors are true.

510
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,830
Well, are you gonna tell me or not?

511
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,530
There's a confidentiality clause on the location agreement.

512
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,370
They're trying to keep the story under wraps.

513
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,370
Aw, come on.

514
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,000
But if I were just to maybe...

515
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,470
drop these...

516
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,170
And I were just to pick them up...

517
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,370
Holy cow.

518
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,670
They're really gonna kill Dr. Holden.

519
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,200
- Yeah.  - Why?

520
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,100
Because apparently the real drama is behind the camera.

521
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,830
Look. It seems...

522
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,870
that Grant Holden is having a torrid love affair

523
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,970
with one of his co-stars,

524
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,670
- And that's coming to an end.  - Suzanne Zale.

525
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,970
Well, they didn't say,

526
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,400
But rumor has it that's why he's leaving the show.

527
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,570
Wait till they find out he might be a murderer.

528
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,600
Come on. You really think

529
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,930
Grant had something to do with Miles' death?

530
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,470
Yeah, I think it's possible.

531
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,630
According to the police file, Grant took the prop gun home

532
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,430
the night before Miles was shot.

533
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,100
He said he was using it to rehearse a scene for a movie audition.

534
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,400
You really think he was rigging it

535
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,900
to kill Miles when Brook pulled the trigger?

536
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,800
And...action!

537
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,600
I think the ghost may think that.

538
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,970
Shut it.

539
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,570
Which is why he said, "somebody's going out with a bang."

540
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,830
I won't let you do this.

541
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,030
I won't let you leave me.

542
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,270
Wait a minute. Celeste is about to shoot Dr. Holden...

543
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,530
Celeste, how do you think you can stop me?

544
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
With a prop gun?!

545
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,500
...where you are.

546
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,500
Cut! Cut! What the...

547
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,670
Security!

548
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,100
- Hey, security!  -What's going on? Get off me.

549
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,400
Get off, man! Come on!

550
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,400
Grant, you ok?

551
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,600
She was gonna shoot him.

552
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,830
It's a TV show. It's pretend. You idiot!

553
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,500
Grant, are you all right?

554
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,600
You should have let her shoot him.

555
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,870
You wanna press charges?

556
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,270
No, but keep that lunatic away from me.

557
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,200
Duff, I'll be in my trailer.

558
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,430
I thought the ghost was trying to kill Grant

559
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,230
the same way he was killed.

560
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
It was a good theory.

561
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,430
They should be thanking me.

562
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,870
Instead, I just ruined my chances of getting that walk-on part.

563
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,100
It was a good theory,

564
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,570
except nobody tampered with the gun.

565
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,570
But the ghost was here.

566
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,370
He said I should have let her shoot him.

567
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,430
Can ghosts make blank guns fire real bullets?

568
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,200
Something tells me he doesn't wanna kill anybody.

569
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,170
Why do you say that?

570
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,230
Nobody's dead.

571
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,370
Yet!

572
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,370
Hair and makeup needs a half-an-hour to fix Grant,

573
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,530
plus whatever time he needs to recuperate.

574
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,330
Let's shoot Suzanne's close-up.

575
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,300
This episode is cursed.

576
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,630
Excuse me. I-I'm sorry about my friend.

577
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,100
He can get excitable.

578
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,770
Yeah, well, it's in pretty bad taste

579
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,600
to be bringing up malfunctioning blank guns around us.

580
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,470
Because of Miles Maitland. We know.

581
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,070
What is this about? Really.

582
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,000
Look, I know it's gonna sound strange,

583
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,670
But do you remember the other night at the theater

584
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,270
when all the lights went haywire?

585
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,270
What about it?

586
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,200
That was Miles.

587
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,500
He's angry, and I think he blames

588
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,370
one of you for his death.

589
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,730
Look, I know that it's hard to believe,

590
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,130
but I have a gift.

591
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,830
I've seen Miles, and I've talked to him.

592
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,900
Since he died, has anything strange happened to you?

593
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,700
Anything that's made you feel like maybe Miles was with you?

594
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,900
I've never told anyone that before.

595
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,400
So you're saying that his ghost is really...

596
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,600
Haunting you.

597
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,900
I'm just not sure why or for how long,

598
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,670
But he's still here.

599
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,500
Is he here right now?

600
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,930
Not at the moment.

601
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,430
You two were close?

602
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,130
We met as undergrads.

603
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,930
Miles would read whatever I was working on.

604
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,370
And give me notes, lots of notes.

605
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,370
Like on Dead to Me?

606
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,300
He fought me constantly during those rehearsals.

607
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,700
He was obsessed with truth, even in a bedroom farce.

608
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,870
That's when I felt like killing him.

609
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,300
But the thing is, all his notes just made the work better.

610
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,570
Anyway, whenever I face that blinking cursor,

611
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,570
it's like he's still there challenging me.

612
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,300
I know that must sound crazy.

613
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,570
Oh. Consider who you're talking to.

614
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,830
He thinks we had something to do with his death?

615
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,330
That's crazy.

616
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,170
The irony is that play never would've gone anywhere without him.

617
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,300
As it turns out, it didn't.

618
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,900
Sounds like you regret that.

619
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,270
Regret?

620
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,300
Who knows?

621
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,630
Things worked out pretty well for us.

622
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,630
You and Grant, you mean.

623
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Sure, he got his ego bruised,

624
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,630
But he knew I'd look out for him.

625
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,800
I always look out for my friends.

626
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,070
Trouble is she has a not-so-friendly way of doing it.

627
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,530
So I'm... I'm guessing that you and Grant...

628
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,200
Why have you kept it a secret?

629
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,100
I'll deny it if you ever tell anyone,

630
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,870
but the truth is it's better for his image to be single,

631
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,430
and I like my privacy.

632
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,400
Then why are you writing him off the show?

633
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,700
Look, we get ratings when he leaves,

634
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,670
even more when he comes back,

635
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,500
And every now and then, he needs his freedom,

636
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,200
but he always comes back to the show

637
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,530
and to the character.

638
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,270
And to you.

639
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,670
Sorry. I just...

640
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,970
I get these chills.

641
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,370
It's like a low blood sugar thing.

642
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,830
No. Actually, it was Miles.

643
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,630
He got really upset, and I don't know why.

644
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,870
Well, good luck figuring him out.

645
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,570
I never could.

646
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,370
I'm still confused.

647
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,770
So you're killing Grant's character off your show.

648
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,170
Cally! They're ready for you on the set.

649
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,170
Do you catch much TV or movies or books, for that matter?

650
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,530
People in fiction don't always stay dead.

651
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,870
What the hell?

652
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,330
Like I said, cursed.

653
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,870
But I love the thought of working with you again.

654
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,100
Grant, you would actually consider it?

655
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,300
Of course I would.

656
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,930
And I'm a free man after today.

657
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,300
Duff, where's Grant?

658
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,570
Uh, he's in his trailer.

659
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,100
We'll be ready in 5 for Suzanne's close-up.

660
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,330
I'll be right back.

661
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,900
When I heard the show was coming to Grandview,

662
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,530
This is what I hoped for.

663
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,230
What? The teaching job?

664
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,000
No. Just...

665
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,270
Oh. Sorry.

666
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,400
Brook, what a surprise.

667
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,930
Hi, Cally.

668
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,470
Grant, I just wanted to let you know

669
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,600
that your body Mike is on,

670
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,770
so if you two were discussing anything private...

671
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,670
Not at all. I was just talking to Brook about the possibility

672
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,500
of teaching when I'm done with the show.

673
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,770
Teaching?

674
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,230
At Rockland?

675
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,400
Yeah. The department chair suggested an artist in residence.

676
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,000
Well, congratulations.

677
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,670
Omn I hate to interrupt,

678
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,330
But we need you in hair and makeup, so...

679
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,870
Really good to see you, Brook.

680
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,230
Sorry. I've gotta get back to work.

681
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,600
- Of course.  - Duff!

682
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,500
I'll be in my trailer!

683
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,530
You finish the scene, please!

684
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,500
Action!

685
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,300
I won't let you do that.

686
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,670
I won't let you leave me.

687
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,070
Celeste, how do you think you can stop me?

688
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,330
Easily.

689
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,470
At least this way, I'll always know where you are.

690
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,670
Waiting for you... in hell.

691
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,970
And cut!

692
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,330
Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen,

693
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,270
that's the series wrap for Grant Harper.

694
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,500
Good job.

695
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,730
Nice job.

696
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,230
Thank you, everybody. Enjoyed it.

697
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,770
You guys are the best. Thank you.

698
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,670
What?

699
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,100
I'm gonna miss him.

700
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,300
Goldenrod pages.

701
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,630
Old habits, I know, but I just wrapped. I'm done.

702
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,930
Uh, but you're first up in line for tomorrow's work, scene 34.

703
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,900
Well, somebody made a mistake.

704
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,770
Hey, I don't get it.

705
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,700
"Dr. Holden sputters back to life"?

706
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,230
I'm so sorry. I would have told you,

707
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,750
but I only just got the call while you were shooting.

708
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,750
What happened?

709
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,220
The head of Daytime changed her mind.

710
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,720
But it was settled. She agreed.

711
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,050
I fought for you.

712
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,820
I even pitched out a whole story line

713
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,380
in the aftermath of Dr. Holden's death,but she wouldn't budge.

714
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,480
I swear, Cally, if I don't get out of this role,

715
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,480
I really will die.

716
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,680
We'll get through it.

717
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,720
I'll call her, and I will try again. I promise.

718
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,980
Come on.

719
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,550
Sorry, babe, but if you're asking me to beg for my life...

720
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,680
All I'm asking is

721
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,920
please don't get blood on my new Berber.

722
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,202
L I E S

723
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
I could never understand why you would deliberately lie to me.

724
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,750
You're not going anywhere.

725
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,850
I still have the files.

726
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,220
You think I care about that?

727
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,050
My father was a hero to me.

728
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,320
I never even got to say good-bye.

729
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,880
What does that even mean, "lies"?

730
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,880
And why did he have to make them come out of my mouth?

731
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,080
That's where lies usually come from.

732
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,650
You know what? You're not helping.

733
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,975
And whose lies are we talking about, Cally's,

734
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,020
Grant's, or Brook's?

735
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,020
Or all of them.

736
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,880
And does this even have to do with Miles' death?

737
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,650
Because there hasn't been one dream or vision with a gun or blood.

738
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,820
What was the color of that goo you yakked?

739
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,720
Green. Thanks for bringing that up.

740
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,320
So to speak. Get it?

741
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,380
You said Cally didn't look happy

742
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,050
when she found Grant and Brook together yesterday.

743
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,320
Yeah. Something went on with those three in college.

744
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,350
It's like there's a soap behind the soap.

745
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,250
Yeah. Or I guess you could say acting is lying.

746
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,650
So is writing. It's making stuff up.

747
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,220
Is that what this is about, the show?

748
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,800
'cause why would Miles care about that?

749
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,030
Yeah,and speaking of which,

750
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,200
What are they filming today?

751
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,970
Uh,they're in an alley behind city hall.

752
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,500
It's that scene where Dr. Holden's body's being brought out

753
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,330
And,you know, he comes back to life.

754
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,900
How do you know all this?

755
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,270
Because I'm sexy coroner number 2.

756
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,270
Wait. You won the walk-on part?

757
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,570
Jim...Jim put me up for it.

758
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,930
I'm late for hair and makeup.

759
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,300
And...

760
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,730
Action!

761
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,470
Cut. Cut,cut.

762
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,800
Melinda.

763
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,130
You're not on your mark. Again.

764
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,370
Oh,I was looking for it.

765
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,570
- Back to one! - I...I really...

766
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,700
It's the pink tape right there.

767
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,500
- Oh,the pink tape!  - See?

768
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,790
- Ok? Ok. - Got it. Sorry.

769
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,120
You're doing a fantastic job.

770
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,320
Aw,thank you.

771
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,190
In fact, please feel free to screw up every take.

772
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,390
Well,I didn't exactly screw...

773
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,860
We don't have a choice here,Grant. I'm sorry.

774
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,060
No,actually, I'm the only one without a choice.

775
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,660
You have plenty.

776
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,090
I told you. Now come on.

777
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,260
We gotta get this scene.

778
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,060
I asked my agent to call the network.

779
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,020
Um,everyone,take five!

780
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,460
Grant,let's go talk in my trailer.

781
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,760
You lied to me, Cal.

782
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,260
You're the one who decided to keep me on the show, only you.

783
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,620
Ok,I'm sorry.

784
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,290
I was just trying to protect you.

785
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,320
The only thing I need protecting from is you.

786
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,190
- I want out. - What?

787
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,720
The cushiest job in the business, a great career.

788
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,120
No,us.

789
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,890
Look,I...I know I owe you a lot,

790
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,860
Maybe everything,

791
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,260
And maybe that's why I stayed so long.

792
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,290
But I need to go. I'm done.

793
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,790
You're not done until I say so.

794
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,590
You're still under contract.

795
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,360
All right,Duff! From the top,ok?

796
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,490
This is the one, you guys. Lots of energy.

797
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,690
Stand by! Picture's up! Let's go!

798
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,920
That sounds just like Celeste and Dr. Holden on the show.

799
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,820
Wait a minute.

800
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,920
That's it.

801
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,620
You're doing what you did in grad school.

802
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,690
You're giving them notes.

803
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,090
You want her to change the script.

804
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,560
Dr. Holden must leave Hope's Edge,

805
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,490
And if Cally won't kill him,

806
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,220
I will.

807
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,090
What's going on?

808
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,020
Were you just talking to the ghost?

809
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,290
You know what? I've seen ghosts try to manipulate...ooh.

810
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,460
Sorry...tvs, but never enjoy them.

811
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,260
What does that mean?

812
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,120
Is the ghost a fan of the show?

813
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,190
Picture's up!

814
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,220
Melinda,we need you on your mark!

815
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,090
Oh. Um,more of a critic,actually.

816
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,660
He wants him to change the story line,

817
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,360
But I'm not sure how far he'll go.

818
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,260
Ok. Pink tape.

819
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,490
Ok. Good luck.

820
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,820
And...

821
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,890
Action!

822
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,620
What the hell?

823
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,690
Hey,Jerry! Jerry! The crane!

824
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,590
- Hey,cut! Cut it! - I was on it!

825
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,520
- That's a cut! - We can't stop it!

826
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,890
It's gonna hit her! Watch it!

827
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,760
Ok,Miles, cut,print,wrap,

828
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,590
Or whatever it is you people say.

829
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,160
It's over.

830
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
Sorry about your hand.

831
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,255
Yeah,well,you should be.

832
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,420
She almost broke a bone with that crane stunt.

833
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,020
It's a sprain. I'll live.

834
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,260
I wish I could say the same.

835
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,620
Yeah,well,I might have felt more sorry for you

836
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,720
If you hadn't just tried to kill my friend.

837
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,090
It's okay.

838
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,590
Listen,I wasn't trying to kill anyone.

839
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,760
I just wanted to stop them from filming that idiotic scene.

840
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,860
Why? Because you didn't like the story Cally was tellin'?

841
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,460
You're not doing plays anymore.

842
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,390
This is real life.

843
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,490
Yes, I'm aware of that.

844
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,520
Ok,so then, why do you keep trying

845
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,460
To get them to change the story line?

846
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,990
Is it some sort of revenge?

847
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,990
Revenge for what?

848
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,120
You were shot to death on this stage.

849
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,890
You have to blame someone for that.

850
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,190
No,I do,but it's none of them.

851
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,990
Who are you talking to?

852
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,190
We came right over. What's the emergency?

853
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,360
I'm due in editing.

854
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,290
Miles wants to talk to you.

855
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,790
What's going on? Did you put 'em up to this?

856
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,020
It's real,Grant.

857
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,060
Just hear them out.

858
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,320
So those accidents weren't really accidents?

859
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,060
Except for the one where I tackled you.

860
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,090
That was kind of...

861
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,690
Pure stupidity.

862
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,420
Thanks. Miles,anything to add?

863
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,520
We're all waiting.

864
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,990
Well,first of all, you can tell them

865
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
To stop wallowing in the guilt for killing me,

866
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,720
Because it wasn't their fault.

867
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,420
Miles wants you to know that his death wasn't your fault.

868
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,390
When he saw your reaction to Grant being dropped from the show,

869
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,390
He was afraid that people would start to tank their performances.

870
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,560
I decided to shake things up,

871
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,320
So I put a double charge in the gun,

872
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,860
Thought an extra-large blast would put some life into the second act.

873
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,260
He put a double charge into the gun.

874
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,860
That is so Miles.

875
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,860
What about everything that he did,

876
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,220
All those hauntings?

877
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,760
What does he want from us?

878
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,220
It's not about what I want.

879
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,290
But the vision that you gave me,

880
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,720
The word "lies"...

881
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,890
Who's lying?

882
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Who isn't?

883
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,620
And what does any of this

884
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,290
Have to do with Grant leaving the show?

885
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,220
Is it that you didn't want him to be with Cally?

886
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,490
Why would I care who he chooses to be with?

887
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,090
I'm dead.

888
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,260
Just as long as he follows his dreams.

889
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,260
Right?

890
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,390
That's why you wanted us to watch the show,

891
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,660
Because Grant and his character have the same problem.

892
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,290
Uh,not following our dreams...

893
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,890
What's he talking about?

894
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,090
Miles is saying that

895
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,990
he thinks you should take the job at Rockland U,

896
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,720
And as usual,

897
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,760
He's right.

898
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,390
Cal,is...Is this some sort of trick?

899
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,960
Are you setting me up again?

900
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,790
If this is about lies,

901
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,020
I think I know what Miles has in mind.

902
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,460
Grant, That night, when I told you

903
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,760
The producers wanted Miles for your part,

904
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,490
It wasn't true.

905
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,190
They offered to keep the whole cast.

906
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,790
They wanted me for the lead?

907
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I don't understand.

908
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,320
I had been offered that job in L.A.,

909
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,990
And I was afraid if you went to the city to do the play...

910
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,320
I would get back with Brook.

911
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,990
I was right, wasn't I?

912
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,160
I don't know.

913
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,660
Would you hate me for hoping yes?

914
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,520
Hate you?

915
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,160
I wish I could.

916
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,660
I bet I know what Miles is saying right now.

917
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
He thinks I'm Celeste

918
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,190
And that I never really loved Grant,

919
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,220
But that I wouldn't let anybody else have him.

920
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,460
Is that true?

921
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,990
No. Look at her.

922
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,460
She loved him,

923
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,660
Maybe too much.

924
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,020
She just held on too tight.

925
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,620
He thinks you have a really good heart.

926
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,590
You just need to learn to use it.

927
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,990
Your turn.

928
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,220
Miles says you kept coming back to Cally,

929
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,120
Because you're afraid you won't be able to succeed without her.

930
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,060
You were afraid of her holding you back,

931
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,620
But you did that to yourself.

932
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,490
Ouch.

933
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,420
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

934
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,690
Try not to enjoy it so much, Miles.

935
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,860
It's my turn.

936
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,890
I think I can guess.

937
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,990
Do you,uh, mind if I tell them?

938
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,690
Grant has been writing me and calling me for years,

939
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,560
Every time he and Cally broke up.

940
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,490
I just never wrote him back.

941
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,160
I just told myself I didn't want that life.

942
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,720
That was a lie.

943
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,460
You were afraid,too.

944
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,920
To take a chance on you.

945
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,920
Now you understand?

946
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,360
I couldn't stand seeing them live their lives like this...

947
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,720
Especially when they were so close to being happy.

948
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,960
Just had to knock some truth in their heads.

949
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,990
What's happening?

950
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,820
I think he's ready to go.

951
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,620
But if he leaves,

952
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,820
Who's going to keep me honest?

953
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,590
Tell her to remember me

954
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
And that...

955
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,890
And I'll always be right here.

956
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,060
I'll tell her.

957
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,360
Now,that's a spotlight.

958
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,690
He's gone.

959
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,960
Uhh. Waiting for you... in hell.

960
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,920
And this time, he really dies.

961
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,420
Along with my acting debut.

962
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,090
I'm sorry they cut your scene,babe.

963
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
Enh. It's all right. It's show biz.

964
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,160
Ms. Gordon.

965
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,960
It says here you hurt your hand last Thursday.

966
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,390
Yeah. Yeah,I was hoping that it would get better.

967
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,290
I tried to get her to come in early,

968
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,460
- But she's,um, plain stubborn. - Right.

969
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,820
Well,we'll have to do an x-ray to see if it's broken.

970
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,020
So are you currently taking any medications?

971
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,760
Nope.

972
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,460
Any chance you're pregnant?

973
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,190
We have to know what precaution to take for the x-ray.

974
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,320
No.

975
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,320
No,I'm not pregnant.

976
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,120
Are you sure?

977
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,060
How long's it been since your last period?

978
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,420
Well,um...

979
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,160
Well,I have been preoccupied.

980
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,420
Oh,my god. That's a baby.

981
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,890
That's a heartbeat.

982
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,860
Ok,uh,8 weeks,right?

983
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,560
- Yeah. - Which means...

984
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,820
That means it happened before you...

985
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,090
Went away...

986
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,620
And came back.

987
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,790
Tell me it's real.

988
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,760
Please tell me it's real.

989
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,920
It's real.

9999
