1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,734
Your door's wonky.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,567
Yeah. I need to get the hinges adjusted.

3
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,166
- Double Chai tea? - Thank you.

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:16,899
You've got a little something.

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,734
Oh, yeah. The frost is melting off the roof,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,233
And this is my favorite coat.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,643
Do you sell water repellent?

8
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:24,266
Yeah. I sell vintage water repellent

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,866
And used shoe polish.

10
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:26,915
Ok. Fine.

11
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,123
It doesn't hurt to ask.

12
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:29,841
Excuse me. Cutler and Banks?

13
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,164
You know, the realtors next door?

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,297
As a matter of fact, I do.

15
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,455
Any clue when they'll be in?

16
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:34,463
Delia's out of town for the week.

17
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,686
She's Banks, as in Banks and Cutler.

18
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:38,272
- Ok, thanks.  - Well, wait a minute.

19
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,300
Do you want to leave your info?

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,062
'cause I talk to her, like, every day.

21
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,433
Ok.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,634
Well, I'm looking for a loft for my office.

23
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:46,801
Uh, studio, really.

24
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,134
- I draw.  - Are you an artist?

25
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:49,601
A graphic novelist, actually.

26
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:52,749
So I need a place that gets good light, is quiet.

27
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:54,301
I'm in the Bradford Building now, and, uh...

28
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, a friend of mine works over there.

29
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:57,701
That place is amazing.

30
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,867
- Why are you leaving?  - Mine's...well,

31
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,835
Just not working out for me. It's hard to explain.

32
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,401
Are you famous?

33
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,368
Would we have heard of you?

34
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:09,234
I doubt it. I have kind of a cult readership.

35
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:10,634
My name's Damon Weaver.

36
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:13,967
Sorry. Don't know you.

37
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,835
Have you written anything popular I may have heard of?

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,827
I've got a new book coming out with some hype.

39
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,735
- It's called "Destined."  - Doesn't ring a bell.

40
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:22,201
Well, because, like he just said, it hasn't come out yet.

41
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:23,634
Have you written anything else?

42
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:26,735
I also wrote "Transcender" a few years ago.

43
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:27,867
Nah, haven't read that, either.

44
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,201
Eli!

45
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,234
But I have heard some of my students talk about it.

46
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,201
So you are famous. See? You feel better now?

47
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,768
I feel fine. But hey, if it'll make you feel any better,

48
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:37,827
I've got some fliers.

49
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:39,934
It's for a signing I'm doing this week for the new book

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,267
over at Bay Ridge booksellers.

51
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,701
Frankly, I could use a crowd.

52
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,368
Don't you worry, my famous friend.

53
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,701
We'll get you a crowd.

54
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:49,501
"Destined." I like the title.

55
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,401
Well, I would be happy to put one in the window.

56
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:53,501
Thanks so much. Oh!

57
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:55,601
And here's my number.

58
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,900
Tell your realtor friend to give me a call, Miss...

59
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,900
Uh, Melinda Gordon, and this is Eli James.

60
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,134
See you.

61
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,234
Oh, let me help you with that thing. It's...

62
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:10,501
Impossible.

63
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,368
Eli. Eli, wait. There's a trick to it.

64
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,468
Thank you.

65
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,934
You're welcome.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,301
Hey, the frost is melting.

67
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:28,967
Except not on you. You're sparkling.

68
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,067
That's weird. The drops are turning into ice.

69
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,601
How the heck does that happen?

70
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,534
It must be colder outside than it feels.

71
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:39,101
The radio said it's already in the fifties.

72
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,101
Well, then, they were wrong.

73
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,468
- Oh, my god.  - What the...

74
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:55,900
That almost hit you. Are you ok?

75
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, I'm fine.

76
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,768
I got to go.

77
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,301
Did you do that?

78
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,334
Who are you?

79
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:08,401
What are you trying to do?

80
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,034
He's a liar and a thief.

81
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,401
But he'll get what he deserves.

82
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,959
How come my building is the only one with icicles on it?

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,046
And why was the ghost wearing a ski mask?

84
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:02,739
Look, if you got a theory, don't hold back.

85
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:03,992
Just spit it out.

86
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,828
Jim and I are thinking hypothermia.

87
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,234
But something still bothers me.

88
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,634
So the guy is frozen to death.

89
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,934
He creates icicles and freezes drops of water on Damon's coat.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,033
Who does that?

91
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,490
You've got a theory, right?

92
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,334
Well, actually, no. I've got nothing.

93
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,100
Because I got a theory, but if you're just gonna mock me...

94
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,434
- Eli.  - Ok, fine.

95
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,085
Do you want to know who does that?

96
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,558
Supervillains do that.

97
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,834
Their powers hearken back to what killed them, or almost did.

98
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,103
Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Elektra.

99
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,824
That's Damon's world. He's a graphic novelist.

100
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,316
You're not mocking me.

101
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,328
- What are you looking at?  - It's damon's blog.

102
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,654
He's been posting drawings to tease his new graphic novel.

103
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,338
Check out the latest.

104
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,191
That character's about to get skewered by icicles.

105
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:47,527
Yeah. You notice anything else?

106
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,009
Yeah. He looks a lot like Damon.

107
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,460
I guess he draws from experience... art imitating life.

108
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,501
Or the other way around. Take a look at when that drawing was posted.

109
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,133
Monday, 7 A.M.

110
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:00,245
Today's Tuesday.

111
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:03,466
So this was drawn before Damon ever set foot in my store.

112
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,183
Maybe that explains why he took off so quickly.

113
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:07,534
He recognized that near-miss from his own illustration.

114
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,624
He did seem a little freaked out.

115
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:11,562
I wonder if this kind of thing's happened before.

116
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,634
Does that mean he can foretell the future through his art?

117
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,067
No one can foretell the future,

118
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,667
But the ghost probably saw Damon's drawing

119
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,100
And reenacted it somehow.

120
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,805
So the ghost reads graphic novel blogs,

121
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,296
Acts like a supervillain?

122
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,567
Sounds like someone who's way into comic books.

123
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,634
Yeah. Looks like we need to get into them, too.

124
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,587
Oh, look no further.

125
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,856
Rockland's got an A to Z encyclopedia of comics.

126
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,223
At the university library?

127
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:32,958
Nope. She's in the Anthropology Department.

128
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,645
I am not obsessed with comic books.

129
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:38,968
I am an anthropologist, and graphic novels...

130
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,913
which are not comic books, by the way...

131
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:45,501
Are a window into an entire generation's passions and frustrations

132
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,601
And...

133
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:51,115
I just dig 'em, ok? They speak to me.

134
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,855
They have since I was an angsty teen

135
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:54,794
who did not fit into the world.

136
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:56,955
And a lot of my clothes.

137
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,205
And I happen to know

138
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:01,446
that you are a closet fan of those gushy undead teen novels.

139
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:05,105
I was doing research for a paper on teenage disaffection.

140
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:08,258
I saw you crying into your popcorn at "Twilight," professor.

141
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:08,908
You know what?

142
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:10,734
Let's just deal with the ghost at hand.

143
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:14,071
Well, the first thing I can tell you

144
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,172
is if someone is haunting Damon Weaver,

145
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:18,426
That's the most attention he's had

146
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,675
since he put out his last book 2 years ago.

147
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:20,720
What do you mean?

148
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,760
His career is dead as a doornail.

149
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,035
Am I offending anyone?

150
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,824
No, no ghosts. Just us.

151
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,297
I used to read his stuff,

152
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,327
But then his plotlines got stale.

153
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,901
It was like he ran out of ideas,

154
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:35,657
And I think readers could tell.

155
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:36,917
He fell off the map.

156
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,347
So what about his new book?

157
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,951
Is that gonna put him back on the map?

158
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,567
If it's any good.

159
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,701
Are you sure this is about a ghost?

160
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,739
You mean, aside from the fact that we talked to one?

161
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,202
Yeah, why would you ask that?

162
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,215
Damon needs this book to sell.

163
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:51,854
He needs the publicity.

164
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,705
Oh, so the icicle thing was a stunt to get people's attention?

165
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,293
Other artists have tried it.

166
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:57,791
It got your attention.

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,126
Someone did make sure it was on his blog.

168
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,355
Come on. You're not really buying into this, are you?

169
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,094
We met the ghost. He's real.

170
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,160
He's real mad, too.

171
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,868
Ok, but what is he mad about?

172
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:11,167
I mean, what if this all does actually have to do with Damon's new book?

173
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,707
Wha...

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,020
It's kind of a bad time right now!

175
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,297
Sorry to barge in.

176
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:59,191
I just came to see if you opted to leave this space.

177
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,200
'cause if you were leaving, I was thinking I could maybe take it myself.

178
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,838
- Eli, right?  - Yeah.

179
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:10,950
Yeah. I'm out of here as soon as I find a new studio.

180
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,829
Ok. Well, you probably shouldn't trash the place on the way out.

181
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,328
You might lose the deposit.

182
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,503
The ice maker just decided to go haywire.

183
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:20,914
I don't know what's wrong with it.

184
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,033
Ice maker, huh?

185
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,868
Yeah.

186
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,537
There something else I can do for you?

187
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:34,000
Maybe. See, I couldn't help notice the drawing

188
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,125
that you posted on your blog yesterday.

189
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,356
It looked a lot like what happened to you outside Melinda's shop.

190
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:42,575
The only thing is you drew it before we ran into you.

191
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,737
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,333
The time stamp on your post,

193
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,734
It was way before the icicles almost actually clocked you.

194
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,367
Oh, my site must be buggy again.

195
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,969
Thanks for the heads-up. I'll get my I.T. Guy on it.

196
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,772
That's ice flying at you.

197
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:03,899
Yeah, let me save you the phone call, damon.

198
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,425
I have a gift,

199
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,095
A superpower, if that can help you relate.

200
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,900
I communicate with ghosts,

201
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,033
And so does Melinda, the woman you met who owns the antique store.

202
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,634
And the truth is you got one.

203
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:18,868
A ghost, I mean, not an antique store.

204
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:19,970
You're putting me on, right?

205
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,956
I wish I were.

206
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,673
The ghost Melinda saw was wearing a trench coat,

207
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:24,937
A ski mask and has a thing for ice.

208
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,006
It's possible he may have frozen to death.

209
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:28,512
Sound like anyone you know?

210
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,506
Eli, what'd you say your last name was?

211
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,506
James. Why?

212
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,667
Just wanna make sure I get it right for the restraining order.

213
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,876
What the hell?

214
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,134
What's happening to me?

215
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:03,796
Is that guy in trouble?

216
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:06,130
Oh, not if mommy can help it.

217
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,163
I wanna see what happens next.

218
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:11,063
What happens next is you go and get ready for school.

219
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,063
No fair.

220
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,330
March.

221
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:16,629
What was that about?

222
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,833
Oh, I'm the world's meanest mom

223
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,268
because I didn't want him to see this.

224
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:21,971
It's true.

225
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,628
I can't believe this stuff

226
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,178
has replaced the "Archies" of my youth.

227
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:30,729
Isn't that your graphic novelist about to be run over by a car?

228
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,340
Or attacked by this guy.

229
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,675
The kid with a knife?

230
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:34,977
- He your ghost?  - No.

231
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,653
Ghost outside the store was wearing a ski mask and trench coat,

232
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,566
And I still don't have a clue who he might be.

233
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,295
Um, that's because I didn't wanna wake you when I came in.

234
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,716
I asked around the ER.

235
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:47,050
They only treated one case of hypothermia this season,

236
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,202
And that man is now alive and well

237
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,733
and living retired in sunny Florida.

238
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,591
Maybe Damon should consider retiring, too,

239
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:57,883
At least until I can convince this ghost to stop recreating what he draws.

240
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,363
You mean more than the icicles outside of your store?

241
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,929
Yeah. Eli told me Damon drew himself being pelted by ice

242
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,976
right before the ice maker in his studio exploded.

243
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,590
And I've been checking the blog for new art

244
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,397
to see what else the ghost might have in store.

245
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:10,963
Maybe Damon should just draw himself into harmless scenes,

246
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,570
You know, like, in a home, doors locked,

247
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,363
Away from cars and crowds.

248
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,211
Wait a minute.

249
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:19,341
In the crowd, that's him. That's the ghost.

250
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,434
I thought Damon told Eli he didn't know anyone fitting that description.

251
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,836
And yet Damon drew him exactly the way I saw him,

252
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,895
Which either means he lied, or there's something I'm missing.

253
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,515
Well, you're not the only one in the dark.

254
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:33,143
Check out these fan comments.

255
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:34,605
"new characters out of left field.

256
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,513
"no connection to the upcoming novel.

257
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:38,330
"is there a part of another new collaboration?

258
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:39,715
Answer us, Damon.

259
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:42,330
Who are backpack boy and ski mask man?"

260
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:46,629
And no response from the artist himself.

261
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:49,436
Well, if Damon won't answer his fans,

262
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,267
maybe he'll answer me.

263
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:54,510
I'm just telling you if you don't want this to happen,

264
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,910
you should start talking to me.

265
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,863
Because you and your friend think a ghost can make this come true.

266
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:01,899
You've been reading too many comics.

267
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,327
Look, I think the ghost is taking cues from your drawings.

268
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:06,843
I mean, the icicles outside my store,

269
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:07,936
Your ice maker...

270
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:11,030
He's looking at your artwork and bringing it to life.

271
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:12,705
How is that even possible?

272
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,362
Ghosts can make things malfunction.

273
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,163
They can also mess with temperature.

274
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,562
Look, whatever's happening in your studio,

275
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,747
it's not gonna stop just because you move.

276
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:21,042
You're being haunted,

277
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,155
And if you deny that, it's not gonna help you.

278
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,318
What else can ghosts do?

279
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,330
Well, if your last drawing was any indication,

280
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:31,263
You might wanna stop drawing yourself into the panels.

281
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,610
I wish I could.

282
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:35,677
What are you talking about?

283
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,209
I'd say this is gonna sound crazy,

284
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,676
but you and your friends see ghosts.

285
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,452
The icicle panel,

286
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:43,212
I have no memory of drawing it.

287
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:44,967
What do you mean?

288
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:48,230
I'll be at my desk working

289
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:50,581
when I black out or lose track of time.

290
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:52,009
I'm not sure, but when I come to,

291
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,496
I've got a new drawing

292
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,855
sketched, inked,

293
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,568
and uploaded to my blog.

294
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,879
Ok, so if you didn't post those drawings,

295
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,094
Then the time stamp wasn't an error,

296
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:02,596
Which means that the ghost is telling you

297
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:04,917
what he's gonna do to you before it happens.

298
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,323
Have you ever heard of automatic writing or drawing?

299
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,251
When someone forces you to draw something.

300
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,166
You mean like channeling another artist?

301
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,714
I've heard of it.

302
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:14,701
You're saying it's real?

303
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,515
It's a form of possession,

304
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,554
And I think you know it's real.

305
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,338
So he makes me draw how he's gonna haunt me?

306
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:25,997
- Why?  - To scare you.

307
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,411
To punish you, for what,

308
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,003
Only the ghost knows, unless you have a guess.

309
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,466
I could use some air.

310
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,829
Damon, look, please.

311
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,416
Look, I know that you didn't draw him.

312
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,660
I just need to know if you recognize the ghost, the guy in the ski mask.

313
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,156
No, I don't.

314
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,811
But after Eli described him to me,

315
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,819
when I saw him in the drawing, I got nervous.

316
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:51,632
Ok, what about the kid with the orange backpack?

317
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:53,062
Yeah, and the knife.

318
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:55,007
No, I've never seen that kid before either.

319
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,754
Can you think of anyone who might be angry with you?

320
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:00,263
Like upset fans or other artists, maybe?

321
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,601
The new book is totally different for me...

322
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:03,729
new styles, new characters...

323
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,596
And not everybody is happy with that.

324
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:08,308
So take your pick.  My fans, my rivals,

325
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,475
Everyone's gunning for me.

326
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,186
But if any of them have died recently,

327
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,596
I haven't heard about it.

328
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,606
Bottom line, I have no idea who this ghost is.

329
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:19,263
Just please tell him to leave me alone.

330
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:31,729
Damon, wait!

331
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,775
Stop!

332
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,963
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

333
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,908
Are you ok?

334
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,167
I think so.

335
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:59,330
Hey! Hey, wait!

336
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,663
Did you see that kid with the orange backpack?

337
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:09,429
No, but I'm not sticking around for him to come back.

338
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:24,548
I'm not finding any recent reports of people falling through the ice,

339
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:26,963
but I'm pretty sure that's how the ghost died.

340
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,299
Hence the ice hauntings.

341
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,732
Maybe he hasn't been found.

342
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:31,490
Damon has nothing to say on the matter?

343
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,930
At least he finally admitted to the automatic drawing.

344
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,130
Well, I loosened him up for you.

345
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,143
Hey, Melinda.

346
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,488
I didn't realize you were visiting.

347
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:45,030
You just happened to be passing my office with an armload of comics?

348
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:48,030
Uh, yeah, I was just cleaning out my desk and...

349
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,625
Ok. Well, I saw your car outside,

350
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,888
and come on. I teach anthro of the occult,

351
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,323
and you guys are messing with ghosts.

352
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:56,940
I just wanted to hang.

353
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,261
No problem.

354
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,490
I'm not sure that those are gonna help.

355
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,196
The ghost seems to be drawing his own scenes.

356
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:04,919
So damon's latest blog panel came true?

357
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,152
Most of it.

358
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,368
Melinda saw the ghost and the boy with the backpack.

359
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:09,903
Except he wasn't holding a knife.

360
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:12,170
Well, irrelevant. I mean, you weren't in the drawing either,

361
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,697
but you were there when it happened.

362
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:16,761
That's a good point. Maybe you being there is the only thing that saved Damon.

363
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:19,958
Yeah, I think this ghost wants to torment damon, not just injure him.

364
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,626
Right. Why else would the ghost give him

365
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,097
a sneak preview on his blog every day?

366
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,757
Who would do something like that?

367
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,343
Someone who's angry and confused

368
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,451
and quite honestly has me confused.

369
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:29,387
How so?

370
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:30,963
The ghost showed me his death,

371
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,151
and he was trapped underwater below the ice.

372
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,584
Like he fell through.

373
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:36,263
Yeah, except the strange thing is is that the holes

374
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,037
were not big enough for him to have fallen through.

375
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:40,306
I mean, they were very small, perfectly round holes

376
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,696
that looked like they had been carved.

377
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,612
Yeah, like ice fishing holes.

378
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:47,058
Oh, you guys have never been?

379
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:48,707
Trust me. I wish I hadn't either.

380
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:51,549
My dad thought it would make for great father-daughter bonding.

381
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,178
He would schlep us out every winter

382
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:55,163
to some lake in Stanton that was stocked with fish.

383
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,902
Never caught anything but a cold.

384
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,374
Stanton's nearby.

385
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:00,859
Yeah, it's the only lake around that's sanctioned for the sport,

386
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:02,527
and it's almost the end of the season,

387
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,562
and when the ice melts, it gets really thin.

388
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:06,600
Right, but if it was frozen, the ghost's body could

389
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,581
still be trapped underneath there.

390
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:10,248
His dead body?

391
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,063
What do you guys do with that kind of information?

392
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,997
Mm, good question, Mel.

393
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,501
What do we do with that information?

394
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:18,651
Detective Blair is gone.

395
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,978
Detective Simon was less than happy to make our acquaintance.

396
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,629
If we turn in another tip on a dead body,

397
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:24,297
we'll be visiting a very different set of bars

398
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,764
than I'd prefer on a Friday night.

399
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,317
Well, I'll call 911.

400
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:32,416
I'll say I spotted something at my dad's ice shanty

401
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,060
while I was jigging for bluegills.

402
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,580
Oh, that old excuse.

403
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,952
We can't ask you to do that.

404
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:39,010
You didn't ask,

405
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,273
but I wanna call anyway.

406
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,130
I'd want someone to do the same for me

407
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,112
if I was frozen stiff under that ice.

408
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,264
The police followed Avery's lead,

409
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,914
and they found the body in the lake,

410
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:53,177
but they're still trying to discover his identity.

411
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:54,871
But he's young.

412
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:56,447
Well, if he's been reported missing,

413
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,063
they're gonna find out soon.

414
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:06,763
Talk to me.

415
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,346
Tell me what Damon has to do with all this.

416
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:11,528
Damon took my life.

417
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,624
Check it out. We made the front page.

418
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:29,117
No. Sadly, a dead runaway kid named Shane Dunning did.

419
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:30,284
You already knew the I.D. Of the ghost?

420
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,584
Little thing called the internet.

421
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,552
That and Jim filled me in after he talked to the coroner.

422
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,390
Well, I bet he didn't mention this little tidbit.

423
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,686
The lake where they found Shane's body...

424
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,646
is less than a mile from Damon's house. I know.

425
00:21:38,646 --> 00:21:41,317
He's been living up there and commuting to his studio for about 10 years.

426
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,625
How are you always one step ahead of me?

427
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,359
Question is is it a coincidence?

428
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,546
That you're always one step ahead?

429
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:47,983
No, that we have a ghost saying Damon took his life

430
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,474
and now the ghost turns up practically right next door to Damon's house.

431
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,117
Damon said he never even saw the ghost,

432
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:53,324
but he might just be a big, fat liar.

433
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:55,350
I'm not sure. The ghost forced Damon to draw those pictures.

434
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,476
He's trying to tell us something.

435
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:57,870
That Damon killed him?

436
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,125
By somehow luring him out onto thin ice, and why?

437
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,170
I mean, there's no apparent connection between Shane and Damon.

438
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,226
And what does the angry kid with the orange backpack

439
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:05,654
have to do with any of it?

440
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,152
Wait. Are you asking me?

441
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,150
Nope. I'm gonna ask Shane's family.

442
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,117
I don't even know why I try.

443
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:31,847
Mr. And Mrs. Dunning.

444
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,671
Hi. My name is Melinda Gordon,

445
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,944
and I am so sorry for your loss.

446
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,651
Are you the hospital grief counselor?

447
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:41,152
Not exactly,

448
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,254
but I think I can help.

449
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,530
So you've actually seen, talked to my son since he...

450
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,139
I know it's a lot to process.

451
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,300
Is Shane here now?

452
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,931
No, but I'm sure he's not very far.

453
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:02,738
I just need to figure out what he's angry about

454
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:05,024
or why he feels like he was wronged somehow.

455
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:06,805
It's because of me.

456
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,879
You can't keep beating yourself up, baby.

457
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:12,417
We all tried our best with Shane.

458
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,247
He had trouble at school and trouble at home.

459
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,212
Shane's mother wasn't any help.

460
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:22,083
She took off after the divorce.

461
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,731
Shane never saw her again.

462
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,445
That must have been hard on him.

463
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:29,094
This is a second marriage for both of us.

464
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,863
We tried to blend our families,

465
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,983
but it wasn't easy.

466
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,005
Shane seemed to take it the worst.

467
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:38,584
We tried counseling.

468
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,296
We worked with teachers and friends.

469
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,267
Nothing helped.

470
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:47,017
Did anything happen right before he ran away?

471
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,417
A lot.

472
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:53,917
There was a last straw, for me, anyway.

473
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:56,556
It seems so small now.

474
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,729
Shane found a preapproved credit card in the mail,

475
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:03,323
and he opened an account in Jeff's name.

476
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:05,932
When the bank called us and told us...

477
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:07,337
I lost it.

478
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,342
I was desperate to get through to him.

479
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:12,534
I told Shane

480
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,355
he had to either shape up or get out.

481
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:22,241
I just thought if he was faced with an ultimatum, then...

482
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:30,683
He decided to leave,

483
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,284
and we never saw him again.

484
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,584
U-until...

485
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,913
I'm so sorry.

486
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:44,017
I just wanted him to get on the right track in life.

487
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,017
I didn't want to lose him.

488
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:55,402
Would you tell Shane

489
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,783
that we'd give anything to have him back again?

490
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,910
Of course.

491
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:03,392
When he's ready.

492
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:07,188
Right now, I just have to figure out what's keeping him here.

493
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:10,283
Look, I know that this is gonna sound strange,

494
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:13,205
But I think it might have something to do with comic books.

495
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:14,917
What?

496
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,080
No, Shane hated comic books.

497
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,420
He teased his stepbrother about it all the time.

498
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,117
Stepbrother?

499
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:23,857
My son colin from my first marriage.

500
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,351
He's the one who loves graphic novels.

501
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:28,033
Were they close?

502
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:32,652
When we got married, Mariah and I hoped

503
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:35,608
that it would bring them together,

504
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:37,756
But it had the opposite effect.

505
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,856
They fought a lot,

506
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:42,793
So Colin mostly avoided Shane

507
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:46,783
by hiding in his room all the time with his comics.

508
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,910
There he is now.

509
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,983
It's ok.

510
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,317
I'm sorry to hear about your stepbrother.

511
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:08,386
Your mom said that you and Shane weren't close,

512
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:10,102
But I'm sure it's still hard for you.

513
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,755
So you've really seen Shane, or his ghost or whatever?

514
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,758
Yes, I have.

515
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,417
He's angry.

516
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:20,573
He said that damon weaver is a thief.

517
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:23,245
I don't know what that meant, but you might.

518
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,014
Not really.

519
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:28,307
Ok, well, your mom said that you're the one who's into comics,

520
00:26:28,307 --> 00:26:31,930
And I saw you at Damon's studio, so you're a fan, right?

521
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,090
Was.

522
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,308
How come?

523
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:39,584
Damon's new novel, it's mine,

524
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:40,821
I think.

525
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,619
What do you mean?

526
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:46,817
I finished a graphic novel of my own.

527
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:48,015
Did Shane know about it?

528
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:49,532
Yeah. I never showed it to him,

529
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,333
but he knew I was finishing one up.

530
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,117
He thought it was lame.

531
00:26:53,184 --> 00:26:55,315
And then right before he left, he stole my laptop

532
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,400
and all my original drawings.

533
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:00,733
His way of taunting you one last time.

534
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:02,944
That's what I thought,

535
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:05,742
But then Damon Weaver releases a spoiler about his new book,

536
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,218
And everything about it is just like mine...

537
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:11,764
I mean, characters, the story, everything.

538
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,562
So what are you saying, that Damon stole your story?

539
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,738
Or Shane stole it and he sold it to Damon,

540
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:18,622
Pretending it was his work.

541
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:22,280
Is that when you started showing up in Damon's drawings?

542
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,962
That's a new thing,

543
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:25,826
Totally unrelated to my work.

544
00:27:26,238 --> 00:27:27,669
I mean, why would Damon Weaver draw me

545
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:30,417
and my stepbrother into his blog comics?

546
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,365
Actually, I think Shane's been doing it.

547
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:36,152
What do you mean?

548
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:39,750
I think that he's possessing Damon and making him do the drawings.

549
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,217
Why would he do that?

550
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,133
I mean, it seems pointless.

551
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,499
Does it?

552
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,110
I mean, there has to be some reason

553
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,932
why you were standing in the picture, holding a knife.

554
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,011
I didn't have a knife.

555
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,554
Why did you go to the square in the first place?

556
00:27:53,997 --> 00:27:55,571
I wanted to talk to Damon,

557
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:57,350
See if I could get some answers.

558
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,484
Maybe he would tell me where Shane was.

559
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,484
Not that he would tell me that Shane was at the bottom of a lake.

560
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,317
So you think that Damon killed Shane

561
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:07,257
to hide the fact that it's not his novel?

562
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:11,250
You're the one that said that Shane was angry.

563
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:13,727
Maybe that's why.

564
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:19,303
- Now, why doesn't this kid, uh...  - Colin.

565
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:21,463
Why doesn't Colin bust Damon for plagiarism?

566
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:24,568
Um, because he can't prove it. Shane took all of his artwork.

567
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:27,770
And sold it to Damon, who is claiming it as his own. That is low.

568
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,513
I mean, but would Damon Weaver really kill this kid to protect his secret?

569
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,001
I don't know. Maybe it was an accident,

570
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,171
Or maybe he realized that he was in a position

571
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,217
where he could lose everything.

572
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:36,217
Everything, huh?

573
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:37,584
Yeah. His reputation, his career.

574
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:40,760
Hey, why doesn't the ghost force Damon to draw a confession?

575
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,080
Maybe that's what he has in mind.

576
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,814
I mean, it's all pretty public.

577
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:45,479
You know, maybe he's trying to torment Damon

578
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,738
so that he'll confess what he did.

579
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:48,574
And will that be plagiarism or murder?

580
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:49,889
Maybe both.

581
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,284
Ok, Shane.

582
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,815
Maybe you're right.

583
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:47,663
Almost makes the interest rate increase worth it.

584
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:49,769
Do you people break and enter often?

585
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:51,809
Uh, it's not considered breaking and entering

586
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:54,874
unless we people get caught, so you wanna close the door?

587
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,315
Well, you're the graphic novelist.

588
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:04,045
Go sniff out the kid's artwork.

589
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:05,148
What if Damon comes back?

590
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:07,552
Melinda's got the perfect vantage point from her shop.

591
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:10,308
She'll give us a heads-up if she sees him.

592
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,542
How 'bout the ghost?

593
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,608
Oh, him.

594
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:16,107
I really won't know he's here until I hear him.

595
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,208
So he could possess one of us like he did to Damon?

596
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:20,041
Yep.

597
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:33,475
Oh, no. I think I upset him.

598
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:37,320
Shane, we're here because we wanna help.

599
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:41,702
I don't think he cares.

600
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:45,380
We know you took your stepbrother's artwork.

601
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,197
Did you really sell it to Damon?

602
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,041
It's time to set things right, Shane.

603
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,608
Just talk to me.

604
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:55,108
Ok.

605
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:56,974
We can show ourselves out.

606
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:00,248
What is that?

607
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:06,155
I think he's gone.

608
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,188
Do you know how much these are worth?

609
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:17,709
These are signed by Frank Miller.

610
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,342
They're originals.

611
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,156
Yeah, well, guess what other originals Damon has,

612
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:24,941
Colin's.

613
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:27,930
These are really good. The kid's got talent.

614
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:33,274
Melinda. Is Damon on the move?

615
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:34,584
Are we about to be made?

616
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,195
No, he's at the book signing.

617
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,434
Did you find anything?

618
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:42,575
Well, we found Colin's artwork.

619
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:45,894
And a copy of Damon's new book.

620
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:49,583
Now we'll see if Damon really did rip it off.

621
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,691
There are differences in Damon's background art and details,

622
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:58,770
But the story, the content, it's the same as Colin's.

623
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,608
Yeah. Colin said that the material was personal. He's right.

624
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,832
So this character, the one who's losing his powers,

625
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:04,858
That's supposed to be Shane?

626
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,058
Well, I mean, it seems to fit.

627
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:08,511
The character in the story is abandoned by his mom

628
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,095
because his powers make her sick.

629
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:12,860
Right. The absentee mom who dropped out of Shane's life.

630
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,730
Custody issues can do a number on kids.

631
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,508
That's probably what made Shane act out

632
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:18,197
and cause trouble for his dad and stepmom.

633
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:20,785
So I guess when the ghost said that Damon took his life,

634
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:23,488
He meant this story, his story.

635
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:25,376
Well, check this out.

636
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:27,969
That obviously is colin,

637
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:30,603
And he's got Shane hooked up to these weird tubes and wires,

638
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:32,411
like maybe he's torturing him.

639
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,866
No wonder the ghost was so angry.

640
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,874
His stepbrother was getting his kicks off Shane's personal pain.

641
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,908
Then why isn't Shane haunting Colin?

642
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:42,837
I think that the ghost is using the drawings

643
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:45,908
to get Colin to go after Damon, like they did with the knife.

644
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:48,308
You know, trying to get the stepbrother to do something stupid.

645
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,371
But that knife attack didn't happen.

646
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:51,975
Not yet.

647
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:53,269
What's wrong?

648
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,857
A lot if we don't get to that book signing.

649
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:59,112
Well, I guess I'll hold down the fort.

650
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:07,587
Oh, no.

651
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,084
Would you make this one out to "my biggest fan"?

652
00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:17,956
Zach. That's short for Zachary.

653
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:21,881
How many would you like?

654
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:25,054
- Just one.  - That'll be 4.95.

655
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,375
You should be signing those books, Colin,

656
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,841
not him.

657
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:33,275
Here's your change.

658
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:35,475
Thank you.

659
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:36,930
I love the explosion.

660
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,775
The genesis of the hero's powers is so, uh...

661
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,208
What was your inspiration?

662
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:42,695
The words you create are so intense.

663
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:45,075
I never know if your characters are going to live or die.

664
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:46,685
Uh, who...who should I make it out to?

665
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:47,941
"my coolest fan, Monique."

666
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:49,642
"to my coolest fan, Monique."

667
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,901
Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

668
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:57,874
Look, I need to take a break.

669
00:34:57,941 --> 00:34:59,245
We've got a line of people waiting.

670
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:00,781
Yes. I gotta get out of here.

671
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:02,075
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

672
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:05,675
Colin! No!

673
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,899
How could you do this?

674
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:22,655
I can't believe I looked up to you for years.

675
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,166
Get this kid out of here.

676
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:27,491
Hey, drop the knife, drop it!

677
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,667
Let's go.

678
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:37,934
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

679
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:40,022
Hold on. Let him go.

680
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:41,474
Are you nuts? He came at you with a knife.

681
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:45,068
Just please let him go. He had every right.

682
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,467
Uh, I'm sorry, everybody.

683
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,133
I'm so sorry. Uh...

684
00:35:57,832 --> 00:35:59,366
There's something I gotta say.

685
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,632
I can't believe Damon admitted that he ripped off my work.

686
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,933
You didn't really give him any choice.

687
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,699
Shane's here, isn't he?

688
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:15,033
Yes.

689
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:20,233
I didn't...I didn't feel him near me,

690
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,766
not until a few days ago.

691
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:23,599
Before that, the house just felt

692
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,278
as cold and as empty as when he left.

693
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:30,499
It felt cold and empty to me way before that.

694
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,400
He felt that way, too, when he was alive.

695
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:37,866
And Colin, he was always in his room,

696
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:41,133
his head down, drawing away.

697
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,300
Shane felt really alone,

698
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:48,300
and he envied you for being able to tune it all out.

699
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,133
It pissed me off,

700
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,565
but thanks for putting it nicely.

701
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,066
And that's when you took Colin's drawings.

702
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,599
Was it to hurt me?

703
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:02,033
Because all you ever did was make fun of them, of me.

704
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,400
I didn't really know what you were doing,

705
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,233
not the whole story.

706
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,532
When my dad kicked me out, I was looking for cash.

707
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,133
I was going through everybody's drawers,

708
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,400
and when I saw what Colin was working on...

709
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,899
He wasn't as oblivious as I thought.

710
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:20,899
What do you mean?

711
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:22,933
The story, it was about this kid

712
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:24,532
whose house gets blown up,

713
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,699
and when he wakes up, he gets these powers.

714
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:30,599
He can disappear. He can destroy stuff.

715
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:37,565
Except his mom,

716
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:42,199
turns out she's allergic to his new chemistry or whatever...

717
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,066
So she has to go away from him.

718
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,699
You said Damon took your life.

719
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,799
You meant what Colin wrote about you.

720
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:58,699
That was your life story.

721
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,266
After the divorce...

722
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,999
My mom didn't want me.

723
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:08,699
My dad said it was this big custody battle,

724
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:11,799
But I heard him talking to Colin's mom one night,

725
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:16,266
Saying how she had said that leaving was her chance to be free.

726
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,465
Free of me.

727
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,066
Shane read your story,

728
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,899
the part about the mom.

729
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,438
Was he mad?

730
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,999
I mean, those drawings are just for me.

731
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,866
Tell him it's ok. It's ok.

732
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:40,006
When I saw them, I finally felt less alone,

733
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:42,333
Like he got it.

734
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,366
But by then, I had done so many crappy things,

735
00:38:45,432 --> 00:38:47,432
I basically got myself kicked out.

736
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:53,699
I thought at least I could do one good thing...

737
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,565
for colin.

738
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,866
And that's when you brought Damon his drawings.

739
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,166
I just wanted him to see them.

740
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,899
He was Colin's hero.

741
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:08,666
And Colin's so talented.

742
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:11,999
I figured why wouldn't he want to help him?

743
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:15,966
And Damon wouldn't even look at 'em.

744
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,565
But I left the drawings.

745
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:21,799
When I left, I took a shortcut across the lake.

746
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,099
It was a stupid mistake,

747
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,333
like so many I had made.

748
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,366
Shane died taking a shortcut from your house.

749
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:53,400
I didn't know.

750
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:54,666
I swear.

751
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:57,166
He said that he tried to show you Colin's drawings,

752
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:58,166
but you weren't interested.

753
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:00,199
I wasn't. I never even glanced at it

754
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:03,922
Until my publisher came to my house and saw it next to my desk.

755
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:05,832
She thought the stuff was fantastic.

756
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,966
I was so stuck.

757
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,866
I was so over.

758
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:13,465
I just needed to dig out,

759
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:15,933
so I redrew it all as my own.

760
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,266
But if Shane could make you draw,

761
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,133
then he could have made you confess.

762
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:23,699
I mean, he could have stopped you.

763
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,266
So why didn't he?

764
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,499
Why'd he make me do it?

765
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,799
I thought the least Damon could do

766
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:32,420
after what he did was get your work published.

767
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,732
Everyone's gonna know your name.

768
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,732
They're gonna care who you are,

769
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,699
and you'll never feel alone.

770
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,499
He really wanted your novel to be published.

771
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:48,999
Maybe if people could see how special you were,

772
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:52,766
then you would never feel alone the way that he did.

773
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:55,066
I'm gonna make sure of that.

774
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,866
Look, if it's ok with you, I'd like to help.

775
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,799
Publishing gets pretty brutal sometimes,

776
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:03,366
and you're already having a pretty strange launch.

777
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,133
It's the least I could do,

778
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,532
if you'll let me.

779
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,066
Tell Colin I think he should trust this guy.

780
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:16,432
We all deserve the chance to clean up our mistakes.

781
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:22,066
And besides...

782
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,465
I may not be around to look out for him.

783
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:27,300
You see the light, don't you?

784
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:29,666
It's so beautiful.

785
00:41:30,933 --> 00:41:33,266
You can't even believe it's real.

786
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:35,499
He's ready.

787
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:38,066
The light?

788
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,666
What's it look like?

789
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:44,623
Even you, you couldn't draw it.

790
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:57,999
He said even you couldn't draw it.

791
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:08,799
Come on, slowpoke, or you're gonna be late for class.

792
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:10,799
Hey, I thought you finished your school project last night.

793
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:11,966
This isn't for school.

794
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,166
It's just for fun.

795
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:14,766
Ok, well, that's Shane,

796
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,300
and that's his sidekick Colin. Not bad.

797
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:20,866
No, mommy. This is me, and that's my brother.

798
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,666
Uh, what brother is that, sport?

799
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:25,532
Well, he's just made up.

800
00:42:26,499 --> 00:42:28,933
Like my teacher says, a fig of my imagination.

801
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:31,101
Exactly.

802
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,427
It would be cool to have a brother.

803
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,620
He might be different, like me.

804
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:37,826
Well, do you feel that different?

805
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,854
I'm different from everyone, even you, mom.

806
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:43,060
Yeah, but, you know,

807
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,467
there's more things that make us the same than different.

808
00:42:46,003 --> 00:42:46,975
Like what?

809
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:49,997
Like what we feel.

810
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:51,911
What do you feel?

811
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:55,005
Right now, nothing but love.

812
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,266
Come here.

813
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,799
Oh, my baby.

814
00:42:58,866 --> 00:43:00,899
I'll second that one.

815
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:03,266
Guys, you're squishing me.

816
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,500
All right. Let's go to school.

817
00:43:08,732 --> 00:43:10,899
- Get your backpack, sport.  - Ok.
