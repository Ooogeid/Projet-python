1
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,500
She's coming, hurry!

2
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:08,001
That's right, come up to the attic.

3
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,600
Drew, come.

4
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,201
Come to us.

5
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:10,400
Now you're quiet?

6
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,101
You woke me up.

7
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,601
Is that what he wanted?

8
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,701
To talk to me?

9
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,234
You have to help our family.

10
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,601
What is it? What's wrong?

11
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,133
We don't have our daughter. You must help us.

12
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,467
Get our daughter.

13
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:35,133
- Please find her.  - I'll try.

14
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,567
You must do what you can.

15
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,934
I promise.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,433
I'll do it. But you need to sleep now.

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,701
You need your rest.

18
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,634
There.

19
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:54,400
Good night.

20
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:39,767
I guess the no-caffeine diet's kind of killing you, right?

21
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,667
No!

22
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,501
It's not a problem.

23
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,434
You didn't eat very much.

24
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,668
Wait a minute.

25
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you having, like, morning sickness?

26
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,200
No, no. Not yet. I feel great.

27
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,367
You know, it's a beautiful day.

28
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,467
I'm here with you.

29
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,233
Oh, hey, about junior...

30
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,167
Can I call him junior?

31
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,933
You can call her anything you like.

32
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,901
It's a girl? What, you feel like you're carrying a girl?

33
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,401
I have no idea.

34
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,567
Ok.

35
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,768
Sam? Sam Lucas?

36
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:09,167
Yeah, over here.

37
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,667
That's me.

38
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,467
Sorry. This is my first day

39
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,601
and I gave you the wrong check.

40
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,634
-No problem.  - I'm so lame.

41
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,833
No problem.

42
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,067
Really, it's no problem.

43
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,467
So, ahh.

44
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,900
Who do we tell about the baby?

45
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,434
Delia.

46
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,500
Come on, come to the store with me.

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,534
We'll tell her together.

48
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,867
No, no, no. Look, thanks,

49
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,967
But that really seems like something

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,134
You two should share alone, you know,

51
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,200
In a high-pitched, girls only kind of way.

52
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:42,668
Bye.

53
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,900
- I can't believe it!  - I couldn't either!

54
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,534
Oh! God, I can't stop screaming!

55
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,267
Well, you can. You really can.

56
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,000
- Ok, how far along are you?  - 8 weeks.

57
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,967
8 weeks?! Are you ok?

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,601
Do you feel sick?

59
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,200
Do you know the sex?

60
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,267
No, I'm fine, and I don't know.

61
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, honey, I am so happy for you.

62
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,200
Are you gonna get married?

63
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,301
When are you getting married?!

64
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,200
Haven't even thought about it.

65
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,951
Oh, right, right.

66
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,668
'cause it doesn't matter, does it?

67
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,117
Well, you know, I mean,

68
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:14,534
in my mind and in Jim's, too,

69
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,100
- We are married. Oh, no!  - What?

70
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,900
The chain, with the rings on it that I wear,

71
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,034
it's gone!

72
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,501
Oh, don't worry, we'll find it.

73
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,701
It probably just fell off when I hugged you...

74
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,567
Did I even hug you?

75
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,234
No, you were screaming.

76
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,000
- Excuse me.  - Come on in.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,334
Join the celebration.

78
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,134
I'm looking for a doll, for my cousin.

79
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,200
This is Drew.

80
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,668
I'm Melinda, this is Delia.

81
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:40,800
Hi. Welcome.

82
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,200
I'm Emma. Anyways, Drew has some dolls.

83
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,534
They're not exactly antiques, but they seem vintage.

84
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,301
We've been to the toy store,

85
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,234
But kind of an odd size.

86
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,634
They need to fit in this chair.

87
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,367
Wow, that is a very cool chair.

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,867
She didn't want to bring them.

89
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,200
They don't like to leave their home.

90
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,667
I guess it doesn't matter if they match exactly,

91
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,167
As long as they fit.

92
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,400
And it's a girl.

93
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,033
They only want a girl.

94
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,834
The dolls have been talking to her.

95
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,834
You know what, we have a lot of dolls over here,

96
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,334
So let's go see if we can find one.

97
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,167
Drew, right over here.

98
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,234
Yeah, you know, and if we don't have anything,

99
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,534
Do you know the make,

100
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:17,801
or when the dollhouse was built?

101
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,100
Oh, I don't.

102
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,667
My cousin just found it up in the attic.

103
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,834
Oh. Just sometimes we can go through the manufacturer,

104
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,100
It was custom made.

105
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,333
It's a model of the house I use to live in with my family.

106
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,467
They died.

107
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,633
- I'm so sorry.  - Me, too.

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,267
Anyway, now I live with my aunt, Drew's mom,

109
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,801
And...and I'm fine.

110
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,901
It's ok. It was an accident.

111
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,534
Carbon monoxide poisoning .

112
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,901
I always tell people that.

113
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,433
I don't know why.

114
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,700
They never ask.

115
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,267
Maybe it's because you want them to know

116
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,801
your family didn't suffer.

117
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:58,534
Yeah.

118
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,534
Well, let's see if we can find anything.

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
- It's Emma, right?  - Yeah.

120
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,100
You know what, we have more dolls in the back.

121
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,167
Why don't you come with me,

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,467
And we'll see if we can find something.

123
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,633
Ok.

124
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,634
Any luck?

125
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,166
No.

126
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,834
Nothing yet.

127
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:38,367
Your cousin says that your dolls are talking to you.

128
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,033
She doesn't believe me.

129
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,734
I do.

130
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:45,700
I believe in a lot of things that other grown-ups don't.

131
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:48,100
Are you sure it's your doll talking?

132
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,433
Have you seen anyone else? You know, maybe somebody...

133
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,100
that others can't see?

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,233
No.

135
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,901
Ok.

136
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,967
So your dolls, what do they say to you?

137
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,867
They're sad.

138
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,033
Why?

139
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,634
They miss their daughter.

140
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,634
She wants a girl.

141
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,133
They want her with them.

142
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,567
I went online. It's true,

143
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:54,967
Emma lost her family 3 years ago to carbon monoxide poisoning.

144
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,934
They all died in their sleep.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Leading cause of poison death in the U.S.

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,833
Hey, I'm gonna get you a carbon monoxide detector

147
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,067
for your shower present.

148
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:03,900
Shower? You mean a baby shower?

149
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,566
I already called Delia about it.

150
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,234
You're planning my baby shower?

151
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,466
Mango and berry, please.

152
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,134
What, you don't think a man can do that?

153
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:13,067
I can buy streamers and mix martinis as well as she can.

154
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:16,466
Ok, but in the meantime, which there's plenty of,

155
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,234
What did you find out from Detective Blair?

156
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,934
You mean about the vision you have

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,267
About someone slicing their wrist?

158
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:23,000
Look, I know that their deaths could have been an accident,

159
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,500
But what if they weren't?

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,833
Oh, you're thinking murder-suicide.

161
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,333
Somebody got so depressed that they took down their whole family?

162
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,301
- I don't think so.  - What makes you so sure?

163
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,533
Well, according to the medical examiner's reports,

164
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,867
There were no marks on any of the bodies.

165
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,167
Ok, so what about scars? There could have been an earlier attempt.

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,067
Yeah, I asked about that specifically.

167
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,334
They said that they were looking for the same thing...

168
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,500
Suicidal tendencies, abuse.

169
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,200
Could Emma be suicidal?

170
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah, surviving the death of your whole family

171
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,833
Would be hard to live with.

172
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:51,867
Yeah, but they died 3 years ago,

173
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,533
So why are they haunting her now?

174
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,200
They're not. They're haunting the little girl, her cousin.

175
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:58,800
Yeah, but that's only because she's young enough to still hear them.

176
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,267
It doesn't tell us what they want.

177
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,034
I thought they want their daughter with them,

178
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,167
which is a nice sentiment, but they're dead.

179
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,533
And if Emma keeps taking a slice at her wrists,

180
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,833
They won't be waiting long.

181
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,234
Yeah, I should get over there.

182
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,334
I can't believe you found one.

183
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,600
Thank you.

184
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,700
You're welcome.

185
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,800
I hope your other dolls like her.

186
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,367
There you go.

187
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:30,301
This is your new home.

188
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,134
And you guys,

189
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,100
This is...Ava.

190
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,267
No.

191
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,433
Chelsea. Wait.

192
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,767
Daisy.

193
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,167
She can be your daughter.

194
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:45,334
So? What'd they say.

195
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,167
Nothing.

196
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,134
They don't talk when other people are around.

197
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,833
But watch.

198
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,500
When we come back,

199
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:54,733
they'll be right where they always are.

200
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,900
Where's that?

201
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,167
The mom and the kids all go to their beds.

202
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,367
And no matter what,

203
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,100
the father ends up on the dining room floor.

204
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:04,200
- Lying down?  - Like he's sleeping.

205
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:06,900
But he doesn't look very comfortable.

206
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,733
So you're saying that they move themselves?

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,934
Yeah.

208
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,934
And when did they first start talking to you?

209
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,234
I don't know.

210
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,934
Pretty soon after I found them.

211
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,700
The dollhouse was all covered up.

212
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,267
But I heard them.

213
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,334
How long ago was that?

214
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,633
2 days ago.

215
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,934
I was up here looking for a birthday present. For Emma.

216
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,934
She's going to be 18.

217
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,301
Drew, what are you doing up here?

218
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,433
I wasn't playing with it.

219
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,833
Melinda brought me a new doll.

220
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,867
I was just putting it in there.

221
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,767
I'm Lucy Stanton, Drew's mother.

222
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,500
Hi. Melinda Gordon. I have a store in town,

223
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,333
And your daughter and niece came by.

224
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,233
Yes. The sitter told me.

225
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,034
Drew, out of this attic.

226
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,433
Now.

227
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:56,233
If you don't mind.

228
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:00,801
Who is this? What is that?

229
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:01,801
That's not our daughter.

230
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,033
Get rid of it.

231
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,834
I spoke to Emma.

232
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,500
She told me how she came to live with you.

233
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,233
Is that why you kept the dollhouse hidden away?

234
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,266
Emma told you that?

235
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,834
No, she just said that it was a replica of her family home.

236
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,134
It was.

237
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,834
It's gone now.

238
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,467
When my brother...

239
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,167
When the family died,

240
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,500
I was the only living relative.

241
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,734
And Emma...

242
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,433
I barely knew her.

243
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,800
My brother and I weren't close.

244
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,134
We'd had a falling out years ago.

245
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,300
- I'm sorry.  - I am, too.

246
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:38,367
Anyway, Drew and I packed up and we moved into the house,

247
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,033
to try and keep things the same for Emma,

248
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
But there were back taxes and the estate couldn't cover it.

249
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,300
A developed made an offer, and I took it.

250
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,900
They subdivided the property

251
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,933
And they tore down the house.

252
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,634
And that's why you kept the dollhouse?

253
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,434
I've had it tucked away upstairs.

254
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,667
I didn't think anyone would find it.

255
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:01,200
Obviously it has some painful memories for Emma, but...

256
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:02,700
I can't part with it.

257
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:05,433
And there's a chance she may want it someday.

258
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:08,301
If not for herself, then for her children.

259
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,466
This may sound odd,

260
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,034
Coming from a complete stranger,

261
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,301
But has anything happened recently?

262
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:20,134
Anything that might make you worry about Emma?

263
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,900
I worry about Emma all the time.

264
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,566
I'm sure if her parents were alive, they'd worry about her, too.

265
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:41,634
You're wrong, all of you.

266
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,967
She's nice.

267
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,967
She would not do that.

268
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:49,133
She wasn't there.

269
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,467
Drew.

270
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,934
You know your mom doesn't want you playing with that.

271
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,534
And neither do I.

272
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,367
Go on downstairs.

273
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,400
Quick, come here!

274
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:22,600
What? Emma's here!

275
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,101
Hurry, hurry!

276
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,034
Where are you?

277
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,067
I'm upstairs

278
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,400
Don't let her go!

279
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,133
What's happening?

280
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
She's here. Don't let her go.

281
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,700
Lock her in! Lock her in!

282
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:33,901
No!

283
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:35,966
No!

284
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,800
Drew! Come on!

285
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,233
Get me out of here!

286
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,333
Hurry, Drew!

287
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,767
Drew said you were asking questions about the house.

288
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,833
That it seemed like if you didn't know things,

289
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,733
That you understood.

290
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,700
I'm trying to.

291
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,267
Could you explain it to me?

292
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:59,767
Because I swear it's like they locked me up in that attic.

293
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,000
That's why I had it brought over here.

294
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:06,800
When you saw drew with the dolls, what was she saying?

295
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:09,300
It was like she was defending someone,

296
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,267
Saying she wasn't there.

297
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,666
I think she was talking to your family.

298
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,433
My family's dead.

299
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,800
I think their spirits are attached to that house.

300
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,867
Their spirits?

301
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,800
Their ghosts.

302
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,733
And I think that they're using the dolls

303
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,067
To tell us something.

304
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,667
Why didn't she get rid of that thing?

305
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
She doesn't want it. She can't stand Drew playing with it.

306
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,333
Are you talking about your aunt?

307
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,267
Because she said that she was saving it for you.

308
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,301
For me? Why would I want it?

309
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,900
Because it belonged to your family.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,633
No, it didn't.

311
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,100
It belonged to that house.

312
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,466
What do you mean?

313
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,700
I don't know, I thought some family before us

314
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:46,834
Had it made.

315
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,767
Because I never saw it until Drew found it.

316
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,733
Look, I see things.

317
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:54,867
Things that have happened,

318
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,000
And I had a vision about your family.

319
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,034
What did you see?

320
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,867
Someone.

321
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,301
Cutting their wrist.

322
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:06,567
Wait a minute.

323
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,567
You think that was me?

324
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,834
Look, spirits stay with us sometimes out of love,

325
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,867
Concern,

326
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,433
Or guilt.

327
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:22,134
I feel terrible about what happened.

328
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,466
My family died for nothing,

329
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,333
Because of some heating valve.

330
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,134
And I got to live.

331
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:35,301
But I would never hurt myself.

332
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,700
If they're worried, tell them that.

333
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,433
I would never dishonor them that way.

334
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:49,976
I've gotta find those rings.

335
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,433
You've checked everywhere else?

336
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:54,501
Everywhere! And I can't tell Jim

337
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,700
Because they're our wedding bands.

338
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,667
So where do you want me to check next?

339
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,833
I don't know. I've searched the whole house,

340
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,533
And now I have to get it fixed back up again

341
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Before he gets home.

342
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,967
So, how's it going with your little friends?

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,767
Oh, you mean the dolls?

344
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,034
Yeah, what do they want?

345
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,466
Well, at first I thought they were blaming Emma for something.

346
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,600
Yeah, and now?

347
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,967
Well, I don't think so.

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,301
You said the aunt lied about the dollhouse?

349
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,900
No, I said that the niece had never seen it before.

350
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:21,533
Ok, so how weird is that? You know?

351
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,566
She finds a dollhouse.

352
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,533
It's the exact replica of the girl's home,

353
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,767
And she never shows it to her?

354
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,034
Well, it was sensitive.

355
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,567
You know, I mean, Emma's family died there.

356
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,301
The thing's destroyed by developers.

357
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,900
Developers didn't destroy it, the aunt did.

358
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,000
- What?  - Yeah.

359
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,061
I know that house.

360
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,331
I used to have a bunch of listings up in that area.

361
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,933
The whole neighborhood was in this uproar.

362
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,500
No, no, no, no. It was subdivided for back taxes or something.

363
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,433
- The house?  - Yeah.

364
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,466
No, that doesn't make any sense.

365
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,900
The family was loaded. You can check out the estate.

366
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,700
It's public record.

367
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,400
Ok, so then why would she destroy it?

368
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,767
That's a good question.

369
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:01,067
And what else is she lying about?

370
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,300
Where is it?

371
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,133
What?

372
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,300
The dollhouse.

373
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:24,700
What have you done with it?

374
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,366
What difference does it make?

375
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,401
What is the matter with you?

376
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,134
Drew said she saw you packing it up.

377
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,833
Ever since she found it up there,

378
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,067
You've been such a bitch.

379
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,167
Tell me where it is.

380
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,700
You mean, my dollhouse?

381
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:41,833
My cherished girlhood item?

382
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:46,067
That's what you told that lady at the antique store.

383
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Why did you lie?

384
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,666
What is it about that thing?

385
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,667
Why do you even care?

386
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,867
Why did you even agree to take me in?

387
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,200
Do you have any idea what I have done for this family?

388
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,634
Because of you!

389
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:07,634
The dolls are not in the same place they were before.

390
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,133
Yep.

391
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,267
What, they just move themselves?

392
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,900
Apparently.

393
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:16,400
Oh, that is so weird.

394
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:19,234
Are you gonna talk to the aunt?

395
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,601
Well, since she's a liar, what's the point?

396
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,833
I was hoping my friends would help me,

397
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:26,100
If they want to stop freaking out their daughter.

398
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,833
Are they here, right now?

399
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,067
Well, I think this is home, sweet home.

400
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,500
Do you want me to stay?

401
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:34,300
No, I'm fine, thanks.

402
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:36,701
Are you sure? Because I'm gonna go home

403
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:37,733
All right.

404
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,500
Good night.

405
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,467
What do you want?

406
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:05,467
What are you trying to tell me?

407
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,800
I can't hear what you're saying.

408
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,400
We kept our deal.

409
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:23,834
Why isn't she keeping hers?

410
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,734
Who did you make a deal with?

411
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,700
With lucy?

412
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:40,501
I don't understand.

413
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,100
If people break promises,

414
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,567
Promises will break them.

415
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,333
Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Gordon,

416
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,934
I'm here about a dollhouse.

417
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,200
Sorry, this one's off the market.

418
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,367
And how is everybody today?

419
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:17,633
Not too chatty.

420
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,733
No, not since they told me about some deal they made

421
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:23,367
And showed me images of aunt Lucy cutting her wrist.

422
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:24,500
You think the ghosts are trying to tell you

423
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,633
That the aunt's in trouble.

424
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,250
Well, they sounded angry,

425
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,033
like she had broken some sort of promise.

426
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,534
And then there's something else.

427
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:32,633
This where she cut her wrist.

428
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,200
Was she teeny-weeny?

429
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,933
No. She was in the real house when I saw her.

430
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,367
The walls were the same, the furniture,

431
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,400
Which made me notice that in each room,

432
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,167
Some of the parts were from the original house.

433
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,534
You mean the house they were living in.

434
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,166
Yeah, the one that the aunt had demolished.

435
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,767
But look, the bedspread and the draperies,

436
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,300
They're actually cut from the originals.

437
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,600
The actual fabric.

438
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,467
Oh, boy.

439
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,101
- Is that hair?   - Human hair.

440
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,034
It's wrapped around some of the other furniture, too.

441
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:07,634
You said the dolls were talking to you about making deals,

442
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,267
- Promises? - Yeah.

443
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:10,900
You saw the aunt spill her own blood.

444
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,234
Any idea what she did with it?

445
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,467
Did with it?

446
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,033
I think she was making a sacrifice...

447
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,767
Maybe sealing the deal.

448
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,334
Maybe sealing them in.

449
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, the blood makes kind of a paste.

450
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,301
They say it glues the spirit's will to the practioner's.

451
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:29,700
Rockland university is actually paying you to teach this stuff,Zoe?

452
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,467
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes.

453
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:33,052
Although I doubt you'd get a seat.

454
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:34,067
It's a packed house.

455
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:36,133
Thanks. I've heard enough of your lectures.

456
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,266
And you were never usually very interested.

457
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,834
What's changed?

458
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,467
It's for a patient. Do you mind?

459
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,900
Hey, you remember that time that I was grinding up

460
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,800
All the egg shells with the fake blood?

461
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,433
For your Haitian voodoo thesis?

462
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,533
Vodou. In Haiti, it's "vodou."

463
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:55,001
Ah, grad school. Good times.

464
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:57,934
So, who's your voodoo priestess?

465
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,500
Well, I wouldn't exactly call her a priestess.

466
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,834
But...ha! You said "voodoo."

467
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,800
It's the new orleans pronunciation. Mm-hmm.

468
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,533
The blood, the artifacts, it sounds domestic.

469
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:09,500
Spirit house?

470
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,101
The dollhouse? You said this lady, what was her name?

471
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,467
Let's just call her aunt lucy.

472
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,333
Because that's her name, and she's an aunt.

473
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,934
She demolished their real home, right?

474
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:19,367
And now they have no place to go?

475
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,700
Well, ghosts can live anywhere. Can't they?

476
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,934
Well, there's one school of thought

477
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,767
That if they can't return to the original place of their death,

478
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,233
Wherever that is, that they'll be lost,

479
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:32,124
Wandering the earth, unrecognizable to even other spirits for

480
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,567
eternity.

481
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,533
That's a bunch of hooey.

482
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,667
Well, it probably is.

483
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:39,067
Which is why what this lady did,

484
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,667
It could have had the opposite effect.

485
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:42,467
What do you mean?

486
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,634
Well, she took a bunch of angry spirits,

487
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,967
She tricked them and then bottled them up.

488
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,700
That only makes them stronger.

489
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,200
- And angrier?  - It would me.

490
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:52,734
At some point, they're going to bust out,

491
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,834
And when they do, it's not going to be pretty.

492
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,067
Good luck.

493
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,867
Hello?

494
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,266
I hear traffic.

495
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,001
Oh, I had to go by the archives.

496
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,333
- What did you find out? - It's voodoo.

497
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,634
Vodou. I don't know, however you want to call it.

498
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,834
Lucy did something to trap the spirits in there.

499
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,500
Well, you can't trap a spirit,

500
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,727
But you can trick 'em.

501
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,798
By making them think they can't exist outside their home.

502
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:21,718
Well, she sure went to a lot of trouble to try to contain them.

503
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:22,768
Exactly.

504
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:24,953
Which means they must have been haunting the crap out of her.

505
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,154
But why?

506
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:27,961
Well, they probably know she wants the money.

507
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:30,154
- There's money?  - Yeah, a lot.

508
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,121
Delia told me that the family was loaded

509
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:33,498
And the aunt was crying broke.

510
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:35,899
I thought it was just another lie, so I researched it.

511
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,498
That's a weird lie.

512
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,129
I like people to think I'm rich.

513
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,664
Yeah, well, she's not rich.

514
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,167
There's money. Family money.

515
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,136
It's the brother's, and then it goes to his kids.

516
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:45,304
Uh, singular.

517
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:46,776
Kid. It's just Emma now.

518
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:49,045
Uh, no, actually, Lucy gets the money

519
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:50,648
once all of his kids die.

520
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:52,615
Wait a minute, you're not... you n't think...

521
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,280
I mean, it was an accident.

522
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:56,517
You're not saying that she actually killed them?

523
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:58,415
There's a reason they all keep going back

524
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,247
to the night of their death.

525
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,214
The dolls snapping back to their positions.

526
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:03,814
But the aunt is managing the huge estate.

527
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:06,053
She must be getting something for the trouble.

528
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,750
Yeah, she is. Until Emma turns 18,

529
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,462
And then she gets everything.

530
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:10,758
And Lucy gets nothing.

531
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:13,367
Maybe that's why they trapped her in the attic.

532
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,366
Maybe they were trying to protect her.

533
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,526
Listen, I gotta go.

534
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,235
Drew, are you home?

535
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,013
Drew?

536
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:26,870
Are you up there again?

537
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:36,617
Drew!

538
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,612
Stop it, whatever you are, please!

539
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:25,462
Get out. You're next

540
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,704
Good, you're home.

541
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:35,784
Drew, the dolls up in the attic?

542
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,247
I believe you now that they have been talking to you.

543
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:40,311
What have they been telling you?

544
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,023
I can't tell you.

545
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:44,390
Drew, you have to.

546
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,918
They're trying to warn me about something.

547
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:49,797
They're only dolls!

548
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:51,452
They're just mad at her because she

549
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,268
Doesn't want me playing with the house.

550
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:55,059
Mad at your mother?

551
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,963
She just doesn't want me to break it.

552
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,595
It's fragile.

553
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,102
It's the antique.

554
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:03,602
Drew, don't you know who they are?

555
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,737
That was my house.

556
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:08,544
The house my family all lived in.

557
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:11,408
But they're just dolls.

558
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,280
Who can talk, right?

559
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:16,975
Because they are my family!

560
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,942
Their spirits live in those dolls.

561
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:23,390
Please.

562
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:26,079
What did they say?

563
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:29,551
They said my mom hurt them.

564
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,792
And she's gonna hurt you.

565
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:39,264
Oh, my god, that explains it.

566
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,944
That's why she was surprised to see me alive that night.

567
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,952
Listen, um, I gotta go.

568
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:56,656
You know my cell phone number, right?

569
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:59,112
- You sure?  - I'm sure.

570
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:01,385
You're going to be ok.

571
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:02,921
You're her daughter.

572
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,889
But if anything ever happens,

573
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:06,393
If you ever get scared, call me, ok?

574
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:08,257
Ok.

575
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:11,399
Bye.

576
00:28:51,597 --> 00:29:01,562
Mom? Dad? Are you here?

577
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:02,866
Yes, honey.

578
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,314
And we love you very much.

579
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,551
It's ok.

580
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,887
She'll be safe now.

581
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:36,003
Honey, we have to go back.

582
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:38,074
If we don't, Lucy will know.

583
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,377
Hey, Ned. Thanks for watching the store.

584
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:45,913
There's just one more thing I have to do.

585
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:47,337
Sure. No problem.

586
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:49,321
No sales, but someone came by

587
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,840
and took that huge dollhouse off of consignment.

588
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:55,476
The dollhouse?

589
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:57,716
Yeah.

590
00:29:57,782 --> 00:30:00,915
Don't tell me, is that what you were going downstairs for?

591
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:04,160
The lady said that it was hers, that she needed it.

592
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,390
Lucy.

593
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:07,263
Yeah, that was her name.

594
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,060
Did I make a mistake?

595
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:10,031
I'll be back.

596
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:17,541
Drew...

597
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,953
Drew?

598
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:01,353
Emma?

599
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:11,574
Drew?

600
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,376
Sweetie?

601
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:17,048
What is it?

602
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,785
I'm scared.

603
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,641
Of what?

604
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,481
Of you.

605
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:33,994
Oh, god. They're out. Drew!

606
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,731
We have to leave!

607
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,604
Drew? Drew.

608
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,008
What's happening?

609
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:44,511
Let her go.

610
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:46,338
You think she needs protection from me?

611
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,448
It's your family!

612
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:48,516
What did you do to them?!

613
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:51,220
- Nothing. Tell them to leave me alone.  - No!

614
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,509
Drew, come on! You'll be safe, ok?

615
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:54,999
- No, no!  - Stop!

616
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:57,581
Stop it, do you hear me? Or I will kill her!

617
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,259
Mommy!

618
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,948
- Stop it, do you hear me?!  - No!

619
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:06,948
Let Emma go, mom. Let her go.

620
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:08,276
Mom!

621
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:09,972
Stop...

622
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:11,548
Come here.

623
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:15,883
I didn't do anything!

624
00:33:15,949 --> 00:33:17,020
I never did anything!

625
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:18,551
We saw you.

626
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:21,016
Please just stop, ok?

627
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:23,151
Your brother is here, and his family.

628
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:24,720
Just please, I can help you.

629
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:27,432
Just tell me what happened, whatever deal you made,

630
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:29,623
Or whatever promise, it doesn't matter.

631
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:31,191
If we don't stay in there,

632
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,839
She'll destroy the dollhouse.

633
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:35,032
It doesn't matter, it won't destroy you.

634
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,735
I know that she said that, but it's not true.

635
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,039
Just tell me what happened. You said that you saw her.

636
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:42,239
The night we died, you were there.

637
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:44,741
It was cold that night,

638
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:48,006
And I kept pushing up the heat,

639
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:49,682
But it didn't get warmer.

640
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:58,255
Everyone went to bed very early.

641
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,292
We were all feeling very sluggish.

642
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,692
I thought we were coming down with something,

643
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,997
the flu or...

644
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:07,941
Good night, boys. Sleep well.

645
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,869
I couldn't keep my eyes open,

646
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,381
I was falling asleep so fast. Too fast.

647
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,861
That's when I saw her.

648
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:34,902
Moving from window to window,

649
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,598
making sure she got us all.

650
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:39,638
And for what?

651
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,869
Money?

652
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,598
Money I'd have given her

653
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,333
if she hadn't been too proud to ask for it.

654
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:46,837
Our parents cut you out, I never did.

655
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:49,205
Wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong.

656
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,045
He thinks that you killed him,

657
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,308
All of them, for your family's money.

658
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:57,588
He said that he saw you outside the windows that night.

659
00:34:57,653 --> 00:35:00,644
I was trying to help Emma.

660
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:07,920
I saw a girl that night, coming out of a club.

661
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:10,100
She was maybe 15.

662
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:11,332
She was with an older boy,

663
00:35:11,397 --> 00:35:14,028
they were drinking. I thought it was Emma,

664
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:16,331
But I couldn't be sure. It had been so long.

665
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:18,572
I hadn't talked to my brother in years,

666
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:21,306
And that was because of the money, it's true.

667
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,244
But I was so worried.

668
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:25,276
And when they didn't answer,

669
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,336
I drove by.

670
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,118
It seemed like they were sleeping,

671
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:36,246
And I didn't want to wake them.

672
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,217
And I found Emma's room.

673
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,024
She was there. In bed.

674
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:48,496
And I thought, ok, it wasn't her.

675
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:50,560
Everything's all right.

676
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:54,504
I was wrong.

677
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,558
When I got the call, I realized

678
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,177
when I'd seen them, they were dead or dying.

679
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,106
And yet there she was. I couldn't believe my eyes.

680
00:36:11,624 --> 00:36:15,326
They're gone. I can't believe they're gone.

681
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:18,062
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

682
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:22,921
And you didn't want to tell the police that you've been there,

683
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:24,725
because then you would have to tell them why.

684
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,228
Emma told the police she was

685
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,693
spending the night with the girl friends

686
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:30,101
And she'd come home early.

687
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,163
When I was 15, I packed my bed with pillows

688
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:35,268
And snuck off to see a boy I liked, too.

689
00:36:37,077 --> 00:36:39,780
But it didn't cost you your family.

690
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:43,012
I should have been with them.

691
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:46,080
I belonged with them!

692
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:47,615
No!

693
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,008
Emma, that is the last thing your parents would want.

694
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,279
This is not your fault.

695
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:57,118
You couldn't have saved them, even if you were there.

696
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:01,198
All that matters is that you were here now.

697
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:04,622
You are all that I have left of him!

698
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:08,525
When we were kids, we were so close.

699
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:11,436
Baby, I'm so sorry.

700
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,164
I was so scared, but I never meant to hurt you.

701
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:17,964
I would never hurt either of you.

702
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,241
It's all right now.

703
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,875
That's all right.

704
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:26,778
We were angry.

705
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,314
She was in our home.

706
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,353
Raising a child we thought she wanted to...

707
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,489
We thought you were going to hurt her.

708
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:36,249
That's why you've been trapped.

709
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:39,592
Not because of some magic spell.

710
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,593
It's not your fault.

711
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:43,960
You didn't leave her.

712
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:47,527
You didn't leave her alone.

713
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:49,335
She'll never be alone.

714
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:53,497
Mom, there it is again.

715
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:55,622
The light.

716
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,804
Oh, honey.

717
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,203
Tell lucy we're sorry.

718
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:03,875
Tell them all we love them very much.

719
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:06,209
I will.

720
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,121
They're gone.

721
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,856
Thank you.

722
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,316
Where are those rings?

723
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:14,201
Please, please!

724
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:32,180
Hey there.

725
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,876
I was coming to see if you wanted to have dinner.

726
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,548
But, uh, is this an invitation?

727
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,692
I'm stuck.

728
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,988
Really?! Sorry! Oh, hang on.

729
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,211
What's wrong?

730
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:04,083
I lost our wedding bands.

731
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:06,308
Oh. And I've looked everywhere.

732
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:08,147
I mean, I tore the house apart.

733
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:09,411
That's why the silverware drawer was on top of the oven.

734
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:11,187
Yeah, and I kept them on a chain.

735
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:12,659
And I wore them everywhere.

736
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:14,015
I never let them out of my sight,

737
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,428
Not even when I thought...

738
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,459
That you and I could never be together again.

739
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:19,371
But the thing is that,

740
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:20,995
like I got out of the car the other day?

741
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:23,923
You know, and I don't know, maybe the chain broke,

742
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,503
Or, I...

743
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,394
No, you were looking in the right place,

744
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:31,939
You just were looking a couple days too late.

745
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:34,579
Check your pocket.

746
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,875
I found them on the floor of your car.

747
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:46,051
I took this one to the jeweler.

748
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:47,955
Why?

749
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:52,883
I wanted to get it engraved.

750
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:54,562
So that you would always remember,

751
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:57,266
and that our child would know

752
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,993
that what you and I have

753
00:40:59,058 --> 00:41:01,937
is...

754
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,633
forever.

755
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,508
If you'll have me.

756
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,580
Melinda Gordon...

757
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,987
Oh, will you marry me...again?

758
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,846
Yes!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
