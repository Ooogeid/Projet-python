1
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:24,659
Commonly accepted methods
for communing with the dead.

2
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,230
As opposed to...

3
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,968
In my culture,
communication with the dead

4
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:37,005
Is taken very seriously.

5
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:39,074
Oh. Now you respect it.

6
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,842
You politically correct
trained weasels.

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,246
I expect the subject matter
to be taken very seriously.

8
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,282
Yes?

9
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:49,984
How come you never tell us
if you believe this stuff?

10
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,186
What does it matter?

11
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:52,587
We're studying trends,

12
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:55,657
Theories, systems of beliefs
that effect people.

13
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,293
Small subsets of people.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,895
Like those who first believe
that the earth is round.

15
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:02,630
But it is.
Oh.

16
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:04,099
Been to outer space,
have you?

17
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,235
Seen the earth in all
of its rounded glory?

18
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,771
I'm just saying.
As per usual,

19
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:11,840
Some of you will
find this all absurd

20
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:14,943
And have a good laugh at it
over your next game of beer pong.

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,278
Others of you,
for whatever reason,

22
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,781
May find it
a little too real.

23
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:28,223
I told you,
I already have a t.A.

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,758
He's an econ major.

25
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:32,093
You need someone who's
serious about the field.

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,762
Here.

27
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,630
Look at this, ok?

28
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:36,931
Oh, wow,
nice spirit board.

29
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,267
Where'd you get it?

30
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:41,903
I scope garage sales for a
secondhand store I work at.

31
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,371
Yeah, it's rare.

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,472
I could have someone
look at it

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,808
If you're trying
to find a price.

34
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:53,148
It's a gift. For you.

35
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:54,916
It might be worth
something.

36
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,351
Sell it at the store
you work for.

37
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:57,752
I can't.

38
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,522
The woman who owns it,
well, let's just say

39
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:02,957
She's not really a fan
of this kind of thing.

40
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:05,994
Oh, an occult prude?
Not exactly.

41
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,729
But really,
you should have it.

42
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:08,997
Don't worry.

43
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,131
You're going
to ace this course,

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,900
So you don't have
to suck up to me.

45
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,268
That's not what I'm doing.

46
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,370
Then what
are you doing?

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,207
Is that a concert flyer??

48
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,012
Trey...

49
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,247
Where did you get this?
Get what?

50
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,549
This flyer.

51
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:28,716
Who put it on my door?

52
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,186
Oh, sorry.

53
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,021
I know you want messages
handed to you,

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,289
But it's not my fault.

55
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,824
I didn't see anyone
put it there.

56
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:37,992
Hmm.

57
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,010
Did you just do that?

58
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,680
No.

59
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,151
Did someone tell you
I like that band?

60
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,420
No.

61
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:08,389
But who would
know that?

62
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:09,824
Maybe the spirit
board knows.

63
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:12,527
For a clean-cut kid,
you're a little odd.

64
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:14,562
I know.
Come on in.

65
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:22,303
I've got it covered,
trey. Go.

66
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,109
Have you ever used
one of these before?

67
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:29,210
No.

68
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:30,478
But you must have,
right?

69
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:32,747
I mean,
in your course of study?

70
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:35,617
In eighth grade,
at a slumber party,

71
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,820
Marie antoinette told my friend
sintra she liked her clothes.

72
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:42,190
Did I mention sintra
was holding the planchette?

73
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:45,927
Why don't we ask
about the flyer?

74
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,328
Hmm.

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,734
Should professor avery
go to the concert tomorrow?

76
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,436
ned: Whoa!

77
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,776
Did you do that?
No.

78
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:03,611
Come on!

79
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,647
Look...

80
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:08,216
Somebody wants you
to go to that concert.

81
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:09,951
Somebody dead.

82
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,087
Office hours are over.

83
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:16,190
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

84
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:17,625
You can leave the board
if you want to.

85
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,147
So did you make
any inroads?

86
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,649
I still don't know why you
want this t.A. Job so bad.

87
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,584
I'd have access
to the faculty libraries.

88
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:46,554
Including
the copeland wing.

89
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:48,389
That's where the drake
collection was originally housed.

90
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:49,757
I can't even
go in there.

91
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:50,892
You have to be
with that department.

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,460
It's where we found
the book of changes.

93
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:53,928
Who knows what else
is buried in there?

94
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:56,264
So you want to do it to find
out more about the shadows?

95
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:57,832
I've been researching for
months trying to find something,

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,169
I mean, anything,
about whatever they are.

97
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:04,172
But I keep coming up dry.
The copeland wing...

98
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:07,141
Academics from everywhere
do occult research there.

99
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,343
Weird looking guys, too.

100
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,011
Some with accents,
funny hats.

101
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,280
Ok, I thought we were
talking about a ghost.

102
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,615
Yes, and if I can help get
it away from professor grant.

103
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,718
That's if the ghost who flipped
the spirit board even knows her.

104
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,152
Look, this spirit
could be anybody, ok?

105
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,722
That's the problem
with those stupid boards.

106
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,491
They upset ghosts who are
desperate to communicate;

107
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,660
Gets them frustrated,
and then you end up with...

108
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,195
Frustrated, upset ghost.
Exactly.

109
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:29,297
There's something
about that concert.

110
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:31,099
And professor grant
knew it, too.

111
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,633
She seemed
kind of freaked out.

112
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,102
She does have
a dead ex-boyfriend.

113
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,770
Fiancé, technically.

114
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,171
Car accident.

115
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,272
I thought
you didn't know her,

116
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,507
That you guys ran in
different circles.

117
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,209
Circles of guys
she hooked up with,

118
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:43,478
Briefly dates,
and then dumps.

119
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,612
I heard many sad stories.

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,913
Fine. What do we
know about her?

121
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:48,216
Well, I found a link
to her webpage.

122
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,119
Wow.

123
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,787
Tribute much?

124
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:56,791
Not to be insensitive, but this
is a shrine to her ex-fiancé.

125
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,628
I mean, piece of cake.

126
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:01,996
He's gotta be our ghost.

127
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,965
Am I right?

128
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,867
I'll keep
my eyes open.

129
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,902
Thanks for lunch.
Yeah, sure.

130
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,138
Thanks.
Hey, all right, yeah.

131
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:11,672
I don't have any money.

132
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,940
Listen,

133
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,442
This might be
a little awkward,

134
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,912
But I think we have more in
common than you might think.

135
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:53,114
Ned, we need
to have a talk

136
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:55,983
About a little thing called
"boundaries." ever heard of them?

137
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,821
What concert?

138
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:02,390
I did not put this
on my date book.

139
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,925
Do you see what's
happening here?

140
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:06,627
No more office visits,
no more bringing me presents,

141
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,463
And no more trying to get me
to go to this concert with you.

142
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,866
With me? I think
you have the wrong idea.

143
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,401
And what are you
even thinking?

144
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:14,769
With your spooky,
invasive magic tricks.

145
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:15,870
They're not
magic tricks.

146
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:18,039
The flying spirit board,

147
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:19,073
The flowers you left me?

148
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,541
I didn't do
any of that.

149
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,877
Then how did you find out
about my favorite band?

150
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,812
You're haunted.

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,215
My friends don't
think so, but...

152
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:29,150
I'm haunted?
What friends?

153
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:31,152
I think there's
a spirit.

154
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,587
The board awakened it,

155
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,655
And I'm sorry
for my role in that.

156
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,824
But I don't think it's
going to stop pestering you

157
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,159
Until you
acknowledge it.

158
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:40,895
You're nuts, and you need
to transfer out of my class.

159
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:43,331
But this is...
I'm asking you to leave.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
<<By ABBI>>

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,781
You're nuts.

162
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,683
According to ned,
those were her exact words.

163
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,951
So she teaches
the paranormal,

164
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,319
But she doesn't
believe in it?

165
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,588
Hey, if I bought into every
psychological theory I teach,

166
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,457
I would have
murdered my parents.

167
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:12,659
Hey, how are they?
Honestly? Thriving.

168
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,394
I mean, for a couple
of dead people.

169
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:17,697
I think they're haunting
my aunt shirley in boca.

170
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,536
That's not exactly romantic.

171
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,604
You can't even
dance to it.

172
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:25,805
Well, maybe it was
something special

173
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,140
She shared
with her fiancé,

174
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,341
If he's even
the ghost.

175
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,377
The guy's sending her flowers
from the grave;

176
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,978
Setting up concert dates
with her.

177
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,713
Who else could it be?
Anybody,

178
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,781
Thanks
to the spirit board.

179
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,516
Ok, I get it,
you hate them.

180
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:37,717
Because they're like writing
your number on the bathroom wall

181
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,085
For the dead.

182
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:40,920
And maybe ned told avery
about the ghost too soon.

183
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:42,655
But he was doing it
trying to help us

184
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:44,524
Get into the copeland wing.
So we gotta help him.

185
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:47,394
That's her,
with the chair.

186
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,432
That's just academics.
Hey!

187
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,466
I resemble that remark.

188
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:54,901
No, I mean,
in this area.

189
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,069
Whether they believe it
or not,

190
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,303
They all think
they're experts.

191
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:58,405
And not only do I have
to convince them

192
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,006
That I can see ghosts,

193
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,108
But then they have to unlearn
everything they think they know.

194
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,377
hello?

195
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:07,380
I told you, I was
going to a concert.

196
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,415
Poor thing.

197
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,350
Whatever she said to ned,
she still came.

198
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,918
To meet her dead fiancé.

199
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,153
What faculty meeting?

200
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,288
With president bedford?

201
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:17,357
What wasn't it
on my calendar?

202
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:18,591
No, it wasn't.
All right,

203
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,393
I'm 10 minutes away. Oh!

204
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,766
Uh...

205
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,571
Oh, yeah, yeah.

206
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,072
I used to have
one of these.

207
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,909
I hated mine, too, so.

208
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:38,111
There. You ok?

209
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,246
Better than
my phone.

210
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,281
Yeah.
Sorry.

211
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:42,649
I just...please.

212
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,251
It's fine.

213
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,920
Fine.

214
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,455
Set it up.

215
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:54,194
So you see ghosts
and you talk to them.

216
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,797
You're one of the friends
ned was talking about.

217
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,332
I know it's
a lot to process.

218
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,235
And you think that's why my cell
phone decided to take flight.

219
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,304
At the exact moment you were
thinking about leaving the concert,

220
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,040
Which a ghost went to a lot
of trouble to get you to.

221
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,275
What do you think
happened?

222
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:11,611
I tripped,
and it flew out of my hand.

223
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,013
Law of physics.
You don't teach physics.

224
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,648
Just because I teach
anthro of the occult

225
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:17,450
Does not mean I should buy
whatever it is you're selling.

226
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,219
I'm not selling
anything,

227
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,221
Especially to somebody
who doesn't want my help.

228
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,723
But you know what,
feel free to call me

229
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,024
When your ghost
comes back.

230
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,060
Look, I'm sorry.

231
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,495
I'm listening.

232
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,997
Please, tell me
how this works.

233
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,868
First, we have to figure
out who the ghost is.

234
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:38,238
Logical place to start,
based on the behavior,

235
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,707
Someone who has romantic
feelings for you.

236
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,075
'cause all
the good ones

237
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,810
Are married,
gay or dead, right?

238
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:46,746
I should
have said "had."

239
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:52,018
Eli told me about
curtis, your fiancé.

240
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,888
Oh.

241
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,258
Well.

242
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,393
If you're just taking
shots in the dark,

243
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:04,063
You should be a little more careful
about throwing out names of loved ones.

244
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,131
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

245
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,366
Nobody means to.

246
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,368
They just want me
to move on.

247
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:12,005
Register at some dating sight
and find another soul mate.

248
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:14,007
Well, I'm old-fashioned.

249
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:15,808
I think you get one.

250
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,678
I don't expect you
to understand.

251
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,847
I understand better
than you think.

252
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:25,285
Believe it or not, I think
this ghost is staying here

253
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,886
Because he thinks
you need him.

254
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:29,422
You have
to let him go.

255
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,592
But if curtis is here,
why would I let him go?

256
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,528
Because spirits
don't belong here.

257
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,597
They belong
in the light.

258
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,065
Who died and made you
the expert?

259
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,303
I know a few things
about ghosts myself,

260
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,338
Or did you forget that?

261
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:46,706
No.

262
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,608
No, I didn't.

263
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,329
Did I order this?

264
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,602
"the big lebowski."

265
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,504
At least someone
screwed up with taste.

266
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,615
Curtis?

267
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,486
What are you doing?

268
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,491
Popcorn?

269
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,303
Extra butter?

270
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,173
Curtis, if this is you,

271
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,343
You know I like
my popcorn plain.

272
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:11,991
I can't tell if this is
a seduction or a séance.

273
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:23,569
Ok.

274
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,779
Well, what's
that about?

275
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,914
You don't want
to watch the movie?

276
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:39,852
So what
do you want to do?

277
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:44,991
Talk?

278
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,262
You know how much
I hate texting,

279
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,165
But I'm game.

280
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,244
Curtis, I...

281
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:08,047
I've been talking
to you out loud

282
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,683
For the past 3 years.

283
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:14,654
And now, I'm about
5 cats away from crazy,

284
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,456
So if you can
talk to me,

285
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,524
I mean, really
talk back to me,

286
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:22,428
Now would be such
a good time.

287
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:31,003
Maybe that woman's right.

288
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,539
Maybe you do belong
in the light.

289
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,978
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

290
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,616
I miss you so much.

291
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,354
Melinda: Don't touch,
I got it covered.

292
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:50,556
I'm...I'm just
trying to help.

293
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,291
Let me help.
Uh, no? Ok.

294
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,160
You know what,
I'm gonna go.

295
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:55,695
I'll clear aiden's stuff
out of the way.

296
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:57,263
No, no, he's in the middle
of a masterpiece.

297
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,865
Look, I already set
the dining room table.

298
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:01,634
Why don't you and aiden
go outside and play ball?

299
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:02,802
Right.

300
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,871
Ok. Turkey chili,
20 minutes.

301
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:06,973
We'll be there.

302
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,612
Hey! You know what,

303
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,814
If you want to talk
to me, just talk, ok?

304
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:17,450
No games.

305
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,085
Hey! Oh!
You know what?

306
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,821
That is just childish!

307
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,726
Why are you hiding?

308
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:32,431
No, no! Not my son's
art project!

309
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,601
Will you please stop?!

310
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,336
I just want to have a quiet
evening with my family!

311
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:39,539
You are ruining
everything!

312
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,174
Look, what I don't understand
is, how can you ruin everything

313
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,342
When you haven't
done anything yet?

314
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:02,043
Well, I told
dr. Grant and curtis

315
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:03,045
That they should
move on.

316
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,014
And you think
he has other plans?

317
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:07,449
Well, luring her
to the square

318
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,084
For a romantic concert,

319
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:10,286
Sending her flowers.

320
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:11,987
It's like he doesn't
want to let go.

321
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:13,422
And who am I
to say he should?

322
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,858
You know,
they're soul mates.

323
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,226
Hmm.

324
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:18,761
Like us.

325
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,596
oh!

326
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:23,199
Hospital.

327
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,733
Duty calls.

328
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,536
For both of us.

329
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:30,039
See ya.

330
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:32,007
Bye.
Avery, hi.

331
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,075
Is everything ok?

332
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:35,678
I think I owe you
another apology.

333
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,479
Something strange
happened last night.

334
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,982
I know
I should be happy

335
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,617
Instead of feeling
whatever it is I'm feeling,

336
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,320
But something about
the whole date night

337
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:46,555
Was just...Off.

338
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,023
And what was it?

339
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,892
I could really
feel him there,

340
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,462
And that was so amazing.

341
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,731
But... but he
wasn't really there.

342
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,900
Having him so close
but not being able

343
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,835
To really be with him...

344
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,937
I know it sounds ungrateful,

345
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,772
But...

346
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,274
It's just not enough.

347
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:07,176
It's torture.

348
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:08,878
Maybe you're right.

349
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:10,980
Maybe the only way
for both of us to heal

350
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,215
Is for curtis
to go into the light.

351
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,619
I can't believe
I'm saying that.

352
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,054
Hey, it doesn't mean that
you love him any less.

353
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:20,256
I know.

354
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:22,057
It's just that I have
a problem

355
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,526
With the whole...
Afterlife thing.

356
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,528
I mean,
before the accident,

357
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,264
I was kind of
a closet believer.

358
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,732
I mean, I always maintained
a very healthy,

359
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,434
Scientific skepticism
in public,

360
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,703
But I would go
in the copeland wing

361
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,238
And I would
read those books,

362
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:39,008
And they rang so true.

363
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:43,112
After curtis died, I waited and
waited for him to come back to me,

364
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,648
And...He never did.

365
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,551
So you're saying
that the hauntings

366
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:51,287
And feeling
his presence,

367
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:54,390
That just started
recently?

368
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:56,191
Maybe I shouldn't
question it.

369
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:57,826
Why would it
start now?

370
00:18:57,894 --> 00:18:58,928
What's different?

371
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,430
Are things
worse for you?

372
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:05,100
Ever since you told me
that curtis was haunting me.

373
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:06,468
I mean, before that,

374
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,971
I could go the whole day

375
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,140
Or two without
thinking about him,

376
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,708
But now,

377
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,144
I'm more obsessed
with him than ever.

378
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,817
Curtis?

379
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:23,285
Curtis,
if that's you,

380
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:24,787
You don't really
have to use the board.

381
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:27,056
I can see you
and hear you,

382
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,557
So you could just talk...

383
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,496
Or we can
do it your way.

384
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,210
"curtis is..."

385
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:49,778
"gone."
that's the message

386
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,880
The ghost spelled out
on the spirit board.

387
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:53,716
If curtis is gone, then
who's controlling the board?

388
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:54,850
Maybe we have
the wrong ghost.

389
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,118
Wouldn't be
the first time.

390
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,353
That would explain
the message

391
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,455
I got on my new
board last night.

392
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,557
You got a new board?

393
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:03,158
It said,
"I'm not curtis,"

394
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:04,793
Which would
make sense if...

395
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:05,961
You bought yourself
another board?

396
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,530
Look, I know how you
guys feel about them,

397
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:11,133
But you don't understand
what it's like for me.

398
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,701
I'm not a sensitive,

399
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,269
And I just thought
if I could...

400
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,707
I don't know
what I was thinking.

401
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,642
You really don't, if you actually
wish you could hear what I hear.

402
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,645
But I guess it proves the ghost was
attached to grant and not the board.

403
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:25,414
Right.

404
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:28,117
Do you know anyone else
in her life who died recently?

405
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:31,220
Professor nettinger was her
mentor in the anthro department.

406
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,621
He died a few months ago.
But the guy was like 104,

407
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,089
So I'm guessing
he wasn't making

408
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:36,291
With the romance.

409
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,394
Wait, her grandmother.

410
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,396
How do you know that?
They were close.

411
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,965
And she died last spring.
And according to my friend,

412
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,400
Grandma was always
pushing avery

413
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,801
To get on
with her life

414
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,569
And date guys she'd only
kick to the curb.

415
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:49,872
Fits the profile
of the ghost.

416
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,907
I was thinking the ghost
couldn't be a guy.

417
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:53,575
How come?

418
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,245
Dude, the ghost
left a glitter note.

419
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:07,756
Ok.

420
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:09,925
My ghost consultants
now tell me

421
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:12,261
That I may be communicating
with you, nana.

422
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:13,896
Is that true?

423
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,998
Nana, you don't have
to use the board.

424
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,766
There's a lady in town
who talks to ghosts,

425
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,269
And, uh, she might be
my new best friend.

426
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,171
Or a complete whack job.

427
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,506
Possibly both.

428
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,411
I know you want me to go
out there and meet new guys.

429
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,646
How about this?

430
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:34,183
I promise to start
shaving my legs

431
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,218
And putting on lipstick
before I go to the market

432
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:38,821
If you promise
to go into the light.

433
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:41,623
But I can't promise
that I'll ever feel

434
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,425
What I felt for curtis.

435
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,329
Is this supposed to be
the silent treatment?

436
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:50,699
Ugh! Why isn't there
a star 69 on this thing?

437
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,835
Ugh! Ok, fine!

438
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,728
"the big lebowski," how did
this get back in the machine?

439
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:43,544
Clavus ferreus,
malleus ferreus,

440
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:48,080
Ferrum refilium,
ferrum nobilis.

441
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,787
My parents thought
my degree would be useless.

442
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:54,824
not so useless
now, huh, mom?

443
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,160
Actually...

444
00:22:58,228 --> 00:22:59,962
I don't know.

445
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,334
Get this chucky doll
out of my life.

446
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,905
Professor grant,

447
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,774
Quince seed, sage,
spirit circles...

448
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,910
This stuff's
not going to help.

449
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:15,412
Well, your friend,
then, tell her,

450
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,880
Whatever potions she has,

451
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,181
Just to bring them on.

452
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:19,282
That's not
how it works.

453
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,917
This ghost wants to
reach you somehow.

454
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,952
Well, whoever's calling me,

455
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,889
My phone is off the hook
and I am not answering!

456
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,260
Hello?!

457
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:33,530
I was being
metaphorical!

458
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,001
What do you want from me?

459
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:45,742
It's the scratched disk.

460
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,310
I never returned it.

461
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:50,013
Maybe that's what
it wants you to do.

462
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,616
The ghost is trying to get
me to return an overdue dvd?

463
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,652
That makes no sense.
Not yet.

464
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,121
Not until we go to the store
and find out what else it wants.

465
00:23:58,189 --> 00:23:59,923
I'm on my way
to the square right now.

466
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,424
Let me give you a lift,

467
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:03,293
And maybe we can put an end
to this thing once and for all.

468
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:14,070
There really should be
some kind of express line

469
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:15,505
For people
with haunted disks.

470
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:16,973
Got that right.

471
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,741
What does the ghost
expect me to find in here?

472
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,043
I already rented
every good movie,

473
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,644
Which is not a lot.

474
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,383
Look out!

475
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,061
Whoa. Are you ok?

476
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,064
Wait...
Uh-huh.

477
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:47,570
Wow.

478
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:53,576
Now, don't I know you?

479
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,078
I think so.

480
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,180
The concert
in the square.

481
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:58,581
You threw
your phone at me.

482
00:24:58,649 --> 00:24:59,949
I didn't throw it at you,

483
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,718
It just kind of fell out
of my hands.

484
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:03,019
I can't explain it.

485
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,755
Well, I can explain it,
but never mind.

486
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:06,890
You're kidding me.

487
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:09,092
You're the one
who's late with this?

488
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,193
I've been waiting
for this.

489
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:11,895
You're here to rent
"the big lebowski"?

490
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:13,363
It's the best coen brothers movie ever.

491
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,532
Uh, best coen brothers comedy.

492
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,766
Aren't they all?

493
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,768
You may have a point.

494
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:23,806
Well, what are
the odds, huh?

495
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,609
Maybe not so bad.

496
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:29,946
No, not bad at all.

497
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:31,748
Excuse me.

498
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:40,323
All right.

499
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:44,427
surprise.

500
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:46,930
Hey, I was hoping
you guys would come by.

501
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:49,032
Oh, aiden twisted my arm.

502
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:50,366
I made this for you
at school.

503
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,402
It was really,
really hard.

504
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,170
Oh, it's really
beautiful.

505
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:55,605
You know what, I better put this away,

506
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:56,739
'cause somebody's
going to want to buy it.

507
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:03,846
What's that
doing here?

508
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:05,348
Ah, oh, it's another
one of ned's.

509
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,482
I made him leave it.

510
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,017
I thought those
were only for teenage girls

511
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,519
To scare themselves with
at slumber parties.

512
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:11,654
Uh, that, too, but
there's more than one thing

513
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:12,722
That can make
the pointer move.

514
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,057
Oh, really?

515
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:15,325
Other than the unconscious
muscle movements

516
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:16,593
Called ideomotor response?

517
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,595
You believe whatever you
want there, doctor man.

518
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,763
I used to,
but then I met this girl...

519
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,332
Aiden: Mom?

520
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,834
This board...

521
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:26,502
You know what,
baby, that's mommy's.

522
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,573
We're just gonna... we're
gonna put that away, ok?

523
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:31,774
It talks.

524
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,509
It talks?

525
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:35,578
What does it say?
It says,

526
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,181
It still won't
give her peace?

527
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:40,650
Give who peace?

528
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:44,620
Her.

529
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:08,389
All right, there you go.
Ok.

530
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:11,458
What, a girl with a
bloody head? How bloody?

531
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,826
She's a ghost.

532
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:15,529
But what does this have
to do with professor grant?

533
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:17,498
You know what,

534
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:20,000
Ned's out there, so let me
see if he knows something.

535
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,535
Right.

536
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,109
Oh, that's beautiful.

537
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:30,210
That's...that's funny.

538
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:31,411
This your doing?

539
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:34,581
No. It's the ghost,
whoever he is.

540
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,483
Oh, we got a problem.

541
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:38,285
You said you didn't really
get a chance to see it,

542
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:39,386
And, uh, I got...

543
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:41,421
Melinda:
You mean she.

544
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:43,223
Professor grant's grandmother?

545
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,758
She's here?

546
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:47,227
Not unless she had kids
at a very young age.

547
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:49,563
I don't know if you're going
to be able to watch it either,

548
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,732
'cause I think it's scratched. Oh, yeah?

549
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,234
I mean, maybe I could come
over and watch it, but...

550
00:27:58,139 --> 00:27:59,439
That sounded so smarmy.

551
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:01,608
Um, there's something wrong
with my dvd player.

552
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:03,043
I was not inviting
myself.

553
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:04,344
Stop it, that was me.

554
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:06,647
I was angling inviting you

555
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:10,217
In my most smarmalicious
kind of way.

556
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:12,085
Really? 'cause it was
really awkward.

557
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:14,221
Why are you smiling
about it?

558
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:15,789
'cause I think you're just
as bad at this as I am.

559
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:16,790
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

560
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:19,226
I need to get out
of the house more.

561
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:22,262
Yeah, tell me about it.

562
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,432
Ok, why do I keep feeling
like I've seen you before?

563
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,434
More than the concert
or the video store?

564
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,136
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:31,138
Oh, I know what it is.

566
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:33,173
The taj mahal.

567
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,675
Not the one in india.

568
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:36,610
Mini putt!
Mm-hmm.

569
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:37,678
I love that place.

570
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:39,346
The best mini golf
in the tri-state area.

571
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:42,115
Oh, the world!

572
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:44,484
You know, I know people go
there ironically and stuff,

573
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:48,121
But...It's beautiful
there at night, you know?

574
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:49,923
It's like this tiny,
perfect world

575
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:53,627
Where nothing bad
can ever happen.

576
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:54,728
Yeah.

577
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:56,296
It's not like here, huh?

578
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:57,397
No.

579
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:04,838
You want to go get
a coffee or something?

580
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,014
Ooh!

581
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,655
Why is there a tweenager
haunting avery?

582
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:24,925
And why'd she work so hard
to get those two together?

583
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:28,328
Nothing, nothing
was right at all.

584
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,864
And, you know,
we parted ways.

585
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:32,866
That's all.
But we still talk,

586
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:35,402
Sometimes.
Not so much.

587
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:38,205
Oh, god, how many rules
does that break,

588
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:40,707
Talking about my divorce
on the first date?

589
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:42,676
If that's even
what this is.

590
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:45,679
It is for me
if it is for you.

591
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,080
good.

592
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:48,849
Tell me a little bit
about you,

593
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,151
'cause honestly, I...

594
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:52,819
I can't believe
you're single.

595
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,288
Well...

596
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:59,359
The truth is, I don't really
consider myself single.

597
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:00,427
Mm-hmm. Why?

598
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:03,497
My fiancé died
in a car accident.

599
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:05,232
Oh, my god,
I'm so sorry.

600
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,768
A car accident?

601
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:10,871
Yeah, if it had been
a couple of weeks later,

602
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:12,239
We would
have been married

603
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:14,775
And I would officially be a widow,

604
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:17,678
Which maybe people
would understand better.

605
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:21,448
Mm-mmm. No, no,
they'd never understand.

606
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:24,751
Avery, the only people
that understand

607
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,386
Are people
that lived through it.

608
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:27,587
Did you?

609
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:28,922
My daughter.

610
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,224
Oh...

611
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:34,461
Also car accident,
3 years ago.

612
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,797
I was driving.

613
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:37,931
I'm so sorry.

614
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,034
You never get over
something like that, never.

615
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:46,773
Uh, the other guy was
wrong side of the road.

616
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:50,110
And this was
3 years ago?

617
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,248
And what road
was this?

618
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,417
Covington ridge.

619
00:30:57,485 --> 00:30:59,186
Covington ridge road?

620
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,154
Mm-hmm.

621
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:03,757
That's the road
curtis was killed on.

622
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,692
It's those blind curves.
I mean, the other guy,

623
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,594
He was just...
he was killed instantly.

624
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,963
And, what was
his name? Um...

625
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,169
Henry c. Flood.

626
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:18,972
You said
your fiancé's name...

627
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,008
His middle name
was curtis.

628
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:23,744
Oh, god.

629
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:25,312
And you said...

630
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,082
January 12th, 8:28.

631
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,753
You were driving the car
that killed curtis.

632
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,789
And madison.

633
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,795
Who is doing this?!

634
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:43,697
What do you mean?

635
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,198
Who wants me
to feel this pain?

636
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:46,700
What do you mean? Avery?

637
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,603
Do you think this is
a coincidence?

638
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,872
I don't know. I...avery!

639
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,840
I'm sorry, I can't.

640
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:56,176
Avery, wait!

641
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:01,314
Eli: Pizza's here.

642
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:02,749
What do you want to drink?

643
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,418
Anything. I found it.

644
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:06,686
Thank god. I thought I was
really going to have to make good

645
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:08,021
On my offer
to help you inventory.

646
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:10,457
Ah, check it out,
I've ided our ghost.

647
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:12,259
Brian and his daughter
madison.

648
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:13,827
But it says they only
had minor injuries.

649
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:15,195
Ah, that's what
they thought at first.

650
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:17,130
But look at this piece
from 2 weeks later.

651
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,999
2 weeks after the accident
she got a headache

652
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,367
During a volleyball game.

653
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:21,935
By that night,
she was in a coma.

654
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,937
She died of an epidural
hematoma.

655
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:26,106
This is why we didn't come
up with her name before.

656
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:27,908
It's possible.
Not even avery knew.

657
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:29,810
Why would madison
haunt dr. Grant?

658
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:32,012
She wasn't driving
the car that killed her.

659
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,082
Hmm, first article, officials blame
texting and driving for the accident.

660
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,752
Curtis was answering a text
at the time of the crash.

661
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,720
What if it was a text
from dr. Grant?

662
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:42,289
Hmm, that would explain
why the ghost blames avery,

663
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:45,625
But not why the hauntings
just started recently.

664
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:50,930
Why good-bye?
Is somebody leaving?

665
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,434
Leaving how?

666
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:02,074
What does that mean?
Someone's going to die?

667
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:07,546
When? Does it mean that
somebody's going to die soon?

668
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,090
hello?
Avery, it's melinda.

669
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,058
Where are you?
I'm driving. What is it?

670
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:21,461
Where are you going?
I need to talk to curtis.

671
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:23,063
Avery, please
just listen to me...

672
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,431
Please just
leave me alone!

673
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,759
Where's my purse, and my keys?

674
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:49,627
But we don't know if the spirit
board meant it was dr. Grant

675
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,529
Who was going to die, or if
the ghost was threatening her.

676
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,831
Do you really want
to take that chance?

677
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,332
Of course not,
but how do we find her?

678
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,900
I don't know.

679
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,436
She said
she was in her car,

680
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:58,670
That she needed
to talk to curtis,

681
00:33:58,738 --> 00:33:59,938
So where would she go
to talk to him?

682
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:01,206
Ah...

683
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:02,774
Wait a minute.

684
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,479
His obit said
he was cremated.

685
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:08,980
No service to bury
his ashes or anything.

686
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,583
Ok, so what else would be
a meaningful place for them?

687
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,752
I don't know, her website
listed dozens of places

688
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,787
They liked to go together.

689
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:17,823
Maybe she went to
the crash site

690
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,524
At covington ridge road.

691
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,773
I called 9-1-1!

692
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,209
Help is on the way!

693
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,178
Ok.

694
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,182
avery...

695
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,252
Brian!
Avery, it's you!

696
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,653
What are you
doing here?

697
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:49,754
Oh, god.
I was driving,

698
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:51,723
I saw dust and smoke.
Are you all right?

699
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,224
Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.

700
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,425
You sure?
Yeah.

701
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:57,395
Ok. Ok.

702
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,364
Ok. You sure
nothing hurts?

703
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,500
No. I think I'm more
rattled than anything else.

704
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,035
Ok.

705
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,036
Ok.

706
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,338
Come on. Ok.

707
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,409
Ok.

708
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,515
All right, now,
I want you to move everything

709
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,983
Just to see
if anything's broken.

710
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:22,120
Ah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

711
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,188
You're all right.

712
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,523
It's ok.

713
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,692
Why were you
driving on that road?

714
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,027
What do you mean?

715
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,628
Were you...
following you?

716
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:31,696
No, avery.

717
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:32,830
This can't be
another coincidence.

718
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:33,898
It's not.

719
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,834
It's where
the accident happened.

720
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,738
I come here all the time.
Why?

721
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,740
Avery! Brian!

722
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,941
Is everything ok?

723
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,344
Yes. I think so.

724
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,949
Where did you get that?

725
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,622
From your shrine
for curtis up the road.

726
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,292
Why did you do this?

727
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,063
I didn't mean
for her to get hurt.

728
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,631
I believe you.

729
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,899
What?

730
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,402
is madison here?

731
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,304
It's gonna be
all right.

732
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,106
Ok.

733
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,912
Madison?

734
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,948
Nobody
is mad at you.

735
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,117
You don't have
to hide.

736
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,454
Sweet...sweetheart?

737
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,922
It's daddy.

738
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,658
We just want
to talk with you.

739
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,793
She's here.

740
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,731
You did this to bring
them together, didn't you?

741
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,400
I didn't. Fate did.

742
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:44,035
Fate?

743
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:46,003
You mean your accident?

744
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,806
No, I mean, like,
practically every day since.

745
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,642
I don't understand.

746
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,312
Ever since he started coming
to talk to me on that road,

747
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,749
I noticed
she'd go there, too.

748
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,318
She'd come the anniversary
of the crash,

749
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,320
And he'd come the
anniversary of when I died.

750
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,222
So they missed each other.

751
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:09,260
But I followed her,
and I started noticing

752
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,929
That she likes all the
same stuff you like, daddy.

753
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,632
And not just weird groups
and mini golf,

754
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,434
But you both hate
snow skiing

755
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,269
And people who take up
2 parking spaces,

756
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,837
And people who say
"supposebly."

757
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,707
She followed you.

758
00:37:22,775 --> 00:37:25,843
You both have a lot in
common, and not just music

759
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,713
And movies
and mini golf.

760
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:32,216
But you both don't
like snow skiing

761
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,952
And people who take
up 2 parking spaces

762
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,722
And people who use
the word "supposebly."

763
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,724
Supposebly is not a word.

764
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:42,193
No. And people who take
2 parking spaces...

765
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,028
Should be beaten.

766
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,331
Plus, even the accident,

767
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:50,067
It only happened
because dad and her fiancé

768
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:53,504
Happened to be buying tickets
to the same bizarre concert.

769
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,474
The accident was
just a part of it.

770
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,744
You and curtis, you were headed to
buy tickets for the same concert.

771
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:01,946
Broken social scene.

772
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,216
It's my second
favorite group.

773
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,255
Honey...

774
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:14,625
Um, having a few things
in common with someone

775
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,794
Doesn't necessarily mean
the two of them

776
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,330
Should end up together.

777
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,399
Madison: I never said
they should end up together.

778
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,534
Just talk.

779
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,437
She just wants you
to talk.

780
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,241
You don't think I talk?

781
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,877
Till today, not hardly.

782
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:35,012
Not really.

783
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,014
Until today.

784
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:41,752
Because avery,
she understands.

785
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,788
That's the real thing
you have in common...

786
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:46,157
Me, her fiancé,

787
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,359
The wreck,
and how that feels.

788
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:52,730
Is that why you started haunting avery?

789
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,799
Because something reminded
you of the accident?

790
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:57,768
No. Daddy
was feeling so sad,

791
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,370
Like a new place
would help.

792
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,239
He was going to move.

793
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,808
And you were thinking
about moving?

794
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:07,278
Yeah. Yeah, she's right.
I mean, I was looking.

795
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,080
You were?
Yeah.

796
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,916
Then they'd lose
their chance.

797
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:12,917
I couldn't say good-bye

798
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:14,585
Till I made it
mean something.

799
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,087
What mean something?

800
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,422
Me being gone.

801
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,660
What?

802
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:25,129
What?

803
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:28,866
She wanted her death
to mean something.

804
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:33,971
That's what
all this is for.

805
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,112
Sweetheart?

806
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,515
Oh, god, madison.

807
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,617
No.

808
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:52,256
Your life meant
so much to me.

809
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:54,592
It would mean
even more if you try.

810
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,027
Promise, daddy.

811
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,795
Just try.

812
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,731
She needs you to promise
that you're gonna try.

813
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,470
Oh. I...honey,

814
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,705
I don't know.
I can.

815
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,275
I can try.

816
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,643
Really?

817
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,478
I mean, you sure?

818
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,646
Mm-hmm.

819
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,517
Ok. I'll try.

820
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:23,621
Can you tell him
never to wear

821
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:24,822
The cologne
that mom gave him?

822
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,992
He thinks it makes him
irresistible. It doesn't.

823
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,429
Yeah,
I'll tell him that.

824
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,198
Sweetheart?

825
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,833
I'm going to miss you...

826
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,836
Every single day of my life.

827
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,176
And I love you so much.

828
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:59,957
I love you, too.

829
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,413
She's gone.

830
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,800
I mean, does our son
just imagine

831
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,602
That little elves
come out at night

832
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,837
And clean up
his toys for him?

833
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,472
I don't...no.

834
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,742
He probably imagines
that we come out and do it.

835
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,680
I really wish someone
would clean up my toys.

836
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,449
Sorry. I keep
taking these from ned.

837
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,985
What's wrong?

838
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,087
Nobody died.

839
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:04,989
That's a bad thing?

840
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:06,557
Well, no, it's just
that the board

841
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,592
Said that somebody was going
to die, and they didn't.

842
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,095
Good.
The board was wrong.

843
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,798
You're right.
The board was wrong.

844
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,470
No.

845
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,341
Does that mean that
somebody is going to die?

846
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,400
Is it someone we know?

847
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
<<By ABBI>>
