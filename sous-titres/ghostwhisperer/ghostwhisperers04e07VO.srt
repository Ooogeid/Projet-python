1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,634
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

2
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,433
No! Jim!

3
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,434
Melinda?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,867
Hey, what is this place?

5
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,967
Where am I?

6
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,668
Not even a hello for your big brother?

7
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,167
Dan?

8
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,501
Man, I've been waiting here for hours.

9
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,467
Hours?

10
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:56,267
Hours, years, who knows. It's all the same.

11
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,434
But I have been waiting for you.

12
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,267
Dan, why are we here?

13
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,134
Don't you recognize this place?

14
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:03,967
Dad used to bring you here.

15
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,668
Whenever you needed cheering up.

16
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:07,051
You guys used to fish here,

17
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,434
or just dangle your feet off the pier and talk.

18
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,301
We came here when you died.

19
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:15,501
I know. I was watching.

20
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,067
Now we can go.

21
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,467
Go where, dan?

22
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,501
Duh. Into the light.

23
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,933
I'm supposed to bring you over,

24
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,334
That's what I've been waiting for.

25
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:29,567
The old man told me, "next time I see you guys,

26
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,800
I want to see you together."

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,301
Dad's there?

28
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,800
I've only seen a glimpse of him.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,734
He also told me

30
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,668
I can finally lose the penguin suit when we cross over.

31
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:40,933
So let's go.

32
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,334
Dan, I can't.

33
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,967
I have to see Melinda.

34
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,933
Jim, Melinda's gonna be fine.

35
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,567
Fine? No, she's not fine.

36
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,334
She's a wreck! I have to see her. I have to talk to her...

37
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,967
No, you don't, Jim. Trust me, you don't.

38
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,601
- She's expecting me... - Jim, listen to me!

39
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:56,768
Does Melinda know that you love her?

40
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:57,850
Does everyone you care about

41
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,333
know how much you care about them?

42
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,267
Yeah, I think so.

43
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,367
Then you're done.

44
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,467
You're ready to cross over.

45
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:14,301
No.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,867
I can't leave Melinda.

47
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,933
Well, do what you gotta do, brother.

48
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,367
That's it. We lost him.

49
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,401
Ned honey, why don't you go and see if there's any recycling

50
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:36,800
that needs to go out, or any mail.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,601
No, it's fine.

52
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,467
Don't worry about that stuff.

53
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,768
More tea?

54
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:45,601
I can't believe I haven't seen him.

55
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,833
He isn't coming to me. It's been 2 days.

56
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,134
Maybe...

57
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:53,367
I don't know. Maybe he crossed over.

58
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:57,367
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.

59
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,067
But wouldn't he have said goodbye?

60
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:04,267
I mean, he wouldn't just leave, would he?

61
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,434
Thanks for pointing that out.

62
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,334
Haven't you even felt anything?

63
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,800
Mel, I'm here.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,434
Like a presence or something?

65
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:14,467
I'm right here with you.

66
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,000
I haven't seen a ghost since Jim died.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,668
Not that I want to.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,933
Honey, we have to settle on a date for the funeral.

69
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,434
I can't.

70
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,800
It's too final. I just can't.

71
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:42,967
Jim?

72
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,234
Mel, it's not me.

73
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:46,800
Do you see a ghost?

74
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm right here.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,601
I don't see anything.

76
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,734
He's here.

77
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:10,367
No, it's not me!

78
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,267
It's not!

79
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,434
Melinda, why can't you see me?

80
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,634
Thank you, ma'am.

81
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,001
Mom.

82
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,333
Everyone's so sad.

83
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,367
It sucks, I know.

84
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,067
But you have to believe

85
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,967
that they're all going to be all right.

86
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,534
It's not your job to take care of them anymore.

87
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,333
They'll take care of each other now.

88
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,834
Melinda can't see me.

89
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,467
She doesn't even know I'm there.

90
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,001
It's her grief.

91
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,634
It makes the veil stronger.

92
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:35,567
It blocks her gift because this is so personal for her.

93
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,200
When she finds some joy again, it'll come back.

94
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:41,701
I can't leave her like this.

95
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,701
She needs closure. We both do.

96
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,767
Jim, here's the thing.

97
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,434
You're on the threshold.

98
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,867
If you don't come soon...

99
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,467
well, let's just say I can't wait much longer.

100
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,600
I don't know if this will ever go away.

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,934
This feeling.

102
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:16,168
I miss you so much.

103
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,367
Everything hurts.

104
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:29,001
There isn't anything I do that isn't about you, somehow.

105
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,034
Even opening the refrigerator,

106
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:34,400
I start to ask if you want anything.

107
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,034
And then last night

108
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,400
There were dishes in the sink.

109
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,867
And I thought, oh,

110
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:46,734
why can't he just put these in the dishwasher.

111
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,400
God, I love you, Melinda.

112
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,567
I didn't mean to leave.

113
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:55,200
I never want to be without you.

114
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,168
If you could just get a sign.

115
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,367
If I just knew that you were all right.

116
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,600
If I knew that...

117
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,650
you were at peace somehow,

118
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,701
then maybe I could get through all this.

119
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:13,400
I wish I could.

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,101
But I'm here.

121
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,634
I'm with you now.

122
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:27,934
Come on inside.

123
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,001
Time to get some sleep.

124
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,001
I would if I could.

125
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,001
I would if I could.

126
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,434
You can't help!

127
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,567
Jim...

128
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,801
Is this you? I don't understand.

129
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,300
Mel, no! It's not me!

130
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,467
It's this ghost...

131
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,101
Melinda, I'm right here. Hear me.

132
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,001
Honey, is everything ok down there?

133
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:46,867
Yeah. Everything's fine. Just go back to sleep.

134
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,168
Mel, hear me. Hear me!

135
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:12,567
Nice turnout.

136
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,367
Sorry, I'm a little, uh...

137
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,333
I...The thing is...

138
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,567
I was going to stand here and talk about loss.

139
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:47,233
About...

140
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,801
losing a husband,

141
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:54,300
a son,

142
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,367
losing a friend.

143
00:11:56,367 --> 00:12:01,667
All of a sudden it feels wrong to talk about loss.

144
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,200
All of a sudden I want to talk about what we gained.

145
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,934
What he leaves us with.

146
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,767
We're not people who've lost.

147
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,534
We're winners.

148
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,233
Winners because he was here.

149
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,500
He was with us.

150
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,667
He loved us.

151
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,567
And we loved him.

152
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,333
We're all better for knowing him...

153
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,300
Each and every single person here.

154
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,567
Where's the loss in that?

155
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,534
Listen, um...

156
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:43,234
I was gonna play this, you know, sad, moving song.

157
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,967
Jim didn't like sad, moving songs.

158
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,368
He liked to rock.

159
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,401
And so should we.

160
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,567
I'm here.

161
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:48,500
I know.

162
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,533
I just danced at my husband's funeral.

163
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,900
Aren't I the merry widow.

164
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,800
Another scandal in Grandview.

165
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,201
I couldn't understand why you were staying away.

166
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,567
Never. You just couldn't see me through your grief.

167
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,067
It had to lift.

168
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,867
I don't understand the signs you were giving me.

169
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:17,201
The apple, the dishes, silverware.

170
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,167
I was like, "what, is he hungry?"

171
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,993
Is that the only message he has for me from the great beyond?

172
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:23,500
It wasn't me.

173
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
You've got another ghost...

174
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,233
angry teenage girl, I think.

175
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,400
She might be dangerous, Mel.

176
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,700
None of that matters to me anymore.

177
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,533
I am so empty without you.

178
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,967
No, I'm here.

179
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,700
And I'm not going anywhere.

180
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,767
You can't stay.

181
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,700
You know that. You have to cross over.

182
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,734
Why?

183
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,000
It's the way it is.

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,366
It's what happens next.

185
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,034
I don't want to.

186
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,167
I know that.

187
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,867
Mel, I never told you this.

188
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,433
But I don't think I believe in the crossing over part.

189
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,034
Not that it doesn't happen.

190
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,900
But does it have to happen?

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,833
If you don't believe it,

192
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,667
that's like saying that you don't believe in me.

193
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,333
No. Of course I do. I'm just asking you the question.

194
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,734
Do you think maybe it's better sometimes

195
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:15,599
that somebody stays?

196
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,433
I know it feels that way.

197
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,800
You think I want you to go?

198
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,598
You think I wouldn't be happy just to stay here

199
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,157
and forget about everything else?

200
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,399
Look, it's not that I don't want you to have a life...

201
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,034
This is my purpose. It's what I have this gift for.

202
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,633
For souls to cross over and to take the next step.

203
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:37,000
And it's what's best for you. So I can't...

204
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,266
Hey, no more words.

205
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,233
I just want to be with you now.

206
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,667
- Here you go. - Thank you.

207
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,034
I can stay, you know.

208
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:05,233
I'm fine. Really.

209
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:10,834
I know. Since the wake I feel so much lighter.

210
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,967
It's almost like the ache is gone.

211
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,667
It almost feels like there's something wrong with that.

212
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,633
No, tell her it's what I would have wanted.

213
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,266
You know Jim.

214
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:25,800
This is what he would want... everyone to be happy.

215
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,300
Yeah. I do believe that.

216
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,333
You won't forget me, will you?

217
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,633
I love you so much.

218
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,967
I don't want to lose you, too.

219
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:43,134
No. You won't. You're my family.

220
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,000
Safe travels.

221
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,134
Thank you, darling.

222
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,333
Bye.

223
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,201
Shouldn't we have told her that you're still here?

224
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,500
No.

225
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,834
If we had, she'd never be able to let go.

226
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,101
Hey! Who are you?!

227
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,767
What do you want with my wife?!

228
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,867
What do you think you're doing?!

229
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,333
I am right here!

230
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,800
Can't you see me?!

231
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,967
I hate you!

232
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,734
I just want to make you a damn omelet.

233
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:06,834
What?

234
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:09,533
Do you remember what you said about your mom?

235
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,167
That you didn't want her to know that you were here

236
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,533
because she wouldn't be able to let go?

237
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:16,767
You're the one who can't let go.

238
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,700
And you have to.

239
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,300
It's not fair for me to keep you here.

240
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,834
You're not keeping me here, I'm keeping me here!

241
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:28,967
Then it's not fair for me to make you stay.

242
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,500
Melinda, why would we not be together if we can?

243
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,700
Because we're not together. We can't be.

244
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,800
Not in the real world.

245
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,134
How about our world?

246
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,300
Isn't this better than never seeing each other again?

247
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,934
Total, naked truth...

248
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,034
I'd be happy never leaving this house again,

249
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,101
If I could be with you.

250
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:54,467
Alive or dead.

251
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,667
But you have a journey to take.

252
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,700
So do I.

253
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:06,266
We just can't be together right now, that's all.

254
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:11,266
It's our...fork in the road.

255
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:13,034
Until we meet again.

256
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:15,467
Over on your side.

257
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,300
My road.

258
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,700
My journey is with you.

259
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,333
It is you.

260
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,433
It's always been that way.

261
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,867
And that was the choice I made.

262
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,533
And I'm not...

263
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,867
I cannot let it go just because I'm dead.

264
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,867
There's a sentence you don't hear yourself say every day.

265
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,734
I don't want you to come here anymore.

266
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:52,533
It just... it hurts us both.

267
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,034
You know, and it's wrong.

268
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:56,533
So if you love me, you'll just...

269
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:59,633
You'll just do the right thing and cross over.

270
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,201
You don't believe that.

271
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:02,366
Yes, I do.

272
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,366
Please...

273
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,366
don't make this any harder than it already is.

274
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,067
You know what you have to do.

275
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,800
I'll be with you again.

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,034
And it won't seem like such a long time,

277
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,167
I promise.

278
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,934
Oh, Jim.

279
00:21:56,934 --> 00:22:00,467
Please don't do this.

280
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:02,667
Are you kidding me?

281
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:05,767
I'm off duty, ok? I can't help you.

282
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:09,167
You have to help him.

283
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,533
Who? Jim?

284
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,767
Forgive him.

285
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,734
For what?

286
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,800
Who are you talking about?

287
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,067
Look what I've done to him.

288
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:17,667
Can I just say that no matter what else,

289
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:21,167
messing with people like this is the greatest?

290
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,800
And can I just say my freaking heart rate

291
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
Hasn't gone below 125 since I met you people?

292
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,867
Why would you do that?!

293
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:29,201
I'm sorry, Eli.

294
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,667
I just wanted to see if I could turn on your clock radio.

295
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:34,734
I mean, there's a big learning curve to this whole ghost thing.

296
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:37,101
You know, lone ranger look is good on you.

297
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:39,468
My eyes are sensitive to light, ok?

298
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,834
Is the nuclear level really necessary? Seriously.

299
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,900
Sorry. I can't do it.

300
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,001
What are you doing here, Jim?

301
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,500
Not that I'm not glad to hear you.

302
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,301
But why aren't you with Melinda?

303
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:51,034
Look. Melinda doesn't want to see me ok.

304
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:52,734
She just wants me to cross over.

305
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:54,434
Seriously?

306
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,368
I thought you guys had the perfect marriage.

307
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,201
You die. She throws you out? That's weird.

308
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:00,867
Dr. Phil, I don't think I need any advice on my marriage, ok.

309
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,900
I just...I need your help.

310
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,867
How?

311
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,900
There's a ghost haunting Melinda.

312
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,967
It's a toxic ghost.

313
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,934
And I'm afraid she's gonna hurt her.

314
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:11,700
Well, with all due respect,

315
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,167
I mean don't you think you're in a little bit better position

316
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,167
than I am to deal with a ghost?

317
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,600
I mean, me being alive, and you being...

318
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,767
dead?

319
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,900
I was going to say less alive.

320
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,367
The ghost is afraid of me. I can't pin her down.

321
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:28,034
Or I don't know, haven't learned how to do that yet.

322
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,401
And I'm worried about Melinda.

323
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,201
Because right now, she's more vulnerable than ever.

324
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:32,633
What kind of ghost?

325
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,734
Ok. A sick one.

326
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,533
She's wears a hospital gown.

327
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:38,667
She has discolored skin, her hair's falling out.

328
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,533
I think she's a cancer patient.

329
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:41,834
What do you want me to do?

330
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,067
I want you to work with Melinda

331
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:48,867
and find out who this ghost is and what she wants, ok?

332
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,700
Eli, maybe you can help Melinda

333
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,900
re-engage a little bit with real life, ok?

334
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,434
Get her mind off me.

335
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:58,733
In other words, get Melinda to do something

336
00:24:58,733 --> 00:24:59,633
she doesn't want to do.

337
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,967
That's always easy.

338
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,584
Just tell her I can't cross over...

339
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,201
I won't cross over...

340
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,401
until I know this ghost is out of her life.

341
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,368
Ok?

342
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:13,401
I don't want to complain, but I'm starting to tan.

343
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,167
You could use it.

344
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,900
Ok.

345
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,800
50/50 shot that whole thing was a dream.

346
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,101
That was no dream.

347
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:26,700
What if I really want it to be?

348
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,001
Why did he keep coming to you?

349
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:30,368
Does he want you to talk me about having him stay?

350
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,667
He's worried about you.

351
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,633
He wants to make sure you're safe before he leaves.

352
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,633
Safe? Nobody's safe.

353
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,667
Look, I think his heart's in the right place.

354
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,368
I know where Jim's heart is.

355
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:42,434
All right? And I know he's doing this because he loves me.

356
00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:44,667
And I'm doing what I'm doing because I love him.

357
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,834
It's like O. Henry meets Edgar Allan Poe.

358
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,567
If you want to help Jim, just tell him to cross over.

359
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,234
I want to help you.

360
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:54,500
I am fine.

361
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,734
No, you're not.

362
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,967
You're angry. You're hurt. You're lost.

363
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,834
Just like anybody would be who's going through this.

364
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,667
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

365
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,034
Yes, there is.

366
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:05,167
You can help me find this ghost who's haunting you.

367
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,267
Find out what she wants.

368
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,134
I don't care.

369
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,734
Then fake it!

370
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,034
You need to do something positive.

371
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,900
Something to help this ghost, help Jim,

372
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,767
and help you.

373
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Tell me what you know about her.

374
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,834
She said I needed to forgive him.

375
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:25,434
Jim? For what?

376
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,633
I don't know if she was talking about Jim.

377
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,067
She seems really confused.

378
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,633
Jim says he thinks she might be a cancer patient.

379
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,700
Yeah, could be.

380
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,800
Ok. So we'll check some hospitals.

381
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,917
Yeah, 'cause a cancer death in Driscoll county,

382
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,034
that should be a snap.

383
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,201
It's a start.

384
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,301
Look, I know that you're trying to help.

385
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:50,001
But I can't do this.

386
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:53,600
I don't want anything to do with ghosts. Ok?

387
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:58,434
Melinda...

388
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:00,734
Jim, people have been searching for a way

389
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:03,034
to live forever for a million years.

390
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:05,867
But it just can't be. It's against nature.

391
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:08,067
I'm not looking to live forever.

392
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,368
I just can't live without Melinda.

393
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:12,267
You're not.

394
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:16,567
But you owe it to her to let her live without you.

395
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,468
Jim, I can't wait any more.

396
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,834
I'm crossing over.

397
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,334
I want to bring you with me, little brother.

398
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,134
That's what I've been waiting for.

399
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:29,533
But I can't force you.

400
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:34,533
What's it gonna be?

401
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,800
Is that dad?

402
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,267
He's been waiting, too.

403
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:53,100
For both of us.

404
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:56,634
I can't.

405
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,201
He's not here?

406
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:04,767
Who?

407
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,100
The dead man.

408
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,601
My husband.

409
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:13,634
No. No, he's not here.

410
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:16,668
He doesn't want me to talk to you.

411
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:18,800
He hates me.

412
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,534
Is this about Jim?

413
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:25,334
First, it's about my step-dad.

414
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:26,668
I hurt him.

415
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:28,301
Hurt him how?

416
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:29,967
Is he still alive?

417
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,267
Yes.

418
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:34,534
But he doesn't want to be.

419
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:41,367
Look, I...I don't want to seem hard.

420
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,867
But I'm a mess right now.

421
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,668
It's all my fault.

422
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:49,800
I know how it is to feel guilty. I do.

423
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,334
Everything is my fault.

424
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,434
It's because of what I did.

425
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,934
What did you do?

426
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,367
I'm the reason your husband is dead.

427
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,634
What would this ghost have to do with Jim's death?

428
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,191
Wouldn't Jim have said something?

429
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,667
Unless he doesn't know.

430
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,901
Or the ghost is confused or lying.

431
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,667
Thanks for narrowing that down.

432
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,201
See, that's why we need you back in the game!

433
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:27,634
You gotta listen to what this ghost has to say...

434
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,400
I think I scared her off last night.

435
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,201
Heh. Isn't that irony?!

436
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:33,167
I mean, most ghosts scare the hell out of the living,

437
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,301
But you...

438
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,567
Focus. How do we figure out who this ghost is?

439
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,500
You want focus? How about this...

440
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,833
We've been assuming,

441
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,167
because of what you and Jim have said,

442
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:44,500
that the ghost, by the way she looks, is a cancer patient.

443
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,533
But there's another possibility.

444
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,150
Jim said that the ghost had something

445
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,767
in her bathrobe. An apple?

446
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,901
Yeah. That she threw at my head.

447
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,734
Why would there be an apple, or any food, in a bathrobe?

448
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,368
Something she was saving?

449
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:58,284
Or hiding. Hiding because she wanted

450
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,201
someone to think she'd eaten it.

451
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,533
I don't get it.

452
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,834
Ok. Yellow skin, decaying teeth, hair loss

453
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,634
Are all symptoms of...

454
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,901
anorexia.

455
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,334
My ghost isn't all that thin.

456
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,867
There could be other complications from not eating.

457
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:17,500
Like your heart stopping.

458
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:20,967
That would make more sense given her age

459
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,500
and all the guilt that she's feeling.

460
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,268
And if she's local...

461
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:25,551
makes it easier to track down

462
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,834
'cause it's more unusual in Grandview.

463
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,834
What did I just do?

464
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,834
Come on, say it with me.

465
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:33,400
Narrowed it down.

466
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm sorry, Mr. James.

467
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
The hospital will never give out that information.

468
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,268
Actually it's Dr. James.

469
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,167
I don't see an "M.D." On there.

470
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,767
Doctor of psychology and philosophy.And doctor of love

471
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:49,901
in my last year of high school,if you must know.

472
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:52,301
Very impressive. Bye-Bye.

473
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,634
- Eli, listen... - Aah!

474
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,600
Just get her to bring up the informational on her computer?

475
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
- Are you ok? - Yeah, yeah.

476
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,101
I just hate when something I'm not expecting happens.

477
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,400
You just ask her to look at the records.

478
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,634
She doesn't have to name names.

479
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:05,867
I don't know how that's gonna help.

480
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,334
How what's gonna help?

481
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:10,834
Because I can read the name over her shoulder, genius.

482
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,600
Can you do me a favor?

483
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Can you just look and see if someone specific...

484
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,467
No, not specific! Eli, she can't do that.

485
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:21,934
And when I say specific I mean anyone, really,

486
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:25,301
In general, who may have died of anorexia in the last month?

487
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:27,467
And why would I do that?

488
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,734
Because you're doing research at the university

489
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,901
on anorexia deaths in the student population.

490
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:34,934
That's right.

491
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:36,301
Eli, she can't hear me.

492
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:39,500
And I'm doing research at the university

493
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,167
on anorexia deaths.

494
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,467
And I want to see if there's an upward curve

495
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:45,767
in back-to-school months.

496
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,800
I'd love to be a fly on the wall in one of your classes.

497
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:53,901
There were 2 deaths last month.

498
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:57,368
One in the hospital, one D.O.A.

499
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,268
Does that help?

500
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,334
Got it.

501
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:02,201
It does help. It's very helpful.

502
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,334
If it were up to me,

503
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:05,001
you'd have a little something extra

504
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,567
in your envelope this week.

505
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,934
You should walk away now.

506
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:12,334
Caitlin Mahoney. Her address 15 Keats Street.

507
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:13,667
Don't forget that, ok?

508
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,767
Got it.

509
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,368
He's in defib.

510
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:20,400
Defib charged to 200.

511
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,634
Clear!

512
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:27,101
Resume C.P.R. Give him an amp of epi.

513
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:32,500
Ok. Hold C.P.R. Let's do a rhythm check.

514
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,001
Still in asystoli.

515
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,867
I'm gonna call it.

516
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,001
Time of death 11:22.

517
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,934
I'll call the wife.

518
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:43,934
No more pain.

519
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,433
It's hard, isn't it?

520
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:15,433
What?

521
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,867
Being you.

522
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:18,767
I don't mean, like, right now.

523
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,867
I mean, like, every day. Doing what you can do.

524
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,634
I just tried it for, like, 5 minutes,

525
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,067
I thought my head was going to explode.

526
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,634
I used to think it was hard.

527
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:28,334
But I didn't know what "hard" meant.

528
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,533
That's the house.

529
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,533
You know what? I'm really don't feel like doing this.

530
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,067
Can you do it?

531
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:39,417
Me?! I just did the whole hospital-get-a-name-thing.

532
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:39,767
It's your turn.

533
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,583
I understand. I just don't feel like

534
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,400
I can face a grieving parent.

535
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,567
What?

536
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,201
Oh, No.

537
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,368
Remember me?

538
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:07,667
Jim, I know that I asked you to stay away.

539
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:08,834
And you have.

540
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,800
But there's really something I need for you to know.

541
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,500
I'm here.

542
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,400
It's ok.

543
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,134
Caitlin Mahoney died a month ago from anorexia.

544
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:20,567
She lived with her stepfather.

545
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,800
Her heart gave out before he even had the chance

546
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,234
to realize she'd stopped eating.

547
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:27,533
He was devastated. She was all that he had.

548
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:30,666
Anyway, her step-father went back to work right away,

549
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,400
sooner than he should have.

550
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,268
Because he didn't know what else to do.

551
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:35,067
And then something happened at work.

552
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,733
Something that almost destroyed him.

553
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,467
What?

554
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,400
Where did he work?

555
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,134
The Grandview police department.

556
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:53,134
Her step-father is Carl Neely,

557
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,301
The detective who shot you.

558
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,401
Look, I already told you I'm sorry.

559
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:02,100
I don't blame you for hating me.

560
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,567
I just don't want to talk about any of this anymore, all right?

561
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:06,901
I feel bad enough as it is.

562
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,034
I don't hate you.

563
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,333
No one hates you.

564
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,634
I told you that I would bring someone who could help.

565
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,067
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

566
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:16,534
I've been to the department shrinks.

567
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,367
I just want to be left alone.

568
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:19,967
It wasn't your fault, you know.

569
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,234
I shouldn't have been on the job.

570
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:23,401
I shouldn't have trusted myself pulling my weapon.

571
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:25,733
I wasn't ready.

572
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,867
I mean Caitlin.

573
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:30,867
What happened to her. It wasn't your fault.

574
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,534
How'd you know about Caitlin?

575
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:37,234
She blames herself for what happened.

576
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:38,767
She wishes she could take it back.

577
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,367
But none of us can.

578
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,234
None of us can change the things that happen or what we do.

579
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,234
We just have to accept it. Deal with it.

580
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:48,101
And try not to let it kill us.

581
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:49,934
She's been here.

582
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:51,600
Watching over you.

583
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,767
What are you telling to me?

584
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:59,568
What I'm saying is she's seeing what's happening to you.

585
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,334
And it's breaking her heart.

586
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,267
That can't be.

587
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,834
It can't be.

588
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:07,000
It is.

589
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,201
Tell him I that I didn't meant to hurt him.

590
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:15,468
That I was just so stupid, so obsessed.

591
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:18,568
I just couldn't get thin enough.

592
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:21,468
She's so sorry.

593
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,934
She never thought about what it would do to you.

594
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:25,733
I should have seen she was in trouble.

595
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:28,501
I should have helped her.

596
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:31,900
I didn't want to believe that something was wrong with her.

597
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
I hid it from him.

598
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,967
I thought everybody would love me more if I was thin.

599
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:41,267
Thin and beautiful, like in the magazines.

600
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:44,800
She thinks what happened that night...

601
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,434
with you and Jim... was her fault.

602
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,934
Because you were so distracted.

603
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,834
No. No. Not her fault.

604
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:57,334
I shouldn't have been on duty. She has to know that.

605
00:37:57,334 --> 00:38:01,067
I just wanted her back.

606
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,301
I wanted my girl back.

607
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:11,167
He was the one person who never judged me.

608
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,534
I totally took him for granted.

609
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:18,501
She knows that you were always there for her.

610
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,800
Even if she didn't realize it.

611
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,000
Even when she thought you couldn't see her.

612
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,667
But why? Why would she do that to herself?

613
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:37,034
Maybe she was scared.

614
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:40,568
So scared that her whole life

615
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,834
She would never be truly loved.

616
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,634
Not completely.

617
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:46,434
Not for really who she really was.

618
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,934
Maybe now she sees that she was loved in that way.

619
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:57,334
And that it was real.

620
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:02,334
And once you've had that kind of love, it never goes away.

621
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,633
It just gets stronger.

622
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:11,468
And it means that she can move on.

623
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:14,267
And so can you.

624
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:19,134
I'm sorry I hurt you, daddy.

625
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,301
I love you.

626
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:31,267
Caity, I always thought you were perfect inside and out.

627
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,667
I wish you could've seen that.

628
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,501
Me, too.

629
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:43,101
Melinda, tell him.

630
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,600
Jim's here, too.

631
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,301
He doesn't blame you.

632
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,800
She's crossing over now.

633
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:14,767
You coming?

634
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:23,034
Not quite yet.

635
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:47,968
It wasn't your fault either.

636
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:48,968
What?

637
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,567
What happened to me.

638
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,300
It wasn't because of what you can do.

639
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,601
Then why?

640
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,801
I don't know. I don't think we can know.

641
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:00,367
Not yet. Not here.

642
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,467
Then I don't want to know anything.

643
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,167
It would just be much easier.

644
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:08,068
Melinda, I love you.

645
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:09,334
I love you, too.

646
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,300
Now you have to go and do the right thing.

647
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,200
I know.

648
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,600
Jim?

649
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
You ok? Keep it going.

650
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,667
No.

651
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:53,434
Charging.

652
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,534
Ok. Clear back.

653
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:57,967
Clear.

654
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,134
Charging.

655
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:03,434
Clear.

656
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:05,601
Still non-responsive.

657
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:09,000
That's it. We lost him.

658
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:12,701
Let's call it. Time of death...

659
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:23,667
Let's get him ready for transport.

660
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,201
Jim, no!

661
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,634
No!

662
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,502
No!

663
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:37,701
Hey, Patrick, get over here!

664
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:49,534
Hang on there, buddy. Just take it easy. Give us a second.

665
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:52,168
Jim, it's you. You're back.

666
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:55,968
Hold on a second. Take it easy.

667
00:42:57,468 --> 00:42:59,135
Jim...

668
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:02,667
Do I know you?
