1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,800
Previously on ghost whisperer...

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,700
Day of the accident,
I saw jim's ghost step into sam's body.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,700
You're back!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,900
Do I know you?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,800
I see the same guy that you see.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,800
It's not jim. I just know what
I see when I look in those eyes,

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
And jim is in there somewhere.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,700
That's dr. Byrd.
He's dangerous.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,700
Look into the light.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,900
I'll be staying right here,
where you live.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,500
I see ghosts.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,500
All right, if this is
supposed to be funny, it's not.

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,700
If you stop trying, then you're
never going to get back what you lost.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
Your memories, they're not yours.

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,400
- Who am I?
- Jim!

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm not your husband.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,700
You decided you couldn't accept
that your husband is dead,

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,600
And so you filled my head
with his memories.

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,800
I think you should just
get your things and leave.

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,100
- Melinda...
- good-Bye!

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,500
hi, it's melinda.
Talk at the beep.

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,800
Melinda, hi.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm probably the last person
you want to hear from right now,

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,400
But I kind of--

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,400
Well, besides wanting
to hear your voice,

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I need to ask you a favor.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
I think I left something in your garage

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,800
And I didn't want to
just come by, because...

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,700
I don't know if you even want to see me.

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,800
So if you could...

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,900
give me a call, that'd be...

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thanks.

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,700
Is that him again?

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
You know, sam says that
I have to face the facts,

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
And he's right.

36
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,100
He's not jim, and he never will be.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey! Don't say that.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,600
You know, if he were,

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,900
He would have believed me
when I told him the truth.

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,100
But instead, he just kept saying
"I need more proof, I need more time."

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
And when I gave him everything,
Even evidence,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
it was right there in his own head,
He still couldn't.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,300
Look,

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,500
you may never be able
to understand this

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,700
Because you've never
actually had a choice,

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,500
But when you're asked
to let go of everything

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,400
You've ever believed in,
that's not easy.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,700
And you're asking him
to let go of himself,

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,500
The only self he's ever known.

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm not asking him anymore,
Because I'm done.

51
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Mel!

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,500
You can't give up.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
You love him, right?
And he loves you.

54
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,500
He may not be the exact man--

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,900
I don't think I love him anymore.

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,300
What?

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
What do you mean? It's jim!

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,100
In a way.

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, I guess.

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,600
But the jim that I love,

61
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
He had something sam never will,

62
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,800
And I don't know if it's something
I can live without.

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,400
What?

64
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,300
Faith.

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
In me.

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,500
Where are you going?

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,300
To the store.

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
You know, there's some things
I can do before tomorrow.

69
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,900
You're going to the store at this hour?

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah. It's better than going home.

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,500
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,700
I don't know.

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,900
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm calling the police!

75
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
The police are on their way!

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Hey!

77
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
Dr. Byrd!

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,100
What are you doing?

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,600
Who was that?

80
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,400
There's more where he came from.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
How safe do you feel now?

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,100
can you see us?

83
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:52,800
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:05,000
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRS@wdysai</font>

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,000
GHOST WHISPERER S04E18

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Will you two relax?

87
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,000
Ok, I wasn't in any danger.

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,800
Some random guy breaks into the store
And you weren't in any danger?

89
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,200
Ok, he didn't break in,
He came in through the tunnels.

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
And he was led there
by that dr. Byrd guy.

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
How can you be so sure?

92
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,100
Because he was confused.
He didn't know where he was.

93
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
And if byrd led him there,

94
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,600
Then he was probably doing that
persuasive whispering thing.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
You gotta seal up that entrance.

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,200
With concrete and steel.

97
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,500
And throw a little led
in there. And garlic.

98
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
I don't know, whatever else
keeps the evil spirits away.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,500
I can't.

100
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,800
There's just too many
lost souls still in there.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,200
Yeah, but this was a man.

102
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,900
A real, living person.
What did he want?

103
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
And more important, what does byrd want?

104
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
He's ticked!

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
You crossed his favorite
mental patient Into the light.

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,700
You poached his client.

107
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
Did he threaten you?

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,100
Byrd said that there was
more where he came from,

109
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
And did I feel safe now.

110
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,500
See, in danger.

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,100
What is that supposed to mean?

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,700
I don't know. But I do have to
find out who this ben guy is.

113
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,600
Ben?

114
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,200
What, did you exchange business cards?

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000
No, he was wearing a grandview
water and power jumpsuit

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
With the name "ben" on it.

117
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,300
Well, that was very handy.

118
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,000
Actually, it is, because it will
make it easier For eli to find him.

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
No, wait, what? Me?

120
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,800
Look, we have to find out
Why byrd brought this guy here.

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,900
He was one of your colleagues.

122
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
Colleague? The guy's dead.

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Fine, but he still thinks that he's
practicing psychiatry for some reason.

124
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Yeah, but you're not
suggesting I meet with dr. Byrd.

125
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,600
You're suggesting I meet with the tall
lunatic who snuck into your basement.

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
He's not a lunatic.

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,900
He was tall.

128
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,000
ben tillman?

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,100
Yeah. Who are you?

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Eli james.

131
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
You broke into
my friend's store last night.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
You kind of scared the hell out of her.

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
I didn't break in. The door was open.

134
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
That begs the question, what were
you doing there in the first place?

135
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,700
Well, best I can remember,

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,600
I was working in one of the
run-Off drains by the river,

137
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,500
And all of a sudden, these lights Started
flickering on and off in the tunnels.

138
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,500
So you followed them?

139
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Yeah.

140
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,900
I checked the bulbs.

141
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
And then the next thing I knew,
I was in that store.

142
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,100
It's ok if you think I'm nuts.
Most people do, including me,

143
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,700
So if you want to
press charges, go ahead.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,100
It's probably better for
everyone if I was locked up.

145
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm a psychologist.

146
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,900
Maybe I can help.

147
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,700
A shrink. No, thanks.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,300
Tried that already.

149
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,600
Tried everything.

150
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,100
Tried everything for what?

151
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
My memory is whacked.

152
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,800
Stuff I'm supposed to rember, can't.

153
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Stuff I shouldn't remember,
can't help it.

154
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,100
What do you mean,
stuff you shouldn't remember?

155
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Stuff that never could
have happened to me.

156
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,600
At least according to my ex-Wife.

157
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Has it always been like that,
or did something happen?

158
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Yeah, something happened.

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,600
I died.

160
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,900
How?

161
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,700
Well, they tell me
I was at this party 3 years ago,

162
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,300
And the balcony collapsed.

163
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,400
I was technically dead.

164
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,700
But they managed to revive me.

165
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Of course, I don't remember any of it,

166
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,300
Just waking up with absolutely no idea

167
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,100
who I was or how I got there.

168
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
I didn't know my family.

169
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,600
My own face in the mirror.

170
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,400
They should have left me dead.

171
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,700
Why are you so interested?

172
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Because I think I know the reason why
you ended up in my friend's basement.

173
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,400
Listen, this is
going to sound crazy--

174
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,700
Wait a minute,
I don't want any more crazy, ok?

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Now whoever you are,
just leave me alone.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
I don't want your help, ok?

177
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,200
- Ben--
- No, no, leave me alone!

178
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,700
Now I'm sorry I scared your friend, ok?

179
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
But maybe she should be scared.

180
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Maybe you should be scared, too.

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,500
Hey.

182
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Melinda, it's me.

183
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,600
You're not going to believe this.

184
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
Dr. Byrd?

185
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,700
I know that you can hear me,

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
And I know about ben.

187
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
You do?

188
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
He's a step-In, isn't he?

189
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm not familiar with that term.

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,900
It's been quite a few years
since I've practiced.

191
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,600
You know what I'm talking about.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
A ghost that steps into a vacated body.

193
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,900
That's what he is,
that's why he's so confused.

194
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,500
You seem to know quite a lot
about these step-Ins.

195
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,200
You said that there was more.
Did you mean more like ben?

196
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,100
What do you think I mean?

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your patients.

198
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
What do you want from me?

199
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
What I always want--
I want to help.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Well, I don't want your help.

201
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,700
And leave ben alone.

202
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Your husband's just
gonna get worse, you know.

203
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,500
It's a pattern I've seen many times
before, And it never ends well.

204
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,300
Confusion, amnesia, psychosis,

205
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,900
Destructive rage.

206
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,400
I guess you could say it's the price
one pays for cheating death.

207
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Death always wins.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Sam is different. Jim is different.

209
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,900
He's strong, he's remembering.

210
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
That's not what you
told your friend delia.

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,800
What I told her is that
I couldn't help him.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
That doesn't mean that
he can't be helped.

213
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,900
He just needs time.

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,300
Time is the enemy.

215
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,800
Your husband's been a step-In
for what, a month or two?

216
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,600
Ben tillman's been in the
same limbo for 3 years.

217
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,900
I'm sorry to say,
he's on the same path as all the rest.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,200
Those souls attack themselves

219
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Until there's nothing
left to attack but us.

220
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
Then why did you bring ben to me?

221
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,700
I told you-- I want to help.

222
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,300
If you can find a way to save ben,

223
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,600
Then maybe, just maybe,

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
There's a chance
you could save your husband.

225
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,000
Just what I need.

226
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,500
Detective blair says ben has a record.

227
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,700
What did he do?

228
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
2 years ago, he beat the
crap out of a total stranger,

229
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,900
Some random guy walking
into a restaurant.

230
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,300
He's been violent before?

231
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,500
You mean before his brush with death?
No, nothing on record.

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Ok, so then assuming
that dr. Byrd was right

233
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,000
And that his spirit is gone
And someone else's soul is in there,

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,700
Isn't it possible that the spirit
Could have been violent to being with?

235
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,400
You're basically hoping
that some violent psychopath

236
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Took over a good guy's body.

237
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,300
That's something to root for.

238
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,800
Well, it's better than the alternative,

239
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,100
That some good soul
is eating itself alive,

240
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,800
And I'm not gonna have that
be jim's punishment for--

241
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,800
Loving you?

242
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I...

243
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,400
Ok, um, Ever since--

244
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,900
Ever since jim woke up, He's been
having these flashes of memories,

245
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,400
But if he wasn't talking To somebody
like me who could make sense of them...

246
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,700
People think he's losing his mind.

247
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,400
Right. So who did ben wake up to?

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,600
And what did he say that could
give us a clue about who he was?

249
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
Or who he really is.

250
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
So this is your new place?

251
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,200
yeah. Thanks, ned.

252
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,500
Thanks for bringing this.

253
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,300
Sure.

254
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,000
I guess melinda was busy.

255
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,200
How is she?

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Ok, I guess.

257
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,900
She, uh, say anything?

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Um, "could you take this to sam?"

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,800
Yeah.

260
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,100
What's that, like your
journal or something?

261
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,900
You want a drink? Nothing?

262
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,800
No, I'm fine.

263
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
Journal? No, it's, uh,

264
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,500
It's a daily planner. Have a seat.

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,100
You ever seen one of these things?

266
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,700
It's kind of like a paper pda.

267
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Ok.

268
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,400
Here, check that out.

269
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,000
"Shower, shave, brush teeth, stove off,

270
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,600
Burners off, all four."

271
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
Geez, did you really need this?

272
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,700
As it turns out, I didn't,
But serious amnesiacs do, so...

273
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,900
And everyday I would wake up

274
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,700
and I'd wonder what I'd forgotten
From the day before,

275
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,900
so I wrote everything down,
See? Everything.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
I made these huge lists
just to be sure.

277
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,200
Oh. Heh. That's funny. 

278
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,900
what?

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You see that carter?
You see that name carter?

280
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,700
Ever since I started making that list,

281
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,600
That is the one guy
I have no idea who he is.

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,100
I thought you said your
short-Term memory was ok.

283
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,300
It is, it's great.

284
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,100
Carter's not on my phone.
My sister doesn't know who he is.

285
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
He's nobody I work with. Who's carter?

286
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Maybe...

287
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,200
What?

288
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,200
Maybe he's not from, you know,

289
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
That life.

290
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
Right. It's from jim.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,800
There's this bike shop
in town, called carter's.

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
It's small, just for serious cyclists.

293
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,400
And jim, he was way into riding.

294
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Yeah. It's unbelievable.

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,700
- What?
- What,

296
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,800
did melinda put this in my head, too?
Did melinda put carter in my head?

297
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,700
What do you mean?

298
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,400
Look, I know that you
and your mom love melinda,

299
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
And I respect that.

300
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,000
And I also know that
you were very close to jim.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
That has nothing to do with it.

302
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm not a kid.
I don't believe in the tooth fairy.

303
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,100
But I believe in melinda,
And what she believes.

304
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Ned, don't you think
I want to believe in it, too?

305
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,900
You know?

306
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,300
I mean, how great would
that be that you die

307
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,600
And then just step into
someone else's life?

308
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,800
Yeah, I want to believe in that.

309
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,800
Except I can't, ned, Because
it doesn't make any damn sense.

310
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,400
No.

311
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,400
My ex-Husband ben was treated
At providence care clinic.

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,700
How did you come across his case again?

313
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,500
I was researching
a journal on memory loss.

314
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
His neurologist was cited.

315
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Well, if you're looking
for some insight,

316
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm probably the last person
who can help you.

317
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,900
Why is that?

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,800
Because I don't understand
anything that happened.

319
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Losing one's memory completely,

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,100
It's maddening.

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
I watched what it did to him.

322
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,800
I would try and tell him things
About who he was, who we were,

323
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,500
And it was like it didn't stick.

324
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,200
It only confused him more.

325
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
And...

326
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,400
Go on, anne.

327
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,800
It was like he didn't want to remember.

328
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,900
Like he was holding on
to something else.

329
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,500
Some images that...

330
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,900
they never happened.

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,400
What kind of images?

332
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,100
Places he thought we'd been.

333
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,200
Songs he wouldn't have liked.

334
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
And people's names.

335
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
He used to call me clarissa...

336
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,500
When he was half-Asleep
or wasn't thinking.

337
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
Can you imagine...

338
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,100
After 20 years?

339
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,400
So the divorce.

340
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,900
He didn't want to be with me.

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,000
After work, he wouldn't come home.

342
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,100
I'd call him on his cell,

343
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,900
And he'd be sitting
on the same bus bench.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
Night after night.

345
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,800
Like he was waiting for someone.

346
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Maybe he was waiting for her.

347
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Hurry, send the police now!
He is here again.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Oh, my god. Quickly,
I don't see him anymore!

349
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,600
He could be at my door!

350
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,600
He could be--

351
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,800
???

352
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,300
??

353
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,800
???

354
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,400
??

355
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,400
???

356
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,900
??

357
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,900
???

358
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,700
??

359
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,400
???

360
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,300
??

361
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,700
???

362
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,300
??

363
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,200
???

364
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Is he dangerous?

365
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,300
Hey!

366
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,500
Is he dangerous?

367
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
I don't know.

368
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Clarissa. That's her name, isn't it?

369
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,000
I can't tell you that.

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
That would be
a violation of her privacy.

371
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,200
Look, just tell me one thing.
Is she by any chance a widow?

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Oh, come on. I could find out
online in 5 seconds.

373
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Yeah.

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,700
She lost her husband 3 years ago.

375
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,600
And your guy ben tillman's
been hanging around,

376
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
Freaking her out ever since.

377
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Imagine the timing on that.

378
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,100
Yeah, imagine. Hmm.

379
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,000
Thanks.

380
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
Clarissa's husband dies.

381
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Anne tillman's has
a near-Death experience

382
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,300
And comes back a
different man, her words.

383
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,900
Calling her clarissa and
hanging around his old home.

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,900
And get this-- The man
that ben randomly attacked?

385
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
That was clarissa's dead
husband's business partner.

386
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,300
Ok, so then the attack wasn't random.

387
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,900
It was unfinished business of
joseph's that's driving him.

388
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,800
Or it was something that
byrd put into his head.

389
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,800
Yeah, but where did dr. Byrd find him?

390
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,400
I mean, was joseph's spirit
drawn to the tunnels?

391
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
According to his obituary,

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,900
Joseph died of a protracted illness

393
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,400
And was treated at a clinic

394
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,600
that was housed In the same building
as byrd's sanatorium.

395
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,800
So byrd was waiting?

396
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Probably right by his bedside,
Saying "welcome to the afterlife."

397
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Why the bowels of the town again?

398
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,900
Because ghosts don't always
come when they're called.

399
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Why? What does he want?

400
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,300
Aahh! Oh...

401
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
A wild guess? He was
probably trying to scare us.

402
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,300
Or maybe it's because
we have nothing to talk about.

403
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,200
You've done nothing to help joseph.

404
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,700
I thought you wanted to help me.

405
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
But I guess joseph is your patient,

406
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
So of course that's
who you want to help.

407
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Not true. I wanted to
help your husband, too.

408
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,200
Well, then why did you pick joseph?

409
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,700
I mean, there had to have
been others, so why him?

1
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,000
The light held less interest for him.

2
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,900
You know, he was dying. Is that
what helped you get inside his head?

3
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
When his doctors gave up on him,

4
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
I was there offering a cure.

5
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
For death.

6
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
But you didn't tell him
the risks, did you?

7
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,600
There were some things he
wanted to do and I helped him.

8
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Like attacking his old business partner?

9
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,800
You're a doctor. Act like one.

10
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,100
You want results? We need the facts.

11
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,900
His partner was profiting from his death
at work and at home With his wife.

12
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Is that even true?

13
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
What does that matter? It helped him.

14
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,800
To get into ben's body.

15
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,100
Which proved that joseph's
spirit was alive and well,

16
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,600
Even if the combination
proved a little unstable.

17
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,000
It's not perfect, but
it's working better this time.

18
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,500
This time?

19
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Practice makes perfect.

20
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,900
That's what he's doing.

21
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,600
He's practicing,
Until he gets it right.

22
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,500
Those souls-- Joseph, jim,
They're just lab rats to him.

23
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,400
He's using them.

24
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Yeah, because he wants to live again.

25
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,000
it's worrying me that
you're not more worried.

26
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,300
Byrd is not going to step into anyone

27
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
Until he knows that
there's less of a risk.

28
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,300
How do you know that? He's pure evil.

29
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,300
And if pure evil is that bad,

30
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,300
How bad will pure evil be
bring a meat suit?

31
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,200
And what's a meat suit and
what shrink calls somebody pure evil?

32
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
Ok, he's a ghost with issues
that we haven't resolved yet.

33
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
Ok, yeah, and let's list those issues.

34
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,100
Number one, he's evil.
Number two, he's pure evil.

35
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
This is ben's.

36
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Ben? It's melinda, are you home?

37
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,600
Can you clarify for me

38
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,000
Why we're breaking
into someone's apartment

39
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Who did time for beating up a guy?

40
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,800
This is why.

41
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,200
Oh, this guy's got issues.

42
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,300
Wait a minute, we know these names.

43
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,400
They're in joseph's file.
Stanley's the father,

44
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,800
Jessica's the sister, and galveston,
That's where he's from.

45
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
What are you doing here?

46
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
what are we doing here?

47
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,900
what are we doing here?
I don't remember.

48
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,000
We went to see you at work,

49
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And your boss said
that you were a no-Show.

50
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,300
Didn't even call in sick.

51
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,300
Oh, so now you think
you got it figured out?

52
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,300
I flaked out 'cause I'm a nutcase?

53
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,700
No, believe it or not, we're probably
the only two people around here

54
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Who know what's going on in your head.

55
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,000
How's that?

56
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
For starters, we know who stanley is.

57
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,400
And jessica, and we know
why galveston Matters so much.

58
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,800
Would you like us to tell you?

59
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,300
So you're serious?

60
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, I must be crazy,

61
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,400
because that's the first thing that's
made sense to me Since my accident.

62
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,600
So you don't recognize the photo?

63
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,100
Of me? No. No, but
everything else you're saying.

64
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,000
So nothing that I remember
is from ben's life?

65
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Just the memories you've
made over the past 3 years.

66
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,000
And my old life, my real life,

67
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,900
Is where all of this comes from?

68
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,100
"C."

69
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,900
Clarissa. Why are
so many of these in twos?

70
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
I don't know, that's
just how I remember it.

71
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,500
Cc, two "cs."

72
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,600
Clarissa cooper webb.

73
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,900
Her initials. That's gotta
be your nickname for her.

74
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,100
That's it, that's what I called her, cc.

75
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
So that's the woman you were watching

76
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,900
Where you were arrested,
that's your wife,

77
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,100
Living in the house
that you used to live in.

78
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,100
And now she's scared of me.

79
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
My own wife.

80
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,700
How am I gonna make her understand?

81
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,800
Why don't you let us do it?

82
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
We've done it before, and that way,
if there's a bad reaction--

83
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,700
I'll lose her again.

84
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,400
You just have to be patient.

85
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,800
It's a lot for someone
to take in all at once.

86
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Oh, god.

87
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Cc...

88
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Can I help you?

89
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,500
Yeah, um, I found a note to myself

90
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,400
That I was supposed to come
pick up something at your store.

91
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,400
And, uh, I have no idea what it was.

92
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,400
Let me check the order book.

93
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,600
What name? Sam lucas.

94
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,500
Sam lucas...

95
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,900
Nothing here, sorry.

96
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,000
- Yeah.
- Anything else I can do?

97
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
Yeah, actually.

98
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,200
You know, it might have been

99
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
Something that belonged
to a buddy of mine.

100
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Could you check his name?

101
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,500
What name?

102
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Jim clancy.

103
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,700
Jim clancy...

104
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
I remember this guy.

105
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,800
He was so excited about this bike.

106
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah?

107
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,400
It was a touring bike,
titanium, 24 speeds.

108
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,800
Think he was planning on
taking his wife on a trip.

109
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,300
You know, one of these
tours through wine country.

110
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Yeah.

111
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,500
Been ready for weeks.
If you want to pick it up...

112
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,100
No, I should check and see if--

113
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
Ah, don't check with his wife.

114
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Why not?

115
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,400
Well, it's a surprise.
The bike is for her.

116
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,100
She doesn't know anything about it.

117
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,000
Right.

118
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,000
Is this a joke?

119
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,800
Did he put you up to this?
Is he here somewhere?

120
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,300
No, of course not. Ben stayed away.

121
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,000
I asked him to until
I had the chance to talk to you.

122
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,700
Because what, I'd believe this from you?

123
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Who are you?

124
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,500
What is this even about?

125
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,000
You were married to him.

126
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Whether it's possible or not, I mean,

127
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Wouldn't you want the chance to talk
to your husband again if you could?

128
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,800
No. And if this guy were
actually joseph, he'd know.

129
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,500
What do you mean?

130
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,700
Joseph cheated on me.

131
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,300
I told him I was leaving him.

132
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,700
His partner craig Risked their
whole business to tell me the truth.

133
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,900
Which, thank god,
joseph never found out.

134
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,700
Look, in cases like this,

135
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
People sometimes don't
remember all the facts,

136
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,900
But they do remember their feelings.

137
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,400
Based on what I saw,
ben-- Joseph--

138
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Still really loves you.

139
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,600
So...what?

140
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,400
Some sad, creepy sewer worker
Thinks he's my husband?

141
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm supposed to think that's romantic?

142
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
Look, I know that it's
really hard to under--

143
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,500
I need to go check something.

144
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,500
No, cc!

145
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,700
Sorry.

146
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Why did I even...
I should have stayed dead!

147
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, god.

148
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,800
What the hell am I?

149
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,300
I'm just a ghost of
my own worthless life!

150
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Ben?

151
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,600
you don't have much time.

152
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Time for what?

153
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,600
So that you can step into a
body and go live life again?

154
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,500
You're angry with me.

155
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,700
Yeah, you picked up on that?

156
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,900
I don't expect you to
understand what I did or why.

157
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,100
Believe me, I'm beginning
to wonder about it myself.

158
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,600
But ben is in trouble,
and if someone doesn't help him,

159
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,800
He's going to die again.

160
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,900
Well, where is he?!

161
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Ben!

162
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Ben?

163
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Ben!

164
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,700
He's in there.

165
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,000
I think he wants to hurt himself.

166
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
Ben, can you hear me?

167
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,400
Ben!

168
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,300
Ben! Ben, can you hear me? Ben?!

169
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,300
Melinda!

170
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Ben!

171
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Will you please just go
make sure that he's all right?

172
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,500
Keep going, ben, you're almost safe.

173
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Ben!

174
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,600
He's ok, but you should leave.

175
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
How do I know that
you're not lying to me?

176
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
How do I know that you're not
just going to step into him

177
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,100
- The second that he dies?
- You don't,

178
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,900
but you should leave!

179
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,200
Run!

180
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm so sorry. I never
intended for any of this--

181
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,700
Just please go and tell eli where I am!

182
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,500
I wanted to understand.
I thought I could help people--

183
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,700
Just go!

184
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,200
Please!

185
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Eli. Look, I need to talk to you.

186
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,800
Now is not a good time.

187
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,900
I know you're friends with melinda
And you're probably mad at me, but--

188
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
I said not now!

189
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,800
You can get to her
through a utility vault.

190
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,100
There's a manhole cover
up here ahead on the right.

191
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,100
Eli, what's with the crowbar?
What's with the tools?

192
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,100
Why can't we get to
melinda from above ground?

193
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
The utility vault must have
led to the street before,

194
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
But it's been sealed off.

195
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
What, melinda-- What's wrong
with melinda? What's going on?

196
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,700
She's trapped underground.
The water is rising.

197
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,600
What? What water?
What are you talking about?

198
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,500
Who are you talking to?

199
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Are you sure you're ready to hear this?

200
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Eli!

201
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,900
A ghost told you this?

202
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,700
One you don't even
trust in the first place?

203
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,100
He's making sense, and
I'm not taking any chances.

204
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,900
This is where ben came up when he
heard melinda's voice calling for him,

205
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,200
But if the water's rising
as fast as byrd says it is--

206
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Byrd, the ghost, that's right.

207
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
Ben won't be back in time!

208
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,800
Eli, you know how this sounds!

209
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,200
Reincarnated guys breaking water mains,
ghosts sending messages!

210
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,100
What's wrong?

211
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
I'm afraid I won't get to her.

212
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
I can't really swim.

213
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,400
What?!

214
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,000
Then what are you doing?!

215
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,900
Same thing she'd do for me.

216
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,300
You don't even know
if she's down there.

217
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,900
You're risking your life for nothing!

218
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,200
For nothing?! Is that
what you think of her?

219
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Is that how afraid
you are to take a chance?

220
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,100
Stop. Stop!

221
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,100
You're right.

222
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,000
You're right, eli.

223
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,600
And I can swim.
Give me this.

224
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Where is she?

225
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,500
Ok, byrd says you go down through
the door here at the bottom,

226
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,000
And you swim maybe 90 feet.

227
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,200
She's in a utility vault,
just like this one, ok?

228
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
These tools are to break
through a locked grate.

229
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
90 feet.

230
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,900
And you know all this from a ghost?

231
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,000
That's enough for you?

232
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,900
Sometimes you just have
to take a leap of faith.

233
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,500
Ok.

234
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh, my god!

235
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,300
Sam! Sam!

236
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,900
Sam!

237
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,900
Sam!

238
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Sam!

239
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,500
Melinda, you're safe.

240
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
You-- You came for me!

241
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,500
Of course I did.

242
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Where are we?

243
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,600
They must have shut off the water,
it stopped rising.

244
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,800
Oh!

245
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Melinda...

246
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,400
What's going on?

247
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,500
It's ok, sam, you're just confused.

248
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,800
You're gonna be all right
As soon as I can get us out of here.

249
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,600
Why do you keep calling me sam?

250
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,700
You don't remember.
It's the amnesia, it's ok.

251
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,700
Honey, what amnesia?

252
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,600
What are you talking about?

253
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,200
Then what do you want me to call you?

254
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Well, you can call me by my name.

255
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,900
Just call me jim.

256
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,400
What?

257
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,800
Just call me jim, mel, it's my name.

258
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Jim!

259
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Oh, my god!

260
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Oh, my god, you're back!

261
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh!

262
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,500
You're back!

263
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,900
- Hi.
- Hi!

264
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,000
Shh. Hi, hi!

265
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,700
You all right?

266
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,400
Great.

267
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,900
All right, let's get out of here.

268
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,100
Ok.

269
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,700
You must be freezing.

270
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,400
Sit.

271
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,300
Ok? And just--

272
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I need you to stay here
For just a few minutes.

273
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,000
All right?

274
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
So cover up.

275
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,200
Don't move. Don't talk to anyone.

276
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,500
Don't call anyone. Don't...

277
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,200
What's going on, mel?

278
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,600
Uh, nothing. Just trust me,
everything's fine.

279
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Is it a ghost thing?

280
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah.

281
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,400
Yeah, you know how weird that can be.

282
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,700
Well, I'm here. I'm a statue.

283
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
I love you.

284
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,800
God, I love you so much.

285
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Me, too.

286
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, I feel horrible.

287
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,400
I mean...

288
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,500
god, what you went through...

289
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,700
It's ok.

290
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,300
And you tried to get help.

291
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,700
No.

292
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,000
I tried to get even.

293
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,200
That's how this started.

294
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
I wanted revenge on my partner.

295
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,400
But that was in another life.

296
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,300
In this life, you helped
make a miracle happen.

297
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,500
Thank you.

298
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,800
It's ok.

299
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,700
No, I mean for what you did.

300
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,000
You made sense in my life,

301
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
And, uh,

302
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
it's not the life that I left behind Or

303
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,500
even what I might have chosen.

304
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
This is my second chance,

305
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,600
And I'm gonna do better with
this than I did the first.

306
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Thank you.

307
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

308
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
What about you?

309
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,800
Seen any lights?

310
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,800
Same ones I've been seeing
Off and on since the day I died.

311
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,100
Does the light really look that bad?

312
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
The truth?

313
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
It looked good.

314
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,500
Looked too good.

315
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,200
I'm scared.

316
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,200
Why?

317
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,700
The emotion inside of it.

318
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,300
Everything I'd ever learned

319
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,100
Taught me that emotion like that
Need to be managed.

320
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,500
Feared, even.

321
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,800
What emotion? Can you describe it?

322
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,900
Do you really have to ask?

323
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,500
Love.

324
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,900
The kind that makes
a man risk everything,

325
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,600
Over and over again

326
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,000
For no sensible reason.

327
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
The kind that makes sensible reasons...

328
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,500
And even death itself

329
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,500
Mean nothing.

330
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Were you afraid that it
would make you mean nothing?

331
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,300
I was just afraid.

332
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,300
And now?

333
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,700
ok.

334
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,200
Ok.

335
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,300
- Mel, I gotta call sully.
- ???

336
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,500
He's gonna be worried
that I haven't checked in.

337
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,900
Trust me, sully's not worried about you.

338
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,500
Why have you made me keep
my eyes closed this entire time--

339
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,700
Because it's a surprise.

340
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,200
- A big surprise.
- All right?

341
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,500
Ok.

342
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Ok.

343
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
- You ready?
- Yep.

344
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Here it goes.

345
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,200
All right, just... right there.

346
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
- Ok.
- Ok?

347
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,300
Do you promise to keep an open mind?

348
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,000
I promise.

349
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,900
I mean we're all born
and reborn out of water.

350
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,900
You know, baptized, as it were,
From the unconscious depths. It's--

351
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What do you think happened?

352
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,900
How did he suddenly get
all his memories back?

353
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Well, generally, you know,

354
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
healthy psyches Can accommodate
more than one Functioning ego at a time,

355
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,800
and if one of those egos Perishes,

356
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,200
then another one may
come in and take its place, and--

357
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
So in other words,
you don't have a clue.

358
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,300
None at all.

359
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,100
It's pretty quiet in there.
You think she's shown him yet?

360
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,800
What...

361
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,200
What the...

362
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,900
This is my face now?

363
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,500
How did I...

364
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,700
You did it for us.

365
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,500
For me.

366
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,100
And I begged you not to do it,
But you wouldn't listen.

367
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,900
I must have been out of my mind.

368
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,700
Yeah.

369
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,800
I thought so, too, Like,
kind of one of your worst ideas ever.

370
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,200
Until today.

371
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,600
You still look the same.

372
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,100
That makes me the lucky one.

373
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,200
No, we both are.

374
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,700
Oh, my god!

375
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:18,700
