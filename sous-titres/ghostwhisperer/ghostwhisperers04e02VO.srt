1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Lucas! Come on. It's me. Open up.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,400
Look. I am sorry i am late,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,700
But i couldn't get away.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,000
Are you there?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,900
Hey. Hey.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,400
Are you looking for lucas?

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
Uh,no. I'll just come back.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
Well,he should be here.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,500
His car's parked in his space and mine.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Could you tell him that those parallel white lines

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,800
Actually serve a purpose?

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
I had to park on the street again.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Lucas!

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,100
Lucas

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,900
Somebody help!

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,300
I don't know. I just saw him lying by his car.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,900
So tell me again what happened,ma'am.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,300
Hello?

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,400
Yes. This is melinda gordon.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,200
Sure i remember you.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,700
Lucas? I'm so sorry.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Um,yeah,ok.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,400
Thanks.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
Ok. Weird.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,300
What was that?

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Well,this guy from my high school,

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,800
Lucas marston, he died.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
I never heard you talk about him.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,400
Was he a good friend? No.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Not at all.

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,100
So why did i just get invited to his funeral?

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,300
Grace: there's haylie.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,700
Haylie,hi.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,200
Guest of honor here yet?

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
I don't see him,but i've seen a couple people

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,700
Checking me out just in case i did.

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Honey,i think they were just checking you out.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,800
I've literally heard,like,5 guys say how beautiful you were.

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,700
Yeah. Meaning how much i've changed,

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,400
But one thing has not.

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,900
Hey. I think they probably included you

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,400
Because they remembered you and maybe they liked you.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,700
I was the kid who was caught talking

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,900
To dead people,ok?

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
They called me a freak,a mental case,

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
And my personal favorite - Meloony gordon.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
Catchy,i know, but not at the time.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,500
All right. So it was a drag,

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,700
But then why are we here?

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Well,because lucas always seemed like a nice guy

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,500
And grace,too, but then again,

52
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Maybe they were so into each other,

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,800
They were too busy to be mean.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,900
Which one's grace?

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,000
Uh,pretty blond. The one that got

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,500
Icy reception from haylie.

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
They used to be friends.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,300
Haylie,you know, she was lucas'

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,300
On-And-Off-Again girlfriend.

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
I thought you said you didn't know these people.

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh,i knew of them. Everyone did.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
You know,they were a power clique,

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,900
Superbeautiful and all best friends.

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,000
Go. Let's go.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Grace: i'll be right back.

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,100
Oh. Looks like grace is with ryan now.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
Him i know.

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Really? How do you know him?

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,100
He's a surgical resident at grandview hospital.

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
That is so disappointing

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
When the person who's voted most likely to succeed actually does.

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,700
Um... guess i was right

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,500
About why i was asked here.

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Melinda.

75
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,800
Grace,hi.

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,000
Uh,you met my husband jim,right?

77
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,800
Yes,hi. And actually, i have a favor to ask hi.

78
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,200
That i hope you won't mind,

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,700
But,um,if you're going back to grandview,

80
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
Would you mind riding with me?

81
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,100
Grace: the reason i called you was,

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,300
You remember in high school

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,600
How you said you could see ghosts?

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,100
I never said that.

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,900
Not if i could help it, and i still don't.

86
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,200
But do you believe that you can,um,see them,the dead?

87
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,100
Have you seen lucas?

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,400
No.

89
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,600
So what is it like when someone is haunting you?

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,900
I mean,are they around all the time,

91
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,300
Or do they just kind of come and go?

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,000
I mean,what can they do to someone?

93
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,800
You mean,to you.

94
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Look. I-I found him,

95
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,500
And there was blood, not just on lucas

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
From where he'd collapsed

97
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,800
But streaked across his car window.

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,700
I know it sounds crazy.

99
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm so nervous.

100
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Grace?

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,700
Ahh. Oh-Oh,god. Oh,god.

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,900
That is disgusting.

103
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,700
Are you all right?

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,900
Melinda, the medical examiner

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,100
Said that when they found lucas

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
He had been dead for hours,

107
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,700
But i saw that blood appear,

108
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,900
And ever since i saw it,

109
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,200
I've felt something around me.

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,500
I can't describe it.

111
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm not sure you have to.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,400
Because-Because you know the feeling?

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah. Pretty well.

114
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,800
Child,whispering: can you see us?

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000

???  ?4??2?</Font>

117
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,560
Eli: wait. So the ghost smeared its own blood

118
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,580
For grace to see?

119
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,860
Melinda: well,yeah,eli.

120
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,800
I mean,you've seen them move objects around.

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,800
It's pretty much the same principle.

122
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,000
The on the way home hurled itself against the windshield?

123
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
Ghosts can sometimes act out.

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey. If i'm gonna hear ghosts,

125
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,800
I might as well get the whole picture.

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
You know what? That surprises me

127
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Because most people in your position,they just-

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
You mean,who died and come back with bonus features?

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,700
You know that many of us?

130
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Melinda,i've written books upon books on subjects

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,600
About a thousandth as cool as what's going on in my skull right now.

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,700
I mean, don't get me wrong.

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,300
This whole ghost thing,

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,200
It's kind of creepy at times,

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,600
But this,this psycho paranormal whatever

136
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,100
Is a trip.

137
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,300
Glad to hear it.

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,500
How can i help?

139
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,800
Well,anytime that a ghost comes to you-

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
No. I mean,you.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Loop me in.

142
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,200
How else am i gonna learn?

143
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,400
Can i use your computer?

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,200
Eli: who knew hamilton high was

145
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
A feeder school for the ivies?

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,500
After yale, mr. Lucas marston worked

147
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,300
In the skiing industry.

148
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,700
He was a lift attendant.

149
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
He dabbled in real estate development.

150
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,800
His dad owns an apartment building.

151
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,000
I overheard someone at the wake saying

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
That he was the handyman.

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,000
So if you know so much about the ghost,

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Why are we bothering with the obituary spin?

155
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,600
Well,because lucas' background is just a starting place.

156
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900
I mean,the truth is,i didn't get a good look at the ghost.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,300
That alone can tell you something.

158
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,300
Chockfull of antioxidants.

159
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,600
No,thanks.

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
So you think the ghost

161
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
Miss popular mowed down the night of her friend's wake

162
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
Was somebody random?

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,000
No. There's always a connection,

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
But if the ghost that i saw on the road

165
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,200
Was lucas,why wasn't he at his own funeral?

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Soaking up the kind words.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,300
Yeah. Something like that.

168
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
Maybe the words people said under their breaths

169
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,000
Weren't so kind.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Call me crazy,but when a perfectly healthy,bright,

171
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,900
But underachieving 29-Year-Old suddenly keels over,

172
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
I smell...

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
Drugs.

174
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,700
I haven't seen the result of the tox report,

175
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
But they're saying it was an overdose.

176
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Grace,don't do this.

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,900
We don't have anything to feel guilty about.

178
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,600
We know what we did.

179
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
I have to scrub up, but we'll talk.

180
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,600
No,we won't, not about this.

181
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,700
More light,please.

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,200
Would somebody get that out of my eyes,please?

183
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,400
Are you ok, dr. Hellar?

184
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,500
Yeah.

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
Then why don't you close up?

186
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,500
Right.

187
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,700
All right. Stitch and dress.

188
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Ok.

189
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,900
We're good here.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Nice work,everybody.

191
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,000
Whoa,whoa. What the hell?

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,200
The wound's closed. Where's this blood coming from?

193
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,400
Whoa! Oh,my god!

194
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,000
No. What's going on?

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,900
I'll get dr. Dugan.

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Aah!

197
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll take over.

198
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,500
Jim,voice-Over: ryan comes tearing out of there.

199
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,800
The nurse i spoke to said there was blood everywhere.

200
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,400
What happened? I don't know,

201
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
But when the surgeon comes back,

202
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,500
No more blood, patient is fine.

203
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
The blood has to mean something.

204
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,500
Thanks. And why don't you not go to work right now?

205
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
As much as i love playing hooky with you,

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,100
I have to go.

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Oh. You forgot one of your tear sheets.

208
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,200
Wait a minute. We're putting a 6-Burner stove

209
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,100
In the nursery?

210
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
It's for the garage.

211
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,700
I was thinking that we could convert it

212
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Into a guest house, you know,

213
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,000
For a live-In sitter or for our mothers.

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
I mean,it's a good idea,

215
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,700
But,uh,i mean, converting the garage now.

216
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,000
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,100
Because i'm not getting pregnant?

218
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,600
Hey. No,no. Because when you do,

219
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,900
We'll still have 9 months.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,300
I mean,let me run the numbers a little bit,

221
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
Think about it,ok?

222
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,700
Ok. Sure.

223
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,200
Ryan: lucas' death,well, it freaked us both out,

224
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
I have to be honest,

225
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
But what happened at the hospital-

226
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,100
I think it was a ghost.

227
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,900
Did you feel anything strange,

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,100
A chill you couldn't explain,

229
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,400
After lucas died?

230
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,900
Ghosts. We're talking ghosts now with-

231
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,100
Ryan,i asked melinda for her help.

232
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,900
Look. A suture must have ruptured.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,100
I made a mistake,ok? It happens.

234
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
I've been stressed.

235
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,500
I work crazy hours,

236
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,300
And my best friend from high school just died.

237
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,900
So you and lucas were still close?

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,100
We were fine.

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,300
I am happy to finish my coffee

240
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,100
And go back to my life

241
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,400
Because i am not afraid of the d dead,

242
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,700
But you came to me,and an innocent person lost a lot of blood

243
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Because you have something you need to resolve

244
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
With either lucas or someone else.

245
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Who else would it be then?

246
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,400
I haven't seen the ghost, so i don't know who it is,

247
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,100
But when a ghost doesn't reveal themselves,

248
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,300
It's for a reason.

249
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,000
Either they're hiding something,

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,300
Or they have a project in mind,

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Like torturing you.

252
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,500
Why don't you try to not say that

253
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,400
Like you enjoy it?

254
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't,

255
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,000
And i don't like seeing souls linger,

256
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,800
But that's what they do when they're

257
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,100
Trying to finish something.

258
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Well,you're casting an awfully wide net there.

259
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
I don't know what lucas did for the last 10 years

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,300
When he was supposed to be building a career,a life.

261
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,100
You want to know? Ask haylie.

262
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,300
She waited around long enough for him to get his act together.

263
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,600
All i know is that he o.D.Ed at 29,

264
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,000
So if you want to know what he didn't finish,

265
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,000
Why don't you try everything?

266
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
And he's got no one to blame but himself.

267
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh,my god!

268
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
You're bleeding.

269
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
Ryan.

270
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
I need another napkin.

271
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,700
What was that?

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500
You found him. You were there when the police came.

273
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Are they sure his body wasn't moved?

274
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
What are you talking about?

275
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Grace,let's go. Come on.

276
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,200
I've had enough.

277
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Ok.

278
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,100
We don't need your particular brand of help,ok?

279
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,500
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

280
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,500
Ah. Hamilton high, 1998-

281
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Big hair and big dreams.

282
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Oh,wait. That's not you!

283
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,500
No,it's not,but will show you lucas.

284
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,800
The guy who died? He's so cute.

285
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah. Died or was murdered by his friend.

286
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,200
I saw it in a vision,

287
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
But i only got a piece of the story.

288
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Ich is not exactly the story ryan's telling?

289
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,400
No. He seems pretty keen

290
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,900
On blaming lucas for his own death.

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,300
He said he was a real screw-Up

292
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,400
And that if i doubted him

293
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,300
I could talk to haylie.

294
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Well,color me doubtful.

295
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Hmm. My favorite color.

296
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
Ha ha ha!

297
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,300
Are you calling haylie?

298
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,300
Are you kidding? The girl was so perfect in high school,

299
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
There's not crack in her demeanor.

300
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,400
She would never open up to me.

301
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Come on. You are not still afraid

302
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Of the popular girl?

303
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,400
Hardly.

304
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,900
Besides,eli is a very experienced grief counselor,

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,800
And he wants to learn,so let him melt the ice queen.

306
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,400
I spent a third of my life as lucas' girlfriend,

307
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Give or take our many breakups,

308
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,200
And even in death, who does he go to? Grace.

309
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,400
Look,haylie. It isn't just grace.

310
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,100
Lucas is haunting ryan,too.

311
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
Were they rivals?

312
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,100
Lucas and grace, i mean,they were

313
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,700
Closer to each other than to anybody

314
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,900
They were actually sleeping with.

315
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,500
Come on. Ryan know this?

316
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Well,i'm sure. They never hid it.

317
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,400
They'd be on the phone for two hours at a stretch.

318
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,900
There was something unhealthy about it.

319
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
That wasn't exactly helping his battle with drugs.

320
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,400
He took antianxiety medication,

321
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
But i never saw him take anything else.

322
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I've treated a lot of addicts.

323
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,300
They're very secretive.

324
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,200
He wasn't always.

325
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,500
It wasn't always so hard for him to be happy.

326
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,200
You make it seem like something happened.

327
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
What was it?

328
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
I wish i knew.

329
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,300
I think that ryan and grace do

330
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,900
Because senior year, the 3 of them,

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,900
They went to look at some colleges.

332
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,400
They were gone for 4 days,

333
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,700
And when they came back, lucas was never the same.

334
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,800
Melinda: haylie gave you her keys to lucas' apartment?

335
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,200
You're a quick study.

336
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,700
What can i say? People trust me.

337
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,300
I'm a professional.

338
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
It sounds like to me that lucas

339
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,400
Was still in love with grace and ryan knew it.

340
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,900
I'm not sure this was about grace.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,200
It seems like lucas was more haunted than haunting.

342
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,900
So the question is,who or what was haunting him,

343
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,300
And is it the same spirit that's haunting ryan and grace?

344
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,000
Shouldn't we be,like,wearing latex gloves,carrying flashlights?

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,300
Knock yourself out.

346
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,500
No need. These will do the trick.

347
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Benzodiazepine-

348
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,200
A little dose will help you get some sleep.

349
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,600
A larger dose will help you with anxiety.

350
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,900
Supersizing can kill you.

351
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,600
Whoa. Oh.

352
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
What is it?

353
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,900
Looks like family, maybe a sister or niece.

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,100
Lucas was an only child.

355
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,700
Grace: oh,my god,lucas. Oh, my god,oh,my god,oh,my god!

356
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,900
Grace,grace, shut up!

357
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh,my god! What are we gonna do?

358
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,600
What? What is it?

359
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,400
The 3 of them...

360
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,700
They killed a man.

361
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,500
That's it then.

362
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,700
The ghost was telling you he was murdered,not lucas.

363
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,200
He didn't tell me anything.

364
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,600
I got a vision from his picture,

365
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,200
But i still don't know who he is,

366
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,400
And if he wants me to know the truth,

367
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Then why isn't he coming to me?

368
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,700
Maybe he wants you to come to him.

369
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
For someone who's gift is in their ears,

370
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,300
You're not a very good listener.

371
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Eli?

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This wasn't just for pictures.

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
The victim kept i.D. In here,too,

374
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,800
Which i'm sure lucas trashed

375
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
In case anyone found it.

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,100
There was something in this sleeve for a very long time.

377
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,300
Haylie said something about a road trip fall of your senior year.

378
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
She mentioned something happened

379
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,600
And oktoberfest in cambridge.

380
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Well,that gives us a definite weekend.

381
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,000
That,a partial name and address,

382
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
And it sure looked like he had a child with someone.

383
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,800
His widow. That's my next step.

384
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,900
What if i took that step for you?

385
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,700
I think i'm up to it if you think it could help.

386
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,800
Yes. That would help a lot.

387
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
Ok. Ok.

388
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,700
Hey. No,no,no. No. It's not even 3:00.

389
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,100
No. Oh,look. I got to go cover for sully.

390
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,900
I really got to go,and i'm gonna be late,so don't wait up.

391
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,300
Hey. What's wrong?

392
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,900
Well,i just kind of thought we could-

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
I mean,if we're gonna get pregnant,you know,

394
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
We have to...

395
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
Have sex!

396
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,100
We got that covered,right?

397
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,400
Today. It's just i've been tracking my cycle,

398
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And there's this window,

399
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,400
And it's basically closing tonight.

400
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,300
Right,and that's - That's why you've been playing hooky from work.

401
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,500
Well,it's not the only reason,

402
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,200
But we did agree that we would try,so...

403
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,800
You're right. We did,we did,

404
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,200
But,i mean,honey,do we have to schedule our sex life,you know,

405
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
Or convert a garage to have kids?

406
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,500
It's just so much pressure.

407
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,300
You're right. You're right.

408
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,100
Hey. I want you, i always want you,

409
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
But it's just we got so many stresses in our life.

410
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,700
Let's not make this another one,all right?

411
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
Yeah. Can i help you? Mom?

412
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,300
Hi. My name is eli james. I'm sorry i didn't call before i came over.

413
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah?

414
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,300
I'm sorry. I just- I'm here because-

415
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,900
Male ghost: that's right. You've seen her.

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
That girl grew up without a father.

417
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
Ahh,ahh.

418
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,700
Because?

419
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,300
Tell her you have something of theirs.

420
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm sorry. Tell her.

421
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Tell her now.

422
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,900
I'm just- Ok.

423
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
No,no. I have something of yours.

424
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,000
I mean,i have something of your husband's.

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Uh,honey,can you go check on the dinner?

426
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,500
Yeah,yeah.

427
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,900
I'll be out back.

428
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,300
I don't understand.

429
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,300
You said these photos of my husband were

430
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,900
In your friend's apartment?

431
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
How-How could that be?

432
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,900
I was hoping you could tell me.

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
Well,i don't know any lucas,

434
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
And tim's wallet was with his body.

435
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
This was all that was missing.

436
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,700
Didn't you find that strange?

437
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Mister,i had a toddler and dead husband.

438
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
Worrying about a few photos wasn't

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
At the top of my list.

440
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
I'm sorry.

441
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,700
I am,too.

442
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,900
Sorry he died out on that road alone,pitch black,

443
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,300
Rain pouring down.

444
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
The coroner said that he'd severed an artery

445
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,200
So it was probably fast,

446
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,400
But define fast,you know,if you're tim.

447
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,800
What did they tell you about the accident?

448
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,000
Just that. It was an accident.

449
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,500
There were no other skid marks

450
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
From another vehicle,

451
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
The road was slick.

452
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,400
He just wiped out.

453
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,510
Who found him.

454
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,010
A little lady drived her little husbhud to work.

455
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
What wouldn'ldgive e them.

456
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,900
Girl: are you ok,mom?

457
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,500
Hi,honey. It's ok.

458
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Ok.

459
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,200
So how did your friend

460
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,900
Get these from my husband unless-

461
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,400
Unless hew as there when he died.

462
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,900
You said you didn't know lucas.

463
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,700
Do you know these people?

464
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,900
They'd be older now.

465
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
No.

466
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
Hold on. Him. Him i know.

467
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,400
Him? That's lucas.

468
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,200
No. He said his name was mark.

469
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,300
You met him? When?

470
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
He came by the house a few months

471
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
After my husband's death,

472
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,400
Said he worked with tim once

473
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
And that he owed him some money.

474
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,700
Seemed like he didn't have much,

475
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,500
But he sent what he could over the years.

476
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,800
Wait. Over the years?

477
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,700
Every once in a while, i'd get a cashier's check

478
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,500
For 50 bucks, a few hundred.

479
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Well,i cashed them.

480
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,400
I thought he was a buddy, you know,took pity on us,

481
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,300
And frankly,we needed the money,so...

482
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,700
I never realized that it was,um,sort of...

483
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Male ghost: blood money.

484
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,200
Eli: you should have heard it.

485
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
This guy sounded so bitter,

486
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
Like a big hunk of bitterness

487
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,000
In the front row seating in my frontal lobe.

488
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah,but it sounds like lucas was haunted for years,

489
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,100
But why not grace and ryan?

490
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
I mean,they were there,too.

491
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,900
Who says they weren't haunted this whole time?

492
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,600
Maybe they just dealt with it better.

493
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,000
No. It was new for grace.

494
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,200
She was scared. She kept asking what a ghost could do.

495
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,100
Because she thinks it killed her friend,

496
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,800
And she just realized...

497
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,500
They're next.

498
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,500
Grace: can't you just drive me back to the city tonight?

499
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,300
Lucas' sendoff is tomorrow

500
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,500
The people that couldn't make the funeral

501
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,500
Are flying in.

502
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,100
"His sendoff." I hate that phrase.

503
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,400
You said "memorial" sounded geriatric.

504
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,300
Is there anything i can say right now

505
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,500
That won't piss you off?

506
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
You could tell the truth.

507
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Yeah. We all could have,but we didn't.

508
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,600
We made a choice to get on with our lives.

509
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,600
Don't you feel it?

510
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,600
He is with us!

511
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,100
He was with lucas all the time.

512
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,300
Grace,the man died 10 years ago,ok?

513
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,300
It's ridiculous. Crazy people believe in ghosts.

514
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
Ryan.

515
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,600
No!

516
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,830
They brought them in about an hour ago,

517
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,270
And ryan was pretty banged up,

518
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,820
And they're giving him a full body scan,

519
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,160
But he was lucky.

520
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,770
Grace had some contusions, but his side took

521
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,190
The brunt of the roll.

522
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,290
How did she seem?

523
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,390
I didn't talk to her,

524
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,570
But they said she was really shaken up.

525
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,870
Grace.

526
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,440
Please. Make him stop.

527
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,400
So i was just kicking and screaming,

528
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,180
And this policeman took his hand,

529
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,200
And he just dragged it along the windshield

530
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,540
Just to show me that it was just mud. It was mud.

531
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,080
Do you know what i thought it was?

532
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,140
Blood?

533
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,260
Yes.

534
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,390
I've seen it,too.

535
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,410
I know about the guy who died 10 years ago.

536
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,210
So it was him all along?

537
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,800
How did he die?

538
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,100
We took a road trip. I don't know.

539
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,160
I mean,we were just going to see some colleges...

540
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,940
So we're at this party,right?

541
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,800
And ryan knew this guy up in binghamton,

542
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,300
And he invited us to a frat party,

543
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,270
And we should have just stayed there,

544
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,900
But we promised our parents that we would head home.

545
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,080
And lucas was supposed to be the designated driver,

546
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,410
But he ended up just being the least drunk,

547
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,540
And that was not like him.

548
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,500
He was always so responsible.

549
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,300
He was a really good guy.

550
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
And he was driving superslow when this guy

551
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,600
On a motorcycle just came up behind us.

552
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,100
This guy's practically on our fender

553
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
What's he doing?

554
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Grace: he wants you to speed up.

555
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,760
But the road, it just-It curved,

556
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,400
And it was so foggy, and i guess that the guy

557
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,490
Just got stuck and it pissed him off,

558
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,550
And that's when he decided to try to take us on.

559
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,870
You ok,lucas? Yeah,sure.

560
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,970
Slow down,slow down. Slow way down.

561
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,070
Just teach him a lesson.

562
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,600
[Horn honking[

563
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,950
Well,come on! What,you want to join our party?

564
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,500
Ryan! Ryan!

565
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,400
Whoa,whoa,whoa! Did you see that?

566
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,300
Oh,my god!

567
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
You got to stay in the car.

568
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,600
Please.

569
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,700
He must have been thrown.

570
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,800
Here we go.

571
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,900
Come on!

572
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,600
Come on!

573
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Ryan.

574
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,900
Come on.

575
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,300
Oh,my god! Oh,my god!

576
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
His leg is half off.

577
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,200
Oh,my god! Grace,grace,shut up.

578
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,800
What are we going to do?

579
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,100
There's nothing we can do.

580
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
A phone. A phone. We'll call 911.

581
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
He's dead, and you're drunk,

582
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,800
And we're all drunk.

583
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,300
I'm not drunk.

584
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
Tell that to a breathalyzer.

585
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
Ryan,what are you saying?

586
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
I'm saying this never happened.

587
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,700
We didn't hit him. There's no evidence.

588
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,300
It's his own fault!

589
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,500
Ok,ok. So we'll tell the cops that.

590
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
Listen. You want your life ending

591
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
On this road tonight,too?

592
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,000
What we did, it haunted lucas.

593
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,800
And you.

594
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,100
You said you felt it, an angry presence.

595
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Yes. Ever since lucas died.

596
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,200
But not before? No.

597
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,700
Not that i don't think about it all the time.

598
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,900
The blood.

599
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There was so much blood.

600
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,300
I cannot stand the sight of it.

601
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,700
Your fear of blood,

602
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Did you ever talk to lucas about it?

603
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,100
Yeah. He was the only one i could talk to.

604
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Lucas?

605
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,700
You can skip the blood and tell me what you want.

606
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,500
I know it's you.

607
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,400
I never said i was anyone else.

608
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,100
No. I guess you didn't have to.

609
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,500
You just let their guilt do the work.

610
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Ryan's guilt has a ways to go.

611
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,000
He'd do anything to cover this up.

612
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,400
Let me help you.

613
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,500
We could talk to them together.

614
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,400
They wouldn't listen to me when i was alive.

615
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,700
Why would they listen to me now?

616
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
You could have told the truth at any time.

617
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,000
No one was stopping you.

618
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
No. You're wrong.

619
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,500
For years,all it took was one word - Grace.

620
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,700
What's this gonna do to her?

621
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
I mean,i know you still love her.

622
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,800
You think i don't know how often you two see each other,

623
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
How often you talk?

624
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
Leave her out of this.

625
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,500
Look. If you do this,you're not just taking me down with you.

626
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
Grace was there,too.

627
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,900
I didn't come asking for permission this time.

628
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,400
I didn't back down. I made my decision.

629
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,800
How do you think that went over?

630
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,100
Why don't you tell me?

631
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,800
The one night that ruined my life

632
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,000
Gave him everything-Grace-

633
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,400
Because i couldn't stand the darkness between us-

634
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,300
A career because one man's death

635
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Drives another's decision to save lives,

636
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,000
As if ryan cared about anyone else but himself.

637
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,400
You have to stop blaming him for something you did.

638
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,300
I know what i did on that road,

639
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,500
But i didn't do this.

640
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,800
I didn't kill myself.

641
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,000
I wasn't a drug addict.

642
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,500
Whose life do you think would be a lot better

643
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,700
With me gone?

644
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Are you saying ryan killed you?

645
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,300
I'm dead,aren't i?

646
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
Eli.

647
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,400
I know how ryan killed his friend.

648
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,700
Now we know that lucas was on

649
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,400
Some pretty hefty happy pills.

650
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,100
You mean, antidepressants.

651
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes. They were in his apartment,

652
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,300
But he also had a prescription

653
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,260
For some pretty hardy tranquilizers.

654
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,600
Now there's contraindications,

655
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,500
Meaning that's a very bad combo.

656
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
He had to go to two pharmacies and two doctors

657
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,200
To get them filled.

658
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,200
How do you know that?

659
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm a doctor.

660
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,900
I called a few drug stores in hamilton.

661
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,900
You're a ph. D., not an m.D.

662
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,800
I'm not named dr. Hellar either,

663
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,200
But they didn't need to know that.

664
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,500
Ok. So we know that he gave his best friend drugs.

665
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,900
Did he have any idea that the combination would kill him?

666
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,500
I should have changed.

667
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,000
It is this guy's memorial.

668
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,400
It's just a get-Together with old friends.

669
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,100
Besides,i don't think we'll be staying long.

670
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,000
You're not the only one who's crashing the party.

671
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,300
Let's go.

672
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,600
Why? Just...

673
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,500
And i think in his own way

674
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,900
He loved every single person here,

675
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,200
And what i think that he would want the most

676
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,200
Is for all of us to move forward,

677
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
To find the things that he was still searching for

678
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,800
With the people that we love.

679
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,400
Grace and i are doing that.

680
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,000
We're getting married.

681
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,300
And when i say that we lost our best man,

682
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
I mean it in every sense of the word.

683
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,400
We all did.

684
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,400
To lucas.

685
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,600
To lucas! To lucas!

686
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
Want to do something,

687
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
Or should i?

688
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,700
We should go outside and talk.

689
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,600
Look. I know what grace told you,

690
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,600
And there's a statute of limitations,

691
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,900
Even on obsessive guilt.

692
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,000
You might want to restart the clock

693
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,500
From the time that you prescribed the medicine

694
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,100
That killed your friend.

695
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,400
Tell me you didn't give him those drugs.

696
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,300
Grace,he came to me,ok?

697
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,500
Because he wanted to come clean.

698
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
He told you that?

699
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,900
Yeah. He brought me up to speed

700
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,700
On the plans that the two of you made together.

701
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,200
I met with him because he had inherited some money

702
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,400
And he wanted to put it into a trust account

703
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,000
For that man's daughter.

704
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,700
He figured he could do some good,

705
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Maybe get some peace.

706
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,100
You couldn't let him have that,could you?

707
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,200
You would rather see him dead.

708
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,900
Ah,no.

709
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Grace,wait!

710
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,000
You think you're the only person that cared about him?

711
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,100
He was my best friend.

712
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,400
I was just trying to make things ok.

713
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,100
That's all i ever did.

714
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,500
Grace,it was our mistake that

715
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,000
He was driving that car.

716
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,700
It was our fault.

717
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,900
That's the big secret

718
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,400
That we never discuss.

719
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,300
What happened that night,lucas?

720
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,900
I think you know.

721
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,100
You were so responsible, such a good guy until...

722
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,800
Ryan: the party at binghamton.

723
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,000
He's here,isn't he?

724
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,900
Since seventh grade, we were best friends.

725
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,200
On the first day of high school,

726
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,500
He introduced me to the girl that he'd met over summer,

727
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,300
And every single day, i fell harder for her.

728
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
And nothing happened for so long...

729
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,000
No,man. I'm good,thanks.

730
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Until that stupid frat party

731
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,500
At the end of the road trip.

732
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,300
Who was that?

733
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,000
Here you go,lucas.

734
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,700
Thanks,man.

735
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,000
Later,i tried to act like nothing happened,

736
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,900
And i realized that we all were

737
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,600
And that lucas knew and that's why he was drinking.

738
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,900
It wasn't like him.

739
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,200
It was our fault. We did this to him.

740
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,100
Leaving that guy on the road,

741
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,500
I wasn't just protecting myself.

742
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,400
I was protecting all of us,

743
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,400
And when my best friend came to me,

744
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,400
Falling apart after 10 years,

745
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,800
I just tried to do the same thing.

746
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,300
I tried to save him...

747
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,700
Or at least,that's what i thought i was doing.

748
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,400
I didn't come asking for permission this time.

749
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Ryan,a man died because i was drinking,

750
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,000
Because we left him there like he was some kind of animal.

751
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Ahh,ahh.

752
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,200
Because i told you to.

753
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,500
Look. The guy was gone.

754
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
There was nothing we could do.

755
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
He had a wife and a kid.

756
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,700
I can't live like this anymore.

757
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,500
Really? How are you gonna live in a 10x10 cell?

758
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,700
Look. As your friend, i am begging you,

759
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Please stop torturing yourself.

760
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,100
If i don't do this,

761
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,100
I think i'm gonna die.

762
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,300
I can't get out of my head,

763
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,700
I can't sleep, i can't think.

764
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,500
You still seeing your shrink?

765
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm done with all that.

766
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,300
Whatever decision you make,i'm behind you,

767
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
But don't make a decision like this without a clear head.

768
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,700
Look. You said you haven't been sleeping.

769
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm gonna give you something,ok? Yeah.

770
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,900
You just take a couple of days.

771
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
Do that for me, all right?

772
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,500
Yeah.

773
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,100
I told him don't mix those pills with anything.

774
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
I swear,

775
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,100
And when i found out that he o.D.Ed-

776
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,400
Ask him. Please,melinda.

777
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,400
If lucas is here, ask him if that is true.

778
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,200
He told me.

779
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
But it wasn't the pills.

780
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,400
It was the silence. I remember now.

781
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Late at night every night.

782
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,700
I hadn't slept for so long.

783
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,300
The pills my shrink had prescribed to me,

784
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,100
They weren't helping, they didn't do anything,

785
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,800
So what harm could a sleeping pill do?

786
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,400
I woke up again.

787
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
It had to have been hours since i took the first one.

788
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,900
Why wasn't i sleeping?

789
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
I went out to my car to get headphones.

790
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,100
I had neighbors,

791
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,300
And next thing i know...

792
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm standing over my own body.

793
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,700
I saw grace. She looked so sad,

794
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,500
Even before she found me.

795
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I needed to make them understand.

796
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,600
The sadness,it just doesn't go away.

797
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,300
Lucas may not have realized it,

798
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,400
But i think he was trying to save you.

799
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,800
From what?

800
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,900
From making the same mistake he did.

801
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,700
He was afraid that if you kept

802
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,200
Your guilt a secret it would ruin your life

803
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,500
The way that it ruined his.

804
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,100
Lucas,i'm sorry.

805
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,700
We are both so sorry.

806
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,700
I didn't see it coming.

807
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,900
My girlfriend, my best friend.

808
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,400
Did you? You saw everything back in high school.

809
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
You were always so quiet,

810
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Taking it all in.

811
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,400
You're asking me?

812
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,900
What a difference 10 years makes.

813
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,100
What i see now is that it was an accident-

814
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,700
The crash,your death, all of it.

815
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,000
You made a mistake.

816
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,300
It's time for you to move on

817
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,900
And let your friends do the same.

818
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
Mrs. Graber,these are the two people i told you about.

819
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,900
This is grace, and this is ryan.

820
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,100
I hope she can forgive them.

821
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
They're going to the authorities,

822
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
They're taking responsibility.

823
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,700
Maybe that will help.

824
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,100
I don't think she wants revenge.

825
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,800
I think she wants to know what it was like

826
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,400
For her husband

827
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,100
In those final moments.

828
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,500
Maybe she'll take comfort in knowing he wasn't alone.

829
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,500
All those years, you held it in

830
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,900
For grace, for both of them.

831
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,500
It's all i could think about

832
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,800
My whole adult life.

833
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,800
Well,now you can just let go.

834
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,500
But what comes next?

835
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,800
The light.

836
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,600
What's that like?

837
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,900
I don't know.

838
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,900
D- Doesn't that s- Scare you?

839
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,700
The light doesn't scare me.

840
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,300
No,no,no.

841
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,300
I'm talking about the unknown.

842
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm just like anyone else.

843
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,200
Of course it scares me.

844
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,200
Yeah.

845
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,100
But it's ok to be scared.

846
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,200
Wow!

847
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,400
Take care of them, will you,all of them?

848
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,000
I will.

849
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,500
You're all right, meloony gordon.

850
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,700
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

851
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,900
Hey.

852
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
What are you doing?

853
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,000
I lost your tear sheet,

854
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,400
So i'm kind of winging it right now.

855
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,500
No. I mean,i thought we were gonna wait

856
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,700
Until i got pregnant

857
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
Because then we would still have 9 months.

858
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,100
Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan.

859
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,400
Very logical, but,uh,didn't seem to

860
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,200
Make you very happy.

861
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,000
It's not you.

862
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,800
It's what i do.

863
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,100
Silly fears and anxieties,

864
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,700
Stupid things that ghosts say.

865
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,100
Like what?

866
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,500
What?

867
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,200
That there might be a price for me to pay

868
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,500
For what i do, putting myself

869
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,400
In places where i might not belong.

870
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,700
What kind of places?

871
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
The unknown...

872
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,400
Death.

873
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,400
You know,that's exactly why we do this.

874
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,400
Yeah. This project, all of it.

875
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
I was wrong, you were right.

876
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Why?

877
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Because of what you do.

878
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,500
Every day,you know, you believe.

879
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,700
We should believe that the right thing

880
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,100
Is gonna happen no matter what,

881
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,800
So we just keep pushing and pushing until it does.

882
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,900
What if it doesn't?

883
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,600
Well,then we push some more.

884
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,400
Where did you learn to be so brave?

885
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,200
Where do you think?

886
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,900
She's right here.
