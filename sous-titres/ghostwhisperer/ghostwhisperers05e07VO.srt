Zoe: that book is
the key to everything.

00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:05,684
The book is always changing.
new things are written,
old things are erased.

00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:07,386
You know,
carl said that aiden

5
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:08,854
Would have powers
that i don't.

6
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,489
What if that means
seeing things things
that i can't,

7
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:11,723
Things that are real?

8
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,125
Tell them why
your friends shine.

9
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:14,826
Because
they don't have faces.

10
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:16,628
They're made of light.

11
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:17,963
But they're scared.

12
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,564
What are
they scared of, buddy?

13
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,533
The shadows.

14
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,068
What kind of shadows
are those?

15
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:25,570
The ones they make
from the parts that
get left behind.

16
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:26,738
Parts of what?

17
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:29,274

Be sure to let them

I will.

22
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:41,086
And save your tin foil
for the shinies.

23
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,255
You, too, aunt delia.

24
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,023
Ok, honey, i will.

25

The shinies?

26
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,693

Be grateful.
ned's imaginary friend
was named bob,

29
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:54,866
And all bob ever did
was watch tv

30
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:57,169
And agree with everything
ned had to say.

31
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:00,405
I know, but he talks to
these shiny people like
they're real, you know?

32
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:02,274
And i can't
see them or hear them.

33
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:06,144
And then they put these
scary ideas in his head,
like the shadows.

34
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,679
Which she can't see, either.

35
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,481
Not the ones
that move, anyway.

36
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,983
Shadows that move?
apparently.

37
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,119
I mean, could
a 5-year-old
even make that up?

38
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:16,354
One that lives
with ghosts, sure.

39
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:19,057
What?

40
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,294
He's supposed to have
abilities that i don't,

41
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,730
But what if talking
to these shiny people
is one of them?

42
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,632
You know, i mean,
what if aiden's
imaginary friends

43
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,100
Aren't imaginary?

44
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,770
I don't know.
what that be so bad?

45
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:32,938
They told aiden
this morning

46
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,206
That something bad
was going to happen.

47
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:36,408

I want my mom

00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:52,290
All right, ruby g.,
don't even tell me
you're nervous.

54
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:54,392
Hello, you guys
are about to cut me open
and rip out my gallbladder.

55
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,894
And i can't miss
the playoffs.

56
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,329
Time out.

57
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:59,231
Nobody's going to be
ripping anything
out of anywhere.

58
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,600
And secondly,
you're not going
to miss the playoffs.

59
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,034
Because we never
let anybody miss
the playoffs,

60
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:04,569
Do we?
hey, um,

61
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,338
Maybe we could
postpone the surgery?

00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:08,907
Ruby, how many matches
have you missed because
of your stomach aches?

63
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,042
Too many.
all right.

64
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,078
So this surgery
is going to make
that problem disappear.

65
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,080
Uh, if i can ever
find a vein.

66
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,948
We should try
the other arm,
huh? all right.

67
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,051
Yeah. don't worry
about it.

68
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,920
Everything's going
to be all right.

69
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,723
Thanks. just relax, ruby,
it's going to be ok.

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,857
I'm scared.

71
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,092
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

72
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,694
Except this is going to be
a little pinch.
ow.

73
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:31,463
The surgery will take
about an hour.

74
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,764
And you're gonna be out,
and be able to go home

And sleep
in your own bed.

76

Yeah, but i'm gonna
have a big honkin'

177
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,655
So maybe she heard that.
and then she thought that...

178
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:20,658
Jim, you didn't do
anything wrong.

179
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,126
Has anything else
happened?

180
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:23,995
No.

181
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:25,930
But i'm telling you,
i feel like...

182
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:28,699
I could feel that she was
angry at me, you know?

183
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,201
I don't blame her.

184
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:33,371
Probably 'cause
you're angry
at yourself.

185
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,339
'cause you care.

186
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,408
Too much,
according to morgan.

187
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:38,909
One of the many
reasons

188
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:40,478
I'm in love
with you.

189
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,480
You were kind to her.

190
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:45,916
There's nothing
wrong with that.

191
00:07:45,984 --> 00:07:48,853
You know, maybe...

192
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,755
You're being haunted
by your own doubts

193
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,123
More than
anything else.

194
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,459
Maybe.

195
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,631
Look, what did aiden mean
when he said that his friends

196
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,733
Said no bad stuff
would happen to him?

197
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,569
Nothing.

198
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:08,539
Tell you what,
why don't you send
her picture to my cell

199
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:10,541
And i'll take
a look at it? ok?

200
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:11,842
If it'll make you
feel better.

201
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,978
Yeah, yeah, it might.

202
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:18,983
Carl?

203
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,685
If you're around,
i really need
to talk to you.

204
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:23,054
Carl? [gasps] oh.

205
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,722
Do you always
have to do that?

206
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,024
Do you always
have to keep calling?

207
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,659
Is it a problem?

208
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,861
They don't like me
to talk to you too often.

209
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,531
We're watchers, you know.
we're not meddlers.

210
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:35,366
I'm sorry.
i know. it's just...

211
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:38,436
Your son.
you're worried
about your son.

212
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,004
His new friends.

213
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:41,672
It all felt harmless
until they told him

214
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,542
That something bad
was going to happen.

215
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,243
Jim lost a patient
yesterday during surgery,

216
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,512
And he thinks
that she might be
haunting him.

217
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,681
But you're not so sure.

218
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:51,916
Ok.

219
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,851
Let me see the picture
on your cell phone.

220
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,119
How did you know that?!

221
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:58,989
Oh, right.
the watching.

222
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,893
Hmm. haven't seen her.

223
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:05,229
Doesn't prove anything.

224
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:08,032
Why don't you ask me
what you really
want to know?

225
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,533
Is it true?

226
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:11,335
The shinies and the shadows?

227
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:13,370
It just all feels
so fanciful.

228
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,172
Because you've never
seen them.

229
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,308
Hmm?

230
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,377
So the person
who asks people

231
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:24,048
To believe what
they can't see

232
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:27,852
Is refusing
to believe what
she can't see.

233
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,155
It's completely normal
for children to have
imaginary friends.

234
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:33,224
But you don't really
believe that.

235
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,227
Carl, please.
just once, give me
a straight answer.

236
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:39,029
I couldn't,
even if i wanted to.

237
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,866
It's too dangerous.

238
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,067
For you?

239
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:45,035
Are the shadows
that powerful?

240
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:47,037
All i can
tell you is this--

241
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:49,807
The answers are there.

242
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,376
But you have to know
when to look.

243
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:53,410
Don't you mean "where"?

244
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:55,379
That you already know.

245
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,481
If you're talking
about the book,

246
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:58,782
Ned's already looked.

247
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,418
Ok, there's no shinies
or shadows in there.

248
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:02,686
Maybe not now.

249
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:04,421
What does that mean?

250
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:07,057
What use would
the book be

251
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:11,428
If it got itself
destroyed?

252
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:16,066
Are you saying that
the book hides things
to protect itself?

253
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:19,537
Someday...

254
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:21,572
Someday soon,

255
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,576
You may want to think
about doing the same.

256
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:40,457
Please don't touch that.

257
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,993
President bedford.
i wasn't sure how long
i'd be waiting.

258
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,262
Your assistant didn't
know where you were.

259
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,631
Well, i was detained.
my apologies.

260
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,768
You wanted to see me
about something?

261
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:52,303
You honestly
don't know?

262
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,737
Professor sanders?

263
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:56,106
Tenure? job for life?

264
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,575
Well, if you want
to congratulate him,

265
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,811
I suggest
a nice bordeaux.

266
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,613
This is twice
you've passed me over.

267
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:05,349
I get published more
and invited to more conferences

268
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,685
Than any professor
in the entire
psych department.

269
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,852
Do you?

270
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,187
I've also been voted
best professor

271
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,422
By my students
three years running.

272
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:12,690
Really?

273
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,791
I even worked
on my appearance

274
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,492
And my hair since
your last evaluation.

275
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,095
Well, i find that
hard to believe.

276
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,433
It's a job offer,

277
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,768
From collier university.
it's not the first.

278
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:26,670
It's a good school.
you should take it.

279
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:28,205
I don't want to leave here.

280
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:31,041
I can't.
why not?

281
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,812
Let's just cut
to the chase.

282
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,880
What do you have
against me?

283
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,483
[scoffs]

284
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:41,485
Well, it's not so much

285
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:42,853
That i don't respect you

286
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:45,256
Or that i disapprove
of your cowboy methods

287
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:48,025
Or that i cringe
every time

288
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:51,161
You open your mouth
representing this
university in public.

289
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:53,097
Although all those
things are true,

290
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,866
It's just,
the simple fact is,

291
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:59,803
I just don't like you.

292
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,040
Well, for a minute there,
i thought it was personal.

293
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,610
What's not to like?
i'm likeable, right?

294
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:07,745
People like me.

295
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:08,979
Yeah, we like you.

296
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:10,714
[sighs] well,
that's a start.

297
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:11,849
Jim, could you
step it up, there?

298
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,850
I got a date
at the wine bar
at lento's.

299
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,918
Hey, count me in there.

300
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,487
Did you i.d. your ghost?
not yet.

301
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,189
And there haven't been
any other hauntings, so...

302
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,724
Well, maybe it's just
some random hospital ghost

303
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,259
Who was messing
with the lockers
and the sound system.

304
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,527
Yeah, that's possible.

305
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,629
Or maybe the ghost
was just haunting
somebody else.

306
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:28,532
What about dr. morgan?
was he surprised
by what happened?

307
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,900
I wondered about that.

308
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,068
He was surprised
at first,

309
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:32,870
But then he just turned
and walked away.

310
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,371
Hmm. maybe it's not
the first time.

311
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,340
Maybe that's why
he's being such
a sourpuss.

312
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:38,175
'cause he's got a ghost
keeping him up at night.

313
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:40,177
Hey, doctor morgan's
a good man.

314
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:43,147
He's just frustrated
he can't perform
surgery anymore.

315
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,649
He's in the early stages
of parkinson's.

316
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:46,917
You know,
he's hard on us

317
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:49,086
Because he wants us
to be as good as he was.

318
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:51,088
Eli: funny.

319
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:54,258
The only thing
bedford wants from me
is to dry up and blow away.

320
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:09,206
What are you--
are you crazy?

321
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:10,474
Yeah. for you.

322
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,775
Come on.

323
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:16,113
I locked the door.

324
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,681
Come on. i'll do
anything for you.

325
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:19,850
Absolutely anything.

326
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,121
He used me.

327
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,890
And then he just
threw me away.

328
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,094
What'd you see?

329
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,730
Um, let me just
put it this way--

330
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,631
You're not the one
who's being haunted.

331
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,512
Wow, so the old man
did ok for himself.

332
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,314
Was he by any chance
married at the time?

333
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,650
No, he was divorced,
and i think for a long time.

334
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:50,719
Any clues about
who she was?

335
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,420
Hmm, she was wearing
yellow scrubs.

336
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,756
Which means she was
a med student.

337
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:55,824
Damn it.
yikes.

338
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:58,493
The good doctor,
whether married or not,

339
00:13:58,561 --> 00:13:59,794
Wasn't being so good.

340
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:01,329
You're not blogging this,
ok? don't blog this.

341
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:02,530
I'm offended.

342
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,932
I'm searching
for female med students

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,334
At rockland who have
died in the past
five years.

344
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,637
Here we go,
two of them,
both male.

345
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:09,771
What do you got?

346
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,374
Med school face page.
ooh, i found her.

347
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:16,611
"tina clark, 22,
went missing this week."

348
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,979
That was 6 months ago.

349
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,448
Is there a body?
doesn't look like it.

350
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,483
Wait. i know her.

351
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,884
She and i took
morgan's class.

352
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:26,621
She was really quiet.
i think she was his t.a.

353
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,056
I think you mean
t and a.

354
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:29,491
Look, whatever
their relationship,

355
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,493
We have to figure out
what happened between them

356
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,128
And why she's so angry
at morgan.

357
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:35,096
You know, i'd really
like to give this guy

358
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:37,432
A chance to explain himself.
he was a good teacher.

359
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:12,000
[pills clattering]

360
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,842
Dr. morgan?
oh, i'm sorry.

361
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,977
Can i give you a hand?

362
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:25,447
I dropped some pills.

363
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,216
For my parkinson's,

364
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:29,517
If that look on
your face means

365
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:30,585
It's any
of your business.

366
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,354
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,423
I just came by
to ask your advice

368
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:37,292
About that liver patient
who was admitted last night.

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Aaronson?
yeah.

370
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,894
Leave the files.

371
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:41,596
I'll review it
and i'll get it back to you.

372
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,365
All right.

373
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,068
Ah, doctor,

374
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,703
Look, i've been meaning
to ask you about

375
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,705
Tina clark.
do you remember her?

376
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:51,840
Did you know her?

377
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,008
I knew her.

378
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,576
Someone i'm close to
was asking about her,

379
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:57,879
And i remembered her
from your intro
to clinical medicine class.

380
00:15:57,947 --> 00:15:59,714
You know she went missing,
don't you?

381
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,983
Well, i knew
that she quit
medical school.

382
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,985
I heard she went to
new york after that.

383
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:05,220
Was that the last thing
you heard about her?

384
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,988
Well, i saw
her photo in the news,

385
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:08,356
Just like everyone else.

386
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,891
Right. i'm sorry.

387
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,092
I know this must be hard
for you.

388
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,527
I know she was
your teaching assistant.

389
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:13,695
And it did seem like
the two of you were close, so--

390
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:16,297
Did it, now?

391
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:20,568
Yeah, look, i'm just
trying to help find her,
that's all.

392
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:22,237
You should talk
to the police.

393
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,641
Did they talk to you?

394
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:27,809
No.

395
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,310
Why?

396
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:33,681
Do you think
you know something
about her, about me?

397
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:35,517
Look, dr. morgan,

398
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,519
The shortest answer
to that question is yes.

399
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:40,321
Something that could get
you a good evaluation,

400
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:41,823
Get you into cardiology?

401
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:44,125
Let it go. there's
no mileage here.

402
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:45,493
Doctor, i'm not trying
to blackmail you.

403
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:46,895
I'm just asking you
to help find a young woman

404
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,463
That i thought
you cared about.

405
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,732
This is all sound
an awful lot like
blackmail to me.

406
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,967
We're done here.

407
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:57,005
All right.

408
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:01,276
[door closes]

409
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:02,477
Blackmail?
yep.

410
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,779
I mean, you talked
about a missing girl

411
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,114
And he went straight
to blackmail?

412
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:07,348
And he said
there's no mileage here,

413
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,017
Like he'd been cornered
on the topic before.

414
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,652
Maybe someone else
knew about the affair.

415
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,253
Well, people gossip.

416
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,289
Yeah, so did you
talk to any of his
other students?

417
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,657
Yeah, i did.

418
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,058
And nobody wants to be
known as the person

419
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:18,293
Who blackmailed
their professor.

420
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,661
But a few of them knew tina.

421
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:21,129
What did they say
about her?

422
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,198
They said that
she was always tired,
like any medical student.

423
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:25,200
But that she paid
her tuition in cash.

424
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,135
In cash?

425
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:28,503
Her full
tuition?

426
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,072
Yeah. lots of small bills
in lots of installments.

427
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,407
And they said
she was scraping by,

428
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:34,476
You know, just borrowing
money for books and lab fees.

429
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:36,478
But, you know,
there was something else.

430
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:40,215
When i walked in on morgan,
he was taking pills.

431
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:42,584
And he looked like
he'd been caught,
he was wired.

432
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,719
Maybe he was just
taking something
for his parkinson's.

433
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:48,022
Yeah, or maybe he and tina
had more in common
than just their affair.

434
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,058
Wait a minute.
you think that

435
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,326
She's paying all
of her bills in cash

436
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:54,329
Because they were
dealing right out
of the hospital?

437
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:56,764
He does have easy access
to drugs.

438
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:13,414
I feel so lost.

439
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:16,284
I can help you.

440
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:19,721
Please.

441
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:22,924
Please.

442
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:25,960
Don't judge me.

443
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,530
What do you mean?

444
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:38,273
[indistinct chatter]

445
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,689
[men cat-calling,
whistling]

446
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:05,099
[men cheering]

447
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,235
Oh, yeah!
all right!

448
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:32,060
[door slams]

449
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:51,045
Tina...tina?

450
00:19:57,286 --> 00:20:01,089
Go away, tina.
for good.

451
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,526
Who did this?

452
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:06,728
Who was threatening you?

453
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,363
It wasn't a threat.

454
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,331
Are you saying
that someone killed you?

455
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,166
He wanted me gone.

456
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,769
Who? was it morgan?

457
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:17,105
Yes.

458
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,173
[gasps]

459
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:25,947
[sighs]

460
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,381
Thank you.
so i tell you

461
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,916
That a med student
is a stripper,

462
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,417
And you're not
surprised either?

463
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,953
Well, tina wouldn't be
the first grad student
to moonlight.

464
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:38,987
That's what i said.

465
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:40,823
Tuition's expensive,
time is money.

466
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,391
It's maximum results
for minimum effort.

467
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,992
Yeah, easy
for you to say.

468
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,228
Well, what did
tina's other career

469
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,763
Really have to do
with anything?

470
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,465
Maybe that's why morgan
wanted to be so rid of her.

471
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,767
It's bad enough
for your career
to date a student.

472
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,236
Even worse
if she happens
to be a stripper.

473
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,405
What? bad enough to want
to kill her, though?

474
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,741
Tina said
that he wanted her gone,

475
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,542
But she still hasn't
told me how she died.

476
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,177
We gotta find that body.

477
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,612
Have the police tell us
what the ghost won't.

478
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,814
Morgan said
the last thing he heard

479
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:07,116
Is that she was on
the way to new york.

480
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,550
So if that wasn't
in the papers,

481
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,885
It'll help narrow
down the search.

482
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:11,820
Especially
if they're only
looking in the morgues.

483
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,856
I'll call detective blair.

484
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:16,158
She doesn't
ask questions anymore.

485
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,693
She's glad for the help.

486
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:19,261
Wait. where
are you going?

487
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,863
Uh, tina's other life,

488
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,564
The one she hid,
to find out what else

489
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:24,433
She's been hiding.
wait a minute.

490
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:25,701
You're going
to a strip club?

491
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:27,336
Yes. ok?

492
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:28,604
And i never thought
i would say this
to my husband,

493
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:30,139
But you're coming
with me.

494
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,307
Hallelujah.

495
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,878
What about me?!

496
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:37,546
Man: that's
all right, girl!

497
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:40,382
[indistinct chatter]

498
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,651
Um...
so the bouncer said

499
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,586
You guys were friends
of tina's?

500
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,555
Uh, yeah, we took
a class together once.

501
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,657
Did you know that tina
was in medical school?

502
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,992
Yeah.

503
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,728
You know, i used to be
an executive assistant downtown.

504
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:54,963
Thought i'd do this
a couple hours a week.

505
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:57,065
One night turned into three,

506
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:59,601
Three turned into five,

507
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:01,770
And pretty soon,
i couldn't stay awake
at my day job.

508
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,906
Now this is what i do.

509
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:06,608
So is that what
happened with tina?

510
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,644
Sure, she said this was
short-term for her,

511
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:12,381
And i believed her
because one day i came in,
and she was just gone.

512
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:13,882
Was that when
they reported
her missing?

513
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,384
No. she went missing later.

514
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,885
She left here for new york.

515
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:19,054
Didn't say good-bye?

516
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:23,358
Look, she got on
the wrong side of somebody,

517
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,228
And she didn't say who.

518
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:28,597
You know, we tried
to stay friends.

519
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:30,432
I even went
to visit her once.

520
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,434
She had a nice place.

521
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,002
A really nice place.

522
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,004
You seem surprised.

523
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:38,774
[chuckles] we don't make
that kind of money here.

524
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:41,176
I figured she landed
on her feet,

525
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:44,379
Met somebody.
a rich somebody.

526
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,382
Charee, do you mind
if we show you
some photographs?

527
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,686
Ahem, right.
have you seen
this guy?

528
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:53,922
No.

529
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,758
Morgan had a beard
for a while, so it might--

530
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,294
Wait, wait, go back.
that guy.

531
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,530
I've seen him with tina.
wait a minute.

532
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,599
Why didn't the cops
show me that guy?

533
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,334
That's bedford.
are you sure?

534
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,435
President bedford?
oh, yeah.

535
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:08,470
They were arguing
about something.

536
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:11,106
At the time,
i thought it was
because he was cheap

537
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:12,608
And they were
coming to terms.

538
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:14,276
To terms?

539
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,878
Because they went into
the back room after.

540
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,447
You know,
for a private.

541
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:20,115
The next day,

542
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:21,783
Tina was gone.

543
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,919
[deep voice]
shh, come on,
don't do it.

544
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,754
We told you.

545
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,023
[high-pitched voice]
what? you never told me.

546
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:30,325
[deep voice]
yes, we did.

547
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:31,793
Don't talk to him.

548
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,562
[high-pitched voice]
why not?

549
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,864
[deep voice]
you know why not.

550
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:37,499
Aiden,
what are you doing?

551
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,902
Playing.

552
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:42,571
Playing what?
teacher.

553
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,740
Is that the teacher?

554
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:47,175
Who's not supposed
to talk to him?

555
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:50,045
You.

556
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:53,248
Who doesn't want me
to talk to him?

557
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:55,717
Well, my friends.

558
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:59,621
They say the shadows
don't like it when you do.

559
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,127
Whose teacher
have i been talking to?

560
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,262
Yours?

561
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,865
He teaches grown-ups.

562
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,734
Is it your daddy's teacher?

563
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,870
No.

564
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:18,206
Uncle eli's.

565
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,210
[cell phone rings]

566
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:24,346
Hey, i was just
about to call you.

567
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:25,948
They found tina's body.

568
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,449
She was laying dead
in the street.

569
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:31,053
She's been a jane doe
in some morgue in
downtown new york.

570
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,688
Oded on
prescription meds.

571
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:35,157
You know what,
i'm not surprised.

572
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,792
I felt high
when i was dancing.

573
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,161
She must have been
doing drugs just to
make it through the night.

574
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,964
Cops were finally able
to search her apartment.

575
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,199
They found a lot
of hidden cash.

576
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,702
Her friend said
that she had money,
enough to od.

577
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:50,105
But then why would
she be blaming
dr. morgan for her death?

578
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:51,606
Maybe 'cause
he turned on her.

579
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:53,642
Threatening her
to make her leave town.

580
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,111
Except he's not the guy
they saw at the club.

581
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:57,813
It was bedford,
your boss, your teacher.

582
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,081
My teacher?

583
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:00,882
Yeah, it was bedford.
look, i'll explain later.

584
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,118
Now we just have
to figure out
how he's involved.

585
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:04,786
Think he's sleeping
with her, too?

586
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:06,154
No, it's gotta be
more than that

587
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,589
For the shadows
to get involved.

588
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:08,690
The shadows?

589
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,158
Yeah, aiden said that

590
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,860
I'm not supposed
to talk to bedford

591
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,662
Because they don't like it
when i do.

592
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,332
The shadows, the parts
that get left behind when
people go into the light,

593
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,767
They actually
want something?

594
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:20,435
Well, whatever it is,
they're scary enough

595
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:22,104
That the book decided
to rewrite itself

596
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:23,538
To erase
any mention of them.

597
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,675
Ok, just pretend
for a moment that
any of this makes sense.

598
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:29,811
The shadows are in bed
with the president?

599
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:32,014
That dude just gets
more and more evil.

600
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:39,921
[rumbling]

601
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,990
[wind blowing]

602
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,708
[glass breaking]
[bedford grunting]

603
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:09,885
[elevator dings]

604
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,400
[screaming]

605
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:30,872
[groaning]

606
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:35,877
[alarm]

607
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:42,050
It's you!

608
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:45,320
No, you're wrong.

609
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:47,722
I'm not the one
you should punish!

610
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,127
No!

611
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,495
No!

612
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:55,564
No!

613
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,632
[screaming]

614
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,986
Was he injured?
only his ego.

615
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:06,254
I heard that when
maintenance finally

616
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,756
Pried open
the elevator door,

617
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:09,991
They found the president
curled up in the fetal
position.

618
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,893
I only wish
i could have been
there to see it.

619
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:14,396
Eli, he's a person.
a haunted person

620
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:16,898
Who has a ghost
that we can't cross over

621
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,234
Until we find out
what happened
between them.

622
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:20,502
Wait a minute,
what do you mean,

623
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,737
What happened between them?
do we think that tina

624
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:23,405
Was sleeping with both
morgan and bedford?

625
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:24,840
I don't know
about that,

626
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,074
But i do know
one thing that
they both wanted.

627
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:28,477
You asked me to look
for a connection,
right?

628
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:30,145
Well, i think
i found one.

629
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,447
Right around
the time that tina
went missing,

630
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:35,016
Bedford became
president of
the university.

631
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:36,585
Guess who he was
running against.

632
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,320
Dr. morgan.

633
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:39,588
Who acted like
he'd been threatened before

634
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:41,456
About his affair
with tina. yeah.

635
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:43,091
But if bedford wanted
the affair to go public,

636
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,893
Why would he be
at the club
threatening tina

637
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:46,194
To get her
to leave town?

638
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:47,796
You know what,
maybe it's the other
way around.

639
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:50,499
Maybe bedford
was paying her
to go public

640
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:52,033
And morgan was
threatening her

641
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,402
To be quiet and then go.

642
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:54,536
Yeah, but would either
one of those guys

643
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:55,837
Threaten a girl's life
over a job?

644
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,105
Hmm.

645
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,641
What if it was about
more than the job?

646
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:01,410
What if it was
about the book?

647
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:05,480
Wasn't bedford managing
the sale of rockland's
rare book collection,

648
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,182
The one
with our book in it?

649
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,451
Till it got stolen
and ended up with us.

650
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,520
So you think
that bedford knew
about the book, then?

651
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:12,821
I'm sure
the shadows did.

652
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,423
There must be some
reason why they don't

653
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,824
Want you talking
to him.

654
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:17,859
Oh, if the wrong people
got a hold of that thing...

655
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,027
Bedford's president now.

656
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:20,729
He'd have total
control over it.

657
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:23,198
Maybe that's what
he's been after all along.

658
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,740
You want to tell me
why you're going around
asking questions

659
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:33,375
About me and tina clark?

660
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:34,743
And the day after
you're asking these questions,

661
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:37,245
It's in the news
that she's dead?

662
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:39,314
Doesn't that sound
strange to you?

663
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:40,682
No.

664
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,985
No, the only thing
that seems strange
to me is this--

665
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,520
From the day i got here,

666
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:46,955
You know, i've been
defending you

667
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,391
Against people who say
you're too hard
on your staff.

668
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:50,826
And you know
what i tell them?

669
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:52,160
I tell them
it's because you care.

670
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:54,863
You care about us,
you care about
our patients.

671
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:57,866
And because
you're an honest man.

672
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:00,202
But ever since
this tina thing started,

673
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,737
No, doctor, you have not
been an honest man.

674
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,406
You're angry at me?

675
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:07,676
No. you're
stonewalling me.

676
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:10,412
Why is that,
dr. morgan?

677
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:15,617
You're right.
i'm sorry.

678
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:18,053
I just don't know how.
if you're sorry,

679
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,755
Stop lying
and tell me
what happened.

680
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:24,326
Some people call it
a perk of my job.

681
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:26,161
I call it
a waste of my time,

682
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:28,797
But attending surgeons
are wined and dined

683
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,799
By sales reps all the time.

684
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:33,034
This one night,

685
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:36,037
The sales reps
dragged me
to a strip club.

686
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:38,907
[indistinct chatter]

687
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:52,053
I'm not going to pretend
i didn't look.

688
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:57,025
But i really wasn't
in the mood.

689
00:29:57,093 --> 00:30:00,762
So i went outside
to get some air.

690
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,432
On the way out,
i passed

691
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,234
A partially opened door.

692
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:09,971
I glanced inside,
and i saw tina

693
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,607
Giving someone
a private dance.

694
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,143
It would have
ended there, but...

695
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,878
She looked up
and saw me.

696
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:18,947
Soon as i got outside,

697
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,782
She was running
to catch me.

698
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,651
Dr. morgan!

699
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:24,653
No, please wait!

700
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,455
She needed to tell me
that she only danced
to pay her tuition bills.

701
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:28,857
I told her it was
none of my business.

702
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:30,926
You've got
to understand!

703
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:33,962
But...she was so ashamed,
she couldn't stop crying.

704
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:38,433
I gave her my shoulder.

705
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,669
But it didn't take long

706
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:43,538
For it to turn into
something more.

707
00:30:46,475 --> 00:30:49,077
Didn't you try
to break it off?

708
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:50,378
A hundred times.

709
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,747
I'm not saying
that i don't share
the blame,

710
00:30:52,815 --> 00:30:54,049
But tina had problems.

711
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:55,884
She had an addictive
personality,

712
00:30:55,952 --> 00:30:57,519
And not just
about us, either.

713
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:59,287
Do you think
she was stealing meds?

714
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:02,958
I never caught her,
but i recognized
the behavior.

715
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:04,192
And i'm pretty sure
she was using.

716
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,227
How did it end?

717
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:08,463
My old friend,
josh bedford.

718
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:10,899
President bedford?
you guys are friends?

719
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,000
Were.

720
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:14,235
Josh came to see me

721
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,470
Because he knew
about me and tina,

722
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:17,672
And begged me
to break it off.
for my own good.

723
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,676
See, he knew that i was
on the short list
for university president.

724
00:31:21,744 --> 00:31:24,613
What he failed
to mention was that
he was on that list, too.

725
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,348
What did you do?

726
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:28,249
Well, like a fool,
i did what he told me.

727
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,751
I let him talk
to tina for me.

728
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,252
What do you mean?
what do you think happened?

729
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,921
She packed up overnight
and left.

730
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,724
And somehow, news of our
relationship got out.

731
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:39,160
And somehow,
the guy they picked
to be president

732
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:41,596
Was the one person that
knew about me and tina.

733
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,331
You think he got her
to disclose the affair?

734
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,867
They find her dead body
on a street corner

735
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:48,937
With a pile of cash
sitting at home in
a new, expensive place,

736
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:51,539
When a month before
she was lap-dancing
to make ends meet.

737
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:53,575
Now he's president,

738
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:54,943
Handing out
millions of dollars
in research grants

739
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,845
And construction
contracts.

740
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:59,247
What do you think?

741
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,953
[siren in distance]

742
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,962
President bedford.

743
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,765
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to find you?

744
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:19,367
Not hard enough,
apparently.

745
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:20,635
You're disappearing
every day.

746
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:22,437
Your staff has no clue
where you are.

747
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:24,372
Well, you could
ask my mother

748
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,041
If she weren't
comatose.

749
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:28,443
That's your mother?
yeah.

750
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:32,147
I visit her every day
since the liver failure.

751
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:33,581
Wow.

752
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,617
I'm sorry to hear about that.

753
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:38,620
So you got
something to get
off of your chest?

754
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,356
Look, i know all about
your meetings with tina clark.

755
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:42,757
And i know you probably
paid her off

756
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:45,260
To go public about
her affair with dr. morgan.

757
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,896
And i got
a pretty good idea why.

758
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:49,397
You wanted
to become president.

759
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:50,932
[chuckles]

760
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
But not just so you keep
your foot on the necks

761
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:54,335
Of professors you don't like.

762
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,638
You wanted to control
the book.

763
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:59,908
Look, i'm going
to give you some advice,

764
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,343
And i suggest you don't
make me repeat it.

765
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:07,048
Now some of what
you think you know
may be true,

766
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,617
But it's just
part of the story.

767
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:12,187
How do you know
how much i know?

768
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:13,588
Because
if you knew more,

769
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:15,190
You wouldn't be
babbling about it
where they could hear.

770
00:33:15,257 --> 00:33:16,357
"they"?

771
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:19,294
Shut up and listen.

772
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:20,695
It's true.

773
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:23,098
I did pay off
dr. morgan's
stripper friend.

774
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:25,633
But only to make her
leave town.

775
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:27,135
Why?

776
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:29,170
I was trying
to help my friend.

777
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:30,772
It's the last decent
thing i've done

778
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,874
In a long,
lone time.

779
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:34,943
If you didn't leak it,
who did?

780
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,313
Just before i found out
about forrest--

781
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,782
Dr. morgan's affair,

782
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,351
I had a meeting with one
of my old classmates

783
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,922
Who was also one of
the college trustees.

784
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,692
We were reminiscing
about something,

785
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,595
And then suddenly
his face went blank.

786
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,166
I thought he was having
an episode of some sort,

787
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,501
But he wasn't.

788
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:00,735
And then he said...
joshua...

789
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:04,272
You are going to be
the next university president.

790
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,975
All you have to do
is nothing.

791
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,710
What are you talking
about, henry?

792
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:11,880
The next thing i know,
he was back to his
normal self

793
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,948
And apologizing
for having broken
my carafe.

794
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,484
Oh! i'm sorry.

795
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,754
Are you saying something
possessed your friend?

796
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:21,156
Look, i don't know
what happened.

797
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:22,624
All i know is,
the next day,

798
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,893
The rumors about
dr. morgan were
flying around.

799
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,595
I thought i was
the only one that
knew about it.

800
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:28,930
Well, who do you think
spread the rumors?

801
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,534
Two days after
i spoke to my friend,

802
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,435
I was recruited
by the board

803
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:37,038
To replace dr. morgan
as a candidate.

804
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:38,706
Now one by one,

805
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,875
Each candidate withdrew

806
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:44,813
As skeletons
began falling out
of their closets.

807
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:48,349
So you're asking me
to believe

808
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:51,519
That you had nothing
to do with the smear campaign

809
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:53,087
That got you appointed?

810
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:56,558
And who is this "they"
that is so desperate
for you to be president?

811
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,393
You already know
who they are.

812
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,030
You know what?
i'm done being toyed with.

813
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:04,966
The minute that you can
show me the slightest respect--

814
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,802
Why do you think
i have treated you
this way?!

815
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,838
Why do you think
i have tried

816
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:12,607
To chase you away
from this university?

817
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,076
I've been trying
to protect you.

818
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,644
You and melinda.

819
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,413
Melinda? how did you--

820
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,281
Look, i've said
too much.

821
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:21,583
Protect her from what?

822
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,084
Is it the shadows?

823
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:24,485
Are you trying to protect us
from the shadows?

824
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:26,421
Stop asking
so many questions!

825
00:35:26,488 --> 00:35:28,690
Don't ask any
questions at all.

826
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,868
Tina?

827
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,536
I really need
to talk to you.

828
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:43,171
Are you here?

829
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,273
Tina?

830
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:50,144
My husband and eli,

831
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:52,814
They spoke to morgan
and bedford.

832
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:54,282
I think
i understand now.

833
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,050
You died so young,
that's hard to accept.

834
00:35:56,118 --> 00:35:58,186
And you needed
someone to blame,
and these two men--

835
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,154
No, they had nothing
to do with how i died.

836
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:01,656
So then why have you
been haunting them?

837
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,458
I never haunted bedford.

838
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:07,762
And forrest, well,
i loved him.

839
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,764
But i was angry at him

840
00:36:09,832 --> 00:36:12,033
Until i heard what
you and your friends
were saying.

841
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:14,702
That he never
asked bedford
to chase you away.

842
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,238
Well, forrest was weak.

843
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:19,641
Just like i was.

844
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:22,277
He could never say no.

845
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:24,646
And bedford, well...
[scraping]

846
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:27,515
He was just trying
to protect his friend.

847
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,084
[whispering]
but the truth is,

848
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:32,787
They're the ones
who need protecting now.

849
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:34,188
From what?

850
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:38,960
I also heard what
you said about
president bedford,

851
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:42,230
About what he could
control as president.

852
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:43,698
You mean the book?
[scraping]

853
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,533
So i asked some questions.

854
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,969
You asked questions?
about the book?

855
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:49,370
Well, who did you ask?

856
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,606
Ghosts.

857
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:52,907
There's so many.
[scraping]

858
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:55,009
Especially here.

859
00:36:55,077 --> 00:36:58,846
In the hospital?
well, what do they say?

860
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,648
They were scared.

861
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:02,884
So they didn't say much.

862
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,719
Eli said that
something

863
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,221
Possessed a friend
of bedford's.

864
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:08,356
Is it the shadows?

865
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:10,425
Is that what the ghosts
are so scared of?

866
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,393
Is that what you're
trying to protect
bedford and morgan from?

867
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:16,898
Tina, please, what is
everyone so scared of?

868
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:20,034
[whispering]

869
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:21,970
Who's there?
[scraping]

870
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:25,306
Is anyone there?

871
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:28,376
Who are you?
is anyone there?

872
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:30,445
[breathing heavily]

873
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:33,081
[voices whispering]

874
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:35,350
[gasping]

875
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,818
No!

876
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:38,419
What are you?

877
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:41,222
[voices whispering]

878
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,324
What do you want?

879
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:44,926
[scraping]

880
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,203
Eli: so what was it?
a ghost?

881
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,072
Different than any ghost
i've ever met.

882
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,306
What do you mean?

883
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,708
It was like it could
get inside me,

884
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,744
And all i felt was
cold, fear and hate.

885
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,479
Then it just disappeared?

886
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,847
Sort of.

887
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:08,485
It was uncoiling like
this band of cold
slithering off me.

888
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,789
Tina's here.

889
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,257
She's just keeping
her distance.

890
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,759
Did you tell him
what i can do?

891
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,160
Yeah, i did.

892
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,929
A month ago, i would
have booted him
out of the hospital.

893
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,765
But recently,
you felt like
tina was here?

894
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,902
So this light
that she's supposed
to go into,

895
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,005
She stayed back
because of me?

896
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,340
You have
to ask her that.

897
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,843
Is she here?

898
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,482
I don't know
where to begin.

899
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,420
I'm so sorry
for what happened.

900
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,188
I was your teacher.

901
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,023
I never should have
let us get involved.

902
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,658
Tell him
that he's right,

903
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,129
But that it's
my fault just as
much as it is his.

904
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,432
She says
it's her fault, too.

905
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,534
But if i played a part
in leading her down
a path to her death...

906
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,436
No, i had
a pill problem

907
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,971
Long before
i met forrest.

908
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,440
Her addiction was there
long before you were.

909
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:07,010
So what's kept her here?
how can i help her move on?

910
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,813
I made so many mistakes.

911
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,682
Like not believing
in myself

912
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,652
And running away from
things when i really
should have faced them.

913
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,654
But the one thing
that i always did

914
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,857
Was i took
the easy way out.

915
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,626
You know, the easy money,

916
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,194
The easy relationship.

917
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:27,330
She always chose
the easy way out,

918
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,099
The easy relationship.

919
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,468
Didn't take any work.

920
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,004
Do nothing,
we stay together.

921
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,274
Do nothing,
and it eventually ends.

922
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,909
Eli: just like bedford.

923
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:39,976
That's what they told him,

924
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,745
Do nothing and you'll
become president.

925
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,481
Tina: but i'm not going
to do that now.

926
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,484
I'm not going to leave
forrest alone now,
or bedford.

927
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,352
Even he's not
to blame for this.

928
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,087
Tina, i know
you want to
protect them,

929
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,189
But i don't think
you can.

930
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,356
How do you know that?

931
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,258
You said it
yourself.

932
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,426
Ghosts are scared.

933
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,928
Whatever
this thing is,

934
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,931
It can hurt them,
and they don't have
the power to stop it.

935
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,566
Well then, who can?

936
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,634
I don't know.

937
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,536
But i'm going
to find out.

938
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,272
Tina, whatever
this thing is,

939
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,043
It can't mean more
than you being
where you belong.

940
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,712
Can you see the light?

941
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,549
Look for the light.

942
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,352
She can see it,
she just doesn't
want to go in.

943
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,389
If you want to help me,
move into the light.

944
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,260
Why?

945
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,596
All the time
that we were together,

946
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,599
I told myself
that i was good for you.

947
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,869
But i really wasn't.

948
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,471
I want to be good for you.

949
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,707
Once.

950
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,376
Please.

951
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,653
Tell him i don't know
if we were good
for each other...

952
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:05,795
But he--he was
the best thing i ever had.

953
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,298
I will.

954
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,525
Melinda: she's gone.

955
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:48,405
Please, mother,
chopin isn't muzak.

956
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,841
Now if you don't
pipe down,

957
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,045
I won't read you
your jane austen.

958
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,314
Where were we, hmm?

959
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,549

968

Leave her alone.

She's helpless.

970
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,645
She can't even
open her eyes,
for god sake.

971
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,549
In the middle
of the night,

972
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,484
When no one is looking,

973
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,788
I'm going to go
to that machine
over there,

974
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,192
The one
that keeps me alive,

975
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,561
And unplug it.

976
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:48,465
I will slowly die, josh.

977
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,133
It will be painful.

978
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,936
And it will be
on your head.

979
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,673
Why are you
doing this to her?

980
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,042
You have no right.

981
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,946
I've done everything
you've asked.

982
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,415
You've been sharing
our business.

983
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,418
That's not acceptable, josh.

984
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:11,287
You will pay a price.

985
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,090
I won't let you hurt her.

986
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,994
If i have to keep
a nurse in here
24 hours a day,

987
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,996
I will do whatever it takes.

988
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,798
Do you hear me?

989
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:22,932
Do you hear me?!
