1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,134
Previously on ghost whisperer...

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,334
No!

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,933
I want you to remember
me this way, please.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,566
No. not you.

5
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,100
- I will always love you, melinda.
- Oh, please not you.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,633
I am so empty without you.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,733
- I'm not going anywhere.
- No, you have to cross over.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't want to.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,800
Jim, no!

10
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,434
- You're back.
- Do I know you?

11
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,633
Look, I see the same guy that you see.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,167
Different hair, nose,
eyes. It's not jim.

13
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,654
I just know what I see
when I look in those eyes,

14
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,267
And jim is in there
somewhere. He just has to be.

15
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,867
Do you believe in the afterlife?

16
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,211
Wait, you're not gonna tell me you
think I'm your husband reincarnated,

17
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,967
Because you're the only sane
person I've met since I woke up.

18
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,467
It's not much, but maybe you
could help me finish my garage.

19
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,290
And you could live there
while you do the work,

20
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:51,933
Just until you figure
out your next move.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,134
Will you tell me what
is going on between us?

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,933
Do you know how lucky you are?

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,833
You are gonna get a second
shot at your one true love.

24
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,167
Oh! Oh. Hey. You're up early.

25
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,900
Hey, Sam. Yeah, just... you know.

26
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,666
Trying to be good.

27
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah, me, too. Get a workout in.

28
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,134
You want to, uh...

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,034
- Together?
- Ooh, I don't know.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,300
- No, that's stupid of me.
- I'm sorry. what?

31
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,596
This is probably a time when,
you know, you want to be alone.

32
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:07,267
- After what you've been through...
- No, it's not that.

33
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,267
- Get your stuff together.
- Right.

34
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,234
Something you probably did with
your husband, huh? in the morning?

35
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,067
- I don't want to get in your way.
- No. not at all. um...

36
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,900
He worked a lot of weird hours,
and liked to sleep in a lot.

37
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,267
You're really not in my way at all.

38
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:22,533
I should... well...

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,566
Ah, nice work, Sam. um...

40
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,800
Have a good morning. I'll run that way.

41
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,533
I'll go this way.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,700
- See ya.
- See ya.

43
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:42,112
Why couldn't I just say "your
legs are longer than mine,

44
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:44,367
"and I might not be able to keep up. "

45
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:45,666
What is so hard with saying that?

46
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,904
Well, it's probably
better than saying, "hey,

47
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,375
You're the love of my life in a
new body, "and every time I see you,

48
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,401
My knees go weak. "

49
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,700
Ugh. my knees, my legs.

50
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:58,267
I fumble with words, it's
like my voice gets shaky.

51
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,700
I'm a total dork... whoa!

52
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:04,734
Hey, Sam.

53
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,501
- Hey. How you doin', Sam?
- Hey, Delia. Hey look...

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,833
I've had this stuff in my truck
for a couple of days... unh!

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,557
And I've been meaning to give it to
you, but every time I see you, I just.

56
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,300
Forget.

57
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:19,221
It's not like I don't forget
everything else I've done in my life, I

58
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,495
mean. How to read a blueprint I made,

59
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,248
- the name of my dog.
- You have a dog?

60
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,000
No. but, I mean, that's what I
think about when I wake up, you know?

61
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,867
Anyhow, this is all yours
to keep, or sell, or toss.

62
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,566
Wow, you've got some nice things
in here. Where did you get them?

63
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:33,800
Well, I got a job doing some demo
on a big house off of route 18.

64
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:36,067
They're getting rid of all the hardware

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,367
- Do you have a first aid kit I can...
- It's ok. it's just a cut.

66
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,034
Here. here you go.

67
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,401
You look a little pale.

68
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:56,733
You have got to stop skipping breakfast.
It's, you know, low blood sugar.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah. yeah. um, you said
that there was more stuff?

70
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:03,434
Yeah, in my truck, but... There's
also tons more back at the site.

71
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,733
- Can I go look at it? Yeah,
- I was going there right now.

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,600
Yeah, we started the job
from the back of the house.

73
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,234
I don't know if the owner wants to
gut it or tear it down, but uh...

74
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,501
I don't think you're gonna find
too much high-end stuff here.

75
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,900
- Is there water around here anywhere?
- Water? why?

76
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,467
Well, the tiles. I just was...

77
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,367
I don't know. is there
a fountain or a pool?

78
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:33,401
There's a well right there. Is
that what you were looking for?

79
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,700
Why not, huh? It is a wishing well.

80
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,434
Careful what you wish for.

81
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,733
Are you sure this little girl is...

82
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,500
- What do you call it?
- Attached to him? No.

83
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,184
But as soon as Sam made his wish,
she was right out of the well,

84
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,167
- Standing next to him, warning.
- Warning you or him?

85
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,208
Who knows? maybe anybody who
comes by the well. But she was

86
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,133
- definitely focused on him.
- Well, do you know what he wished?

87
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,033
You got me.

88
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,841
It had to be to get his memory
back. And if so, what's the

89
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:57,900
problem? We all know it's jim's
spirit. You know it. even I know.

90
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,966
What? what's that look for?

91
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:05,167
- Believing me.
- So, what are you going to do?

92
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,467
Stop worrying about myself and
the things I can't control...

93
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,667
Help a dead little girl whose
spirit is stuck down a well.

94
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,567
- Do you know if she ever lived in the house?
- The last owner was a widow.

95
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:16,866
She had children, but no daughters.
The place is, like, 100 years old.

96
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,866
So, you're searching for what?

97
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,734
A missing or dead child
over the last century?

98
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,788
Basically. Or I wait until she
appears again and then try to

99
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:27,334
Figure out if her warning
was a threat or a promise.

100
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:42,400
It's still good. why
are they tossing it?

101
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,567
Contractor wants all new, you know?

102
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:57,434
Man, I think I just lost
an eardrum. You heard that?

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,734
Yeah, it was Bob's truck.

104
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,966
- But twice?
- I don't think so.

105
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,866
- Help me with this.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,966
Sam, you ok? yeah.

107
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,801
It's Melinda.

108
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,267
Hang on a second.

109
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,933
- You just got in. How did you get...
- Uh, naked? um, sorry.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,434
Let me turn down the radio.

111
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,067
Sorry. I had the radio on a little loud.

112
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,966
- Didn't you hear me?
- no. um...

113
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,100
Hang on a second.

114
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,067
So, uh, hey. what's up?

115
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,434
What happened? did you hurt yourself?

116
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,900
Well, not that I know of.

117
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:15,101
And nothing that my doctor here or
the one back home knows about, either.

118
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,067
What do you mean?

119
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,067
I thought it had something
to do with the car accident.

120
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,100
But that turns out to be
a straight up head injury.

121
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,833
I mean, sure. It could cause muscle
trauma. Why am I feeling it now?

122
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,600
- When did it start?
- Well, it's weird.

123
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,016
The first time I felt it, I heard a

124
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:35,634
car backfire. It was like a rifle shot.

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,900
I heard it twice, but
it only happened once.

126
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,767
I'm sure I just imagined it, but...

127
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,933
Well, don't brush it off. I
mean, it could be a memory.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,933
You know? one that you want to
forget, But it could lead to others.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,434
Well, I hope so. I mean, I'm
going through all these boxes,

130
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,933
All my old stuff. Just
trying to jog something loose.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,634
And? I don't know. I listen to cds,

132
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,490
I see pictures of people I'm
supposed to have known, you know?

133
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:02,280
I have a cell phone here. what do I do?

134
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,816
I call these people and say, "hey.

135
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,400
do you remember me?" 'cause I don't.

136
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:09,300
You said that it happened at
work. Were you near the well?

137
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,767
Nah, I was in and out of the house, you
know. Coming and going past the well.

138
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,300
And has anything weird happened
there? To you or anyone?

139
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,833
- No. not that I can think of. why?
- What about the owners? I mean,

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,701
Have you talked to anyone
who lived in the house?

141
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm just working for the contractor.

142
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:26,467
What are you getting at? why are
you so curious about the well?

143
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,767
I... it's my business.

144
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,900
In a way. you know? Antiques, wells...

145
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:35,100
I mean, there's actually a market for
that kind of thing, Believe it or not.

146
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,166
I should go.

147
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,900
All right.

148
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,300
Sorry about being naked.

149
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:52,500
Who are you? what do you want?

150
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,900
Look, talk to me, but
just leave him alone.

151
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:14,966
I made your, uh, chicken with the
tahini sauce. And a good salad.

152
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:16,634
good, you're eating.

153
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,133
Yeah.

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,500
That's me. I am eating.

155
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:26,067
Ugh. something that looks
inedible And totally raw.

156
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,600
Well, what'd you cook the chicken on?

157
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,334
- On? a pan.
- I mean what temperature?

158
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
I told you for an hour at...

159
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,701
Yeah, I did an hour.

160
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,000
In the oven?

161
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,701
In the oven? you...
you said on for an hour.

162
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,000
No. no, no, no.

163
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:44,433
That was the pan searing. I
said inside the oven at 425.

164
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,300
Well, I didn't hear that part.

165
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:57,435
Delia, I miss him so much.
He's keeping his distance

166
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:01,233
Because he thinks I'm
grieving. And the truth is...

167
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,801
I am.

168
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:07,801
I just miss him.

169
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,000
You know, and today...

170
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,833
Today he remembered
something from his life...

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,600
I mean Jim's. or at least I think
he did. Well, that's great, honey.

172
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,100
No, it's not. because...

173
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,734
He remembered being shot.
You know? and I-I think...

174
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,866
I think the ghost is responsible for
that If that's what he wished for.

175
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:29,634
I'm... I'm so sorry. It just scares me.

176
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,467
You know, what he
might have to go through

177
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:36,167
To come back to me. and...

178
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,400
What if he doesn't want to?

179
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,600
He already came back to you.
I want you to remember that.

180
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,634
Jim did all of this for you.

181
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,567
Could you just...

182
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:58,233
Stay on the phone with me
for, like, 5 more minutes?

183
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,534
Then I promise we'll both go to sleep.

184
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah, sure.

185
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,767
We can talk all night if you want to.

186
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,000
I warned you.

187
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,067
Stay away from the well.

188
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:56,100
My arms and legs. Did
someone do that to you?

189
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,500
Terrible things will happen
if you don't stay away.

190
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
So what is it about explicitly
being told to stay away

191
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,834
That inspires you to come
running to this house?

192
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:16,967
I can't exactly search for clues With
everyone working here, especially Sam.

193
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,400
How was she when you saw her
before? One piece or chopped liver?

194
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,467
She was all in one piece. Must
have happened after she died.

195
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:25,266
Yeah, for transport. For
some killers, dismemberment's

196
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,800
a fetish, But for most it's
a matter of convenience.

197
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,033
I mean, how else are you gonna
stuff the body in the trunk?

198
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,767
Your encyclopedic knowledge of
the depraved Is awe-inspiring.

199
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,166
And if you've got a crowbar
in that snazzy little tote,

200
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,700
I'll be impressed.

201
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,066
They didn't even lock it. Come in.

202
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,734
Look at all these
newspapers. Oh, my god.

203
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,500
Welcome to the nest
of the giant pack rat.

204
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,400
Who lived here?

205
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,166
A widow in her sixties. Heart attack.

206
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,800
You know they linked
hoarding to perfectionism?

207
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,634
It's ironic, isn't it? because people
who have it End up living like this.

208
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,667
Yeah. not the most inviting
place For a kid to visit.

209
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:09,333
Do you think that she was drawn to
the property Because of the well?

210
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,033
Maybe it's just where she wound up.

211
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,967
Nearest dispose-all where the
killer could dump her body.

212
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
Wait.

213
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:18,667
Swing that back over there.

214
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,267
What is that?

215
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,433
Forget transport. I'm thinking fetish.

216
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,734
How long has this house been empty?

217
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:36,133
I don't know. The widow
died a few months ago.

218
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,700
And has it always been empty, or
could someone else be living here.

219
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,433
I no longer care if the
neighbors call the cops.

220
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,634
What is this?

221
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,934
They're wishes.

222
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:55,467
A wish for new toys, A million dollars.

223
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:59,001
A teacup terrier who won't bite.

224
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,567
It's like they were
all written by children.

225
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,033
Santa would have been a better bet.

226
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,300
Wait, look at this one. This
looks like adult handwriting.

227
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,300
"I wish he could know she was here. "

228
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:20,934
I gotta say, It's awfully nice of
someone who chops up a little girl

229
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,901
To leave a note. for who?

230
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,500
The girl's father? wishing
he'd learn the truth?

231
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:29,600
So nice of that old lady pack rat
to save it. Um, she saved everything.

232
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,534
Meaning she had no idea there
was a little girl down the well?

233
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,134
Meaning we don't know if there's
a little girl in the well.

234
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,233
I'm not going down that well.

235
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,950
I don't care if you have
flippers and a mask in that bag,

236
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,600
- I'm not going.
- Ok, fine.

237
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,901
I just think she's haunting it 'cause
it has something to do with her death.

238
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,100
Good morning.

239
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,400
- Eli, right?
- Yeah. Sam, hey.

240
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:49,333
- We were just...
- We went to this, um...

241
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,667
It's early, right? Yeah. it's morning.

242
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm... I'm just gonna read the sports.

243
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,500
Maybe I'll remember what team I like.

244
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,634
Oh, hey. Melinda?

245
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,300
Remember you were asking me
about the history of that well?

246
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,467
You had a buyer or
something? Yeah, right.

247
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,023
Yeah. well, I asked around. it
turns out That the contractors

248
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:14,433
were hired by the old lady's
son. He pretty much owns it now.

249
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,700
He's staying at a
place called the, um...

250
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,000
Grandview Court. his
last name's Ackerman.

251
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,567
- Travis Ackerman.
- Great. thanks.

252
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,467
- Sure.
- Can I ask you a...

253
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,267
A strange question?

254
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,633
What did you wish for? At the well?

255
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,834
I can't tell you that.

256
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,134
Might not come true.

257
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,633
I cannot wait for this ghost to
cross over as soon as possible.

258
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Let's go see that pack
rat's son. Travis Ackerman.

259
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,400
- Let me do it.
- Are you sure?

260
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,201
Yeah no problem.

261
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,834
You said you called because you have a
buyer For some of the items at the house?

262
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,934
I thought that we got
anything of value out of there.

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,967
I was visiting a friend up
there, And I saw these dolls.

264
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:03,167
Dolls? Doll pieces.

265
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,201
That's weird.

266
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,900
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There was a... a pile of them.

267
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,800
You know? arms and legs.

268
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:12,400
They were next to a box of notes,

269
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:17,767
Or, um... wishes. Actually. I think.

270
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,934
You know what? I... I do know
what you're talking about.

271
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,433
I found a bunch of broken
dolls. They were yanked apart.

272
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,400
Um, somebody left them with a note

273
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,600
- At the foot of the well.
- The well?

274
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,266
Yeah, there's this old
well on our property.

275
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,533
It's a wishing well, actually.
Neighborhood kids knew about it.

276
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,134
I was already 15 when we
moved into that old place,

277
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:39,067
But, uh, every once in a
while,I would see them out there.

278
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:42,700
Of course,they would run the minute
anyone from the house came out.

279
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,734
- Why's that?
- You know, uh,

280
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,633
Old, creaky place near
the new subdivision.

281
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,533
We were instantly the spooky house.

282
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,333
I was going through a bit
of a rough patch at the time.

283
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,467
And I kinda figured if I could help

284
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,900
Grant some little girl's wish, why not?

285
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,101
So I, uh, I took the broken parts...

286
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,366
Which, big surprise, it
sounds like my mother saved,

287
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:08,900
And I, uh, I left a new doll.
And the next day, it was gone.

288
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,067
Did you have any idea who the girl was?

289
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,333
No. I only ever saw her from
a distance. She was alone.

290
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,366
No more than 10, long dark hair.

291
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:22,467
You know, the truth is I learned
to keep my distance from that well.

292
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:26,000
I kinda wish everyone would.

293
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,267
Why is that?

294
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:33,034
You'll think I'm nuts.

295
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:36,333
It's unlikely. I can usually tell.

296
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,067
All right. um...

297
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:45,000
When I was 18, i... I got a full
scholarship to an out-of-state school.

298
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:48,366
And then I found out that
my girlfriend was pregnant.

299
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,700
<i>I didn't say it was all your fault...</i>

300
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,567
You know, I saw my future slipping away.

301
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,967
I would be one more thing
that my mom could hang onto.

302
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,967
You know, me, Allison, and a
baby all stuck in that house.

303
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,900
- And...
- We will be happy.

304
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,201
I wished.

305
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:08,934
With Allison right there, I
wished... That she weren't pregnant.

306
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,400
I said I'd give anything.

307
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:17,900
Allison's car was parked out front,
Right along the side of the road.

308
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:22,834
And these, uh, these racers... these
cyclists Came flying down the hill.

309
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,500
And she got hit.

310
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:35,101
She lost the baby, and I went away to
school And she never spoke to me again.

311
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,233
So...

312
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,767
Wish granted.

313
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:46,934
But I'm sure that you don't
believe in All of that stuff anyway.

314
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,433
You'd be surprised what I believe.

315
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,667
Let me tell you what a friend
of mine saw down your well.

316
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,067
So just like that the son
agrees to drain the well?

317
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:59,538
It was an easy sell. The
ghost got the guy halfway

318
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,800
believing She was real
just by granting his wish.

319
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,967
He feels if she's down there,
the family deserves to know.

320
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:07,633
Well, that's cooperative. Not what
you'd expect from a brutal killer.

321
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,867
I didn't get that from this guy.

322
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:10,201
What about his mother?

323
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:13,167
She seemed like a nice lady
With an anxiety disorder.

324
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,667
What? what am I missing?

325
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,600
Well, I'm just thinking about
the wish That Travis had granted.

326
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,067
I mean, it certainly
proves the ghost's point.

327
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:22,467
Be careful what you wish for. Yeah,
but what caused the little girl's death?

328
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,067
Because she keeps
warning us against wishes

329
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,900
So it obviously has to be
something that she wished for.

330
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,366
That ought to be easy to figure out.
A little girl who wished for something.

331
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,867
Yeah, but maybe we have more than that.

332
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,690
I mean, now we know when
she lived, right? So what if

333
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,650
she's the girl that Travis
Ackerman saw leaving doll parts?

334
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:39,000
The severed doll parts.
It's got to be her.

335
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,300
Yeah, but when did she go missing?

336
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,201
Well, Travis said he
was 15 when he moved in.

337
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,500
Yeah, and he left for
school when he was 18.

338
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,201
And he's late 20s now.
I mean, how many girls

339
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:50,233
Could go deceased or missing
in Grandview in a 3-year span?

340
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:55,567
Gretchen Dennis. that's her.

341
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:58,067
Missing since 1996.

342
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,333
You were right. and,
uh... It's pretty awful.

343
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,767
I'm sorry. Thanks for doing this.

344
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:26,767
Yeah. yeah, um...

345
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:29,900
Is the girl here? I mean,
the spirit that you saw?

346
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:32,667
- No.
- Well, maybe, now that they've found her body,

347
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:34,034
she's at peace?

348
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:38,967
It's a step. What did
you tell the police?

349
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:41,034
Just that I was having it
drained before I sold the place.

350
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:44,900
You know, it's an insurance hazard
And I didn't want anyone getting hurt.

351
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:50,333
Um, Allison? could... Could
a ghost have done that to her?

352
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,101
I mean, caused an accident like that?

353
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:57,067
I don't know. maybe. I'm sorry.

354
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:36,433
Help me!

355
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,600
What? what is it?

356
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,398
The little girl.

357
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:49,667
She might not be the only one that died.

358
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,500
That was fast. Neighbors
have built a shrine already.

359
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:57,600
Yeah, it's all over the local news.
Gretchen's been missing for 12 years.

360
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,767
Are we gonna go talk to the
family? It seems a little soon.

361
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,067
No, the ghost.

362
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:06,134
Look at me, Clay! I
hate you! look at me!

363
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,533
Look at what you did to
me, clay. I hate you, clay.

364
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:15,034
What is it? what's
wrong? He did this to me.

365
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,367
He killed me. Who is that?

366
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,667
My brother.

367
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,967
I just can't believe that a little boy

368
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:31,000
would slice his sister into bits.

369
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,867
Oh, he could.

370
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:36,334
You're the search queen.
type in "sororicide".

371
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,767
That's sister-killing.
you'll get 100 hits.

372
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,767
Clay may have killed her,
but he didn't chop her.

373
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,934
- How do you know that?
- I just got an e-mail

374
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,833
From my friend down at the morgue.

375
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,566
Even after 12 years, her
skeleton was still intact.

376
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:51,034
There were some minor fractures, But
nothing that indicated dismemberment.

377
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,200
What about the boy? I mean, were
there any other bones down in the well?

378
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,967
Nope. one set of bones.

379
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:59,234
But you said he was a
vision, not a spirit, right?

380
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:02,633
So that means what happened to him Was
something the little girl experienced.

381
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,134
Ok.

382
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,533
What if the armless boy that
you saw Was clay's first kill?

383
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,000
And she witnessed it.

384
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,833
So if those were her dolls
that were chopped into pieces...

385
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,934
That could have been a warning.

386
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,667
She could have seen what her brother
had done And she was gonna narc on him.

387
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,134
And to shut her up, he
threw her down a well?

388
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,232
It's hard to believe.

389
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:22,733
But I guess either way, we
have to talk to the parents.

390
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,500
Melinda, they just learned that their
daughter Is never coming home alive.

391
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,833
Yeah, but they also don't know that
she still needs their help. and yours.

392
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,334
Look, Eli, I'm serious. You're a
very experienced grief counselor.

393
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,700
You saw the news you're here to help,

394
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,700
And you couldn't stop wondering about...

395
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,633
Gretchen's relationship
with her brother?

396
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,533
Are you asking us how
he handled the news?

397
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,566
Oh. well, he can't even talk
about it. But that's nothing new.

398
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:50,533
Clay...

399
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,367
Clay is so smart. He's
such a good athlete.

400
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,934
He was a great ball player.

401
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,466
But when Gretchen went
missing, he was devastated.

402
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,733
He lost interest in
everything. it was...

403
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,566
It was like we lost him, too.

404
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,600
How do you mean?

405
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:11,301
"survivor's guilt". That's what
the family therapist called it.

406
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:14,667
I understand. But is it
possible for Clay, Would

407
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:17,967
he have anything specific
to feel guilty about?

408
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:21,134
In terms of Gretchen?
did they get along?

409
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Well, they fought like any siblings.

410
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,667
- He was older.
- Typical boy.

411
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,733
And Gretchen was such a little girl.

412
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,000
It's gonna seem odd, but did
she like to play with dolls?

413
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:35,566
Don't most girls? What's odd about that?

414
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,067
Did Clay ever do anything to her dolls?

415
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:39,434
Not really.

416
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:42,000
Well, they... no, wait, Aaron, they did.

417
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:48,566
When, uh, when he was trying to get back at her
For who knows what, he hid them. all of them.

418
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:51,267
And Gretchen just about lost her mind.

419
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:55,067
And that was all the
ammunition he ever needed.

420
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:56,800
Aaron, do you remember that? yeah.

421
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,134
He used to do terrible things.

422
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,934
He would hide them, hang
them... Cut them into pieces?

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,800
Well, yeah.

424
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,000
I
- I know that that sounds awful,

425
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:12,367
But we just thought

426
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:16,000
That's the way kids are.

427
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,566
Aren't they?

428
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:22,200
I have a delivery for
Andrew's meatpacking.

429
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,267
I'm-I'm looking for the main office.

430
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,466
Third floor. I think someone's still
up there If you need a signature.

431
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:32,034
Oh, sorry about that. I'm on the clock.

432
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,267
Thanks. you're welcome.

433
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:04,301
No! no!

434
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,500
No, no, help!

435
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,000
Please, somebody help me! please!

436
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,066
Hello?

437
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,501
check this out. Can we talk later?

438
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:28,367
I called the brothther, Clay at home
and at work. He never called me back.

439
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:31,134
So, basically you're calling to tell
me That you have nothing to tell me.

440
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Sort of. you said the ghost was pissed

441
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,367
- I'm just saying...
- oh. well, that's great.

442
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,367
Well, thank you. um, ok. bye-bye.

443
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,767
- Morning.
- hey, good morning.

444
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,501
How are you? I'm good, I'm good.

445
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:41,367
And this is for you.

446
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:44,633
I knew you'd be in a bit of a rush. I
wanted to get it to you before you, uh...

447
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,167
Ate. or didn't. it's not too late. You're
not gonna be late for work, are you?

448
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,900
No. no, this is...

449
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,434
It's really nice of you.

450
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:55,900
It's payback for all the good stuff
You got me from the store. eat up, now.

451
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,566
How is it? good? bad?

452
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,367
Did you use orange rinds in the waffles?

453
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,900
Good! I did, yeah. orange rinds,

454
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:10,700
Organic maple syrup, a
little fruit, Roasted pecans.

455
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:11,900
Wait. you're not allergic to those?

456
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:13,300
No.

457
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:17,067
No, it's just something my husband did.

458
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:24,067
- Sorry.
- don't be.

459
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:26,134
Really.

460
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,134
It's perfect.

461
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,467
I'm sorry I keep bringing
him up. it's just...

462
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,833
How could you not?

463
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:39,733
Look, you can talk about
him to me anytime you want.

464
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,034
Anytime.

465
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,300
Which is something I have loads of now.
time. Oh, that's right. I heard the news.

466
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,200
- I'm sorry.
- whatever.

467
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,034
I guess all the work's been halted.

468
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,600
So it goes. They found the
body of a child in that well.

469
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:55,034
You know, the well you
were so curious about.

470
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,566
I gotta ask you, um...
What's the deal with that?

471
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:03,034
Um, I don't know. I hope maybe
the police can find out something.

472
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,300
I was really talking about you. You know, all
the questions you were asking about the well.

473
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,600
And then when we were there,

474
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:11,200
It's like you could sense something.

475
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,200
I mean, it freaked you out.

476
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:20,733
You're not psychic, are you? Uh, no.

477
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,234
No, I'm not psychic.
You're certainly popular.

478
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,833
Hello, Eli. Mel. this
time I have something.

479
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,100
Clay's dispatcher just called me back.

480
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,434
Seems our ghost has been hard at work

481
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,900
Putting Clay on disability leave.

482
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:34,666
What happened? He had an accident.

483
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,867
I know you're gonna say I was getting
ahead of myself, Reaching out to the brother

484
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:43,600
Who probably killed his little sister.
Manslaughter? murder? take your pick.

485
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,267
How about you start a phone call with,

486
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,401
"can you talk, or is this a bad time?"

487
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,367
No. I want you to pick one, seriously.

488
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:54,200
Oh, I get it. because
Sam might be there.

489
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:56,434
And you don't want him to
know you have superpowers.

490
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:58,200
- Right.
- Got it. will do.

491
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,067
But come on. you gonna pick or what?

492
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,733
I'm inclined to go with manslaughter,

493
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Gretchen's death being
some kind of accident.

494
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,167
But there's something
that keeps bothering me.

495
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:06,900
One-armed joe?

496
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,833
Ok, fine. that poor boy you
saw with his arm cut off.

497
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,134
You're thinking if
Clay did kill his sister

498
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,467
In some sort of weird, rough,
freak tumble play accident,

499
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:18,034
Who's the armless kid? Yeah,
and how is he related to Clay?

500
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,933
I called the school
looking for a yearbook.

501
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,267
See if you could I.d. old
joe as one of his classmates.

502
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:25,234
Then I remembered. Clay
was a little league star.

503
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,633
So maybe joe was one
of the kids on his team.

504
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,967
I don't know. maybe he's lost his arm In
some kind of freak accident that Gretchen saw.

505
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:34,000
- A double accident?
- yeah.

506
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:37,334
That's him. that's the boy I saw.

507
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,200
That's one-armed joe? That's
Clay Dennis, Gretchen's brother.

508
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,267
I'm telling you, that's him.

509
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,134
He can't be both Butcher and victim.

510
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,767
Gretchen blames him, so he
has to be involved somehow.

511
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,501
Well, if he wants to hang
onto the rest of his limbs,

512
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:48,633
He'd better start talking.

513
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:56,700
You know, the warning label on these
Says that you're not supposed to drive.

514
00:30:58,367 --> 00:30:59,733
I don't think that's a problem.

515
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,200
There's another warning
you should know. um...

516
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:08,401
I see spirits. I've seen your
sister. she's angry at you.

517
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,800
Ok. you saw my sister's ghost.

518
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:14,633
Yes. And the fact that I talk to ghosts

519
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,600
Is not something I like to admit

520
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,733
Unless I feel like someone's
life might be in danger.

521
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,666
Look, lady. what happened to my arm?

522
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:25,034
That was just a... freak thing.

523
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,566
No, I don't think so. It's too
similar to a vision that I had.

524
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,100
You were a kid, 10 or 11.

525
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:34,067
And that same arm was
injured. missing, in fact.

526
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:38,334
Ok, please stop. I know exactly
what you're talking about,

527
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,467
But how...

528
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,566
Oh, my god.

529
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:48,900
Because my sister told you.

530
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,200
In a way.

531
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:54,434
She showed me severed arms and legs.

532
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,666
I had no way to connect it,

533
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,234
Except to her dolls and
what you had done to them.

534
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,501
What I did to them.

535
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:05,401
She tell you what I did to
her? Did she tell you that?

536
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,666
I was so mean to her.

537
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:11,067
She was such a stubborn tag-along.

538
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:12,900
She was always getting into my stuff.

539
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,401
Move!

540
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:16,666
There were times when
I literally hated her.

541
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:20,100
This one time, I was convinced
that she slit my tires.

542
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,501
What is the matter with you?

543
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,401
I didn't touch your stupid bike!

544
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,967
I didn't do it, I promise!

545
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,067
So I went nuts on her dolls.

546
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:31,700
Hiding them, hanging them.

547
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:34,933
She'd run, tell my parents,

548
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,666
And write down in this little notepad of hers,
You know, about how she hated me right back.

549
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,633
Writing those stupid
notes won't do anything.

550
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,034
Shut up and leave me alone.

551
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:51,633
One day, I don't even know
what she did To bug me, really,

552
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,300
But I just chopped up all of her dolls.

553
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,501
<i>Mom! Clay killed my dolls!</i>

554
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,767
I got grounded for 2
weeks. I was home alone,

555
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,100
Saw her latest entry.

556
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,434
She'd torn out the page,
but I could see the imprint.

557
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,200
She wrote, "i wish Clay's
arms and legs were cut off. "

558
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:34,900
She wished for you the
same fate as her dolls.

559
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:39,566
And when my parents were gone,

560
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,434
I made that wish come true.

561
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:58,566
Help me! Is this what you
wanted? what did you do to me?

562
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:05,267
I tried to stop her before she
could call my parents or 911.

563
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,367
I heard the screen door
to the kitchen slam.

564
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:11,767
Gretchen, come back. it was just a joke.

565
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,467
She was already gone.

566
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,666
She didn't come back that
night. Or the next, or the next.

567
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:24,700
I don't know what I was thinking.

568
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:28,067
She was 8 years old.

569
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:35,100
I heard my mom sobbing every night.

570
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,666
"how could this have happened?"

571
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:41,200
I knew.

572
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:44,367
But what I didn't know Was
what happened to Gretchen

573
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,666
After I scared her away.

574
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,234
Do you?

575
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:55,800
No.

576
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:59,700
But I'll find out. I promise.

577
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,967
I saw you talking to him.

578
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:09,300
Gretchen, he didn't mean to hurt you.
He's been scared for you ever since.

579
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:13,067
I've been in the dark, In the cold.

580
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:15,034
All this time I was afraid to go home.

581
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,967
Because you thought
your wish had come true?

582
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,600
But he's fine. it was just a trick.

583
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,900
- No, he's not fine.
- he's alive,

584
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,600
And I'm dead and it's all his fault.

585
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:26,700
He would give anything to take it back.

586
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:32,167
There are no take backs
when it comes to the well.

587
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:33,967
Ask your friend Sam.

588
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:02,800
I don't get it. why is
the ghost going after Sam?

589
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:05,200
I thought she was mad at her brother.

590
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,066
I'm dealing with
an angry 8-year-old

591
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,233
Who keeps changing
the rules as she goes.

592
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,467
None of it explains how
she got down the well.

593
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:12,867
She wrote a note

594
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:15,901
Asking for the well's help
in punishing her brother.

595
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,567
That's how this all
started. but then, Eli and i

596
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:22,567
Found this With her
dolls at the old house.

597
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,901
"i wish he could know she was here. "

598
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:28,933
- Did her brother write this?
- no, I don't think so.

599
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,667
Where are those tiles that Sam brought?

600
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,534
I put them over here. I
wasn't sure if you were serious

601
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,700
About selling it as a garden fixture.

602
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:41,966
What do the tiles have
to do with any of this?

603
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,901
This is how I'm gonna get
Gretchen to tell me the truth.

604
00:36:56,467 --> 00:37:00,734
"make a wish of your very own.
"hide it deep within the stone".

605
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,066
Gretchen, you thought
the well had real powers

606
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,867
And that's how your brother got hurt.

607
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,667
Can I speak to her?

608
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:11,300
She's here. she's angry.

609
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:14,467
Like she was the time that she
made a wish Wanting to hurt you.

610
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,834
Hide it deep within the stone.

611
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,767
Is it still in the stone?

612
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,700
I watched it fall away over time.

613
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:24,600
Years and years I was down there.

614
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,200
Because of you.

615
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:29,734
Look, whatever she's saying,
Please just tell her I'm sorry.

616
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:32,200
She's sorry, too.

617
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:35,567
Even if she doesn't
remember feeling that way.

618
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:36,700
When you thought your wish had come true

619
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:40,400
And you saw your brother
bleeding, Maybe even dying...

620
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,267
You came here to take
back your wish, didn't you?

621
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,202
It was so hard to reach.

622
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:04,700
You said there were no
takebacks. You're right.

623
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,300
Even though you want to,

624
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,834
No one can change what's happened.

625
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,933
But you can grant one more wish.

626
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,134
You can help your
brother forgive himself.

627
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:22,467
All I ever wanted to do was be
with him. No matter what he did.

628
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:26,667
She always looked up to you.
She wanted to be with you.

629
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,800
But I was so mean to you.

630
00:38:29,966 --> 00:38:32,867
And you were just a kid.

631
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:38,067
You were a kid, too. Will you tell
him I love him and forgive him?

632
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,467
I will. She understands now.

633
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:43,534
That it was a horrible accident.

634
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:50,233
Same goes for you.

635
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,500
She wasn't in the well when
your girlfriend had her accident.

636
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:57,700
There was no spirit, no magic.
You didn't make that happen.

637
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,634
Yeah, I didn't need a ghost's help.

638
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,033
I mean, I might not have gotten what I
wanted, But I definitely got what I deserved.

639
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Allison, are you ok? Go away!

640
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,200
- Allison...
- get away from me!

641
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,400
Still, I can't help but wishing...

642
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:16,000
Wishing you did something
different. So does she.

643
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:18,066
Who?

644
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,667
The woman who left the note.

645
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:24,467
The one who came here
With your daughter.

646
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:28,634
Of course. The other note.

647
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,434
"i wish that he could
know she was here. "

648
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,534
Wha... what other note?
what is she saying?

649
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,933
I think she's talking
about your girlfriend,

650
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Allison.

651
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:18,834
12 years. and she'd been
living here the whole time.

652
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:23,500
In Lewiston. half an
hour away. She was hurt.

653
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,066
Let him think that she had lost the baby

654
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,333
So she wouldn't force a child on him.

655
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:29,300
Didn't she think he
have the right to know?

656
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,167
I think she wanted him, too.

657
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:34,600
It's just, as the years passed,
It got harder to tell him.

658
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,933
So, the visits to the well. I guess so.

659
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,233
So far, so good. right.

660
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:49,834
What? is she here?

661
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:53,167
Figured while I'm here, I
might as well help people.

662
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:56,966
Like your friend Sam. Sam?

663
00:40:57,033 --> 00:41:01,100
It was dark for so long.

664
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,801
Now it's so warm and bright.

665
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:06,400
What did you do for Sam?

666
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,933
I gave him what he wanted.

667
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,367
Something he really wanted.

668
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,700
Turns out it was
something he already had.

669
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,300
What?

670
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:20,767
A piece of his life back.

671
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:39,033
Which life?

672
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:49,033
Thank you.

673
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,100
It's been kind of a weird day, And I didn't
know who else I could talk to about it.

674
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:24,966
Ok.

675
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:29,333
I was going through all my
stuff, And I found a key.

676
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,434
I know it's strange, I've been
hoping... Wishing for a clue.

677
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,233
Something to tell me who I was. Right?

678
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,200
Guess I got more than I bargained for.

679
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:57,367
Are you sure this belongs to you?

680
00:42:57,434 --> 00:43:01,100
Yeah. My name was right
on the receipt, Sam Lucas.

681
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:03,100
I bought that less than a month ago.

682
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,300
Question is,

683
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,000
Who did I buy it for?

684
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:13,601
