1
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,180
Forty-love!

2
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,700
This is match point. You ready?

3
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,660
Finally. Let's get it over with.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,930
Ace!

5
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,220
I hope you're not going easy on
me 'cause i'm new around here.

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,820
Easy? What, that was brutal!

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,910
My sweat has sweat.

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,320
What, are you some kind of
tennis hustler or something?

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,120
Figure new town, new school,
new unexpecting kids to beat?

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,820
Hey, i didn't take
your money or anything.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,980
No, just my self respect. Look out!

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,130
Diana, i told you, follow through.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,450
It's all about the
follow through. Come on.

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,320
Any day now.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,640
You're welcome.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,830
What was that all about?

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,010
You know diana morrison?

18
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,660
I used to, back when i lived
in grandview the first time.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
We were friends.

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,820
It was like a million years ago.

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,920
Diana? Somebody help!

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,550
Diana, please!

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,510
What's happened?

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,200
Diana! Diana, diana! Please wake up!

25
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,110
She just dropped out of
nowhere, she won't respond!

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm calling
9-1-1.

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,980
- I'll stay here. Go get help.
- Ok.

28
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,160
Diana, it's olivia.

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,230
Diana, please wake up!

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,410
Yes, we need an ambulance.
Grandview park at the tennis courts.

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,940
- A girl's collapsed.
- Why won't you wake up? What's wrong with you?

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,620
Diana... Diana!

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,340
- Thank you.
- Sure.

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,830
- Thank you, nurse. Jim.
- Hi, doctor.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,960
Melinda, how you feeling?

36
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,010
I feel ok.

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,680
No more nausea, light-headedness?

38
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,070
Um, no.

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,780
Well... You're not pregnant.

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,180
Yeah, we-- we
figured as much.

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,170
Yeah, that's what the
pregnancy test said, too.

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,870
All ten of them.

43
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,070
So then... Everything
that i was feeling...

44
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,630
It was all just in my head?

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,050
No, you did conceive, but your
body didn't support the pregnancy.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,140
Doc, what does that mean?

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,940
If you're worrying about your
chances of having a baby, don't.

48
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,690
There's plenty of treatable
conditions that can account for this.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,360
Let me run some tests, and
we'll go from there, ok?

50
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,100
Ok.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,910
The nurse will schedule
your next appointment.

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,910
Thanks.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,330
I never really figured
it would be this hard.

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,730
It's gonna be ok.

55
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,440
We're gonna make this happen, together.

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,830
You need to finish your
shift. Go, i'll be ok.

57
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,730
- You sure?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,240
'Cause you can hold on to
my hand as long as you want.

59
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,750
Sorry.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,310
I love you. I'll see you later.

61
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,320
Coming in!

62
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,430
Doc, bp 75 over 42. Pulse
is rapid and irregular.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
I want an ecg and a chest x-ray.

64
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,100
- And get me a consent to treat.
- I'm on it!

65
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,890
Do we have her name?

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,370
Diana morrison.

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,560
Dorothy?

68
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,830
Ned, what are you
doing here? Are you ok?

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,620
Yeah, i'm fine. We're both fine.

70
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,890
One, two...

71
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
Girl collapsed on the tennis courts.

72
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,150
Olivia and i wanted to
make sure she was ok.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,640
She has to be ok.

74
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,090
- Olivia!
- Mom!

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,620
I went to the courts to pick
you up but you weren't there,

76
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,070
And they said a girl had collapsed!

77
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,930
- I thought that--
- i'm fine, mom.

78
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,810
I'm sorry for scaring
you. I should have called.

79
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,670
It's diana.

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
Diana morrison?

81
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,970
Where's diana morrison? I'm her mother.

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,810
They told me she was here.

83
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,810
Olivia?

84
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,490
What are you doing here?

85
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,960
Mrs. Morrison, i was
at the courts with ned.

86
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,970
Diana was there, too.

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,150
She was taking a lesson, i guess.

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,170
She just collapsed.

89
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,120
Was it heat stroke?

90
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,630
She must have just fainted.

91
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,380
She barely ate any breakfast.

92
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,290
No!

93
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,570
No!

94
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,460
Time of death...

95
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,240
What do you mean, time of death?

96
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,060
You all right? Did you know this girl?

97
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,050
No, no, i'm fine. Um,
time of death, 3:49.

98
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,290
What just happened?

99
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,380
Do you know me?

100
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,660
Wait!

101
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,990
Answer me!

102
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,310
What just happened?

103
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,110
Are you the doctor?

104
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,480
When can i see her?

105
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,410
Your daughter suffered
a blood clot in her lung.

106
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm very sorry.

107
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,190
We did everything we could, but we weren't
able to revive your daughter, and she died.

108
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,090
No, no! Not diana!

109
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,730
No! Not my little girl!

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,510
No!She
can't--

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,670
is there anyone we can call?

112
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,020
A spouse, another family member?

113
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,440
No, it's just me and diana.

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,390
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,570
No...

116
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,180
No, let's go.

117
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,910
Mom, she doesn't have anyone!

118
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,860
We're probably just making it
worse. Come on, we don't belong here.

119
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,370
Is diana here?

120
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah.

121
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,090
She's with her mom. I think she
wanted to say goodbye before moving on.

122
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,330
Or maybe not.

It's crazy. It just makes no sense.

127
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,780
I know. 16 years old, way too young.

128
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,140
Is eli talking to the kids?

129
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,070
Yeah, ned says he's helping a lot.

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,880
And thank you so much for
suggesting him for that.

131
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,360
He's a good therapist.
He really listens.

132
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,760
Well, when you told me how important
diana and her mom were to everyone--

133
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,620
Ooh, let me give you a hand.

134
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,740
Yeah, all the kids in the neighborhood
used to go over there and play.

135
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,700
They just had one of those homes,
you know, very warm and inviting.

136
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,060
Everyone loved them.

137
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,760
Except for olivia's
mom, from what i saw.

138
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,860
I just don't get that.

139
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,740
Well, it seemed mutual.

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,690
You know, maybe it's just because
cynthia was worried about her daughter.

141
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,480
No, it seemed like
something more than that.

142
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,930
I mean, ned said that the daughter
was chilly with olivia at the court.

143
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,430
She might have just been
feeling sick, you know?

144
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,390
Yeah, maybe, but it didn't end there.

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,160
Meaning?

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,700
What? Was there a
ghost? Did you see diana?

147
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,940
Are you sure you want to know that?

148
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,180
Anything's better than thinking a
spirit that young would just vanish!

149
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,580
She didn't vanish. I
saw her at the hospital.

150
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,430
Well, did she say anything?

151
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,280
I mean, did she go into
the light or whatever?

152
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,280
Impressive!

153
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,780
No, she went in a different direction.

154
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,060
She followed olivia and her mom home.

155
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,130
Well, what does that mean?

156
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,000
Mmm, my experience? Nothing good.

157
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,310
What can i say?

158
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,650
Mom, dad, are you back?

159
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,620
Hello?

160
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,300
Is someone here?

161
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,480
Hello? Is someone here?

162
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,530
Hello?

163
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,820
Mr. Or Mrs. Keller, please.

164
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,620
No, they're not in right
now. Can i take a message?

165
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,500
I can't hear you! Who's calling?

166
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,510
What's happening?

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,080
If there's anything we
could do, Mrs. Morrison...

168
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,480
Just don't be strangers.

169
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,660
My home will always be open to you kids.

170
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,360
Techno spook by the computer.

171
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,260
Scary.

172
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,600
Where did you hear that?

173
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,610
Olivia was telling some of her
girlfriends this morning at assembly.

174
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,080
- I'm really sorry, Mrs. Morrison.
- Is that olivia with diana's mom?

175
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,450
Yeah.

176
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,330
Well, that didn't seem to go very well.

177
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,340
Let's go see what's going on.

178
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,580
Olivia?

179
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,430
My name is eli james.

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
I'm a therapist over at rockland u.

181
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,790
I was asked to come here today to speak
to your fellow schoolmates about your loss.

182
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,720
Yeah, i've seen you around.

183
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,150
Ned said, uh, you two were
there when it happened?

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, whatever it was.

185
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,750
Does anyone know how
she got sick like that?

186
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,560
I haven't heard anything yet.

187
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,810
When's that picture from?

188
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,970
It's you and diana, right?

189
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,770
Yeah, we were, like, 7 or 8.

190
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,040
See that cast on her leg?

191
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,020
She just had her ankle surgery, and
i signed her cast right there, "ok."

192
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,240
my ironic initials.

193
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,240
You said you and diana
used to be friends?

194
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,970
Yeah, the first time
i lived in grandview.

195
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,060
It's ancient history.

196
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Olivia, i do this a lot, and i promise
you, if you're feeling bad about something,

197
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,440
Talking about it always makes it better.

198
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,330
When we were little, our moms were such
good friends that we did everything together.

199
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,720
It was almost like we were sisters.

200
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,500
With play dates and sports and camping.

201
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,510
We even have the same birthday, so our parties
were like this whole big deal every year.

202
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,890
And what happened?

203
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,070
It just ended.

204
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,640
I remember one night i woke up,
and my mom was in bed with me,

205
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,860
And she was rocking me,
just crying and crying.

206
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,270
I asked her what was wrong, but all
she would say was that she loved me.

207
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,530
And then after that, everything changed.

208
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,120
Diana's mom and dad split up,
we stopped hanging out with them,

209
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,090
And then we got transferred to texas.

210
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,010
Or my dad, so we left.

211
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,620
Did you and diana keep in touch?

212
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,040
We tried, or at least i did.

213
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,040
I wrote her and stuff, but
she never wrote me back.

214
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,780
I guess diana made new friends.

215
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,240
My mom said that i should, too.

216
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,280
She told me to forget about
her. It was really weird.

217
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,690
It was like she was mad at her, too.

218
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,210
Well, what happened when
your dad got transferred back?

219
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,930
She didn't write me in 8 years.

220
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,940
I mean, why would she
want to be my friend now?

221
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,690
She didn't need me when
she had all of this.

222
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,630
What's dad doing here?

223
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,580
Excuse me, i better go.

224
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,060
What's that all about?

225
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,160
If it looks like a duck,
quacks like a duck...

226
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,710
Get your mind out of the gutter.

227
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,400
She pulled him aside, she hugged
him, she whispered sweet nothings...

228
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,920
It was a prayer vigil.
Who didn't she hug?

229
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,990
Forget my masters in
clinical psych for a minute,

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,240
Which i'd like to forget 'cause
i'm still paying off the loans,

231
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,020
And let's just look at the
circumstantial evidence.

232
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,090
What evidence?

233
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,440
Two women who used to be best
friends suddenly become enemies

234
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,980
And don't give their kids a reason.

235
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,390
Yeah, but that still doesn't explain the
ghost's weird behavior at the hospital,

236
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,920
Or following the wrong family home.

237
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,650
Maybe diana knew about
the affair before she died.

238
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,300
Maybe that's why she was so nasty
to olivia at the tennis courts,

239
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,730
And then went to her house to haunt her.

240
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,090
Unless...

241
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,420
Unless?

242
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,580
Diana found something out at the
hospital that proved more than the affair.

243
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,560
What if she found out something
that proved everything?

244
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,300
I'm gonna have to buy a vowel.

245
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,650
Ok, what if olivia's dad was her dad, too,
and she found that out in the hospital records?

246
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,550
Well, that would explain
why he was at the vigil.

247
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,010
I mean, if he lost a daughter, too...

248
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,200
Yeah, and why diana went home with
the kellers instead of her own mom.

249
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,630
Olivia could be the half-sister
she never knew she had.

250
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,430
Or wanted.

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,540
Making olivia's dad...

252
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,630
The man who ruined everything.

253
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,240
Hey, kiddo. Oh, god, you startled
me. What are you doing up?

254
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,090
I can't sleep again.

255
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,890
Thinking about diana?

256
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,760
Um, mom won't even talk to me about her.

257
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,310
I know that we weren't friends
at the end, but she died.

258
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,200
What happened, dad?

259
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,520
I mean, with mom and Mrs. M.

260
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,780
How can mom be so cold
to her, especially now?

261
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,410
If you know, please tell me.

262
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,830
Honey, i just think that...

263
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,470
I don't know, maybe there's
a little guilt, 'cause...

264
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,420
We still have you.

265
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,520
Did you hear that?

266
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,550
It's the same noise that
i heard the other night.

267
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,910
It's coming from
upstairs. It's the attic.

268
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,140
- Wait here, ok?
- No way.

269
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,220
Dad, i'm scared.

270
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,770
Don't worry, honey. It's probably
just rats in the rat traps.

271
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,650
Those are no rats.

272
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,780
That's strange.

273
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,940
- Dad!
- Honey, are you ok?

274
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,650
Yeah!

275
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,260
it's diana, i know it is.

276
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,490
My dad claims that there's some
sort of reasonable explanation,

277
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,730
Although he sure isn't
coming up with one.

278
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,900
So what is he saying?

279
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,350
Not to tell my mother.

280
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,330
He says that he doesn't
want to worry her.

281
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,890
But he went to work, and my
mom's out, and i'm so scared.

282
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,660
She keeps doing it!

283
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,220
I put them away so many times, and
she keeps bringing them back out.

284
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,530
Diana did this.

285
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,870
You believe me?

286
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,600
Yes.

287
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,780
We both do.

288
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,580
Why?

289
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,480
Because i can see spirits.

290
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,140
I've seen diana's. I watched her
follow you home from the hospital.

291
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,700
That's why ned wanted
you to meet with me.

292
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,870
Do the photos always look like this?

293
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,150
Yeah, each time i
found them the same way.

294
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,730
Starting with photos of my mom
and dad growing up, their wedding,

295
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,450
And all of my baby
photos up through now.

296
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,590
It's like the whole family
history laid out in photos.

297
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
And then there's the phone calls.

298
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,160
Phone calls?

299
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,610
Yeah, it rings, i answer, and i can
hear someone trying to say something.

300
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,170
Does it sound like diana's voice?

301
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,860
No, it sounded like a woman,
but it's totally garbled.

302
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,990
And then it's cut off by
this awful screeching sound.

303
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,220
Um, where's your telephone?

304
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,560
It's in the kitchen.

305
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,200
Please tell me you have caller I. D.

306
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,670
Ok, so you said that the last
interrupted call came in...

307
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,050
About an hour ago.

308
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,200
Got it.

309
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,980
No! It's happening again.

310
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,830
It's ok. We're here.

311
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,640
She's gone.

312
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,680
Why does diana care
about me and my family?

313
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,280
I don't know.

314
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,400
But i think i know someone who does.

315
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,590
I'm looking for a nurse,
but i don't know her name.

316
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,040
She was working the E. R.when that
high school kid died, diana morrison.

317
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,650
Is there anything i can help you with?

318
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Well, it was just a tough day, and so i wanted
to thank her for reaching out to the family.

319
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,240
Her name is perry, dorothy perry.

320
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,620
I'm sure she'd appreciate it, if she were
here, i know she was trying to make some copies,

321
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,280
And a phone call, and...

322
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,670
Nothing was working for her.

323
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,250
Is there a copier nearby?

324
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,940
Um, the records room on the third floor.

325
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,560
Great. Thank you.

326
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,040
What is going on here?

327
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,240
Hello? Anybody there?

328
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,970
Wait, nurse perry! Nurse perry!

329
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,970
I just want to talk!

330
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,560
Oh, my god! Please,
somebody, help me! Help!

331
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,480
The word is, she's going
to be out for a while.

332
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,860
They've got her on heavy
painkillers and anti-anxiety meds.

333
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,310
Did you get anything else?

334
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,350
Oh, yeah. She got
worked over pretty good.

335
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,460
Head laceration, 2 broken ribs,
hairline fracture of her collarbone.

336
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,460
Diana was so angry at her.

337
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,310
Yeah, mel, how was an E.
R.nurse involved in this?

338
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,310
I think she was on the phone with olivia's
family trying to tell them something.

339
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,090
When i saw her, she was
coming out of the record room.

340
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,360
Melinda, come on, it's one thing to go asking
around about a medical condition, it's another to--

341
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,810
Yeah, but we still don't know
what caused diana's death!

342
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,220
I don't think the answer is in
those records. Those are old records.

343
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,020
Maybe it was something else.

344
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,530
Maybe something in diana's past
that the doctor should have seen.

345
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,520
Maybe they made a mistake.

346
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,460
I mean, she was a
healthy 16-year-old girl.

347
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,150
Ok, then if that's the case, why is the
ghost haunting olivia and her family?

348
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,700
I don't know.

349
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,200
The girl is dead, a woman is
hurt, and i am out of theories.

350
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,020
Please. All i need is 10 minutes.

351
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,840
Here's m.

352
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,310
Moore, moriarty.

353
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,750
Where's morrison?

354
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Missing. Hold on a second.

355
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,430
These must be waiting to be re-filed.

356
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,650
There you go.

357
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,800
Her medical records.

358
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,030
These are from like 8 years ago.

359
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,180
Oh, looks like she had an operation.

360
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,350
Fractured her ankle.

361
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,010
And diana's birth record.

362
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,890
Mr. Keller's not listed as her father.

363
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,310
Why would a nurse want
copies of this stuff?

364
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,110
Wait a minute, this
is weird. Look at this.

365
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,070
Her blood type on her surgery record doesn't
match her blood type on her birth record.

366
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,980
A. B.,

367
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
O.

368
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,420
Do hospitals make mistakes like that?

369
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,830
It's possible, but rare.

370
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,080
Or maybe there's another possibility.

371
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,430
I saw the records she put together.

372
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,330
I know why you're angry, but i think
she was trying to do the right thing.

373
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,350
She wanted the truth to come out.

374
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,070
There are some mistakes
that you can't fix!

375
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,180
I found that out the day that i died.

376
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,250
Answer me!

377
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,500
What just happened?

378
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,190
I followed her to the records room.

379
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,340
And right away, i saw something weird.

380
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,980
What are you looking for?

381
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,830
And that's when i
realized what happened.

382
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,160
Olivia and i were switched at birth.

383
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,930
The blood types didn't match, i know.

384
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,260
But that's not what was
really upsetting her.

385
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,780
She looked so guilty!

386
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,150
What have i done?

387
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,860
Like she had done something awful.

388
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,910
You were there the day i was born, too?

389
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,840
And that's when it hit
me-- it was her mistake.

390
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,110
That's how she knew to look
in those files. It's her fault!

391
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,220
Look, i know that you're upset, but i...

392
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,170
I think it was just a mistake, you know?

393
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,220
A stupid accident.

394
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,020
Do you want to know what's stupid?

395
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,550
How could i not have known?

396
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,560
I mean, we even have the same birthday!

397
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,540
And my-so called family?

398
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,320
My mom is blonde, blue-eyed,
a semi-pro tennis player.

399
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,340
So i always told myself that i sucked
at tennis because i took after my dad.

400
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,310
Well, it turns out, i do take after
my mom, i just had the wrong one.

401
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,270
Look, i know that this is painful, but i can
help you, talk to your mom, your birth family.

402
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,820
No! They can't know.

403
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,480
Well, i think you need them to.

404
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,230
That's why you went to
the keller's house, right?

405
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,030
So that you could reconnect
with the family you came from?

406
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,430
You need to make peace with
this so that you can move on.

407
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,040
That woman's mistake has
caused enough damage already.

408
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,500
Well, you don't control that
anymore.I know that's upsetting, but--

409
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,460
take a look at that nurse and
tell me what i can and i can't do.

410
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,170
I will do whatever i have to do.

411
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,360
No one can find out.

412
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,500
Hi, Ms.perry.

413
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,320
Um, my name is melinda gordon and i'd like
to talk to you, if you're feeling up to it.

414
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,760
You're the one who came
looking for me when i fell?

415
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,660
Yes.

416
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,500
I thought you might have some
information on diana morrison,

417
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,560
And now i couldn't be
more certain that you do

418
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,910
i know what happened the
day that diana was born.

419
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,340
I know that she was
switched with olivia keller.

420
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,740
Look, i know that you're scared.

421
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,520
A lot of really strange things are
happening to you, but trust me--

422
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,880
They won't end until
you admit what you did.

423
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,560
What i did?

424
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,520

No!I--

425
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,090
i was there when it happened, but i'm
not the one who switched those girls.

426
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,990
Ok, the day that diana morrison was born,
there'd been this huge accident on the interstate.

427
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,800
We were understaffed and overwhelmed.

428
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,580
The bracelet must have
come off in the bath.

429
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,570
The charge nurse seems confused.

430
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,270
Um, is everything ok?

431
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,600
You were sent to room 214.

432
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,560
You got to get Mrs. Keller
up and walking. Go, now!

433
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,150
I was fresh out of nursing school.

434
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,610
I was trying to learn without
asking too many questions.

435
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,400
What could i do? I didn't have
any proof. It was just a feeling.

436
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,220
But i did remember those girls' names.

437
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:06,420
Then i saw the mothers bonding
and talking in the hallways, and...

438
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,980
Cradling their babies.

439
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,610
And then you saw them
again 16 years later.

440
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,500
I recognized her name when
the paramedics brought her in.

441
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,230
Do we have her name?

442
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,880
Diana morrison.

443
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,940
Circumstances of her death, the blood
clot, it made me wonder all over again.

444
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,170
So i pulled the girl's medical records.

445
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,520
That's what confirmed it.

446
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,200
You know, i've been trying to
contact the families ever since.

447
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,380
It's just that some...

448
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,010
Something just... Doesn't want to let...

449
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,900
What's happening to me?

450
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,920
Look, it's gonna be ok.

451
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,630
You suspected for 16 years.

452
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,040
I need to know why you're so
determined to tell them now.

453
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,720
Because the blood clot that killed
diana was a genetic condition.

454
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,960
It could affect someone else
in her biological family.

455
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,100
They have to be told.

456
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,480
That's a tough one, even for you.

457
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,690
I have to tell them, obviously.

458
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,210
I mean the kellers need
to know about the disease,

459
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,370
and then cynthia morrison's
going to find out.

460
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,520
I just don't know what's going to
happen to the ghost or the families.

461
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,540
I can't even imagine.

462
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,150
I mean, mourning your child,
only to find out she isn't yours.

463
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,680
And then the child that is
yours, belongs to someone else.

464
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,290
Olivia's parents, too.

465
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,230
I mean, their birth child is dead.

466
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,070
They're never going to
get to know her as theirs.

467
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,840
I guess that's why diana's been fighting
so hard to keep this all a secret.

468
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,530
It's all just to protect
everyone from the big bombshell.

469
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,770
Who do you tell first?

470
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,010
I think i have to start with
the woman who raised her.

471
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,130
So kind of you to bring this by.

472
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,150
I think everyone misses diana.

473
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,240
I know that ned does.

474
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,500
Oh, he's a sweet boy.

475
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,920
Is that how you know my
daughter, through ned?

476
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,780
What are you doing?

477
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,620
I warned you not to do this!

478
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,050
Actually, i didn't know
diana when she was alive.

479
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,760
But i've talked to her recently.

480
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,350
I see earthbound spirits.

481
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,450
That's how i know that diana's here.

482
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,330
I came here because she's not at peace,
and there's a reason why she can't move on.

483
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,060
I don't understand. Is
this some kind of joke?

484
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,770
No, this is... It's very real.

485
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,160
Diana's been trying to
protect you from something,

486
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,160
But i think it's something you should know,
because it's going to come out eventually.

487
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,990
You have no right to do this!

488
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,310
Who do you think you are?

489
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,740
I spoke to a nurse at mercy
hospital, dorothy perry.

490
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,730
She was there the day that diana
died, and the day that she was born.

491
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,700
The same day that
olivia keller was born.

492
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,690
Stop it! Stop!

493
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,650
Why is this suddenly coming out now?

494
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,900
Who told you about all this?

495
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,080
You know what i'm talking about?

496
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,260
Mmm, i have a pretty good feeling.

497
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,240
What?

498
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,820
How did you find out?

499
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,990
I saw a blood panel from the ankle
surgery she had when she was 8.

500
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,470
Is that when you realized the truth?

501
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,980
No, it was long before that.

502
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,470
I've known diana wasn't mine
almost as long as i've had her.

503
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,970
That's impossible. You
never said anything.

504
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,830
Please.

505
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,570
I had a long labor,
and so did lisa keller.

506
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,930
We met walking the halls,
passing the time together,

507
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,830
waiting for it to happen.

508
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,970
Both having girls, excited.

509
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,540
And we just became friends.

510
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,330
There's so much joy.

511
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,120
And then what happened?

512
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,170
Then i brought diana home,
and something felt off.

513
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,620
Everybody thought it was post-partum
depression, and at first, so did i.

514
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean, i love my little girl.

515
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,910
But that feeling didn't go away.

516
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,320
So, when did you suspect
that diana wasn't your baby?

517
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,100
As they started to grow older,
i started to notice similarities

518
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,830
Between me and olivia that
i didn't notice with diana.

519
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,270
When she played tennis,
she played like me.

520
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,150
She had my mother's eyes.

521
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,140
And sometimes, when i looked at her and she
smiled, i felt like i was looking at a mirror.

522
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,720
What about when you looked at me?

523
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,530
Did you contact lisa keller?

524
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,260
Not until the pre-surgery
blood work confirmed it.

525
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,120
That's when i called lisa.

526
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,430
How did she react?

527
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,840
She didn't believe it.

528
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,930
Refused to have olivia tested.

529
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,240
She cut off all contact.

530
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,800
They moved to texas.

531
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,520
She said it was for kevin's job.

532
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,580
She was running away from
the uncomfortable truth.

533
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,080
So my own mother didn't want me,
and you couldn't get rid of me?

534
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,370
- Let her explain.
- She already has.

535
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,170
And if they loved the two of us so little,
then they won't miss us when we're both gone!

536
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,890
What's going
on?Is, uh, diana--

537
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,230
we need to go see
olivia before diana does.

538
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,520
Diana, stop it!

539
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,820
Why are you doing this?

540
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,680
What is that?

541
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,440
What do you want from me, diana?

542
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,800
- Mrs. Keller?
- Yes?

543
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,220
My name is melinda gordon.

544
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,380
Is your daughter home?

545
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,070
What is this about?

546
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,110
Trust her, lisa. This is important.

547
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,560
Oh, my god! What happened?

548
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,300
Who-- who did all
of this? Livvy?

549
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,510
Sweetie? Olivia?

550
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,120
Her backpack is not here.

551
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,630
Or her cell phone, clothes, laptop.

552
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,890
Oh, my god! What did you do?

553
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,350
Did you tell olivia?

554
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,310
No.

555
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,350
Then how did she know about these?

556
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,230
How did she know to even look for these?

557
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,170
Diana must have led her to them.

558
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,980
What?

559
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,320
These are all letters
from diana to olivia.

560
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,350
And she thought i never wrote her back.

561
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,390
Her mom must have kept them from her.

562
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,610
You kept these from olivia?

563
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,210
My god, lisa.

564
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,790
Are you so selfish that you wouldn't
even let our daughters be friends?

565
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,680
Diana's baby bracelet.

566
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,080
I sent this to lisa, trying one
last time after i told her the truth.

567
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,440
And now olivia knows the truth.

568
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,430
I have to find her, i
have to call the police!

569
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,700
No, you don't. You know where
she is, don't you? Please.

570
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,150
Olivia needs your help.

571
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,020
Sweetheart!

572
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,450
Oh, i'm so glad we found you!

573
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,400
Stay away from me.

574
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,360
I understand why you're angry,
but, olivia, you have to know that--

575
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,750
what?What you knew for the last 8 years?

576
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,130
I found the letter.

577
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,960
Dear lisa, i wanted you to have
something of your daughter, diana.

578
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,510
Olivia...

579
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,480
Don't talk to me, i
can't hear any more lies!

580
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,130
Olivia, don't. Don't talk
to your mother that way.

581
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,700
My mother? And who are you?

582
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,710
The woman who gave birth to me let me
play in their house and then let me go?

583
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,730
And not just somebody else's house,
but halfway across the country.

584
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,820
Were you relieved when we moved?

585
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,730
Did the two of you work
all of that out together?

586
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,740
She tried.

587
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,780
When she found out the truth, she
tried to talk to me, but, olivia,

588
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,430
You were my daughter and so was
diana, and i couldn't lose you both!

589
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,020
Both, what do you mean?

590
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,580
Well, from the time they could walk,
they would follow you everywhere.

591
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,350
Puppet shows, games, sports.

592
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,300
Kids love you.

593
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,230
What if they had to choose?

594
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,760
They would both choose you.

595
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,120
Lisa, look at your daughter.

596
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,060
Your daughter olivia.

597
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,740
As much as it kills me to say that.

598
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,210
Why do you think she's so angry?

599
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,300
It's not because you kept this from her.

600
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,800
She thinks this means
that you don't love her,

601
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,460
And there's nothing more in the
world that she wants than your love.

602
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,750
Well, i always thought there was nothing
more in the world i wanted than hers.

603
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,730
And then...

604
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,680
You called me that
day, and i wanted more.

605
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Whenever i looked at either one of them.

606
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,330
Olivia, you are my little girl.

607
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,280
Nothing can change that.

608
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:44,040
But diana, her hands, her eyes,

609
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,740
the way she walked--
she was mine, too.

610
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,920
I'm sorry that i tore
our daughters apart.

611
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm sorry that i abandoned both of you.

612
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,960
How could you not want
both of them? I know i did.

613
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,750
I don't want them to hurt anymore.

614
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,990
Diana wants to forgive you.

615
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,770
Wait, diana's here?

616
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,650
That's how we found you.

617
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,470
She told me that you guys
used to play here together.

618
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,130
Tell olivia that i did
make new friends, but...

619
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,280
There were none like her.

620
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,520
She wants you to know
that she missed you.

621
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,570
There was no one like you.

622
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,360
I missed her, too. I still do.

623
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,090
Sweetheart, we're going to sit down,
we're going to talk all of this through.

624
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,490
We'll figure out where
to go from here...

625
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,070
Together.

626
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,510
She's saying good-bye.

627
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,180
Will she be ok?

628
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,910
She wants to know if you're
going to be all right without her.

629
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,030
I'm not going to lie to you, sweet girl.

630
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,520
Nothing is ever going to be the same.

631
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:22,360
Remember what you used to
tell me when i had a bad day

632
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,710
or i didn't do well?

633
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,710
You would always say that the
only thing that mattered to you

634
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,820
is that you knew i tried my best.

635
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,350
That's what i need you to do.

636
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,190
I need you to try to be ok.

637
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,070
For me.

638
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,840
She wants you to try.

639
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,900
Just like you used to tell her to do.

640
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,730
She needs you to promise
that you'll at least try.

641
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,710
I will, sweet girl.

642
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,860
I'll try.

643
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,600
She's gone.

644
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,670
Thank you.

645
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,270
Long day?

646
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,310
The longest.

647
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,910
Do you want to talk about it?

648
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,000
When i...

649
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:24,740
Saw those two mothers love daughters
that weren't even really theirs,

650
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,510
it just made me realize...

651
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,840
If we can't do this...

652
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,200
If we can't have a baby, would...

653
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,370
Would you consider adoption?

654
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,930
Absolutely.

655
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,740
I really...

656
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,670
Needed to hear you say that,
because the tests and the trying--

657
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,910
But mel, look at this.

658
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,190
Are these my results?

659
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,020
Well, i did run into Dr. Chen today.

660
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,160
Well, what is this prescription?

661
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,620
It's for a hormone.

662
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,650
It helps the embryo attach itself.

663
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,330
It basically makes it feel more at home

664
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,520
So it can settle and grow.

665
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,640
- And this is all we need?
- Yeah.

666
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,470
- So we're going to be able to have a baby?
- Yeah.
