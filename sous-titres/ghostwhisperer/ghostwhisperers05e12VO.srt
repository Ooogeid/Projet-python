1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,237
Oh, please don't worry, sir.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:04,972
The walkers are taking great care

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,474
Of your rental property.

4
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:09,377
They just haven't had a chance
to stop in and sign the lease.

5
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,579
Um...

6
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:12,747
Yes.

7
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:15,816
Yep, I have the lease right here.

8
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,184
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:19,253
No, I will have them come in, sign it today,

10
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,588
And then I'll drop it off, of course.

11
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,990
Ok. Sounds good, thanks. Bye-bye.

12
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:26,193
my assistant is great with the clients,

13
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:29,163
But she is so organizationally impaired.

14
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,331
Ha, here it is.

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,168
Walker. Who puts walker in with the ms?

16
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:35,736
An upside down person.

17
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,939
Ah. You know what,
I don't see the humor in that.

18
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,407
But could you please tell me

19
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:42,143
What possessed me to branch
out into the rental business?

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,878
Uh, ned's college tuition.

21
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,212
I take it you can't go to lunch.

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,314
Oh, I wish I could.

23
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,983
I am so swamped.

24
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,853
Hey. I thought you said
you had classes all day.

25
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,023
Yeah, but I had a break and you
sounded stressed on the phone, so...

26
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:59,994
You came by to save me.
Oh, honey, I love you.

27
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,262
You know what, you could totally

28
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,431
Help me if you could
just drop off this lease.

29
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,766
The landlord is giving me
grief because it isn't signed.

30
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:09,036
And I need to, right, get the keys

31
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:12,473
And drop them off at the rental property.

32
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,241
Walker. I think I know their daughter.

33
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:15,643
Oh, I doubt it. The family

34
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:16,877
Just moved to town recently.

35
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:19,213
No, katie, that's her.

36
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,415
She started working at the
dance center next to my gym

37
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:22,617
About six weeks ago.

38
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:25,019
Huh, really? Wonder how you would know that,

39
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:26,887
Since you let your membership lapse

40
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,223
Because there was that great
free facility up on the campus.

41
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,059
This gym has better towels.

42
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,394
Towels?

43
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:35,563
Maybe there are other benefits.

44
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:37,465
Mm-hmm, like katie.

45
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:38,866
You know what,

46
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,234
I think I can drop by the lease

47
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:41,802
And you could drop off the keys.

48
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,537
Mom...

49
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:44,872
No, don't "mom" me, ned.

50
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,107
This girl is fresh off

51
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,775
Of the hay wagon from ohio.

52
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:49,076
Yeah, she's different.

53
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:50,177
I like that about her.

54
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:52,213
Her? And who else?

55
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,315
Seriously, ned, how many girls

56
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:55,650
Are you stringing along now?

57
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,151
None.

58
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,519
I learned my lesson.

59
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:01,188
Katie gets off work in about 20 minutes,

60
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:02,990
So I better run.

61
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:07,028
He knows her work schedule.

62
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:09,664
Yep, and I bet he's not
coming back for these.

63
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,668
Hello. Hi, thanks.

64
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,703
Hey, katie. Hey, ned.

65
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,837
Hang on.

66
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,172
Oh, thanks. I'm not working out.

67
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,840
Thursday is a skip day.

68
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:22,743
Oh. So you just came by to say hi?

69
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,645
Actually, I'm doing my mom a favor.

70
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,347
She's a realtor.

71
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:27,448
There you go. Thanks.

72
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,649
She rented you guys your house.

73
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,685
Apparently your parents
forgot to sign the lease.

74
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,987
Got it.

75
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,723
But why are you bringing
it to me and not them?

76
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,391
I don't know.

77
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,592
Here you are. Thanks, katie.

78
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,994
I thought maybe we could grab a bite.

79
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:41,929
You get off soon, right?

80
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:43,364
In case you're interested. Great.

81
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:45,533
Hey, we're having dance company auditions.

82
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,702
Do you think you could put a
few of these up on campus?

83
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,603
I've seen this.

84
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,005
My mom used to drag me

85
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,506
To this show every year.

86
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,809
Mm-hmm? And I really enjoyed it.

87
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,777
Are you going to audition?

88
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,345
No. I'd love to,

89
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:01,348
But I'm just not at that level, really.

90
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,117
I just started taking dance classes.

91
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,019
Are you?

92
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,255
What are you still doing here?

93
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:10,591
We were supposed to meet out front.

94
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,093
You had plans?

95
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,396
Yeah. I mean, no.

96
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,832
Ned, this is mike, my brother.

97
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,935
oh. Hey.

98
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,603
Good to meet you.

99
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:25,239
Don't make us wait.

100
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:27,508
I guess this means we're
not grabbing a bite?

101
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,376
Yeah.

102
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:37,218
Katie, wait. You forgot the lease.

103
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,599
I don't get it.

104
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,901
I mean, why do you always
have to be such a creep

105
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,002
To any guy I ever like?

106
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,771
You know why.

107
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,543
Yeah, we should.

108
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:03,811
What do you think? I mean, I just--

109
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:10,384
mike, oh, my god!

110
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:11,519
Someone help! Hurry! Mike!

111
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,623
Mike!

112
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,843
Oh, you ok?

113
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,977
Mike, are you ok? No, no, no!

114
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,479
Hey, look, I'm calling 9-1-1.

115
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:41,348
No, don't, don't.
He's our son, we've got this.

116
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,184
Come on, sweetie.

117
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,485
Come on.

118
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:48,856
Excuse me.

119
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,525
My husband's a doctor and
I just saw what happened!

120
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:53,360
That's ok. We're fine.

121
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:54,728
Are you sure that you--

122
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,430
Thank you.

123
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:58,132
Are you sure that you don't need help?!

124
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:03,270
Let me guess-- that's the
girl you have a thing for?

125
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,306
Yeah, katie.

126
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:08,309
Kind of weird, huh.

127
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,445
Weirder than you think.

128
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,353
Child, whispering: Can you see us?

129
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:29,423
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

130
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,495
So soda just shoots out at the guy?

131
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:53,730
Bam, bam, bam!

132
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:54,831
Yeah. And the strange part

133
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:56,032
Is that their son is bleeding,

134
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,233
There's a hospital across the street,

135
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:58,501
And the parents just took off.

136
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,169
That is odd.

137
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,071
Yeah, it's like they knew
they were being haunted.

138
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,272
We don't know that they were.

139
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,607
You didn't see a ghost. Yeah, but--

140
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:06,209
And the soda could have been overheated.

141
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,077
Except for the fact that I was kne
e-deep in a mud vision

142
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,178
When it all exploded.

143
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:12,014
Which kind of screams ghost. You know, ned,

144
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:14,717
We gotta look at why you keep
hooking up with haunted babes.

145
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:19,188
Or why you see a ghost
every time I like someone.

146
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:20,957
Wait a minute.

147
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:23,292
Did my mom put you up to this?

148
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,161
Is this her way of keeping me in line?

149
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,597
You know what, ned, your mom just
actually wants you to be happy,

150
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:28,664
And safe.

151
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,333
Which dating a haunted girl isn't.

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,068
You probably dated a
haunted girl in college,

153
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:33,369
You just didn't know it.

154
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:34,937
And at least one possessed bio major,

155
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,739
Judging from the live
frogs I found in my bed.

156
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:37,774
I'd also like to get to know katie

157
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:38,908
Without you two buzzing around.

158
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,177
So if I'm a responsible adult

159
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:42,512
Like my mom says,

160
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:45,181
Why don't you two treat
me like one, and butt out?

161
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:53,222
I'm calling delia.

162
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,813
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,615
We're closed. You shouldn't be here.

164
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:21,918
You're an amazing dancer.

165
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,419
I thought you said you were just learning.

166
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,021
I am.

167
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,089
What are you, some sort of dance expert now?

168
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,959
Look, if you want me to keep your
dancing under wraps, that's cool.

169
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:31,694
I'll pretend I was never here.

170
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,563
Sorry.

171
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,298
It's not you.

172
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:38,668
I just get all moody when I
first move to a new place.

173
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:40,269
Which is a lot lately.

174
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,604
My dad's in construction

175
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,639
And work's been thin,
so we go where the jobs are.

176
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,107
I guess I'm just sick of it.

177
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:47,343
It's funny-- the only time I've ever moved

178
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,379
Is from a house in
grandview to an apartment.

179
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:54,317
I guess that's really all I ever remember.

180
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,185
You are so lucky.

181
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:58,387
It must be scary having to
make new friends all the time.

182
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:01,691
No, what's scary is when you get good at it.

183
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,961
You move to so many places so many times,

184
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:07,496
You don't even know who you are anymore.

185
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:09,799
Some things feel strange about a town,

186
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,234
And you're not sure if it isn't just you.

187
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,205
God. can I talk any more?

188
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:17,607
I wish you would.

189
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,275
But it's fine if you don't.

190
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:21,077
In fact, it's more than fine.

191
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:24,780
How about from now on,
anything you don't want to tell me,

192
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,782
I don't want to know, ok?

193
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,050
Ok.

194
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:29,819
Ok.

195
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,922
You know, since you're here,

196
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,223
I could use a partner.

197
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,291
A partner?

198
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,692
Mm-hmm.

199
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,229
You put your arm out.

200
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,732
Now pull me in.

201
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,700
Now dip me.

202
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,502
Mm-hmm. Good.

203
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,272
No, stay there.

204
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:57,213
Ok.

205
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:58,547
It just--this isn't right, you know?

206
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,416
I tell ned that he has to be responsible

207
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,285
And make the right choices,

208
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,653
And now I'm helping you spy on him.

209
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,888
And he's just starting
to open up to me again.

210
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,623
Look, I understand that you
don't want to break ned's trust,

211
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:08,991
But if these people are haunted,

212
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,192
It's my job to help.

213
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,727
This ghost blows things up.

214
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,263
Ok, fine, let's just make it quick.

215
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,403
Delia, well.

216
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,437
Hello.

217
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:23,272
Hey, dave.

218
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,807
Um, this is my friend melinda.

219
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,179
Don't I know you?

220
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,382
Uh, sort of.

221
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,418
We met yesterday at the gas station.

222
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:38,054
And when mel and I made the connection

223
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,155
That I was your realtor--

224
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:41,157
I wanted to welcome you to town

225
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,759
And see how your son was doing.

226
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,027
This is some stuff from my shop.

227
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:46,262
How nice. Thank you.

228
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,831
Yeah, my son's fine.

229
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,566
Strange as that accident was.

230
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,635
Thick-headed like his dad, I guess.

231
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:55,137
How sweet.

232
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,807
Look, I'd ask you in, but we're
just heading out for the evening.

233
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,742
Oh, well, that's ok.

234
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,243
If you can just sign the lease,

235
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,478
You know, I could finally
get out of your hair.

236
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:03,879
Excuse me. Excuse us.

237
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:05,514
Yeah, we're in kind of a hurry.

238
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:07,316
What if I just drop it by the office?

239
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,986
All right. See you later, thanks.

240
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:14,623
They were not planning on heading out.

241
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,492
I could smell that they were cooking dinner,

242
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,262
And I saw that she had
marinara sauce on her apron.

243
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:22,898
Oh, my god.

244
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,633
I am so dead.

245
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,969
Ok, hurry. Run before ned can yell at us.

246
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,270
All right.

247
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:32,475
Katie...

248
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,543
We have to go, hon.

249
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,412
She'll be fine. Uh-huh.

250
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:42,084
I really appreciate you taking
a look at this old junker.

251
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:43,953
My dad won't buy me a new one.

252
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,888
Hey, I get it. Money's tight, you know?

253
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,623
It's not so much that.

254
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:49,725
He's anti-trashing anything.

255
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,128
Says we live in a disposable culture

256
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,462
That's ruining our planet.

257
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,630
Well, he's right.

258
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:56,298
You know, I bet I can fix this.

259
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,833
Oh, killer.

260
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,702
I mean, I don't need it
for school or anything.

261
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,404
I'm taking a year off.

262
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:03,205
But gotta go online.

263
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,007
Oh!

264
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:07,009
Oh, god, no. Please don't do this.

265
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,381
What the hell? What is this?

266
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:13,849
It won't turn off!

267
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,651
Make it stop! Just make it stop!

268
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,219
Why is this happening?!

269
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,324
It's mud.

270
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:24,160
Yeah, it's mud. So what?

271
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,562
You've seen this before, haven't you?

272
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,902
Oh, please. Not again.

273
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,336
Mom, dad, you're back.

274
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:36,605
Ned was just leaving.

275
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,541
It's a good thing, apparently.

276
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:41,544
Hon, we've rented plenty of houses.

277
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,612
Shouldn't be surprised
when the plumbing's bad.

278
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,849
You're right.

279
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,251
I should know better.

280
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,586
I'm gonna go get some towels.

281
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:54,023
Yeah. Katie's right, my friend.

282
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,058
You should probably be going.

283
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,967
You sure I can't help?

284
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:08,604
No, it's nothing my dad can't deal with.

285
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,116
Since when do we bring people into our home?

286
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,756
So it turns out I was wrong.

287
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:30,993
Looks like katie's family is haunted.

288
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:32,695
But I guess you already knew that.

289
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,063
Yeah. Melinda had a vision

290
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,131
When we were at the house.

291
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:36,332
Here. Thanks.

292
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,033
I'm so sorry, honey. Look at you.

293
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,768
Are you ok? Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:40,970
Any idea who the ghost is?

295
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:43,439
we don't know.

296
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,574
Actually, it turns out
there's a lot we don't know.

297
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:48,110
In my vision, katie's parents and brother,

298
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,346
They had no faces.

299
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,748
So we did a little bit more research.

300
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:54,250
You know, I went back over
the rental application,

301
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,618
The credit check.

302
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,087
I thought if I could go
back a few more years

303
00:12:58,155 --> 00:12:59,922
Than I first had... Find anything?

304
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,491
Nothing, literally.

305
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,859
There's no previous employment,

306
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,494
No rentals, no résumés,

307
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,796
Everything we looked at was a dead end.

308
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:10,766
Yeah, and we even checked their
places and dates of birth,

309
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,669
And the county clerk had no record of them.

310
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,271
So that's why they had no faces.

311
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:17,173
They don't exist.

312
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:29,763
How does an entire family fall off the grid?

313
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,097
Well, it's not that hard these days.

314
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,866
I mean, you can get a social
and get credit reports,

315
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,134
Even a college degree online.

316
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:37,370
Yeah, but why? I mean,
who would want to do that?

317
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,071
People who don't want to be found.

318
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,240
Right. Ok, I'm going to go out on a limb

319
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,342
And say people who are on the run.

320
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,579
Ok, so, someone besides
the ghost is after them.

321
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,047
Right. Right.

322
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,483
But why would a whole family go into hiding?

323
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:51,784
Ah, they did something illegal.

324
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:52,818
They committed a crime.

325
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,554
Yeah, or they didn't commit a crime

326
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:55,922
And they witnessed one.

327
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:58,291
Wait, so you're thinking witness protection?

328
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,326
You could always ask
detective blair about this.

329
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:01,961
Yeah, but even if she was willing,

330
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,396
Do you think she'd get anywhere?

331
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:06,132
I mean, their identities
are protected, right?

332
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,034
Yeah, but it's worth a try.

333
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:10,403
You haven't even seen this ghost, have you?

334
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,437
No.

335
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,039
So really, it could be anybody.

336
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,707
A murderer, victim, man, woman.

337
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:16,943
Ok, you're making this sound
a lot harder than I thought.

338
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,511
Sorry.

339
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,781
Wait a minute. Ned's in a
good position to find out.

340
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,450
Why don't you keep asking him
to hang out with the girl?

341
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,586
Yeah. Something tells
me I won't have to ask.

342
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:29,622
Hey, I'm just leaving now.

343
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,457
I'll see you soon. Ok, bye.

344
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,092
Katie.

345
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,694
Katie, hey.

346
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:37,063
Hey, I left you a message. How are you?

347
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,598
Good. Fine. Just busy.

348
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:40,433
And I'm late to meet someone.

349
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,635
Oh, really? Who, your brother?

350
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:44,237
A friend. Ok.

351
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,706
Hey, what's this deal
with all the mud, anyways?

352
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:50,009
And your parents leaving the house
with dinner still in the oven?

353
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,911
They left a meal for us, so what?

354
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:53,246
I thought it was nice.

355
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:54,981
They didn't really seem to want me there.

356
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,282
They're protective.

357
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,316
What are they protecting you from?

358
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:58,651
What are you talking about?

359
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,486
All the weird stuff that
happens to your family.

360
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,722
The bottles blowing up at the gas station?

361
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,724
What do you think it's all about?

362
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,292
Katie, hey.

363
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,995
You can trust me, I swear.

364
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:11,797
I think you should stay away from me.

365
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,165
Is that what you want?

366
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:16,869
Or stop asking questions I can't answer.

367
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,037
Maybe I can help.

368
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:19,171
You said whatever I don't want to tell you--

369
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,140
I don't have to know. I remember.

370
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,309
It's different now.

371
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,811
Katie, I'm worried about you.

372
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:29,782
Ned...

373
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,451
You asked me to trust you,

374
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,087
So why can't you trust me?

375
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:36,455
Please.

376
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:39,859
It's the only way this can work.

377
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:52,204
Ned thinks katie knows about the ghost.

378
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,774
Yeah, but he doesn't know
what they're running from.

379
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,142
Can't run from a ghost,

380
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,843
So it has to be a real person.

381
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:59,779
Maybe the ghost is doing
all these public hauntings

382
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:01,180
Because it wants them to get caught.

383
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:02,381
No.

384
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,650
I'm right here, and I'm ready to listen.

385
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,986
Whoever this is wants them to run.

386
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,789
Ugh, can you imagine?
Just all those new houses and jobs

387
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:12,358
And schools and friends.

388
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,593
Always lying about who you
are and where you came from.

389
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,228
It's gotta be torture.

390
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,364
Yeah. This ghost definitely wants revenge.

391
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:19,465
On the whole family?

392
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,334
What did they do?

393
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,469
hey, delia,

394
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:25,004
Melinda.

395
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,105
Hey, mike.

396
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,840
Is everything ok with the house?

397
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:30,176
Oh, yeah, great. My mom loves it.

398
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,845
Really? Even with all the mud?

399
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:35,915
Oh, ned told you about
that broken pipe, huh?

400
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:38,184
My dad didn't want you to sweat it.

401
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,719
He just fixed it himself.

402
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,487
That was really thoughtful of him.

403
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,790
Anyway. Oh, um, my mom dug that gift basket

404
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,826
You gave her, and she hates
to let a good mason jar

405
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:48,861
Go to waste. So she wanted me

406
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:51,697
To drop this by. It's raspberry.

407
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,833
just shut up, lydia!

408
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,001
Wait!

409
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:58,337
No, no, no, no!

410
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:04,877
Wait! No, please!

411
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:06,879
No, please!

412
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,714
I said shut up!

413
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:12,051
Oh, I'm such a klutz. I--

414
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,594
I got it.

415
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:25,598
Uh, anyway...

416
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,566
I gotta run.

417
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:34,340
That boy wanted to hurt that girl.

418
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:44,049
That's his necklace.

419
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:52,291
is he asleep?

420
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,893
He's out cold.

421
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,528
Did he say anything about the vision?

422
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:57,530
I asked him and he doesn't remember.

423
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:58,931
Don't worry.

424
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,466
He lets these things in,

425
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:01,834
Then he lets them go.

426
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:04,236
Good. 'cause it was a violent vision.

427
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:07,139
You saw this guy hurt this girl?

428
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,607
The walkers are protecting
their son from something.

429
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:09,742
That's why they're running;

430
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,577
That's why they don't have any faces.

431
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:12,945
Katie's brother, he was so detached.

432
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:15,214
I mean, he was wearing her necklace.

433
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,782
The one he ripped off that
girl in your vision, right?

434
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:20,286
Is that like some kind
of trophy or something?

435
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,087
Maybe. Sick, huh?

436
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:23,088
Yeah.

437
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,390
Poor girl.

438
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,492
So she's your ghost?

439
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,928
It makes sense.

440
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:30,563
I don't know what I would do

441
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,897
If aiden ever hurt someone like that.

442
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:34,500
Hey, hey, that is never going to happen.

443
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,502
Katie's parents thought that, too.

444
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,938
You need to stop thinking
about this right now

445
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:40,606
And go to bed, ok?

446
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,908
I'll go take out the trash.
I'll be up in a minute.

447
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,043
Ok.

448
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:57,490
What are you doing here?

449
00:18:57,557 --> 00:19:00,526
Have you been haunting that family?

450
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,629
Who are you?

451
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,831
What do you want from them?

452
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,900
Only what they owe me.

453
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:10,035
He can never stop paying for what he did.

454
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,773
Look, if the ghost is a man,

455
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:22,774
Then the girl that you saw in your vision

456
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:23,942
Could still be alive.

457
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,110
Yeah, but I still don't know her connection

458
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:26,812
To the ghost. Yeah, I know.

459
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,213
But there's gotta be something.

460
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:29,448
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

461
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,649
You said that he was
covered with mud, right?

462
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,251
Yeah, I could barely see his uniform.

463
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:34,520
Well, the girl in your
vision had mud on her, huh?

464
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:35,921
On the path?

465
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,723
So maybe the ghost is a
boyfriend or a brother

466
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,991
Who died trying to protect her.

467
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,425
Yeah, but why wouldn't he have told me that?

468
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,394
Yeah. Wait, no, you said it yourself.

469
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:44,630
You know, maybe he's trying to torture
them by keeping them on the run.

470
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,900
I know. You've probably already thought
about this about four or five times, huh?

471
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,935
Eight, ten, thirty, to say the least.

472
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,436
But I don't know what that is.

473
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,704
What is that?

474
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,073
Credit check authorization
for one dustin harris.

475
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,642
In the walker file? Yeah.

476
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,111
Get back, check the basement.

477
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,613
Move! Watch your weapons, there's kids.

478
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:04,349
Quickly, quickly!

479
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:10,923
Clear!

480
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,230
Clear.

481
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:19,331
Clear. All clear upstairs!

482
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,599
Something must have tipped them off.

483
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,301
They're a step ahead of us.

484
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,503
Clear. Clear in back!

485
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:36,548
Mel, you ok?

486
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:39,651
Yeah. Um, I think the ghost

487
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,986
Put this here for a reason.

488
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,454
The credit report? Where did he get it?

489
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:45,624
The walkers. Look at the handwriting.

490
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,759
It's almost identical.

491
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,761
Yeah, dave walker is dustin harris.

492
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:51,830
Harris was just an alias.

493
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:53,265
Did you get that in the vision?

494
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,800
I think I was in their house.

495
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,034
And they ran again, you know,

496
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:57,236
Just left everything behind.

497
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,071
Look, I think whatever katie's brother did,

498
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,839
The ghost is just trying to
make sure that the family

499
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,808
Is one step ahead of the law.

500
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,843
No more, no less.

501
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,513
What did detective blair say?

502
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:10,082
That she loves my jacket.

503
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,183
Eli...

504
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:12,517
She said if she's going to call the fbi,

505
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,086
She's going to need something more.

506
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:15,120
Like what?

507
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:16,922
More than mud, ghosts,

508
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,423
And exploding soda.

509
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:19,725
She's going to need something concrete.

510
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,260
Ok, well, what about the
form the ghost gave us?

511
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,961
It's got to have a signature,
fingerprints...

512
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,997
It's gone.

513
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:26,565
The ghost giveth and taketh away.

514
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,000
Just enough to keep them running.

515
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:35,607
This ghost is not going to stop.

516
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:37,442
It's only a matter of time before
the police are after them again.

517
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,710
Then they'll run.

518
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:40,846
Yeah, but then they'll
be leaving the one town

519
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,014
Where someone can talk to their ghost.

520
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,215
Maybe end all this.

521
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:45,017
They're not going to get another chance.

522
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:54,826
Hey, ned!

523
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:56,361
Did you get tickets to the movie?

524
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:58,397
Yeah. Great, let's go.

525
00:21:58,464 --> 00:21:59,898
Can we talk first?

526
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:02,234
ned, please...

527
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:03,769
Look, believe me,

528
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,137
"can we talk" is like the last thing

529
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,571
That I say to girls.

530
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,874
I'm sure you've heard it plenty of times.

531
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:12,444
Anyways, here's the thing--

532
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:14,746
I like you.

533
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:17,649
I like you, too.

534
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:21,286
Good. Glad we got that squared away.

535
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:24,189
Also, I don't want you to move.

536
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:26,391
I don't want to, either.

537
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,660
But my father's job-- don't.

538
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:30,696
Just stop, ok?

539
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:33,832
Please, hear me out before you say anything.

540
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,402
What I mean is, what if
you didn't have to move?

541
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,037
Wherever you wanted to stay,

542
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:41,073
You could. What if there was a way?

543
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,474
It's just...

544
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,376
It's not that simple.

545
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:47,579
I'm not saying it wouldn't cost anything.

546
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:49,214
I know you love your brother and
I know you want to protect him.

547
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:51,049
Wait, my brother?

548
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,384
What does he have to do with anything?

549
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:56,555
If he hurt somebody,
he needs to be responsible for that.

550
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,657
Or else he's hurting you,
he's hurting all of you.

551
00:22:58,725 --> 00:22:59,891
And I think he sees that.

552
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,360
Wait, wait, wait,
what are you accusing him of?

553
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,528
What are you saying?

554
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:05,564
Is someone asking questions
about my brother, about us?

555
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:07,666
I know what it's like to have a secret.

556
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:11,036
I have one, too.

557
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,704
My friend melinda...

558
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:14,906
She sees ghosts.

559
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,943
And there is a really angry guy

560
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,778
Haunting your family.

561
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,446
We think it's some kind of payback

562
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:22,581
For what mike did to the girl.

563
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,251
You and your friend...

564
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,588
Have you gone to the cops about this?

565
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:32,557
Yes.

566
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,295
But we can help you if-
-if you just tell me what's going on.

567
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:39,431
It's not my decision to make.

568
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:42,100
It's my family.

569
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:44,269
I could lose them forever.

570
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,104
You can't keep running,

571
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:47,305
At least not from this ghost.

572
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:50,542
we have to.

573
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,294
Katie...

574
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,299
Rachel.

575
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:18,136
My name is rachel.

576
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,511
Well, their last name is blessing.

577
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:29,147
Glen and his wife belong to the green front,

578
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,449
An environmental activist group.

579
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,451
Their last big stand was 12 years ago.

580
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:33,718
After that, the blessings went underground

581
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:35,454
And the group disbanded.

582
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:36,788
What were they protesting?

583
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:38,156
A housing development being built

584
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:39,524
On endangered wetlands.

585
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:40,992
There were at least a dozen attacks--

586
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,829
Vandalism, trespassing,
destruction of property.

587
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,230
Where did all this happen?

588
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,399
Believe it or not, mostly
right here in driscoll county.

589
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,434
So they lived here before?

590
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:50,635
And they lied about it.

591
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:52,938
Why risk coming back?

592
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,606
Well, it's not unusual for
fugitives to be drawn back.

593
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:56,441
Lots of things, like friends or family

594
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:57,976
Or nostalgia for their old life.

595
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:59,845
But there's something I just don't get.

596
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:03,215
Would the fbi really track
somebody down for a decade

597
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,350
Because they trashed a construction site?

598
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:06,852
Well, during that final attack,

599
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,086
A security guard was killed,

600
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,287
Probably trying to stop them.

601
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:10,489
What was his name?

602
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:11,656
Trevor marshall.

603
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,259
That explains the ghost in uniform.

604
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,194
Well, now we know who they are,

605
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:18,797
So we're going to put out
an apb and find them.

606
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,067
The name rachel--

607
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,401
Without it, we'd be nowhere.

608
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:25,270
Did a ghost give it to you?

609
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,997
Come on, let's go!

610
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:27,766
Now!

611
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:40,645
Police! Warrant!

612
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:46,751
Detective blair: Are we covered in back?

613
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:48,019
All covered.

614
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:49,120
Break it down!

615
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:53,992
Quickly, quickly!

616
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,495
Clear.

617
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:58,830
Move, move! Clear. All clear upstairs.

618
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:00,699
Clear!

619
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:01,800
Clear in back, let's move out.

620
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:02,834
Clear!

621
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:04,903
They couldn't have gone far!

622
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:14,695
Gordon, can you take this? Ok, detective.

623
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:17,196
That's katie's dance bag.

624
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:19,396
They left everything.

625
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:20,998
Well, I think they had a short lead.

626
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,299
There's coffee brewing in the kitchen, so...

627
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,168
So what happens now?

628
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:25,202
They won't get far.

629
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,970
You did a good thing.

630
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,774
Doesn't feel that way.

631
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:36,146
Seeing ned so upset got me
thinking about katie's family.

632
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:38,682
It was a huge risk,
them coming back to grandview.

633
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,117
Which didn't make any sense

634
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:41,885
Until I thought about what
detective blair had said.

635
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:44,054
About nostalgia for the scene of the crime?

636
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,456
Visiting loved ones.

637
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,391
I remember seeing dave and
diane leaving the hospital.

638
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,326
Do you think they were visiting family?

639
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:50,961
Yes, but not their's.

640
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,329
Wait, I'm lost.

641
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:53,797
I asked jim to check the records

642
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,265
To see if there were any
employees or patients

643
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,867
Who might have their real name,

644
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:58,302
Or any of their aliases.

645
00:27:58,369 --> 00:27:59,903
And did he find anything?

646
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,406
No, but found a patient with the
ghost's last name, marshall.

647
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,707
Connie marshall.

648
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:04,975
She's trevor's mom.

649
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:06,844
Hey, guys. Sorry. I was going to call you,

650
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:08,512
But you're not going to
find her in her room.

651
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,581
She died the day before yesterday.

652
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,116
And the nurses were telling me

653
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:13,350
There's a couple that's
been visiting recently,

654
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:15,285
Sounds a lot like the walkers.

655
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:17,521
Ok, I'm really lost.

656
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:20,023
I know someone who has the answers.

657
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:32,202
Try another channel. Ok.

658
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,704
I don't get you.

659
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:35,439
You didn't have to come.

660
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,674
Why didn't you stay?

661
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:40,744
Because I would never see you guys again.

662
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:42,412
He seemed like a nice guy.

663
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,047
Stop it.

664
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:45,349
Did you make him hate you?

665
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:47,618
Mike, don't.

666
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:48,752
That's my favorite trick.

667
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,587
No!

668
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:51,822
That's why I did to lydia.

669
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,323
Just shut up. Aah! Mike!

670
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:54,925
Mike, what are you doing?!

671
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,563
This meant we're together. We're not!

672
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:01,765
Mike, mike, wait! It's over, lydia.

673
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:05,335
Mike, you're-- you're acting
like somebody I don't even know!

674
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:08,005
Who are you?

675
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:10,440
Mike, wait! No, please!

676
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,279
Oh, my god, please!

677
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:18,649
Please!

678
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,951
So we can just keep doing this.

679
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,187
Just me, you,

680
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:25,355
Dad and mom and whatever we can grab

681
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:26,857
Before we run out the door.

682
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:29,193
Don't you want a life? Shh! Guys.

683
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,094
What did they just say?

684
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:33,397
They're calling all units in the vicinity.

685
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,033
How do they know?

686
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,572
they got a tip.

687
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:46,743
You told that boy everything, didn't you?

688
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:51,014
He already knew...A lot.

689
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,416
He has a friend.

690
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:55,552
She sees ghosts.

691
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,122
It's trevor. I knew it.

692
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,457
All of these years-- not now!

693
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:02,326
He's been haunting us! Diane, please!

694
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:05,229
Ned said trevor was angry. He said something

695
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:06,463
About payback. Oh, god

696
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:08,565
Why is he doing this?

697
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,067
Diane, stop it!

698
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:13,837
Dad, mom, what happened to that guy?!

699
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:15,105
Tell us!

700
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:16,840
You know the rules.

701
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:18,508
No questions.

702
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:19,843
The less you know, the better.

703
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:21,878
But you want us to believe

704
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,280
What we read about you on the internet?

705
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:26,083
That you're basically terrorists, murderers?

706
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,051
We're not. You know that.

707
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,286
Look, I'm sorry.

708
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:32,122
Your mother and I never
meant it to be this way.

709
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,626
We just wanted us all to stay together.

710
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:55,679
Trevor...

711
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:57,314
Does he really think he
can make his guilt go away

712
00:30:57,382 --> 00:30:58,515
By visiting my mom?

713
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,184
After everything he did,
the way he betrayed me?

714
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:03,086
betrayed you?

715
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:08,025
He was like a big brother to me.

716
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:10,394
The only reason I got a job at that site

717
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:11,762
Was so we could take it out.

718
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,431
We joined green fund together.

719
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,799
We were ready to give it everything.

720
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:18,068
Or at least I was.

721
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,839
We hit them in their wallet
to get their attention.

722
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:24,007
Glen, sugar.

723
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:26,710
Burned out the engines by pouring sugar.

724
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:29,613
But I knew, to really hurt them,

725
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,715
We had to go further.

726
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:33,283
Then I saw something I couldn't pass up.

727
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,751
Glen! Yeah?

728
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:37,721
All we have to do is point
this tractor down the hill

729
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:38,822
And get the hell out of the way.

730
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,090
Once this rig hits the propane tanks--

731
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:41,658
Yeah, the whole place will blow up.

732
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:44,227
Don't you want people thinking
about what they're doing?

733
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:46,463
Trevor, I want them thinking
that the enemy is this project,

734
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,298
Not us!

735
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,366
Oh, come on, man!

736
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:50,734
Don't do that!

737
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:52,302
Well, either help me or get
the hell out of my way.

738
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,905
Hey, stop acting like an idiot, ok?

739
00:31:54,972 --> 00:31:56,306
Now let's go!

740
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,042
If you're going to walk, just walk.

741
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:09,353
I thought if I could just get it started,

742
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,121
Point it in the right direction...

743
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,026
But it was a two-man job.

744
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,708
Aah!

745
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,643
Glen!

746
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,481
Glen...Glen!

747
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:40,484
I screamed out for glen to help me.

748
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,985
Glen, you gotta help me!

749
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:43,653
Pull me out of there.

750
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,155
But he ran. I was hurt and he left me
in the mud. He left me there to die.

751
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:48,125
Glen, don't go!

752
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:50,060
Glen!

753
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:53,296
By the time the cops found me, I was dead.

754
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:55,465
He ran from our cause,

755
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,968
And he ran from me.

756
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:02,038
And you made sure he never stopped running.

757
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,012
Ok, everybody.

758
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,514
Just stay calm.

759
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,516
Dad! It's ok, sweetie.

760
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,285
You know what to do.

761
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:16,653
Everyone remain in the vehicle.

762
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:19,523
Remain seated in the vehicle.

763
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,758
Dad?

764
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,162
Dave, don't. Don't.

765
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:27,164
Protect the family.

766
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:28,765
Stay together.

767
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,001
That's all that matters.

768
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,002
Sir, stay in the vehicle!

769
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:33,103
Is there a problem, officer?

770
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,806
Put your hands in the air, now!

771
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,841
I'm unarmed. I told you to stay in the van!

772
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:39,109
Is there a problem?

773
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:40,677
Don't move. I'm not moving.

774
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:42,546
Is there a problem?

775
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:43,880
something wrong?

776
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,115
You in the car, don't move!
Nothing to worry about.

777
00:33:45,183 --> 00:33:46,716
Mom!

778
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:47,717
Don't point that gun at my hands!

779
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:49,586
Hands where I can see them.

780
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,354
Where are you going?! What are you doing?

781
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:52,856
Don't shoot. Hands in the air!

782
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:54,791
On the ground! Get on the ground, now!

783
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:57,394
Get back in the car! Get back in the car!

784
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,665
It's ok, officer. Get on the ground!

785
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:02,899
On your knees! Don't shoot!

786
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,367
it's all right.

787
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:05,836
Drive, katie, go!

788
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,471
Hands in the air, on your knees, now!

789
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:09,206
No! No! No! No, no, no!

790
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:10,440
Don't--please don't shoot!

791
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,209
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

792
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:14,511
Please! Out of the car, now!

793
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,214
Now! Now!

794
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,359
They haven't done anything!

795
00:34:24,427 --> 00:34:26,128
They're kids! Those are my children!

796
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:27,896
They are innocent! Out of the vehicle!

797
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,264
Do not shoot!

798
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:31,266
Katie, dad wants you to go!
Why aren't you going?!

799
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:32,734
Do you hear me? Now!

800
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:34,303
Don't!

801
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,005
Turn it off!

802
00:34:38,808 --> 00:34:40,275
Throw the keys out and exit the van!

803
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:49,117
Hands in the air... Slowly.

804
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,957
On your knees.

805
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,962
Everyone on your knees,
hands behind your head.

806
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:02,364
Why did you give up?

807
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:03,699
We had a plan!

808
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:06,468
I can't, daddy. I'm sorry. I just...

809
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,004
I can't run anymore.

810
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:16,745
All of you on your knees, hands behind
your head, interlock your fingers.

811
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,815
She's right.

812
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:21,049
She's right.

813
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:22,851
It's going to be ok, baby.

814
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:23,886
It's ok.

815
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,357
Please, sir, on your knees, all of you.

816
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:47,776
Roger, they're in route.

817
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,484
Be brave for your mom, ok?

818
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:57,319
Stay together.

819
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:58,654
I'll see you soon.

820
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:00,188
I am so sorry, daddy!

821
00:36:00,256 --> 00:36:02,791
No, no, I am.

822
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:04,159
I love you, baby.

823
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:05,494
Sir, come with me, watch your step.

824
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:07,262
I love you, too.

825
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,164
Excuse me, detective blair,

826
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:10,432
I know that it's a lot to ask,

827
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,234
But can I have five
minutes with mr. Blessing?

828
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:13,902
He's just been arrested for murder.

829
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,070
Yeah, I know.

830
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:16,505
But there's something I have to ask him.

831
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,507
Don't tell me-- you've got
a message from a ghost?

832
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:21,143
No, from my husband,
but I think it could be important.

833
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,113
I think I can prove that
he didn't kill anyone.

834
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:28,216
Don't you want to know the truth?

835
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,220
Come on.

836
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:35,190
Ok, just tell me what happened.

837
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:36,858
Well, if you talk to ghosts,

838
00:36:36,926 --> 00:36:38,327
You should already know.

839
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,562
trevor told me what he remembers.

840
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,698
Why don't you give me
your side of the story?

841
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:49,137
The truth is, I try not to remember it.

842
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:50,672
It was the worst day of my life.

843
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,175
Worse than seeing your family
being taken away from you?

844
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:55,210
I'm going to see my family again someday.

845
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:58,180
Trevor, I'll never see.

846
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,148
You still care that much about him?

847
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:02,684
Even though he had your family
on the run for all those years?

848
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:04,553
Trevor was a good man

849
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:07,522
Who lost his life trying
to make the world better.

850
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,524
He blames me for that, and who knows?

851
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:11,393
Maybe he's right. Maybe?

852
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:13,996
I never should have let
him hang back that night.

853
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:16,431
Neither of us knew how to
drive that kind of machine.

854
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:17,899
That's what he regrets?

855
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:21,103
What about leaving me there to die?

856
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,639
He wants to know why you
left him there to die.

857
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,975
Trevor's here?

858
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,245
How can he think I left him there to die?

859
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,581
That's crazy. He was my friend.

860
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,616
That's just what he remembers.

861
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:35,951
He doesn't know what we know.

862
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,252
What are you talking about?

863
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,621
Trevor, my husband...

864
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:43,125
He saw your autopsy report.
You died instantly

865
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:45,794
From the fall. But that's not possible.

866
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:49,197
I called his name, that's why he came back.

867
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:52,034
Aah!

868
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:55,871
I ran, but I stopped.

869
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:58,106
I just couldn't leave him there,
he was my friend.

870
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:03,078
Trevor!

871
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:16,825
oh, my god, trevor!

872
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,095
He came back for you
because he's your friend.

873
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:22,764
But by the time he got to you,

874
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:23,999
He couldn't hear your voice;

875
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,501
Not any more than he can now.

876
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:27,803
What's he saying?

877
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:32,407
He's trying to understand.

878
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,743
I punished him all those years.

879
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:37,245
And he never did anything wrong.

880
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:40,449
He feels guilty for haunting
you and your family.

881
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:41,917
After all he did for my mom.

882
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:44,019
I thought he was just working off his shame.

883
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:45,821
I should have known better.

884
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,422
Family was everything to him.

885
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,124
He was just trying to make sure

886
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:50,592
My mom had a family, too.

887
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,627
He knows why you came back,

888
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,396
And what you did for his mother.

889
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,598
She lost a son.

890
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,667
That was punishment enough.

891
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:00,035
Punishment?

892
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:03,238
She knew what we were up to.
She gave me money.

893
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,407
Gave people from the
movement a place to stay.

894
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:07,909
So she could have gone to jail.

895
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:09,911
Yeah.

896
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:11,146
My wife, too.

897
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:13,248
We were all involved in the movement.

898
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,951
My family would have been torn apart.

899
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,953
I couldn't face that.

900
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,788
We never thought it through.

901
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:21,490
We just ran.

902
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:24,192
And once we did, we couldn't stop.

903
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,028
Tell trevor not to feel guilty.

904
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:30,265
I'm alive!

905
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,600
I have everything.

906
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:32,768
Not if they take it away.

907
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:36,037
They want to put him in prison for my death.

908
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:37,472
We can't let them do that.

909
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,040
What's he saying now?

910
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:42,210
I kept a box, all my letters
to glen and the others,

911
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:43,879
They're hidden in my mother's attic.

912
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:47,749
I was so full of myself, I thought
that they could help some historian

913
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:50,018
Write about my cause someday.

914
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:51,219
Maybe now they can help glen.

915
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:52,320
He hid letters

916
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:53,755
That he wrote about what you two did.

917
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,423
If they read those letters,

918
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:56,458
They'll know that I was involved,

919
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,260
That I was the hot-head, not him.

920
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:02,531
And please call him glen.

921
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,133
That's who he is again.

922
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:08,069
He wants you to take your name back,

923
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:10,872
And your life back.

924
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,242
And he says it's nice to
see a really old friend.

925
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:22,150
I see it.

926
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,087
My mom.

927
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:29,057
She's waiting for me.

928
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:32,227
Then go and be with her.

929
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:37,365
Tell glen he was always right

930
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,000
About family.

931
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:42,938
I can see that now.

932
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,874
I will.

933
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:58,587
He's gone.

934
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:24,179
Detective blair said they
dropped the murder charges

935
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:25,780
Because of the ghost's letters.

936
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:27,949
Katie said her dad still had to stand trial.

937
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:29,284
Yeah, that's because of the
vandalism and the running.

938
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:31,253
But the mom won't be prosecuted.

939
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,721
Oh, I know ned's happy about that.

940
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:34,522
And she signed a one-year lease,

941
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,091
So she'll be sticking around for a while.

942
00:41:36,158 --> 00:41:37,993
So you think it's the real thing?

943
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,294
Oh, god, who knows?

944
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,462
They're still kids.

945
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:41,630
I'm not going to be knitting baby booties

946
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:42,831
Any time soon.

947
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:45,500
But whatever happens,
I'm really proud of him.

948
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:47,936
I think he made some good choices.

949
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,804
Who made good choices?

950
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:51,072
Um, I did.

951
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,508
I got a hazelnut mocha double latte,

952
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:55,410
And it's so good, so good.

953
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,345
That's fine. I don't need your kudos.

954
00:41:57,413 --> 00:41:59,114
Katie's brother has given me plenty.

955
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,516
Ned helped him get up the
courage to call lydia,

956
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:02,717
The girl he chased away.

957
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,686
And she called him back.

958
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:06,688
So we'll see.

959
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:10,125
That's so cute!

960
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:11,893
Please, don't make me look.

961
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:14,396
Oh, my god!

962
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:15,497
Oh, young.
