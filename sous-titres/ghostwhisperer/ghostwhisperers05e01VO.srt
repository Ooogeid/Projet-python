00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,060
Previously on ghost whisperer...

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,520
- What are you doing here?
- There's somethingyou need to know.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,360
I need your help.you've got to find that book.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,830
That book,it's special.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,600
It shouldn't end upin the wrong hands.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,680
The book is the onecommon thread.I mean,my dream,the thief.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,460
The book is the key to everything.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,570
The book is always changing--new things are written,Old things are erased.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,030
I know this isabout our baby,i just know it.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,650

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,740
No.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,200
He'll be able to domuch,much more.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,220
I looked at the book last night

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,080
And there was somethingreally scary.

15
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,910

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,450

Ok.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,590
Ah,you changed the sheets.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,760
Yeah. They get dusty.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,430
In one day?

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,310
I think you need to get something to eat.

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,030
Ok.

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,450
Thank you for painting the room again.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,070
No,you were right,honey.

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,040
The blue is better.

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,740
It's calmer.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,230
I miss the yellow.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,580
Don't. You're perfect.

30
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,950
- It's perfect. I'm just...
- Yeah.

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,470
Oh,i'm grumpy.

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,930

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,630
That's what i am,just a big,crazy,Pregnant,moody lady.and you have exams.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,080
It's nothing. It's fine.

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,120
No,med school is nothing?It's huge.

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,460
Ok,and then you've cooked.

37
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,220
You exchanged the crib!The new one's

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,840
So much better,by the way.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,650
I mean,you've done such--you couldn't have gottenmy car fixed?

40
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,590
Remember,they had to order the part.

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,890
Yeah,but did youtell them that we're stuckwith your truck?

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
Your ancient,unreliable truck?

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,740
I mean,did you tell them that this is an emergency?

44
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,640
- What emergency? 
- This could be an emergency.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,040
Look,i knowthat it's your due date,What the watcherspredicted,

46
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,710
But you're not gonnahave a baby tonight'cause it's after 8:00.

47
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,270
It's the book of changes,ok,not the watchers,

48
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,970
And they've been right about everything else.

49
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,820
Ok...do you really want them to beright about this?

50
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,630
I want to be prepared.

51
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,640
- Easy...

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,310
Let's go.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,450
How are you holding up?

54
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,770
- 16 laps,no progress.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,100
It hurts,i can't do this.

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,550
I can't do this.

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,490
Yes,you can.You have to!

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,580
Hey,honey. The doctor's here.We shouldgo through there.

59
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,170
Thank youfor not treating melike i'm crazy.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,990
It's just a feeling,you know?

61
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,480
It doesn't soundlike you're in labor,

62
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,000
But we'll just make sureeverything's ok.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,280
ok

64
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,570
Your babyis showing signs of fetal distress

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,060
And we need to move to an immediate delivery.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,710
- Get dr. Glass and call the o.r.,now!
- Jim,what's happening?

67
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,390
- they have to get the baby out.
- I need a mask.something's obstructingthe blood supply.

68
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,820
It could be the cord.

69
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,060
- We're going to turn youon your side.
- To my side?

70
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,620
What's going on?Is it ok?Is everything ok?!

71
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,570
They're gonna get him out,mel.

72
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,340
Ok,well,is it ok?

73
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,730

75
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,820
It's going to be ok.

76
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,360
Lots of pressure,ok?

77
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,580
Ok. Here we go.

78
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,700

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,680
He's almost there! He's almost out!

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,820
Tell me what'sgoing to happen.

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,500
Is he going to be ok?

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,270
Is he going to be born this day,like the book said,because that's his fate?

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,960
Fate?

85
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,310
You made this happen.

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,720
You and the book.

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,480
So that's how it works?

88
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,030
Fate and free will working together?

89
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,580
I hope so.i'd really like to see your child live.

90
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,290
Ok,we got 'em,we got 'em!

You did it,mel. You ok,are you all right.

93
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,900
His color's good.

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,150
He's notbreathing.

95
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,230
He isn't breathing.why isn't he breathing?

96
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,130
What do you mean,he's not breathing?

97
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,840
It's ok,honey.

98
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,720
What do you mean,he's not breathing?Stay with him!

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,550
I will,i will.

100
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,540
I'm gonna give him some breaths witha bag and a mask.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,410
I'm gonna suction hisairway again.

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,980
Is he ok?

103
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,070
He'll be ok,they'll get himbreathing.

104
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,800
- Here we go,that's the boy.- He's breathing.

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,660
He's fine,mel.he's ok.

106
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,770
Here's your little boy.

107
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,050
Hi!

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,150
I feel like i've waited My whole life just to meet you.

109
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,850
Hi,dr. Chase.

110
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,440
You were gone a really long time. Is something wrong?

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,110
His apgar scores are normal.

112
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,420
He's healthyand responsive.

113
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Everything seems to be fine.

114
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,690
Doc,is there anything you're not telling us?

115
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,720
When we got to him,his pulse was low,

116
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,310
His coloring was blue.

117
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,540
Everything pointed to some kind ofobstruction or distress.

118
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,070
And then,before he evenbreathed on his own,

119
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,260
His color floated back.

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,660
I've never seenanything like it.

121
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,940
I think somebody's ready to celebrate.

122
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,720
He wants to nurse.

123
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,130
You're not justsomebody.

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,140

Is this what our lives have become together,little man?

146
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,980
One giant party?

147
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,220

Wait a minute,did you justgo some place

Or...did someone just come visit us?

158
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,130
It was a nurse.

159
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,790
She was standing right there.

160
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,780
You know,is it me or this happening More oftenthese days?

161
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,570
Yeah. I guess in the last couple of years.

162
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,060
She was askingfor two units of packed cells?

163
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,420
Blood.

164
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,580
Does she have anything to do With the ghostyou're dealingwith right now?

165
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,860
I don't think so.

166
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,410

178
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,050
We brought a lot so you can share with your friends.

179
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,380
Hey,i'm sorry i'm goingto miss your party with your friends,

180
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,190
But another doctor got sick,so...

181
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,010
It's ok.

182
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,730
But next week on my day off,

183
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,890
I am going to come to school,i'm gonna take you out of there

184
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,170
And we're gonna go out and do something cool.

185
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,810

186
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,420

- Yeah!

187
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,800
Well,fine,if that'sthe way you two want it.

188
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,690
Levi kramer says he doesn'tsee ghosts.

189
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,750
He saidwe made them all up.

190
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,050
Um,did he usedto see them?

191
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,420
Yeah,but not anymore.

192
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,570
When i am goingto stop seeing them?

193
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,870
Do you want to stop?

194
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,930
Do you?

195
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,110
Sometimes.

196
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,560
What about you?

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,210
You know,to tell youthe truth...

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,440
I don't remember ever seeing them.

199
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,850
I mean,i'm sure i did.

200
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,170
But then,i don't know,a friend or a grown-up

201
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,350
Probably came up to me and told me that i was imagining them.

202
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,310
So they lied to you?

203
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,420
No,i think they justdidn't understand.

204
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,720
Like people don't understand Mommy canstill see 'em?

205
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,440
Is that why we haveto keep it a secret?

206
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,400
Hey.

207
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,700
Does it feel bad?Having to keep it a secret?

208
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,920
The spirali put on that ball!

209
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,720
That wasa bullet.

210
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,800
There's a lot of ghostsat your job.

211
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,540
Can ghosts getbirthday presents?

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,190
No!

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,540
She's the authority.

214
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,920
- Too bad. 
- Yeah,too bad.

215
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,720

Yeah,it's almost a toss-up,you know?

234
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,000

I don't knowabout that one.

239
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,570
Haven't you ever noticed that every yearit's something?

240
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,750
Yeah,i mean,last year,

241
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,960
Aiden fell outof that bouncerand needed stitches.

242
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
The year before that,i walked into the plate glass door.

243
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,190
Yep. And when he wastwo,he spiked thatcrazy high fever.

244
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,560
Yeah,well,look at him now.

245
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,300
Aiden's the best one.

246
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,410
He is so much coolerthan the other kids.

247
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,800
- Even if he can't do tricks.
- All right,eli.

248
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,120
What?

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,320
- The watchers saidhe'd have super powers.
- They said he would be powerful.

250
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,770
Are you talking aboutaiden's super powers?

251
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,430
Ok,both of you,enough.

252
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,780
- Ready,aiden?
- Ok.

253
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,800
- But aren't you curious?
- Ready?

254
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
I mean,he's five now,and look at him.

255
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,240
He's just so happy and normal.

256
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,170
Yeah,you can imagine my concern,

257
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,080
'cause what mother would want a happy,normal kid?

258
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,100
Yeah,but this is not about what you want.

259
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,100
His life,his gift,may serve a larger purpose.

260
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,020

Look,they're gonna runsome tests on him tonight,It'll be ok.

284
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,310
They said that his bloodpressure is normal.

285
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,980
- And his heart is fine. 
- Melinda...

286
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,210
They're not goingto find anything.

287
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,260
Where are we?

288
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,910
We're at the hospital.

289
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,280
Did we come to pick up daddy?

290
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,630
You don't remember anything?

291
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,640
Did i fall asleepin the car?

292
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,210
No,baby.

293
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,760
Come here.

294
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,140
Do they really haveto keep him overnight?

295
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,080
That's good,he'll getsome sleep.

296
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,520
Mel,there's got to be a medicalcause for this.

297
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,710
I'm telling you,it was the ghost,i saw her.

298
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,280
You see a lot of ghosts,all right?

299
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,190
- And i've seen youexperience a lot of hideous things.
- Only whatthey've experienced.

300
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,090
I know,in a new vision,but then its overand you're fine.

301
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,110
So is aiden,physically.

302
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,870
I mean,he doesn't remember a thing.

303
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,500
This time.

304
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,370
What if it happens again?

305
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,670
I don't know.

306
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,980
I don't knowwho the ghost is.

307
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,700
Does aiden?

308
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,450
Mom?

309
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,510
Hey,sweetheart.

310
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,470
- How you doing?
- Good.

311
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,890
Where's dad?

312
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,340
He's doing his rounds.

313
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,030
Then we're all goingto go to breakfast,

314
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,670
And your daddy's going to take you home.

315
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,800
Ok.

316
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,930
And then i'm going to figure out what made you sick.

317
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,590
But i'm not sick.

318
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,360
Aiden,do you remember anything about last night,

319
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,140
Before you fell asleep?Did you...

320
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,660
See someone?

321
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,170
You mean a ghost?

322
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,160
Yes.

323
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,740
Just the lady.

324
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,670
The onewho sings to me.

325
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,140
Sings to you?

326
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,040
Happy birthday.

327
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,920
Have you seen her before?

328
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,510
I see herevery year.

329
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,140
Do you know who she is?

330
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,610
No. But she always remember my birthday.

331
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,620
Always.

332
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,860
She always remembersmy birthday.

333
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,280
How long is "Always"To a little kid,do you think?

334
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,670
I believe him.

335
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,390
I mean,all the illnesses,the accidents,

336
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,410
Every year on his birthday,something bad has happened To aiden or jim or me.

337
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,730
I think she's been there,

338
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,040
And i think she's been with us every year.

339
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,330
Yeah,but is she haunting aidenor the whole family?

340
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,490
And why onlyon that day?

341
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,380
What?Five second rule.

342
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,730
If it is every year,How come he hasn't mentioned her until now?

343
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,090
'cause he seesghosts all the time.

344
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,680
Yeah,but they didn'taffect him.

345
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,580
Not like the way this one did.

346
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,040
Maybe she's feeding offof his strength.

347
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,300
Maybe she knows that he's--

348
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,230
What,that he can see ghosts,Just like every kid his age?

349
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,750
Yeah,but he isn't likeany other kid his age.

350
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,830
Not according to the watchersor the book.

351
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,770
What about the book?

352
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,050
You know,we've beenstudying the bookfor years now.

353
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,880
Ned's practicallymajoring in it.

354
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,870
When i heardabout what happenedlast night,

355
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,280
I went to the page with your name on it,The onethat predictedaiden's birth.

356
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,980
You know,sometimesthe book of changes.Actually,uh,changes.

357
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,740
There's beena new entry.

358
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,850
It's about your son.

359
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,660
Ok,so what does that mean for aiden?

360
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,940
We don't know.but that writing,that's latin.

361
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,500
It says,"When the leaves fall,So will the innocent."

362
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,420
But maybe the ghostis part of the prophecy.

363
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,490
Maybe she's part of what's supposed to happen.

364
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,730
What,to aiden?

365
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,270
Is that what we're really talking about right now,

366
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,860
'cause it's notgonna happen.

367
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,010
And i want this ghostto stay away from my son.

368
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,820
Ok,but we don't even knowwho she is.

369
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,060
Look,the...

370
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,690
The clock stoppedright--

371
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,980
right before Aiden got better last night.

372
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,550
And it happened once before.

373
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,080
The night he was born.

374
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,010
Cross match two unitsof packed cells,

375
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,450
Start an i.v. Line and get some oxygen.

376
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,310
The patientwas losing blood.

377
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,160
I think she died in that hospital

378
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,850
The night my son was born.

379
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,770
11:48 p.m.

380
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,660
Does jim like working here?

381
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,900
Yeah,he loves it.

382
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,260
I'm just glad we didn'thave to move for his residency.

383
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,960
But you feel it,too,right?

384
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,140
I mean,every time i treat a patient here,

385
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,210
As soon as i walkinto the building...

386
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,800
Yeah,i feel it.

387
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,130
Lost souls,you know?

388
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,140
But it's a hospital.

389
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,470
People die here.

390
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,480
No,i workedin a lot of hospitals.

391
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,150
There's something different about this one.

392
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,630
This is her.amber heaton.

393
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,630
She was only 20 when shedied of an aortic rupture as a result of childbirth.

394
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,950
****

395
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't you darethreaten my son.

396
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,440
I don't have to.

397
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,150
It's already done.

398
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,830
Hi.

399
00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:04,050
He's mine.

400
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,200
How we doin'?

401
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,960
Better,thanks.

402
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,500
Look,this might not bethe best time to tell you,

403
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,730
But...well,actually,maybe it's perfect.

404
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,820
Look,remember how i promised aiden

405
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,370
That i would take himanywhere he wanted to go

406
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,220
After i missed his party?

407
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,150
Well,look,i caved.

408
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,600
I told him that i wouldtake him to pickwick's fun factory

409
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,150
- And bowling alley.
- pickwick's,really?

410
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,360
Yeah. Look,and i told him It was a once in a lifetime trip,

411
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,400
And i also told himnever to bother youabout it again.

412
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,980
Jim,it's fine.

413
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,660
It's your party.

414
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,820
Pickwick's is fine?

415
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,670
Melinda...

416
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,530
What's a matter?

417
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,260
The ghost.

418
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,450
I think she believesthat her son's spiritwent into aiden.

419
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,420
Wait,like what happenedto me? Like a step-in?

420
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,570
It would explain why she showed mehis body at the morgue,

421
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,900
Why she wrote "He's mine" In blood.

422
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,370
It's not so impossible,really.

423
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,750
I mean...they both had traumatic deliveries.

424
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,030
She died duringchildbirth.

425
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,930
I'm sure if we had stayed at that morguea little longer,

426
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,150
We would have found outthat her son died,too.

427
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,080
Yeah,but how didhe get into aiden?

428
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,050
Think about it.

429
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,780
Aiden was blue.

430
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,860
His heartwasn't pumping.

431
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,060
We don't know that he didn't die for a split second,

432
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,230
But long enough forher son to go in.

433
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,450
Honey,you don't believe that,do you?

434
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,200
Not in my heart.

435
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,330
No. But it would explain some things.

436
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,850
Like,why doesn'the have super powers?

437
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,780
Hey,you know,you've justbeen talking to eli too much.

438
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,590
I mean,i would love himthe same,either way.

439
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
He's my son.

440
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,520
But i can't help but wonder that...

441
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,840
Maybe he'd be better offif he wasn't.

442
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,750
Why? Why,becausethe book says--

443
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,340
"When the leaves fall,so will the innocent."

444
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,770
Jim,i'm worried.

445
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,500
What if i don't knowwhat's coming?

446
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,560
What if i can'tprotect him?

447
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,370
Hello?

448
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,680
Before i tell youwhat i got,

449
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,240
Can we just take a moment to appreciate How good a friend i am?

450
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,960
What'd you get?

451
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,110
Well,the moment i pictured Was a little bit longerthan that,but ok.

452
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,700
I got all the medicalrecords on your ghost.

453
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,780
How? Jim askedall of hishospital contacts.

454
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,200
I treat people there.

455
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,200
I have my own system passwords.

456
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,310
I entered a patient nameincorrectly,

457
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,320
Like,illegally incorrectly.

458
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,140
Which is why i thought maybea thank you,you know,would--

459
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,460
Ok,thank you.

460
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,660
What'd you find out?

461
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,320
First of all,it's no coincidence

462
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,860
That the ghostis attached to you.

463
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,210
You were right.she died in the o.r.,

464
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,090
The delivery roomnext to yours.

465
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,200
Ok. So what happenedto amber's baby?I mean,did he die?

466
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,730
Almost. His blood supplywas cut off and he coded,

467
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,390
But he was revived with no permanenttissue or brain damage.

468
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,820
Thank god.

469
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,080
Ok,so then what?

470
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,650
Then what,what?

471
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,500
If amber thinksthat her baby died

472
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,450
And came back as aiden,which obviously he didn't.

473
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,050
So where is he now?

474
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,000
****

475
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,310
Wait,it says in his medical records that he was adopted?

476
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,250
They had to indicate custody.

477
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,650
Amber was dead.

478
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,530
Ok,do these parentshave names?

479
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,660
No dice.

480
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,450
Closed adoption.

481
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,630
Ok,we got 'em,we got 'em!

482
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,960
Out at 23:48.

483
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,810
- He isn't breathing.
- why isn't he breathing?

484
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,890
****

485
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,540
Jim,stay with him,i think he's not breathing.

486
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,460
He's ok!

487
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,980
Amber?

488
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,990
Where are you?

489
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,240
Amber?

490
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,480
- We need to talk.
- I want my baby.

491
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,590
You're trying to take him away from me.

492
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,290
I'm not trying to take anything away from you.

493
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,000
You told him he doesn'thave to see meif he doesn't want to.

494
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,990
Oh,when i told himthat he didn't haveto see ghosts?

495
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,260
That's what got you upset?

496
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,790
I'm his mother.

497
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,730
A child ought to bewith his mother.

498
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,150
You really think that you're aiden's mother.

499
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,000
What makes you so sure?

500
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,150
There wasn't any timefor pain medication,

501
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,990
So i still feeleverything.

502
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,680
I was bleedingso badly.

503
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,790
My baby was dyinginside of me.

504
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,770
They were racing to get him out,

505
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,990
But even when they got him free,

506
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,700
He was too weak.

507
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,770
He wouldn't breathe.

508
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,750
I kept trying to tell themto show me my son,

509
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,290
But they wouldn'tlet me speak.

510
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,160
I saw two nurses rush him away.

511
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,550
I couldn'tfight it anymore.

512
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,910
One of the nursescame back.

513
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,210
She said something to the other nurse.

514
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,410
I knew it meantmy baby was dead.

515
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,950
I kept screaming at them to tell me what had happened,

516
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,170
But they couldn'thear me.

517
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,330
I waited to take himinto the light,

518
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,320
But he didn't come.

519
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,990
And then i heard him.

520
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,590
He was alive.

521
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,270
He might have to livein another form,but my son was alive.

522
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,110
But you didn't see his spiritgo into my son's body,did you?

523
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,860
I didn't have to.

524
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,390
That child,the one you call aiden,he's mine.

525
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,500
If he's yours,then why wouldyou hurt him?

526
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,110
Why would you want him to suffer?

527
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,220
- I would never do that.
- But you did.

528
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,860
You gave himthose symptoms.

529
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,000
No. I didn't.

530
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,060
I was just watching him.I was just watching my son.

531
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,360
Amber,there's somethingthat you need to know.

532
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,700
Your son's spiritdidn't need another Child's bodybecause he didn't die.

533
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,640
But those nurses...

534
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,580
They were probably talking about you.

535
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,920
And what a tragedy it was that you nevergot to hold your son.

536
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,320
I don't understand.if he's still alive,where is he?

537
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,300
He was adopted.

538
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,780
- That can't be.
- it's true.

539
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,090
And it's reallygood news.

540
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,500
- He went straight to the family that you chose for him.
- I chose?

541
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,200
It was a closed adoption.

542
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,130
That meansthere was a contract.You probably agreedto it in advance.

543
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,380
No,that's notpossible.I didn't want that.

544
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,780
what do you mean?

545
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,770
I can't do this!

546
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,630
Yes,you can,you have to!

547
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,020
Was that the adoptive father?

548
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:27,530
****

549
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,840
That messagewas for the nurses.

550
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,020
You changed your mindabout the adoption.You wanted to keep your baby.

551
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,200
They can't have him.

552
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,730
It's too late.

553
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,500
Amber,he belongsto them now.

554
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,790
He belongs with me!

555
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,120
You're not going to find them.

556
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,700
In closed adoptions,the birth parents,adopted parents,

557
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,850
- The records are sealed.
- Well,i have to find them.

558
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,940
I mean,you should haveseen how angry she was.

559
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,670
At you?

560
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,200
No,the adoptive father.they were arguing.

561
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,700
Arguing? They shouldnever have even met.

562
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,150
What were theyarguing about?

563
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,210
She changed her mind.it sounded like he was threatening her.

564
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,900
You know,maybe he was going to take her to court.

565
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,260
Yeah,but don'tthe adoption laws Protectthe birth mother?

566
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,600
It always allows for a change of heart.

567
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,720
I mean,

568
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,210
He would not havea leg to stand on.

569
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,090
Unless...

570
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,760
Unless he had his own rights.

571
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,950
Parental rights,

572
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,170
Like the kind you would get if you were the blood father.

573
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,470
Adopting your own kid?I mean,why would he do that?

574
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,130
She was 20 years old.

575
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,770
He looked likehe was in his late thirties,I'm gonna guess married.

576
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,400
How did they get involved?

577
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,240
The ghost obitsaid that she was An internat ufland consulting.

578
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,130

00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,470

Right,yeah,he's at tyler'sbirthday party,of course.

583
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,900
Tell himthat aiden is a guest.

584
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,590

585
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,030
But we lost our invite.

586
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,570
Can you tell mewhere the party is?

587
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,500
Thank you.

588
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,350

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,870
They're at pickwick's.

590
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,650
So?That's where jim took aiden.They're at the same place.

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,470
I'm so sorry,but just this once,can you watch the store?

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,930
Yes,of course.i still have my key.

593
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,660
But relax,mel,that's a coincidence.

594
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,720
Yeah,i used to believein coincidence.

595
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,750
What happened?

596
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,660
I read a book that changed my mind.

597
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,910
Too badwe couldn't bowl.

598
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,930

677
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,560
I made tyler stay with me,like i was supposed to.

678
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,280
Who told you thatyou're supposed to?

679
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,500
I don't know. Did i make a mistake?

680
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,560

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,050

Thanks.

687
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,170
I think amber'sready to talk now.

688
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,990
Oh,why don't i give your husband a hand with the boys?

689
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,710
I'm sorry about whati did in that place.

690
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,150
I didn't know i could do that.

691
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,400
She's sorry about what happenedwith the boys,

692
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,370
And she didn't knowher own strength.

693
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,760
Yeah,well,i'm sorry,too.

694
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,740
Can you tell her why?

695
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,490
I'm not proud of whati did back then.

696
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,090
It was a hard time for me and emily,

697
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,680
But that's no excuse.

698
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,370
So then what happened?

699
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,710
They were trying really hard to get pregnant,

700
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,120
- But it wasn't working out.
- My wife and i were having problems.

701
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,650
I'd stay late at the office

702
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,700
And amber was alwaysright there,

703
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,410
Just ready to listen.

704
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,890
There was a partyto celebratelanding a new client.

705
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,910
There was someoffice party,and...

706
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,200
I know,it's a clich?

707
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,610
I never thought i coulddo something like that.

708
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,970
It was one time.

709
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,580
One time,and i was pregnant.

710
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,080
I knew i hadto have the baby,

711
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,690
But i was 20 years old.

712
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,140
I thought i had my wholelife in front of me.

713
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,330
Emily,she--we--really,really wanted children.

714
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,300
We'd alreadydecided to adopt When amber cameto me,pregnant.

715
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,730
So you thoughta closed adoptionwould be perfect

716
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,740
Because then your baby would have a home.

717
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,700
Without anger or resentment,

718
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,780
And his wifewould never know.

719
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,400
And then shechanged her mind.

720
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,890
At the last moment,i thought i could do it.

721
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,710
I could raise my son.

722
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,740
I didn't know what would happen.

723
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,560
I didn't know howshe'd treat if she ever knew the truth.

724
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
Is she here?

725
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,100
Yeah.

726
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,250
It's ok,emilyknows everything.I told herthat night.

727
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,360
When the man you love,trusted,

728
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,890
Comes to you withsomething like this...

729
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,810
It can turn your heart to stone.

730
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,350
Unless you're holdinga baby in your arms.

731
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,580
Watching him grow...

732
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,410
Knowing he needs you.

733
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,520
He needs love.

734
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,620
He needed us.

735
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,030
Because the young girlwho loved him and gave him life Lost her own.

736
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,030
I sawthat before.

737
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,210
But i felt so alone.

738
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,960
So scared for him.

739
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,820
But i know you're oknow,aren't you,sweetheart?

740
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,990
Tell themto be good to him.

741
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,890
To keep loving him.

742
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,180
She wants you to love him.

743
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,150
The way that she would have.

744
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,790
We will.

745
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,570
I think we always have.

746
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,210
And one day when he's ready,

747
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,870
We'll tell himall about you.

748
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,520
She's gone.

749
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,780
- Bye!-Bye!

750
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,750
i've got company.

751
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,730
I'll be inside.

752
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,120
Ok.

753
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,740
So how long have you known?

754
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,160
Known what?

755
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,520
How long have you knownwhat my son can do?

756
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,150
You mean what you twocan do together?

757
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,230
Look,we're connected.

758
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,870
I've always know that somehow,

759
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,600
But...

760
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,520
The visions i've had,they've been from aiden?

761
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,620
How do they come to him?

762
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,540
I mean,is he--is he a sensitive?

763
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,640
The word you'relooking for is "Empath."

764
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,290
He can shareother people's feelings,

765
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,010
Their experiences.

766
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,490
That's why he's sickand then gets better.

767
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,360
Why he turned blue and couldn't talk.

768
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,030
It's like he'sexperiencing something

769
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,150
That somebody else has already been through somehow.

770
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,530
Like the day he was born.

771
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,470
And every birthday since.

772
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,420
Her symptoms,

773
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,410
She relived them,and he relived themright along with her.

774
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,530
And you relivedsome of it,too,through him.

775
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,840
Hi.

776
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,020
Tea? You want a refill?

777
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,500
I would love a whisky sour.

778
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,030
Sometimes i just wishyou were less of a watcherand more of a talker.

779
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,790
I mean,peoplealmost got hurt.

780
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,480
That's how we learn.all of us,living and dead.

781
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,820
And besides,it's the rules.

782
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,730
God,you have an answerfor everything.

783
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,130
If i did...

784
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,600
There would be no need for us to watch,would there?

785
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,350
What are we going to tell him?

786
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,930
Nothing,not about this.

787
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,420
You don't want him to know he's connected to you?

788
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,970
No.

789
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,670
If he did,then he'd know that his dreamsaren't really his.

790
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,980
I want his dreamsto belong to him,like any little boy.

791
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,410
I heard your voices.

792
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,080
I thought you were my dream.

793
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,270
No. But you're our dream.
