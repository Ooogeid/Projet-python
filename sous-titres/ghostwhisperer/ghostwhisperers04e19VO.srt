00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Previously on ghost whisperer...</i>

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,200
day of the accident, i saw
jim's ghost step into sam's body.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
you're back!

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,600
Do i know you?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,900
Your memories, they're not yours.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
- Who am i?
- Jim!

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,700
I'm not your husband.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,000
What's wrong with melinda,
what's going on?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Eli: she's trappe underground,
the water is rising.

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
You know all this from a ghost?

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
Sometimes you just have
to take a leap of faith.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,300
Sam! You came for me!

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
What--Why do you keep calling me sam?

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,700
Call me jim, mel. It's my name.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Jim?

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,800
This is my face now.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,300
You did it for us.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,900
can you tell me more?

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,000
I think i've given you every detail.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
You really don't remember
being sam at all?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,100
I don't.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
I mean, i remember
the sound of a gunshot

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,900
And then a burning feeling
in my shoulder.

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,200
And then seeing you,

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,000
And your hand in mine.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,100
And then...

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,500
you never left me.

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,600
Never.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,300
I died.

30
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,000
And i don't remember
any of that either.

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,200
I mean, the after part.

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,000
- The ghost part?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,100
And i always wanted to know, like,

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,800
How the other half lives.

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,600
what about you?

36
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
I mean, how long have you
been seeing this sam guy?

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,000
2 months?

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
All right, i knew it was you.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,100
Ok? I saw you go into his body.
All i see is you.

40
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,800
And nobody else does, huh?

41
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Yeah, people are gonna talk.
A merry widow and all that.

42
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,900
Let 'em.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Yeah, but seriously...

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,200
what are we going to do?

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,100
You know?

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,300
Who am i gonna be?

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
The man i married.

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Yeah, but not to everybody else.

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,900
it's almost 5 a.M.

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
Do you have to work today?

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,500
No. No, i'll have delia cover for me

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,900
Or i'll close the shop.

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,800
Want to get some sleep?

54
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,300
I can't, honestly.

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,700
Coffee.

56
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
I'll go make it.

57
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,000
Help! Help! Help me!

58
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Help me!

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,500

60

Help! Help me!

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800

Please help me,
please help me!

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,400
Morgan, it's me, eli, your neighbor.
Are you all right?

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,400
I don't know!

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Is someone in there with--

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
No. No.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,700
I think i'm going crazy.

68
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,200
Please help me.

69
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,200
????

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,900
That windows is--
It's closed.

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,200
i see.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

73
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,500
No, it's ok. It's all right.
I'm going to help you, ok?

74
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,200
do you want to die?

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,300
can you see us?

GHOST WHISPERER S04E19

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,800
Honey, that is your third
espresso this morning.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,100
You're exhausted. Just go home.

81
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,900
I would love to, believe me,

82
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,800
But i just feel like
jim needs his space.

83
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,700
You just got back together!

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,900
Yeah, we did.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
And it's amazing,

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
you know, And i'm really grateful
and he is, too. It's just...

87
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
i got him back, you know,
But he didn't get his life back.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He's gotta go find himself
all over again.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,200
He's got sam's face, Sam's rÉSum?,
And jim's skills.

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Well, can't he just study
to be a paramedic again?

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
I mean, he'd ace the course work.

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,700
Yeah, what about his friends?
I mean, isn't that kind of lying?

93
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,300
Hey.

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,300
Are you ok?

95
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
Good, fine.

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,800
Sort of, not so good.

97
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,600
I ran into a nasty ghost
this morning.

98
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh. Anyone you know?

99
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,900
No.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
And if he's a neighbor,
i'm glad i never met him,

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,700
Because he's terrorizing
the girl next door.

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,900
What's the connection?

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't know.

104
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,500
She says she's never known
anyone who's died,

105
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
Except her grandmother

106
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,500
and a boy she knew in the eighth grade
Who choked on a brussel sprout.

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
That's horrible.

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,000
Chew your food. That's
what my mom always tells me.

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,300
Look, i know you're
all blissed out and reunited

110
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,400
And you want to be with jim

111
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,600
and you guys just Probably
want to be together.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,100
Wait, why aren't you together?

113
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
Eli, how can i help you?

114
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
The ghost is making
some intense threats,

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
And i don't know
if they're for me or for her.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,100
What kind of threats?

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,900
Very specific. He asked me
if i wanted to die.

118
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,000
Which i don't.

119
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,900
That's all he said?

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
I guess he felt he made his point.

121
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,300
So tell me about her dreams.

122
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,700
Let's just say that this guy
is not a big fan of gravity.

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,800
Are you ok here?

124
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah, absolutely, no problem.

125
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Let's go.

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,100
how long have these things
been happening?

127
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,700
I don't know.

128
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,500
It feels like a dream.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,100
That's what i thought was happening,

130
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,000
That i was sleepwalking
and just trashing my place.

131
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
Until you saw it, too.

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
The wind.

133
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,400
Hale and hearty.
From a closed window.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,900
So you can communicate with the dead?

135
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,900
I mean, what do you see,
auras or something?

136
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Or something.

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,700
Um, so you don't know
anyone who died?

138
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,700
A man? Not too old,
not too young.

139
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,900
No.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,700
And you're not sure
of when this all started?

141
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,900
Like i said,
it feels like a dream.

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,500
A nightmare.

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,300
The same one over and over.

144
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
More or less.

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,700
Why is this happening?

146
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Someone who died has some
unfinished business with you.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
I told you, i don't know
anyone who's died.

148
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,100
Are you sure that it's a man?

149
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,700
pretty sure.

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,300
???

151
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,700
Oh, my god!

152
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,700
What happened?

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,100
My god, are you ok?

154
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,800
Can i--Can i get
some water? Please?

155
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,800
Yeah, uh--

156
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
My heart--My heart
was pounding in my chest

157
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,400
And i felt like i was falling.

158
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,400
You almost did.

159
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
No, no, no. Really falling.

160
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,000
You were really falling.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
No, to my death!

162
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,700
I think that's how the ghost died.

163
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,300
So you've been
having nightmares every night.

164
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,800
You wake up, your stuff is levitating

165
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
and you have no idea when it started?

166
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,500
Well, morgan's probably embarrassed.

167
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
It's not easy to admit a ghost
has been floating your knick knacks.

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,100
Is it me or does
knick knack sound dirty?

169
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,400
It's you, and unless
she's haunted by an astronaut,

170
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,100
I think we should be looking into
falling, not floating.

171
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,100
Ok, ahead of you there, but that's
not exactly narrowing the field.

172
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,000
We could spend all day looking to
id accident victims Or suicides

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
who fell to their deaths.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The curtains.

175
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,900
It wasn't just the wind,
It was the curtains.

176
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
You said in her dream
that she was floating

177
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,600
Before he brought her back
slowly to the floor.

178
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
Ok, so he was careful
with her, or torturing her.

179
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry, did you say
you liked morgan's curtains?

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,700
In my vision, The floating,

181
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,700
my heart pounding,
The billowing fabric.

182
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,600
Maybe there's only one kind of
jumper we need to be looking for.

183
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,600
Oh, a recreational one!
A parachute.

184
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,600
Here.

185
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
Skydiving.

186
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,700
Here we go--One incident,
and a grandview resident.

187
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,500
Oh, you're so much faster
than me. How do you--

188
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,300
That's him, Rick hartman.
He died skydiving in mexico.

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Oof. His chute never opened.
That had to hurt.

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,100
It says he was on a tour
with extreme action adventure company.

191
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,900
His death was
their first fatality.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ohh.

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,300
The irony, it's too cruel.
It says that he was an actuary.

194
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,100
The guy spends his life behind
the safety of a desk Assessing risk,

195
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
and he dies trying One of
the riskiest sports around?

196
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
An actuary. What does
your neighbor do?

197
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Some kind of graphic arts.

198
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,200
Wait, he's 15 years older than her.

199
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,400
An actuary. She's an artist.
How do they know each other?

200
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,700
Was that his old apartment,
did they meet on the internet?

201
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,300
Well, let's give her his name
and see if it rings a bell.

202
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Great, but i doubt
you'll get very far.

203
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,300
- Why?
- He died 6 weeks ago.

204
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,900
If she knew him,
wouldn't she have heard?

205
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,100
You might want to talk
to someone else.

206
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, who? He lived alone.
He didn't have any kids.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,300
The action adventure people.

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
He died on their watch.

209
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,400
There you go.

210
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,700
So are you ok?
You need anything else?

211
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
No, i'm good. Thanks for the coffee.
Thanks for meeting me.

212
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,700
It's all about the client.
We aim to please.

213
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,500
Yeah, and scare the crap
out of people.

214
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,100
I was looking at
your company's website--

215
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,300
Glacier skiing, running
class four rapids, Bullfighting?

216
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,100
Yeah, but on the cycling
tour in italy,

217
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,400
There's a van that follows you
with bread, cheese and a daybed.

218
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Here's a catalog.

219
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,100
Oh! I want to go skydiving.

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
I dreamt about it my whole life,
But i'm a little nervous.

221
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
I read about that guy,
the one who died.

222
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Yeah, that was--

223
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,000
A terrible accident.

224
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
It seems his chute
was packed improperly.

225
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,300
Oh, i don't know how ???

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,900
Yeah, but the fellow
you're referring to, i mean--

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,700
Uh, what's his name,
rick something?

228
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Rick hartman.

229
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,100
He did know.
He jumped several times.

230
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,000
But just you know, the first 10 jumps
are always accompanied,

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,100
So if for whatever reason
your chute doesn't open,

232
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,200
Your instructor's will.

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,700
Wait, that guy did more
than 10 jumps?

234
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Yeah. I mean,

235
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
he climbed volcanoes,
he swam with the sharks,

236
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
He hunted wild bore.

237
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Most dangerous one,
by the way.

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,800
Did he ever mention a girl
to you, named morgan?

239
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,500
Uh, no.

240
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,700
Wait a minute,
did you know this guy?

241
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,400
No.

242
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,200
you're not interested in
booking a trip with us, are you?

243
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,300
Look, jack, all i can tell you
is i'm not a cop,

244
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
And i don't work for any
insurance companies.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm just trying to help someone
who knew rick get her life back.

246
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,900
Well, maybe you should be
talking to her about him.

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,900
I did.

248
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,900
Problem is, she claimed
she never knew him.

249
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,500
Look, he died jumping
out of your airplane.

250
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,100
I figured you'd want to help.

251
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,300
Did he seem like someone
who got fixated on things?

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Now, look, a guy comes in,
he's a total pencil pusher.

253
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
He said he'd never even
played contact sports in his life,

254
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,700
And a week later he's spelunking
in a cave in brazil.

255
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,700
You must have been some salesman.

256
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,900
No, i didn't push. Not at all.
It all came from him.

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
It's like he got addicted to
the thrills Or he had a...

258
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
A death wish?

259
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,900
so now you're a trust attorney?

260
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,700
hey, you know what,
my legal expertise was only implied.

261
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,200
The landlord made assumptions.

262
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,800
Wow, this place looks untouched.

263
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,300
So why is all this stuff still in here?

264
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh, you know, no family to clean it out.

265
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Condo's in the trust,

266
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,100
but the estate Hasn't
put it on the market yet.

267
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,600
Well, it is definitely ready to show.

268
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,500
I mean, everything
looks very organized.

269
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,400
All put in neat little stacks.

270
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
What are we looking for?

271
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Just to find out why mr. Safe
and reasonable Was hooked on a death wish.

272
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,800
Man, even his books
were alphabetized.

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, and this stuff,
"for my good friend neil."

274
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Everything on this desk
has one of these labels.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,100
"For jocelyn gracie,
My colleague and my friend."

276
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
This guy wasn't just organized.

277
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,800
No, he definitely had his affairs
in order And was expecting the end.

278
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,900
Hey, look at this.

279
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Anti-Nausea pain pills.

280
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,100
All this medication,

281
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,400
that's what you take For chemo
and end-Stage cancer.

282
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,400
Ok. So he was dying.

283
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,300
All right.
Keep looking around.

284
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
See if you can find anything
with morgan's name on it.

285
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Help us know
why he's haunting her.

286
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
Wait a minute, what is this?

287
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
"Scuba diving on
the great barrier reef."

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,200
"Boar hunting in fiji, skydiving,"

289
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
Check, check, check.

290
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
This is a bucket list--

291
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Things he was determined to do
before he died.

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Yeah. "Cook a perfect denver omelet,"

293
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
And "live to see the lunar eclipse."

294
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,300
Hmm, close but no cigar.
That's happening this week.

295
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,900
Look at the last thing on the list.

296
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
- Morgan.
- Yep.

297
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,500
Had no checkmark.
What did he want with her?

298
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,100
Whatever it is,
he didn't get it.

299
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,000
???

300
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
- i can keep looking...
- Ok, great.

301
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
yeah, i just thought
it would be worth a look.

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
Don't be freaked out,
it's going to be fine. Promise.

303
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,500
- Bye.
- All right, bye.

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,700
So?

305
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
She pulled up his obit,
looked at the photo, Nothing.

306
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
And what'd she say about
the bucket list?

307
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,800
"Gross."

308
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,200
Seriously, that's what she said.

309
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,500
I mean, do you blame her?

310
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,600
It's one thing to be the object
of some stranger's obsession,

311
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
But a dead stranger?

312
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,500
So he's obsessed with someone
He's never even met before?

313
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,100
- It happens.
- Not very often.

314
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,700
You think she's lying to us?

315
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
She was his dying wish.

316
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,600
You're gonna tell me he never
introduced himself Or asked her out?

317
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,200
Maybe he did and she passed.

318
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
I mean, do you remember every guy
that's ever asked you out?

319
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
He wasn't afraid to step off
the side of a moving plane.

320
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
You think he's going to be
afraid of a little rejection?

321
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,300
She has to remember him.

322
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,800
Then why would she lie about it?

323
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
I don't know.
Want me to talk to her?

324
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
No, let me get closer.

325
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,800
Closer?

326
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,500
Why are you willing to believe
everything this girl says?

327
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
She's my neighbor. She's nice.

328
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,700
I've spoken to her
maybe 3 times before this.

329
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,500
She's spoken back to me maybe once.

330
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,800
Yeah, cross the ghost over and then
you'll get her attention.

331
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
She's not in.

332
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,700
I saw her go out with one of
those green shopping bags.

333
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm all for saving
the planet, but burlap?

334
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,600
Not exactly sassy.

335
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,400
Mrs. Blakelock, when you see morgan,

336
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
Will you tell her that
i'm looking for her?

337
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,300
Oh, i don't get in people's business.

338
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,900
I mind my own.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
Right, of course.

340
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,800
Is that a new jacket?

341
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Yes, thank you.

342
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,700
Now why don't men wear
real jackets anymore?

343
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,200
You know, suit jackets
Attract the right kind of girl.

344
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,100
Ok. All right. Yeah.

345
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,500
actually, mrs. Blakelock,
I have a question for... you.

346
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,300
Have you ever seen
this man with morgan?

347
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
Oh, sure.

348
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
They like to hang out on the roof.

349
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah, no one's supposed
to be up there.

350
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
It's under construction.

351
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,500
Were they dating?

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,500
He's a little old for her,
don't you think?

353
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Well, i suppose.
Were they friends?

354
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,400
All i know is,

355
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
they left here Every tuesday, 2:15,

356
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
Like clockwork.

357
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Do you know where they went?

358
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,700
Well, one time,

359
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,900
I just happened to be
struggling with my mail.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,900
They stuff the box so full!

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,500
And i heard the word "meeting."

362
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,200
Another time, i heard the word "group."

363
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
You know, my ex-Husband
Did group therapy in the seventies.

364
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,200
He met a high-Strung stewardess
and they fell in love.

365
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Group therapy can
produce positive results.

366
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,200
Not for me.

367
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
It could have been drugs.

368
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,700
Or alcohol. Those group meetings.

369
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,600
That man, morgan's friend,
he had the look.

370
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,500
What do you mean?

371
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,500
Kind of thin, Pale, waxy.

372
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Yeah. That i knew.

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,800
Ok.

374
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Thank you.

375
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
- Delia.
- Hey!

376
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,900
Uh, jim. Hi.

377
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,300
What's happening?

378
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,800
Well, i was just going
to go get some coffee

379
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,500
and then stop by the store And
see if melinda wanted to have lunch.

380
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,200
She's not there.
She went to do something with eli.

381
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,900
You know...

382
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,000
- ghostly.
- Yeah.

383
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
- Right.
- But she said they'd be back soon.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
- Ok, thanks.
- Yeah.

385
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,700
Hey!

386
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,700
Oh, hey, bobby. What's up?

387
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Bobby tooch.

388
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,900
Um, hey.

389
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,900
You're...

390
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
bobby, this is, um--

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,700
- Sam.
- Sam lucas.

392
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
Melinda's friend, and mine.

393
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,900
Right, right.
I've seen you around...

394
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
with melinda.

395
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,300
Oh.

396
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
So much for coffee.

397
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,300
oh, well, do you want
to take mine?

398
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,000
Thank you.

399
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
I will see you, delia.

400
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,200
Tell melinda hello.
She needs anything,

401
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,900
Anything at all,
we're here for her.

402
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,700
Got it.

403
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,500
Do you know how many shifts
i worked with that guy?

404
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,100
I mean, how many people we helped?

405
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,300
The number of double dates melinda and i
went out With him and his girlfriends.

406
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm really sorry, jim.

407
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,100
I'd say i know how weird this must be,
But i really just can't imagine.

408
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,600
Ah, don't be sorry.

409
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,600
It's good to be back.

410
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,100
See you.

411
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,100
Tell melinda i'll see her at home.

412
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,700
Hi, i'm dave mckey,
one of the counselors here.

413
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,400
- Can i help you?
- Hey, eli james.

414
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,100
I'm a therapist over at rockland u.

415
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,800
I have a question
about one of your patients.

416
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
Ok, i'll help you if i can.

417
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm here about rick hartman.

418
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,000
Actually, a friend of his.
Morgan jefferies.

419
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How's she doing?

420
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,400
Honestly, not so good.

421
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,500
She's really struggling
with his death.

422
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,200
Yeah, well, they were so close.

423
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Yeah. Yeah, they were.

424
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,800
Very.

425
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,700
And i was wondering, since, um,
she accompanied him to so many meetings,

426
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,000
If you could give me an insight
into their relationship,

427
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,300
To allow me to help her.

428
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm sorry, I can't speak
to their relationship.

429
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,300
The groups need to be a safe place
for people to share their feelings.

430
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
Of course, i understand.
It's just...

431
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,100
therapist to therapist,

432
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,500
The depth of her grieving, it--

433
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,400
She's not the most
forthcoming patient.

1
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Well, maybe you should encourage her

2
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,200
To come back to the group.

3
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,900
To this group?

4
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,700
I thought she was really getting solace from it,

5
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,300
True support.

6
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,900
And long before rick even joined.

7
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
I'd hate to see rick's death get in
the way of that.

8
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,300
- Wait, she joined first?
- Yeah

9
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,400
that's how they met.

10
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,500
These are her peers.

11
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
No one else understands what
she's going through.

12
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,100
Even we can't.

13
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,900
We're not on the same level.

14
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
It could also be the medication.

15
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean, it does do that sometimes,
exacerbate depression.

16
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,600
Because morgan's dying, too.

17
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,600
Oh, i'm sorry.

18
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,500
???

19
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,200
I've gotta say, it feels a smidge sneaky 
tricking a fellow therapist

20
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,000
but how else were we supposed to find out
that morgan is dying?

21
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,800
What i don't get is if she and rick were really
as close as that guy says,

22
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
Why didn't she mention him?

23
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
Why is he tormenting her with those dreams
if they were friends?

24
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,900
Uh, a little heads up,
he doesn't look so friely right now.

25
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,300
Leave her alone.

26
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,800
We're not the problem.
Why are you haunting her?

27
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,100
Is it because she doesn't want people
to know she's sick?

28
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,800
No one outside of the group.

29
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,300
The group she stopped going to?

30
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
It's like she wants to die.

31
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,800
"Do you want to die?"
It wasn't a threat, It was meant for her.

32
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,500
- Why is she doing this?
- What?

33
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,700
Nothing.
Not one thing to save her life.

34
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,600
And haunting her
with images of your death

35
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Is supposed to what,
inspire her?

36
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,200
She has a chance.

37
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
Why won't she take it?

38
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Hey,

39
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,300
- What's going on?
- Can we come in? It's important.

40
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Yeah.

41
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,700
I didn't tell you i knew rick

42
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Because i didn't want you
to know how we met.

43
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,800
Morgan, i'm sorry.
I had no idea.

44
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,800
You look so healthy.

45
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
well,

46
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm not in any pain.

47
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,100
I'm feeling even stronger now
that i'm off the drugs.

48
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,700
- Were you doing chemo?
- Among other things.

49
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
- You name it, i tried it.
- Well, that's strange.

50
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,700
'Cause rick seemed to think
you weren't fighting it.

51
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Really?

52
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,000
Did he--
Did he tell you that?

53
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Yeah.

54
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
Is he here right now?

55
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,200
No. No, but when i see him,

56
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,400
I can see him as clearly
as i can see you.

57
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
So...

58
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
Was that something you talked about,
Him wanting you to fight?

59
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,400
Guess that's why
i was on his bucket list.

60
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,100
When rick found out
he was dying,

61
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,800
It just made him come alive.

62
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,800
He was willing to take on anything.

63
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,900
But he's right,
i am done fighting.

64
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,900
I get the sense
he's not going to give up on you,

65
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,200
Even if you're going to
give up on yourself.

66
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Why would you?
I mean,

67
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,700
You've tried all these other cures,
so why give up now?

68
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,800
Out of options.

69
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,000
Except for this one
treatment...

70
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,700
Did he tell you about that?

71
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,300
No, he hasn't been
the most forthcoming ghost.

72
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,800
We think he's trying to
protect your privacy.

73
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
So tell me about the treatment.

74
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,800
???
It really doesn't matter.

75
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,300
It's really expensive,
and my insurance doesn't cover it, so...

76
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,800
Do you have any family
or anyone who could help?

77
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,300
Yes, i have a lot of family.

78
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,300
Parents and younger sisters

79
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
And they would do anything they could,

80
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,000
bleed themselves dry,
And i can't have that, ok?

81
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,500
It's not worth it.

82
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm not worth it.

83
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,200
- What do you mean?
- It's too late, ok?

84
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,900
Can you just tell him that?

85
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
It's hard,
and it hurts too much.

86
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,400
The best thing
that rick can do for me

87
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,600
Is to find some peace for himself.

88
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I told him,
call a plumber,

89
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,600
But no, he had to
fix the pipe by himself.

90
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Goes and falls
off a ladder.

91
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,500
Hey, uh, buddy--
Wait.

92
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Look, i'm sorry,
but if he was welding

93
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,800
And he's allergic
to the chemicals in the flux,

94
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
- He could be heading into--
- Anaphylactic shock?

95
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,400
Thanks for the tip,
we got it covered.

96
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Right.

97
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,200
Sorry to butt in.

98
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
sam?

99
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,300
- Sam?
- Yeah?

100
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,600
How about that?
2 times in one day.

101
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,300
Got a way of showing up,
don't you?

102
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,700
Sorry.

103
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,400
Now i remember
where i know you from--

104
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,600
The other accident, the one the kid
fell off the roof.

105
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,500
Right, with the broken arm.

106
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Right, which you happened to
know a lot about setting,

107
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
I mean, for a civilian.
And now this guy needing adrenalin.

108
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,500
I do a lot of welding, so--

109
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,100
Is that what it is?

110
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,300
You're not some kind of
crash junkie, are you?

111
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,600
No.

112
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,700
Look, it's hard to explain, but...

113
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,700
I promise it won't happen again.
Sorry.

114
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Hey.

115
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,500
It's just that,

116
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
You gotta know,
melinda's husband...

117
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
He was a friend of mine.

118
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,200
Is he ok? You gonna be fine.
Just keep breathing.

119
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
I get where morgan's coming from.
It's brutal.

120
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,900
I mean, the side effects of the drugs
Can be worse than the illness.

121
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,500
So that's what you're researching?

122
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
No, i'm trying to find her family.

123
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Why?

124
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,200
I think they should
know about her illness.

125
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
You know, maybe they can
convince her to get treatment.

126
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
Our ghost can move on,
and who knows,

127
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,000
Maybe morgan will get better.

128
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,700
Yeah, well,
what about her privacy?

129
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Or doctor-Patient confidentiality?

130
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,100
She's not my patient.

131
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,800
But even if she were,
i'd have to weigh my responsibility

132
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,200
To contact the next of kin.

133
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,100
- I think she's dangerously depressed.
- And a liar.

134
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,800
- What?
- Look, morgan's parents died in 2002.

135
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,400
"June and bill jefferies
leave behind their only daughter morgan,

136
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
16, a student at melbrook high."

137
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
- 16. That's young.
- Yeah.

138
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,000
And she was worried about her family--

139
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,900
Her parents, sisters--
Not wanting to drain them dry.

140
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,800
Well, maybe she found another family

141
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Who adopted her
and they maybe had sisters, too.

142
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,700
Whoa, back up.

143
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,500
I'll tell you what she found--
Husband number one. Schooch.

144
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,100
Ok, a second wedding for both?

145
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,800
Hello, husband number two.

146
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
She's a kid!
She's 23.

147
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,500
You're trying to find her husband?

148
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,600
My guess is,
he'd need to find us.

149
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
'Cause he's dead.

150
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,700
They both are.

151
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,600
Both of long-Term illnesses.
What are the odds of that?

152
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
Pretty good,

153
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,800
If she sought them out.

154
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,400
The cancer support groups,
that's where she found them.

155
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,700
She's a black widow.

156
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,000
- Did you get back into his apartment?
- yeah.

157
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,300
The landlord remembered me.

158
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,700
Rick left morgan
a quarter of a million dollars.

159
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,400
She was his death beneficiary?
How did we miss that?

160
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
We didn't look for it,
And i dug through the files.

161
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,700
So what did you find out
at the clinic?

162
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,300
She attended therapy meetings,
But was never a patient.

163
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
So she isn't sick now
and never was.

164
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,900
Look, it's not like
i'm fooled by pretty girls every time.

165
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
- She seemed so scared.
- Yeah, she was.

166
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,100
She knew that he was haunting her,
And we proved it.

167
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,600
That's why she kept asking
all those questions about the ghost.

168
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
Because she didn't know
if he knew.

169
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,000
- And now--
- We don't have much time.

170
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,700
It's too late.
She got away.

171
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,700
She's gonna get away
with everything.

172
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,800
She took my lemon zester.

173
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
What did she get away with of yours?

174
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,100
- Did you see morgan before she left?
- Nope.

175
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,800
The building manager said
she had some kind of family emergency;

176
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,800
One that required a nice garnish,
apparently.

177
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,500
You know, we'll just get
a forwarding address from the manager.

178
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,200
I tried. He said she gave him
6 months cash in advance,

179
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
So he didn't
ask her for references.

180
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,200
Pretty girls.

181
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,600
They get away with everything.

182
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,600
- You can say that again.
- I say it all the time.

183
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,100
You never listen.

184
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,400
- We haven't met.
- No, we haven't.

185
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,000
- Hi. Melinda.
- How nice.

186
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Another lady friend.

187
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,500
how could i have been so dumb?

188
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Rick?

189
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
I should have seen it coming.

190
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,200
- She lied to you.
- Every day.

191
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,700
In group, and afterward
when we were together.

192
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,700
She was so young.

193
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,200
I couldn't believe she was dying.

194
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
i couldn't believe
that she cared for me.

195
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,300
But she was so convincing.

196
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,000
Did she ask you for the money?

197
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,700
She didn't have to.

198
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,700
Helping her was the most
important thing on my list, So...

199
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,300
I offered it.

200
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,900
And after that,
something changed.

201
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
She started pulling away.

202
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,500
Said she felt ill.

203
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,800
You know, the medication was
making her so sick.

204
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,400
That's why she needed
this other treatment.

205
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,800
This very expensive
other treatment.

206
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,300
She got everything
she wanted.

207
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
The only thing
she was sick of is me.

208
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,000
Look, i know that this is painful.

209
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,900
But if you could just forgive...

210
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,700
If you could just let go...

211
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
- The light, it'll bring you peace.
- No!

212
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,100
You don't understand.

213
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
I died for nothing.

214
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,800
My life meant nothing to her.

215
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,300
And now her life is nothing to me.

216
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,100
not that i blame him, But if
he looked half as angry as he sounded...

217
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,300
Yeah, we have to
get to morgan before he does.

218
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,400
you know where morgan
could have gone,

219
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,100
Maybe with friends or family?

220
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm sorry, no.

221
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
She was a very private person,

222
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Which is partly why
it just doesn't make any sense.

223
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,800
Half the time, he was the only one
who could get her to share.

224
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah, well, she was just working him.
That was part of the con.

225
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm usually a pretty
good judge of character.

226
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,400
She married two others
shortly before they died.

227
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,600
And we're not sure
how many she lied to.

228
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,800
See, that's what doesn't make sense.

229
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,400
I mean, she was just
all about conning these guys,

230
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,800
Then why would she leave us
all that money with rick's name on it?

231
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,700
What are you talking about?

232
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Well, the donation.
It came into the clinic just last week.

233
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,100
How much did she donate,
exactly?

234
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,600
Quarter of a million dollars.

235
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,700
And it could not have
come at a better time, either.

236
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
She gave away every penny.

237
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,300
I don't get it,
was she a con artist

238
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,500
Or some kind of
ambulance chasing robin hood?

239
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,700
Yeah, or someone who had
a change of heart,???.

240
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,900
Remember, rick kept saying
that she would withdraw every time he left,

241
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,000
So maybe her conscience
was getting to her.

242
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,900
Hey, you know what else
wants to get to her right now?

243
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Our ghost.

244
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,800
And he's M.A.D.,
mad.

245
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,000
So if you were her,
where would you go?

246
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,600
I don't know.
Next small town with a cancer ward.

247
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,000
No, her conscience is getting to her.

248
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
She'd be stupid to stick around.

249
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,900
Or maybe not.

250
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,500
You know,I mean, she can run from us,
but she can't from rick.

251
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,700
She knows that his spirit
is still here. Maybe...

252
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,500
maybe she's trying to make it up to him.

253
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,600
- The list.
- Yeah, it's a long shot,

254
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,100
But what hadn't he
marked off?

255
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Well, the denver omelet
did catch my eye,

256
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,700
Only because i tried, and it's very hard
To get the ham and the bell pepper ratio.

257
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,100
A place she could go--
In grandview.

258
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,500
The lunar eclipse.

259
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,700
It's happening right now.
That was on the list, right?

260
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,900
Look, everyone is trying to
find a place to watch.

261
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
- Come on!
- The roof!

262
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,600
They used to go up there, together.

263
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,600
There was a time i would have thought
you were crying for me.

264
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,100
I believed every lie you told me.

265
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,500
How could i be so stupid?

266
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
Help!
Please! Help!

267
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,400
Help me, please ???!

268
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,900
???

269
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,100
Where is she?

270
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
She's finding out
what it felt like.

271
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
???

272
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Help me!

273
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
Help me, please!
Someone!

274
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,100
Please, please!

275
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,700
hello, hello?

276
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Is somebody there? Help!

277
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,800
- Morgan?!
- Oh! Please help me!
- We got you, morgan.

278
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
We got you, ok,
we got you!

279
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,600
- Hang on!
- Please don't drop me!

280
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
We won't drop you,

281
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,900
- you're ok...
- We got you. We won't drop you.
- Please don't drop me!

282
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,900
it's ok.

283
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You're going to be ok.
It's ok.

284
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,900
That was rick, wasn't it?

285
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,200
He's trying to kill me!

286
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,000
It's ok, we're here now.
He can't hurt you.

287
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,100
I didn't try to kill her.
I tried to teach her.

288
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,900
He's angry.

289
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,400
All right? He wants to punish you.
Do you understand why?

290
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Yeah.

291
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,800
But what can i do?
I mean, it's done.

292
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,700
I lied to him.

293
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,900
But why?

294
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,900
Was the money
that important to her?

295
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,100
Look, he's here.

296
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,100
Morgan, this is your chance
to explain things.

297
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,300
I don't know why
i do the things i do.

298
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,500
Ok.

299
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,000
But do you understand
Why this time is different?

300
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,600
But he was different.

301
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,200
I mean, he cared about me.
He really cared about me.

302
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,500
You know?

303
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,700
And he didn't want
anything from me, and...

304
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,500
I had never had that before.

305
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,100
Is that true?

306
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,700
I think you had that before.

307
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,400
But they left you,

308
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
When you were really young.

309
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,900
This all started
after your parents died, right?

310
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,500
There were foster homes

311
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,600
and schools i couldn't finish, And...

312
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I just learned to fight for things.

313
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,900
And then, i guess,
just to take them.

314
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,100
Things i had no right to.

315
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,800
People's feelings.

316
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
And i know that it doesn't
make it right.

317
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's no excuse,
but giving the money back,

318
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,700
It was the only thing
i knew to do.

319
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,700
I--I don't understand.

320
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,100
- You gave that money away?
- all of it.

321
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,100
To a cancer clinic in your name.

322
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,500
well.

323
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,500
It's better than keeping it.

324
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,500
- I still died for a lie.
- What?

325
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,200
- What is he saying?
- I'm not sure.

326
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Yes, she lied.
Ok, but she didn't make you sick.

327
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,000
- You died because--
- Look, it doesn't matter.

328
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,500
No, it does matter.

329
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,600
It's the reason that
you packed your chute wrong that day.

330
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
That's how you knew
you were going to die so soon.

331
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
It wasn't an accident, was it.

332
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
What?

333
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Look...

334
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,900
The doctor told me
i didn't have much time.

335
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,200
Weeks, really.

336
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,100
And they would be painful.

337
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,900
She was too young for me.

338
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,900
And really,
what chance did we have?

339
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,200
but i loved her.

340
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
You did it for her.

341
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,300
That's the last part
of the secret, isn't it?

342
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
The money.

343
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,300
You knew that if the insurance company
knew you planned your death,

344
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,900
they wouldn't pay out.

345
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
Not in time to help her.

346
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,900
Not soon enough to help her.

347
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Exactly.

348
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,400
He died like that for me?

349
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,600
She was worth it.

350
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,600
She is worth it.

351
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,200
Can you tell her that?

352
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah.

353
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I will.

354
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,400
Guys, i don't want to ruin
a beautiful moment, but look.

355
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,300
We talked about this.

356
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,300
The night we watched
the sunset up here.

357
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,400
You said that...

358
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,200
You wanted to ride the wind
all the way home.

359
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,200
You remembered.

360
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
Tell her i'm ready.

361
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
He's ready.

362
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,000
To go now.

363
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Ok.

364
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
He's gone.

365
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,100
He went into the light.

366
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,200
That light?

367
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,900
There you are.
All the lights were off.

368
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,200
I didn't know
if you were home.

369
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah, you know,
i was, uh, thinking.

370
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,600
Oh, really? About what?

371
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,500
- Oh, it's been a weird day.
- Ok, so tell me everything.

372
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Well, it was like having my whole life
Pass before my eyes.

373
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,900
I mean, old friends on the street, my job,

374
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,900
Everything.

375
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,100
Then i realized
it's not mine anymore.

376
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,400
- I mean, that life is over.
- Hey.

377
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,900
Don't say that.

378
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Ok? We'll get it back.
It might take us some time--

379
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,500
No, it's all right.
You know, because...

380
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,600
What if i want something different?

381
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,900
Different? How?

382
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,800
Did i ever tell you why
i became a paramedic?

383
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,600
Yeah, 'cause you wanted
to help people.

384
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,100
Right. But what i really wanted
Was to become a doctor,

385
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
And i just didn't have the patience.

386
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,600
So i took a shortcut.

387
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,500
And as much
as i love the work,

388
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,700
I wish that i'd taken the time.

389
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,100
Well, now all you have is time.

390
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,600
I got more than that.

391
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,100
First of all, remember all
the annoying prerequisites

392
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,300
For med school i was trying to
find space for last year?

393
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
- Yes.
- Yeah?

394
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Well, it turns out
that i've already studied them.

395
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,600
What are you talking about?

396
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,500
When sam was getting his
architecture degree,

397
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,900
He took all these math
and science classes.

398
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,700
These are his college transcripts.

399
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,900
Yeah, which i had faxed
over earlier today,

400
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,600
And, i mean, of course i have to study them
so i understand them myself,

401
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,500
But this could save a year.

402
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,300
Med school?

403
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
You're gonna go to med school?

404
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,100
Well, if i can get in and if
we can figure out a way to pay for it.

405
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,900
Hey, we'll manage.

406
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

407
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Do you know the 2 things
i've dreamt of most of in my life?

408
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,500
Being a doctor,

409
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
And you.

410
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,600
What if i just work hard enough,

411
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,900
- And if i'm patient...
- Hey.

412
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,400
You don't have to work hard for me,
And you don't have to be patient.

413
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,600
Ah, nobody should be as lucky as me.

414
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,900
Twice in one lifetime.

415
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,000
Actually...

416
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,800
It's more like 2 lifetimes.

417
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,400
