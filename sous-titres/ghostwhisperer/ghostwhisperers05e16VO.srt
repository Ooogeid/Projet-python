00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:02,133
Previously on Ghost Whisperer

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,400
Ghosts don't get hurt.

3
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,934
My mom says they can't feel pain.

4
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:07,233
She's wrong. We do.

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,099
I can still see everything,

6
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,633
All the bad stuff!

7
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,466
The shadows are breaking up!

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,767
Whatever they are,
wherever they live,

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,266
These shadows are very
interested in ghost children.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,099
The shadows, they
actually want something?

11
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,633
Whatever it is,
they're scary enough

12
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,833
That the book decided to rewrite
itself to erase any mention of them.

13
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,767
Now I'm going to ask you
one last time nicely.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,066
Ned, you're going to
bring me the book now.

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,333
If this thing goes off,

16
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:40,500
I would hate to see it take away
someone who is very precious to you.

17
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:44,066
It doesn't have to end this way.

18
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,500
Yes, it does.

19
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:47,000
It's gone, they're gone!

20
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:49,366
The pages are all gone!

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,700
No!

22
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,199
Eli, hurry!

23
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,133
While they're
rebuilding your office,

24
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,533
Everything you need
is right here...

25
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,667
Copier, wireless, phone,
coffee, and best friend.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,667
I have all that stuff at home,

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
You know, minus the
best friend part.

28
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,366
I know, but you hate
working from home, ok?

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,567
And...and no helping any
customers or answering the phone.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,533
I mean it.

31
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,733
Uh, do you want me to unpack these?

32
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:25,967
No. No! My office is gonna
be back to normal soon. Ok?

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,166
Excuse me. All set here.

34
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:32,934
You know what? It's gonna
be just like old times.

35
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,600
Ok, let me get a copy
of the contract for you.

36
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,900
Y-you can just email it to me.

37
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,199
Here are the keys.

38
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,199
I had the power turned
back on for you.

39
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,667
We haven't set foot in the
place in over 5 years,

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,900
So I have no idea what
shape things are in.

41
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:48,767
Um, would you like to
see the appraisals?

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,466
I trust you.

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
All the antiques
came with the house,

44
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,199
So whatever you think.

45
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:56,300
You can have it all
cleared out by next week?

46
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,767
Next week? Um...

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
My husband is already in london,

48
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:03,233
So the sooner I can sell both our
houses and join him, the better.

49
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,034
Ok. Well, if you need a real
estate agent, I can recommend...

50
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,800
It's all taken care of. Thanks.

51
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:12,066
Um, we never finished
the restoration.

52
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,366
It turned out to be too big a job.

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
So be careful.

54
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,066
Thanks for the heads-up.

55
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,266
Catch you later, mom.
See you, Melinda. Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,967
Nope. Not so fast.
That was Donna peyton.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,034
She's brought an entire house
of antiques on consignment.

58
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,000
You wanna pick up some extra cash?

59
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,099
There's no such
thing as extra cash.

60
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,967
Great. Get started packing,
take some pictures.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,733
Oh, and be careful.

62
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,233
Hello! Anyone there?

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,667
Hello?

64
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,466
Hello?

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,466
Ok...

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,199
Is somebody there?

67
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,333
I have a friend who can help you.

68
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,767
I'm leaving.

69
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,233
Hello.

70
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,700
Hello?

71
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,233
Hello.

72
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,867
Ok, I get it.

73
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,266
Chains rattling? Seriously?

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
And then some.

75
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,266
I'm sorry you got hurt.

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,366
I'm fine, but there's a really
pissed off ghost in that house.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,867
If you could confirm
that appointment for me,

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,833
Wednesday at 2 P.M.
, that'd be great.

79
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,166
Ok. Thanks. Bye.

80
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,099
Oh, my god. What now?

81
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,199
Haunted house.

82
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,600
Nothing's broken.

83
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,600
Delia...

84
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,934
This is all I managed to
grab before the show started.

85
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,333
So there's a lot more?

86
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:39,099
It's like they just left everything

87
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:41,867
Exactly where it was and took off.

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,034
Or were scared off.

89
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,500
Don't come back,

90
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,633
Or you'll be dead, too.

91
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,767
You said there's a problem?

92
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:40,066
One of my employees was injured
yesterday in the house.

93
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,100
He's ok, but some strange
things were happening,

94
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,801
And I just wanted to know
why you and your husband

95
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,300
Left so abruptly.

96
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh, it was a money pit...

97
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,834
Dry rot, dangerously
outdated electrical.

98
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:56,966
So it had nothing to do with
the death of your daughter?

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,966
How did you know about that?

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,933
I do research on all of my clients,

101
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,333
And I found Cassidy's obituary.

102
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:09,333
She was a beautiful little girl.

103
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,667
Yes, she was,

104
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,801
In so many ways.

105
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,634
She was only 8 when she died.

106
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,901
Louis-barr syndrome.

107
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,600
My husband's a doctor.

108
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,267
He told me about it.

109
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,667
Must have been awful.

110
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,966
We had moved back to Grandview, uh,

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,734
So she could get treatment
at Rockland memorial.

112
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,767
We thought this house would be

113
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:32,333
A new beginning for us.

114
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,767
So you lived here before?

115
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,300
As a child, yeah.
It's such a lovely town.

116
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,000
Then when I saw that
the house was for sale,

117
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,400
It all felt like destiny.

118
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,333
Destiny?

119
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:42,634
Heh. It's silly, I guess,

120
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,801
But when I was a kid,
I used to walk home from school,

121
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:48,567
Back when you could do that
without becoming an amber alert.

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,400
Anyway, there was this really
sweet old lady who lived there.

123
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,500
She always had children
playing in the yard.

124
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,500
It looked so peaceful,

125
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,333
Almost like a storybook cottage.

126
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,066
Did anything strange happen
when you were living there?

127
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,200
Uh...

128
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,534
Well, sometimes cass
would wake up screaming

129
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,534
In the middle of the night,

130
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,901
Said there were people in her room,

131
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,300
Scary people.

132
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,367
And things were

133
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,467
Constantly getting broken.

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,534
I mean, paul and I both
thought it was just

135
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,133
Cassidy's muscle spasms,
but she always blamed it

136
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,434
On the other people in the house.

137
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,801
I mean, we didn't
believe her until...

138
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,100
Strange things started happening
to you and your husband.

139
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,801
Yeah. Violent things...

140
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,734
Uh, furniture falling over,

141
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,801
Dishes flying off the shelves,

142
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,066
Doors slamming...
usually around midnight,

143
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,600
The same time Cassidy
would wake up.

144
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,066
2 weeks after she died,

145
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,066
Something pushed my
husband down the stairs,

146
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,966
And we haven't been back since.

147
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,200
Wait. Her ghost was
inside the mirror?

148
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,801
Yeah. Not for long. It's like
she didn't wanna show herself,

149
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,600
So she hid in the mirror.

150
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:00,634
Wow. Here, mommy.

151
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,133
Let me help. You and
daddy work too much.

152
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,000
That's sweet. Good man.

153
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:06,901
Wait a minute.

154
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,434
So why would she haunt
her own parents,

155
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,966
Especially so violently?

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,434
I'm not even sure if it was her.

157
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,700
I mean, she told her mother about

158
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:14,901
People in the house, scary people.

159
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:18,167
Apparently she would wake
up at midnight screaming.

160
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,933
You know, maybe the ghosts
were stuck in some kind of loop

161
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,801
Living the same experience
over and over again.

162
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,200
There was noises, furniture moving,

163
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,233
Things breaking. Aah!

164
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:27,933
Oh. I'm sorry.

165
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,767
Hey, you ok? Aiden, you all right?

166
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,467
No, baby. It's ok.
It was an accident.

167
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
No, it wasn't. My arms,

168
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:34,901
They jerked.

169
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,801
They moved on their own.

170
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,867
That's just called a spasm, ok?

171
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,300
Look, um, why don't I read to you
while you take your bath, huh?

172
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,367
How's that sound, buddy?

173
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,133
Ok.

174
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,066
What happened?

175
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,333
Oh, I...I think Aiden

176
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,634
Is empathing Cassidy's illness.

177
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:00,167
It'll be fine once I
get her into the light.

178
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,634
Um, I failed you.

179
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,667
There's nothing on
the peyton house.

180
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,767
All the original plans
and deeds and titles

181
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:12,734
And tax information was lost
in a fire at the city archives.

182
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,867
Oh. The fire from 6 years ago?

183
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:17,834
Actually, the first fire, 1945.

184
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,467
Place has a knack for going
up in smoke, I guess.

185
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,000
So there's no information
about the previous owner?

186
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,033
The only thing I
could find was a lien

187
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,467
That was placed on the
house by the irs in 1952

188
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,033
With "unknown" written where
the owner's name should be

189
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,634
And "deceased" stamped
on one of the pages.

190
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,333
Anyway, the court put it up
for auction about 6 years ago.

191
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,033
Donna and her husband were
the only ones who made a bid.

192
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:45,400
They lived there for about 18 months,
and then they left.

193
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,767
And that's all I could find, so...

194
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:48,933
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,333
Hey, you know, um,
you wanna have a glass of wine?

196
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,534
I mean, we haven't had a
chance to talk about...

197
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,634
The explosion that
almost killed me?

198
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,901
Or you?

199
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,066
Or Ned?

200
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,734
Or the fact that Ned
has already been

201
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,100
In the emergency
room twice this year

202
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,834
Because of your ghosts?

203
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,567
Delia... what?!

204
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,100
I am sorry, Melinda,
but this is getting too dangerous.

205
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:17,667
To what, be my friend?

206
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,534
Let me ask you something.

207
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:25,066
What happened to Ned
yesterday in that house,

208
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,000
It sounds like Cassidy was
trying to scare him away, right?

209
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,834
If it was even Cassidy. I'm not...

210
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,400
Well, whoever it was, she said,

211
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:35,467
"stay away,
or you will be dead, too."

212
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,434
Ghosts are unreliable.

213
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,033
You should know that by now.

214
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:38,966
Really?

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,534
Why don't you tell
that to the ghost

216
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:46,100
That warned you that president
Bedford was gonna die in my office?

217
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,167
Maybe you should start paying
attention to them for a change.

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
Look, there is a scared little girl

219
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,500
Who's locked in a house with angry,
dangerous ghosts.

220
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:57,901
Yes, and this is all the more
reason for you not to get involved!

221
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,133
Or for you to involve my son.

222
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,133
Let this one go, Melinda.

223
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,567
Please, let it go.

224
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,933
I am begging you.

225
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:13,933
You know I can't do that.

226
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,734
Cassidy?

227
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,966
If you're here, it's ok.
I can help you.

228
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,734
Please...

229
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,200
Just talk to me.

230
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,033
You have to hurry.

231
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,534
Cassidy?

232
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,634
You don't have to hide from me.

233
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,700
Whatever's keeping you here, I...

234
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,966
I can help you go into the light.

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,534
It's safe there.

236
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,734
Oh, no. I'm not allowed.

237
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,434
Of course you are.

238
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,700
Did someone tell you that?

239
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,267
We're alone now.

240
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,834
Follow me.

241
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,933
Cassidy?

242
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,000
This hatbox...

243
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,667
Is this what you wanted to show me?

244
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,801
It's in there, but hurry.

245
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,434
Right there, in that wall.

246
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,867
Uh...

247
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,300
Aah!

248
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,167
All right, enough!

249
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,901
Whoever you are,
just let Cassidy go.

250
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,066
Get out.

251
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,033
Hurry.

252
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,600
Cassidy, who are you afraid of?

253
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:40,966
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,300
Cassidy...

255
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,267
Cassidy, wait!

256
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,281
The ghosts don't want Cassidy
to go into the light.

257
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,200
They told her she's not allowed to.

258
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,000
Did you say, "ghosts," plural?

259
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,122
Yeah. I think they're the scary
people her mom had been talking about.

260
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:24,379
I felt their presence,
and it was angry.

261
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,265
Enough to try to kill
you with a wheelchair?

262
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,235
Apparently. Whoever they are,
they're hiding,

263
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:31,027
And if we don't find out some history
about that house, we're stuck.

264
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,573
This box is impossible.

265
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:34,684
Yeah. I couldn't find anything
like it on the internet.

266
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:37,612
Maybe the ghost...
s don't want you to open it.

267
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,367
Cassidy does.
She's asking for our help.

268
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,266
Why doesn't she just tell you

269
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:43,133
Why the other ghosts
won't let her leave?

270
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,299
Mm, because for some reason,
she's terrified of them.

271
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,233
That makes two of us.

272
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,633
This emblem looks familiar.

273
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,400
Let me see.

274
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,299
It's a raven, as in nevermore.

275
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,966
Which is good advice for
visiting that house.

276
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,199
It was a raven that flew at me.

277
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,899
Do you think that means something?

278
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:02,932
Sure. Any guesses?

279
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,533
What's all that?

280
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,400
Old receipts, all with
the same handwriting,

281
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,032
All marked "services rendered,"

282
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,867
All dating back before
1943 with no names.

283
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,666
Services rendered?
What kind of services?

284
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,633
Eh, we'll add that to
the list of questions.

285
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,633
Photo negatives.

286
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,233
Yeah. I couldn't see
what was on them.

287
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,266
I have a scanner that
handles photo negatives.

288
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,433
I'm on it.

289
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,999
And what about the
toys in the attic?

290
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:30,066
And Cassidy's mom
said she remembered

291
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,932
Seeing children playing
in the yard, right?

292
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,666
What, you think the ghosts
in the house are all kids?

293
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,966
Why would they be so violent?

294
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,700
I mean, first going
after you, then me.

295
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,133
Hey.

296
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,899
I'm gonna work from home after all.

297
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,833
Hey, Ned, can I
talk to you, please?

298
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,299
Yeah. Sure.

299
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,099
I really don't want you involved

300
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,733
With this anymore. It's dangerous.

301
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,999
Mom, I know you're still freaked
out about the explosion,

302
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:03,867
But I promise I can
take care of myself.

303
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,333
No. I'm serious.

304
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:08,633
I can't just bail on Melinda.

305
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,233
How do you know?
You never even tried.

306
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,833
Just say no this once.

307
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,166
Say no.

308
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:17,333
Just let me get one
good night's sleep, ok?

309
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,566
Yeah, that... that's her.

310
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,966
That's the old lady who used
to smile and wave at me.

311
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,767
I remember feeling sorry for
her because of the wheelchair.

312
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,533
There's something else
I have to tell you.

313
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:40,700
My friends were able to
date the film stock, and...

314
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,833
These photos were taken
in the early 1940s.

315
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,600
That's when my father was born,
so that can't be the same woman I saw.

316
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,966
Actually, it could.

317
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,133
I think you were seeing her ghost.

318
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,133
Um, since I was a little girl,

319
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:06,500
I've...I've been able to
talk with a-and see ghosts.

320
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,833
And you still see them?

321
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,466
Most kids lose their gift

322
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Around the same time they
stop believing in magic.

323
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,500
I didn't.

324
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:24,800
So Cassidy was seeing ghosts.

325
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,966
Apparently you were, too.

326
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,867
As a kid, I mean.

327
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:31,333
The house hasn't been
occupied since 1952,

328
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:34,466
So I think the children
you saw were ghosts

329
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,299
And they're still there.

330
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:42,600
All those nights,
she was so terrified,

331
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:46,966
And we didn't believe her,
just told her to go back to bed.

332
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,299
Oh, she must have felt so alone.

333
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,533
You couldn't have known.

334
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,566
And I'm afraid that there's more.

335
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,867
I've talked to Cassidy,

336
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:57,066
And she's still there.

337
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,833
What? She...she is?

338
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,466
Did she die there?

339
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,299
No. No, the hospital.

340
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,800
Ok. Well, then something
brought her back,

341
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,099
And it must be that woman.

342
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:09,600
Wait. Are you telling me my...
my little girl

343
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,932
Is trapped there by that old lady,

344
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,600
But why? Who...who was she?

345
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,600
We don't know.

346
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:17,266
All we have is the
last name hanson.

347
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,733
You can see it

348
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:22,233
Right there on the mail slot.

349
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:25,099
I...I don't... I don't understand.

350
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,767
Spirits are supposed
to go into the light,

351
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,999
But for some reason, in this house,

352
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:32,733
They don't want your
daughter to cross over.

353
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:36,099
Are they, um...
are they hurting her?

354
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,566
Is that even possible?

355
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
There's still a lot to figure out.

356
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:43,500
But whatever it is,
I will bring her peace.

357
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,932
I promise.

358
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:51,400
Mm. Mm! That's defense.

359
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,533
Huh? Right? Hmm.

360
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:54,566
Heh.

361
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Hello.

362
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,833
Hey. How'd it go with Donna?

363
00:20:58,867 --> 00:20:59,800
She believe you?

364
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,466
I had pretty convincing evidence.

365
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,466
Hey, what you got there, baby?

366
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,133
You left it on the table.

367
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,199
Am I in trouble?

368
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,099
No. Of course not. It looks like

369
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,700
You made more
progress than anybody.

370
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:10,767
It's pretty cool.

371
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,166
And remember,
don't call me baby anymore.

372
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,533
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

373
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,833
So Delia moved her stuff
out of the store today,

374
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,800
Said she'd rather work from home.

375
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,099
Ah. Think she's still
pretty rattled, huh?

376
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,233
Yeah. I can't say that I blame her.

377
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,899
Wha...

378
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,666
You ok, man? What's going on?

379
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,433
My arms again.

380
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,027
You know what?

381
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,473
I-it's just Cassidy, ok?

382
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,461
It's gonna be over soon, I promise.

383
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:43,698
Um, do you want some cocoa?

384
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,083
Yeah, pal. Why don't I make it?

385
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,759
Ok.

386
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,833
Come on.

387
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:08,966
Mel. Hey, what's going on?
What's wrong?

388
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:10,966
I just saw people being murdered.

389
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,967
The other ghosts in
the house, right?

390
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,368
I think those were
locks of their hair.

391
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,156
Why would that lady keep
them hidden in her house?

392
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:24,101
Because she doesn't
want anybody to know.

393
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:27,034
Look, didn't Cassidy warn you

394
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:30,268
That if you didn't stay away from there,
you'd be dead, too?

395
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:32,634
Yeah, but she's the one
who just showed me those.

396
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,167
It's like she's warning me again.

397
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:35,400
About the old woman?

398
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:38,667
Maybe those are souvenirs
from other ghosts.

399
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,869
Maybe she murderred them all.

400
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,367
Cassidy.

401
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,167
Cassidy, I know about
the other ghosts.

402
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,366
If they're keeping you here,
I can help you.

403
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,974
What is this?

404
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,600
Did you bring the tribute?

405
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,033
Thank you.

406
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,100
And the embodiment?

407
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,600
Excellent.

408
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:21,400
I already sense her.

409
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,300
Now place your hands flat

410
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,634
On the table in front of you.

411
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,734
Mine will stay constrained

412
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:29,700
Throughout the session

413
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:32,467
To prove there's no trickery.

414
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,467
Let us begin.

415
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:39,367
Denizens of the spirit world...

416
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,133
Your loved ones call you tonight

417
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,834
Not to disturb you from
your troubled sleep,

418
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:48,967
But to help you find peace.

419
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:52,700
Tonight we call Naomi,

420
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:54,634
Beloved daughter

421
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,100
Of Virgil and Esther.

422
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,367
A seance.

423
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,133
Are you kidding me?

424
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,333
Naomi, will you come to us?

425
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,667
Are you Naomi?

426
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,133
They killed me.

427
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:16,066
Naomi, will you give us a
sign that you're with us?

428
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,967
They killed me!

429
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:22,901
No. No, you're upsetting her.

430
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:27,767
Naomi is with us now.

431
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,500
She wants you to know
her death came quickly.

432
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:34,066
Stop! You're lying! She's gone!

433
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:39,634
She says she loves you.

434
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:43,200
She's going into the light now.

435
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,834
Stop it!

436
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:00,100
She lied to us

437
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,700
And our families.

438
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,867
There was never any light.

439
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,433
Dream?

440
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:19,734
That old woman was pretending to
be a medium when she was alive.

441
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:24,300
I was a ghost at one of her seances,
if you can believe that.

442
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,800
Ok, her name is Greta hanson,
also known as madame Greta.

443
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,333
She set up shop in
Grandview in 1924

444
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:31,734
During the whole
spiritualism revival.

445
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,901
She died in 1943 when her
wheelchair rolled down the stairs.

446
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,500
More likely a ghost pushed her.

447
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,767
Where'd you get this?

448
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,967
I spent hours searching
"hanson" plus "spiritualism"

449
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,133
And "medium" and "seance"

450
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,400
And found exactly nothing.

451
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:45,367
Professor grant gave
me the t.A. Job.

452
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,300
I now have full access to the
copeland wing at the library.

453
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,267
I hate you.

454
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,734
Madame Greta operated
under the radar,

455
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,033
Held her sessions in a secret room,

456
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,100
Worked strictly by private referral,
and made a killing,

457
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,100
So to speak.

458
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,100
Yeah, off the suffering

459
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,600
Of grieving people and
frustrated ghosts.

460
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,567
She must have been
pretty convincing.

461
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,267
Harry houdini even attended
one of her seances,

462
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,233
But never publicly debunked her.

463
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,834
Yeah, probably because,
according to Melinda,

464
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,333
She was able to attract ghosts,

465
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,600
But she just couldn't actually
communicate with them.

466
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:14,500
So the murder visions
that Melinda had,

467
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:17,734
Could the old woman have been
a medium and a serial killer?

468
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,467
You know, so she'd always
have fresh ghosts to contact?

469
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,867
Maybe not. Melinda said a man at
the seance brought a lock of hair.

470
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,333
As an embodiment.
Mediums sometimes asked

471
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,500
For something personal
from the deceased.

472
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:33,433
And the ghost in Melinda's dream said,
"they killed me."

473
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,233
Yeah. Mel said she looked
like she'd been strangled.

474
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:39,433
So maybe madame Greta specialized
in contacting murder victims.

475
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:42,233
Ok, so the ghosts
aren't kids after all,

476
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,867
But what happened to the
children that Cassidy's mom saw?

477
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,133
And why is Cassidy stuck

478
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,233
In a house with a bunch
of murdered people?

479
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:49,667
Ahh. You're giving me a headache.

480
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,634
Sounds like a good time to
go and chat with some ghosts.

481
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,066
A field trip to the
house of whacked spirits

482
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
At the witching hour?
Thank you, no.

483
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,267
Besides, your mom said
ghosts are off limits.

484
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,901
I know, but since I can't
talk to them anyhow

485
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:05,667
A-and I know you're not gonna
let Melinda go alone...

486
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Ok. I'll call her.

487
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:11,467
Jim finally got Aiden to sleep,

488
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,700
So we should get going.
Do we even have a plan?

489
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,133
Yeah. Our first priority is
to get her out of that house

490
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,934
And convince her to cross
over into the light.

491
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,901
But we don't even know
what we're up against.

492
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,233
We have madame Greta,
murder victims.

493
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,934
Who knows how many?

494
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,967
And if they're all just trying
to keep Cassidy there...

495
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:28,600
Trust me. When she sees her mommy,
she's gonna come to us.

496
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:30,400
Let's go.

497
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,200
I told you to stay away.

498
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,166
Cassidy?

499
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,734
Cassidy, you're here.

500
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,500
Look. Let me call your mommy.

501
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,834
I have to go.

502
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,100
I'll get in trouble
for talking to you.

503
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,934
From who? Who are you afraid of?

504
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,233
Them.

505
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:56,634
She's looking for her.

506
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,100
She's angry.

507
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,233
Who, madame Greta?

508
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:01,033
Who are you?

509
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,333
What is it, chains?

510
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,700
What's going on?

511
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,066
You were both in prison.

512
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,066
She's coming.

513
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,333
Cassidy, hurry.

514
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,534
No, no! Wait!

515
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:15,400
They're gone.

516
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,033
You said they were prisoners?

517
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:20,100
Yeah. And they both had
burns and lacerations,

518
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,133
Like they'd been executed.

519
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,300
You know, the visions
I had of...of murders,

520
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,500
Maybe it wasn't from the victim.

521
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:28,734
What if I was seeing it all
through the killer's eyes?

522
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:29,496
Wait a minute.

523
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:33,143
Are you saying all the other
ghosts in the house are murderers?

524
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,792
The ghosts of murderers?

525
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,731
And they're keeping Cassidy
trapped in that house?

526
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,385
I don't know if they are murderers.

527
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:48,694
I mean, we ided them by the
numbers on their uniform.

528
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,135
They were convicted in the twenties,
executed in the thirties,

529
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:52,831
And since then,
they'd been proven innocent.

530
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,675
You saw people being killed,
didn't you?

531
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:58,444
I know. Which means that they're
not the only ghosts in that house.

532
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,763
I mean, Ned told me that
madame Greta's brother

533
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:03,778
Was hanged for murder.
She went into spiritualism

534
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,579
To try to prove that
he was innocent,

535
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,834
And it became her
specialty as a medium.

536
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,951
She didn't even have the gift.

537
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,408
All she did was attract hundreds
of ghosts to that house,

538
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:15,667
Murderers and people who
were wrongfully executed.

539
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,967
Wait. So the innocent
ones are still there.

540
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:19,333
Where are the guilty ones?

541
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,467
Hiding from me, or maybe
they went into the light.

542
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,200
And the innocent ones didn't.
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

543
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:25,433
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense,

544
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,900
But there's gotta be
some kind of good reason.

545
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,266
Yeah. Oh, wait.

546
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,056
You know, executions are
usually scheduled at midnight.

547
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:33,071
That might have something to do
with the timing of your hauntings.

548
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,867
Yeah, but not why they won't
let Cassidy cross over.

549
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:38,967
I'll be right back.

550
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:41,067
All right. Hey.

551
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:45,967
You can't help her.

552
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,200
I don't believe that.

553
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,001
The two of you who appeared to me,

554
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,300
You were innocent, weren't you?

555
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,834
Why didn't you go into the light?

556
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:58,367
We won't leave Cassidy.

557
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,767
We can't.

558
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,734
You're protecting her?

559
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,200
And you.

560
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,600
From what? The ghosts?

561
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:08,200
The ones who were guilty?

562
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:12,900
Yes, but they aren't
ghosts anymore.

563
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,767
Wh-what are you...

564
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,900
There, my sweet.

565
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:45,533
Soon you can come play with all the
lovely toys at my house forever.

566
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:50,101
You and my friend Cassidy
here will have such fun.

567
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,367
You'll see.

568
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:00,900
Are you home?

569
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,500
No. I'm in Eli's office
doing a little research.

570
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,700
Is it econ, or are you
still helping out Melinda?

571
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,233
Mom, this one's huge.

572
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,800
Melinda needs all the
help she can get.

573
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,067
Ned, we talked about this.

574
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,400
I know, but this is amazing.

575
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,533
This house is full of ghosts,
and for some reason,

576
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:16,001
They won't let this poor
little girl go into the light.

577
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:18,533
Listen, it is great
that you care about her

578
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:21,045
And that you found something that
you're passionate about, but, Ned,

579
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:21,600
Listen to me.

580
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:24,567
A ghost kidnapped Aiden.
Another one killed president Bedford.

581
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,834
You have been hurt twice.
When are you gonna understand

582
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:30,001
This is too dangerous?

583
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:36,834
Apparently more dangerous
than even Melinda realizes.

584
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,200
What?

585
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,166
Mom, I gotta go.

586
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,834
I'll call you from
the car and explain.

587
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,700
No, no, no...

588
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,400
Ned. Ned, hold...

589
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,166
Hello?

590
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,001
Aiden, it's way past your...

591
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:52,034
Bedtime.

592
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,800
Aiden.

593
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:02,600
I know where your boy
is all the time. Do you?

594
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,567
Don't you dare threaten my son.

595
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,700
They stay out of my business.

596
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,634
Ned, hey. Tell us what's going on.

597
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,133
I found out what the raven means,

598
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,433
The one on the puzzle box.

599
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,700
Ok, in the "book of changes"?

600
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,233
First I asked professor
grant about it.

601
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:25,800
She said that an emblem like this

602
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:26,800
On a tombstone represents

603
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:27,967
A guardian of the soul.

604
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:29,867
What's that have to
do with the book?

605
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,001
I'll show you.

606
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,367
The book must have erased it.

607
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,433
Doesn't it only do that when
it's worried about the shadows?

608
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,467
Yeah, and if it has something
to do with the shadows,

609
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,667
That explains a few things.

610
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,400
One of the prisoners told
me that the other convicts

611
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:46,166
Are in the house,
but they're not ghosts anymore.

612
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,367
But how could they be
there and not be ghosts?

613
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,700
If they change into shadows.

614
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,500
All right, help me out.

615
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:54,034
It's what the shinies told Aiden...

616
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:55,834
Or what he saw happening
to Julia. Right.

617
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,764
Shadows, they prey on your guilt.

618
00:32:57,764 --> 00:32:59,061
They break your spirit apart,

619
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,006
And they feed on the pieces.

620
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:01,718
You know, I think I've seen
something like this before,

621
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,049
But I just didn't know what it was,

622
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,391
These dark, angry ghosts
that don't really cross over.

623
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,277
They more cross under.

624
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,238
Maybe that's the shadows.

625
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,516
Maybe that's how they multiply.

626
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:10,712
Yeah, and these are just

627
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,536
Especially interested in children.

628
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:14,388
But if shadows exploit your guilt,

629
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:16,030
Why are they so
caught up on Cassidy?

630
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,900
What does she have to
be so guilty about?

631
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:19,166
I don't know.

632
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,467
Maybe nothing.

633
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,467
Maybe that's why she's still here.

634
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,467
Jim, help me pack
up everything shiny.

635
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,567
And don't let Aiden out
of your sight, ok? Ok.

636
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,734
And can you call Eli?
I'll meet you guys at the house.

637
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,333
I'm gonna call Cassidy's
mom on the way.

638
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:32,834
Melinda, be careful.

639
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:35,067
Yeah.

640
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,333
What's going on?

641
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:40,867
Is Cassidy here?

642
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,400
I need you to talk to her,

643
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,900
Tell her that it's
safe to come outside.

644
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,233
We don't have a lot of time.

645
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:51,800
Cass-Cassidy.

646
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,934
Sweetie.

647
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,233
You could come out.

648
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,934
It's ok. Please?

649
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,266
Mommy.

650
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:05,067
Mommy, you shouldn't be here.

651
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:07,200
It's ok. All right?
We're safe for now.

652
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:09,500
Look, she's here.
I'll explain later,

653
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,233
But we have to hurry.

654
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:15,934
I...I wish I could see
her one last time.

655
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,767
Don't be sad, mommy.

656
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,600
She doesn't want you to be sad.

657
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:23,067
How could I not be?

658
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:25,166
If we had just listened to her

659
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,500
When she told us about
the scary people,

660
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,266
We would have left
this house sooner.

661
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,800
Will you...will you tell her that?

662
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:32,700
She can hear you.

663
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:39,634
Can you ever forgive us?

664
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,934
I was never mad at you.

665
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:44,300
She was never angry with you.

666
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:48,067
Look, Cassidy,
I have to ask you something.

667
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:51,867
Madame Greta, she brings children
here for a reason, doesn't she?

668
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,734
It's ok.

669
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,500
You can tell the truth.
She isn't here.

670
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:59,133
But she said if I told anyone,
I'd be punished.

671
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,867
She can't hurt you. All right?

672
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,333
And the other ghosts,
the lady and the man,

673
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,133
They were protecting you,
weren't they?

674
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,834
We protect each other

675
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:11,767
Whenever the cold things come.

676
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,333
The shadows.

677
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:17,233
Yeah. I felt that cold before.

678
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,533
So how do you protect each other?

679
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,400
We make a circle
so they'll go away,

680
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,967
But they always come back,

681
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,734
And they're getting stronger.

682
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,600
So that's why you
didn't wanna leave?

683
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:30,967
Because you were afraid that the cold
things would take your friends away?

684
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:33,101
Like they did to the others,

685
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,133
All of them.

686
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,300
The children, too?

687
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:40,487
Look, it's not safe for
you to be here, ok?

688
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,034
Do you see a light?

689
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,629
No.

690
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:46,521
What is it? Does she see the light?

691
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,307
No.

692
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:52,568
Please, just tell her that it's ok.

693
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,800
Tell her to see the light.

694
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,001
You can go with her.

695
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,101
Both of you.

696
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,333
Cassidy, you've helped
us stay safe for so long.

697
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,934
Now you have to help yourself.

698
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,233
Ok?

699
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,034
That's pretty.

700
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:16,467
My friends can come, too?

701
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,734
Really?

702
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,067
She sees the light.

703
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:21,734
Look, all of you just go.

704
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:23,166
Ok? It's where you belong,

705
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
And you're gonna be safe there,
I...I promise.

706
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,166
I love you, mommy.

707
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,600
She says she loves you.

708
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:51,034
Cassidy! No!

709
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,533
Sorry. We got here
as fast as we could.

710
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:11,533
Did Cassidy cross over?

711
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,773
No. What?

712
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:13,915
Madame Greta stopped her,

713
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:17,200
And I think she's just
getting warmed up.

714
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:26,268
Cassidy? What is it?
What's going on?

715
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:27,334
It's ok. I'll explain later.

716
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,000
Ned, put all these
things by the windows.

717
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,667
Eli, open the blinds.
They don't like light.

718
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,000
Hurry up, and whatever you do,
do not turn these things off.

719
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:36,167
Can count on that.

720
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,234
Open the ones in front, too.

721
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,466
I'm on it.

722
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,100
Cassidy, it's ok for
you to come back.

723
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:47,401
Cassidy.

724
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,167
Cassidy.

725
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:54,367
You said we could go. You promised.

726
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:57,500
Look, do you see the light?
Is it still open?

727
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,700
Yes, but I'm scared.

728
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,566
There's nothing for
you to be scared of.

729
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,500
You just go,
ok? It's gonna be fine.

730
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,533
Tell her.

731
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:05,600
Cassidy!

732
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:09,067
I-it's ok. Do what Melinda says.

733
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,533
It's too late!

734
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,301
They're here,

735
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:21,466
And they're angry with you.

736
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,000
Get out while you can.

737
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,633
No. I am not leaving until
you guys go into the light.

738
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:26,833
Oh, boy.

739
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,433
Just stay here.

740
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:38,267
We did nothing wrong.

741
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:39,967
We did nothing wrong.

742
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,100
We did nothing wrong.

743
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,934
We did nothing wrong.

744
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,967
We did nothing wrong.

745
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,934
We did nothing wrong.

746
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,833
We did nothing wrong.

747
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,633
We did nothing wrong.

748
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,800
We did nothing wrong.

749
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,134
We did nothing wrong.

750
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,563
We did nothing wrong...

751
00:38:56,563 --> 00:38:58,199
The child stays with me.

752
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,833
No. No. All you've
been doing is using her

753
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:02,967
To lure other ghosts here.
That's over.

754
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
Cassidy's too naughty
to go into the light.

755
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:07,733
She tricked all those
other little ghosts.

756
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,600
We, we! That's a lie.

757
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,667
Don't listen to her! Cassidy,
she's just saying that

758
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,934
To make you feel bad for
something you didn't do.

759
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,334
She couldn't stand being alone,

760
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:18,500
So she lied to those other
ghosts so she could have friends.

761
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,234
That's why the light's not for her.

762
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,633
She doesn't deserve it.

763
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:22,600
I don't?

764
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,200
No, Cassidy, don't listen to her.

765
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,167
Listen to your friends.

766
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,002
You did nothing wrong.

767
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:28,002
You did nothing wrong.

768
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,035
You did nothing wrong.

769
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,435
You did nothing wrong.

770
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:32,468
You did nothing wrong.

771
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,035
We need more shiny stuff.

772
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:36,890
There's silver everywhere.

773
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,484
Grab it and spread it around.

774
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,082
Look!

775
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,435
The shadows, they blocked us in!

776
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:52,635
Move it! Hurry!

777
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,802
It won't budge!

778
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:55,869
You did nothing wrong.

779
00:39:55,902 --> 00:39:58,102
Cassidy, you didn't do anything wrong.
Don't you understand?

780
00:39:58,136 --> 00:40:01,169
That's why the shadows haven't taken you,
because you're innocent.

781
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,802
Stop interfering.
Get out of my house!

782
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,635
Now!

783
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,769
The shadows are killing the lights,
even the headlights!

784
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:14,102
You know what? The only
one guilty here is you.

785
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:16,702
Ok, you took advantage of
people when you were alive,

786
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:17,735
But you were lying,

787
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:19,169
And all you were doing

788
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:21,268
Was bringing tortured
souls back to the shadows.

789
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:22,435
That's enough.

790
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:24,102
Now you're feeding them children

791
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:26,169
Because it's either them or you.

792
00:40:26,202 --> 00:40:27,735
Be quiet!

793
00:40:31,735 --> 00:40:33,301
What?

794
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:36,202
What is that?

795
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,002
The headlights,
they're coming back on.

796
00:40:45,102 --> 00:40:46,602
Cassidy, go!

797
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:49,335
Go right now!

798
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:52,635
Tell mommy and daddy I love them!

799
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:54,568
I promise! Go! Run, Cassidy!

800
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:59,136
Cassidy!

801
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:02,035
No!

802
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:08,035
I'll find more for you,
hundreds of them!

803
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:11,735
All the children you need! Just,
please, I beg you!

804
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,301
Oh, no!

805
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:15,368
Oh, no!

806
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,169
Help me move this stuff.

807
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:33,335
Ned, Melinda! Oh, my god.

808
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,205
Are you ok?

809
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,517
Delia!

810
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:40,869
I am now.

811
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:54,969
Wait. So Greta had some kind
of deal with the shadows?

812
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,735
She fed them ghosts,
and they didn't feed on her?

813
00:41:57,769 --> 00:41:58,835
Apparently.

814
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:00,969
There's only one thing
I don't understand.

815
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:02,002
What got into you?

816
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:04,696
Showing up all Nick of time,

817
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:06,218
Like, heroic and stuff?

818
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:08,069
Please. I'm no hero.

819
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:10,396
Somebody's gotta
look after you guys.

820
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:13,434
The trouble is my
lunatic son is a hero,

821
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,715
So what am I supposed to do?

822
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:19,069
Be a hero, too.

823
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,389
Ok, maybe just this once.

824
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:25,002
But don't get used to it.

825
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,037
Real estate is my business.

826
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:27,702
This heroing...

827
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:34,006
Ned learned everything from you.

828
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:44,904
Would you promise just to be careful,
for god's sake?

829
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:47,320
Right, kid. Listen to
your mother, all right?

830
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,735
And you, too.

831
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,735
What's wrong?

832
00:42:57,448 --> 00:43:01,454
I just wish we knew what was so
important about children's ghosts.

833
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,720
What do the shadows want with them?

834
