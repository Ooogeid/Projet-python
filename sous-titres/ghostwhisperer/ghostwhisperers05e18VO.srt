1
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:07,407
Ok, only on the table, and
no decorating the store items.

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,781
Mommy sees any glitter on the wall,

3
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:11,300
- She's gonna be very bummed. 
- I know, mom.

4
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:14,193
Thank you for hanging
out while I do inventory.

5
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,693
Now remember, if anybody
comes to the door...

6
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:19,083
Don't answer it, just
scream really loud.

7
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,366
Ok, you don't have to scare them.

8
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,974
Just let me know that somebody's here.

9
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:25,353
Ok? I'm going to be downstairs
for just a few minutes.

10
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,345
Aiden. Glitter.

11
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,103
Aiden?

12
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,093
Aiden?

13
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:55,266
Is that you?

14
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,153
Aiden?

15
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:11,199
Ok.

16
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,213
Aiden!

17
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:13,726
Mom?

18
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,478
You scared me.

19
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,781
You were calling me.

20
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:21,796
Well, how long have you been down here?

21
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:24,826
Just now. Is something wrong?

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,094
No. No, nothing.

23
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,366
I just...I thought somebody was here.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,104
Someone was here.

25
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:33,206
Who was here?

26
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:34,028
Someone.

27
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,472
But I didn't scream, because
they weren't at the door.

28
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,743
Ok, where were they?

29
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:40,784
I don't know. I guess they're gone now.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,757
All right. Come on. Let's go upstairs.

31
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,812
Balloon. Is this yours?

32
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:56,089
Can we go now?

33
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,078
Yeah.

34
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:00,217
I mean, home. Can we go home?

35
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:01,678
Yes.

36
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:03,719
We can go home. Come on.

37
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,950
Not again with the covers.

38
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,190
He's always kicking them off.

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,068
So he can climb into
our bed and get warm.

40
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:14,303
You're ruining his alibi.

41
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:16,140
Hey, when are you coming home?

42
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:18,204
When my shift is over. Promise.

43
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,812
You said it was quiet.
Can't you get out early?

44
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:21,998
What's going on?

45
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, I just wish you were here.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,881
Miss you, and...

47
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,754
What else?

48
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:31,726
I just get this strange feeling

49
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,865
that somebody's... watching me.

50
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,766
You mean like a dead someone?

51
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,677
Yeah.

52
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,496
And Aiden, he's felt it, too.

53
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,146
It's just...

54
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:46,113
The house just feels
kinda creepy tonight.

55
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:49,018
That's strange. Nothing creeps you out.

56
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,150
That's not entirely true.

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,000
Mel. Mel.

58
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,946
- Clowns do. 
- Are you ok?

59
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,681
I'll call you back.

60
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,885
Who are you?

61
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:17,926
You don't remember.

62
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,330
Do you know how you got here?

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
- Aiden get to school ok? 
- Yeah.

64
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:34,035
He just felt so bad for missing the bus.

65
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,840
I told him I'm the one who overslept.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,069
More clown nightmares?

67
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,315
I wish they were nightmares.

68
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,443
- It was real. 
- A real ghost?

69
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:42,428
Yeah, I guess a real clown.

70
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,737
Well, while you were
gone, I got on the web,

71
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:46,597
And, um, as far as I can see,

72
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:47,945
There's nothing about a dead clown.

73
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,680
I mean, not in the
vicinity and not recently.

74
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:50,612
Well, how not recent?

75
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,161
I mean, maybe he died a while ago.

76
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:53,237
As far as I can tell,

77
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:56,124
There has never once been a clown
who has dropped dead in Grandview.

78
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,961
Well, this town has that going for it.

79
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,154
Hey, maybe your ghost was just
passing through, like the circus.

80
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,621
So the circus in town?

81
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,634
'cause he might be attached...

82
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,059
No circus, sorry. Hey.

83
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:06,460
Given your feeling about clowns,

84
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,629
maybe you should just let this one go.

85
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,765
Not a chance, given my
feelings about clowns.

86
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:12,161
And he came into our home.

87
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,937
With his creepy face
paint and orange hair.

88
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,387
Maybe he's just attached to something
I brought home from the store.

89
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:19,422
Well, good luck finding that,

90
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,190
'cause the house is filled
with stuff from your store.

91
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,386
Speaking of which, I just
had Aiden's tired patched.

92
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,580
Well, I'm here if you
need an extra set of hands.

93
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,071
No.

94
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,586
I did not just do that.

95
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,328
- Where did that come from? 
- Where do you think?

96
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:44,158
This is why you stayed
on earth, seriously?

97
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:46,349
I don't know why I did that.

98
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,124
I don't understand any of this.

99
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:49,674
"this," meaning your death?

100
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,942
This.

101
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,910
This isn't me.

102
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,211
You're not a clown?

103
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:57,874
You don't remember ever being a clown?

104
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:00,573
No.

105
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,241
Ok, well, do you remember anything,

106
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,059
Like your name or how you died?

107
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:09,307
Someone make you feel like a fool?

108
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:13,561
Sorry.

109
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:16,270
I'm sorry. I...I didn't mean to do that.

110
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,099
Did that ghost just make water?

111
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:21,557
Yeah.

112
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:24,067
The old flower gag.

113
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,998
So not a metaphorical clown?

114
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:29,387
But don't you say ghosts sometimes

115
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,458
appears the way they
felt when they died?

116
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,643
Oh, I wish.

117
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,794
It's your coulrophobia.

118
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,236
Your fear of clowns. A lot
of people have that phobia.

119
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:39,774
You know, it's creepy
make-up, the weird costumes.

120
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,580
It makes you think
they're hiding something.

121
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,023
Or lurking. There he is.

122
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,387
He's hanging around some woman.

123
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:51,415
Why do I always look where you
look when I know I can't see ghosts?

124
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:52,858
I fall for it, too, every time.

125
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,232
It's like the old fake flower gag.

126
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:55,963
He's just staring at her,
this woman with red hair.

127
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:57,726
Maybe she knows who he is.

128
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:58,945
Sorry. Wait one second.

129
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,899
You just need to go
forward! She's leaving!

130
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,052
Your leg is right in there, it's jammed.

131
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,434
Eli, she's going to leave! Just move!

132
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,498
Eli, why do you always
sit on the outside?

133
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,181
Because of this, exactly this.

134
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:09,041
I'm scared of being trapped.

135
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:13,804
Oh, god!

136
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:14,947
She's gone now.

137
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,600
I mean, how am I supposed
to cross over a ghost

138
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,523
who has no idea who he was?

139
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,017
Well, you do it all the time.

140
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:22,189
Except most ghosts don't
even want to remember.

141
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,084
'cause they've done something horrible.

142
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:26,214
Maybe that's why he's hiding
behind the grease paint.

143
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,231
I am never going to sleep tonight.

144
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,999
So you're sure the redhead
was someone he knew?

145
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,523
Well, he was totally fixated on her.

146
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,881
I thought at least she'd be a start.

147
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,603
He didn't seem to
remember anything else.

148
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:37,691
Why do they come to you?

149
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,156
I mean, what does he want?

150
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,259
Maybe he's lost.

151
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,447
Yeah, and somehow he found you.

152
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,374
All right, so the thing
that he's attached to,

153
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:47,846
it's something from the store, right?

154
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,841
It's gotta be. I mean, he didn't
even seem to know how he got here.

155
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,840
If I could just figure out what it was.

156
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,690
Right. Well, I got about a half an
hour of patient's notes to finish,

157
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,577
Then I can help you go
through all this stuff.

158
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,978
Oh, that would be great. I
have more boxes downstairs.

159
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,914
All right.

160
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,442
Jim, can you check the fuse?

161
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,357
Who are you?

162
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,600
What do you want?

163
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:33,204
Why...why are you staring at me?

164
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,840
Please just...

165
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,643
Please get me out of here, please!

166
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,215
What do you want from
me, stop staring at me!

167
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,746
Say something!

168
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,980
Just...

169
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,682
Get me out of here, stop looking at me.

170
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:47,850
Who are you? Please!

171
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:49,852
Please just stop staring at me!

172
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:52,654
A 15 minute counseling session occurred

173
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:54,756
when I explained the
mild drop in hemoglobin

174
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,125
was entirely consistent with
an iron deficiency anemia...

175
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,577
Did you hear me?

176
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,189
Hear what?

177
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:03,873
I was screaming.

178
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,800
Or at least I thought I was.

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,909
Maybe I was just having a vision.

180
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,328
Hey, I'm sorry. What kind of vision?

181
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,124
People were staring at me.

182
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,988
The usual ghosts?

183
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,101
Strangers.

184
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:18,949
It was like I was in a
fishbowl or something.

185
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,545
Hey, you know what, maybe
your ghost was a clown

186
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,846
who just didn't like his audience, huh?

187
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,616
What?

188
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,119
I gave this to you.

189
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,089
Yeah, to record my patient notes.

190
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,180
You gave it to me...

191
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,524
Yesterday.

192
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:37,481
Yeah, the box that I
brought in from the landlord,

193
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,977
She said that her tenant
had left things behind.

194
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:43,064
What if he left it
behind because he died?

195
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:44,580
I thought we were
talking about your vision.

196
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,069
I'm just trying to figure out any reason

197
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,671
why this ghost would be in our home,

198
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,644
And this is the only
new thing from the store.

199
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,615
Why would a ghost use a tape recorder?

200
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,636
I mean, don't they usually
just sort of mime things?

201
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,804
Look.

202
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:56,633
The mild drop in hemoglobin

203
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,920
was entirely consistent with
an iron deficiency anemia...

204
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,065
Did you use both sides?

205
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,581
Seated in the booth

206
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:11,551
near the window. That's pretty carefree.

207
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:12,785
Waitress gives 2 menus.

208
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,119
But wait, now she's taking one.

209
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:17,489
Who's that?

210
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,026
Leaving work at lunch,
third time this week.

211
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:23,560
Both less than an hour.

212
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,530
That's him.

213
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,993
That's the clown's
voice, I'm sure of it.

214
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:32,435
Subject checking his cell
phone. Come on, make a move.

215
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:35,062
Leaving work at lunch,
third time this week.

216
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:37,016
Subject, what was he, a cop?

217
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,769
Play it one more time.

218
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,178
Waitress gives 2 menus,

219
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,324
But wait, now she's taking one.

220
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,551
Damn, more wasted hours.

221
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,778
Client's gonna be
pissed, and I'm starving.

222
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,157
Oh, wait, 12:42. Lunch date has arrived.

223
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:53,074
Little kiss hello.
That's innocent enough.

224
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:54,124
Talking.

225
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:55,818
More talking.

226
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:56,776
Ah, come on.

227
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,333
Somebody bust a move here.

228
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,301
Client.

229
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:02,869
He said client.

230
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,818
Yeah, if that belonged to your clown...

231
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,041
No.

232
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,141
He wasn't a clown.

233
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,811
He was a private detective.

234
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,737
Yep, here he is, Charles
Hammond Investigations.

235
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,755
A ghost P.I.

236
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,758
Do you think that explains
your feelings of being watched?

237
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,922
I'm not sure why I needed
the whole crowd staring at me,

238
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,318
But I guess so.

239
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,637
You sure the clown
get-up was a disguise

240
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:33,805
and not some kind of fetish?

241
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,353
I mean, maybe he's just mortified
they found him in his private wear

242
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:38,439
and that's why he's been hanging around.

243
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,170
He died last week at a birthday party.

244
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,572
Ok, this just gets creepier.

245
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,040
He was hanging around kids

246
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,780
as a fake clown at a party?

247
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,462
The party was
for a 15-year-old.

248
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:49,380
What 15-year-old wants
a clown at her party?

249
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:50,624
Brittany Cabot, apparently.

250
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:51,472
How do you know all this?

251
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,916
I thought there were no
dead clowns in Grandview.

252
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,335
There was one in the emergency room.

253
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:55,430
Jim asked around.

254
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,964
Charles Hammond was dead on arrival,

255
00:11:57,964 --> 00:12:01,222
And he choked on a balloon at the party.

256
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:02,689
Rookie mistake.

257
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,767
That's why they have
clown school, you know?

258
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,819
Anyway, Brittany's father, Alex,

259
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,777
He didn't want any weird publicity.

260
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,431
I guess he has an in with the paper.

261
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,009
He owns all these electronics stores.

262
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,115
So that's why they didn't mention
that the guy was dressed as a clown.

263
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:17,001
Yeah, or the fact that there was
a P.I. snooping around his house.

264
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,670
Is that who he was investigating,
the electronics king?

265
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,860
For all we know, he could have
been working for Alex Cabot.

266
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,808
What about the tapes, the
surveillance notes that Charlie took?

267
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,509
Is there anything about
the party or Cabot?

268
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:29,607
Tape. They only found one in all
these boxes from Charlie's office.

269
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:30,665
And?

270
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,050
Well, he likes to use people's initials.

271
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:35,418
He was talking about some guy, A.C.

272
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,690
That's Alex Cabot.

273
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,646
Yeah, but it was like he was
working on more than one case,

274
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:40,934
'cause there was this
woman's initials, S.P.,

275
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,321
But I couldn't tell whether he was
following her or working for her.

276
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,517
Now what?

277
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:45,741
We have to talk to the king.

278
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:47,065
Find out what he knows about our P.I.,

279
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,970
and if he knows anything
about the woman in the square.

280
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,055
The redhead.

281
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:51,859
Please don't.

282
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,843
Charles.

283
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:57,095
That's your name, isn't it?

284
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:59,478
Look, you don't have to
run away from who you are.

285
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,071
Whatever you did, whatever you need,

286
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,366
We can help you.

287
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,355
I still don't understand.

288
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,433
That's probably because
you died so suddenly.

289
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,943
And whatever you were doing,
you wanted to forget about it.

290
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,401
We can help you work through it;

291
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,903
Help you find peace.

292
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:15,681
I hardly remember anything.

293
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:17,648
I...

294
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:23,960
Maybe there's a good reason for that.

295
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,292
Charles?

296
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,789
I think people called me Charlie.

297
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,836
Wow, so this is you.

298
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,557
Do you feel better now?

299
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:37,129
You were a private
investigator, not a clown.

300
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:38,842
Yeah.

301
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:40,649
Yeah, that makes sense.

302
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,995
So what were you doing at the Cabot's?

303
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,229
I don't know.

304
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:48,612
Who's the redhead you were watching?

305
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,063
I...I know secrets,

306
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,799
other people's secrets.

307
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,283
That's why they pay me.

308
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,701
Ok, so is that what's keeping you here?

309
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,687
Maybe their secrets should die with me.

310
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,987
Hello? Is anybody here?

311
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,544
Yeah, just a second.

312
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,746
It's you!

313
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,925
- Excuse me? 
- Oh, my god.

314
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:21,377
We...we have a customer!

315
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,701
- That's great! 
- Awesome!

316
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:25,449
- Fantastic! 
- Great.

317
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,190
Well, good! It's...good to be here.

318
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,387
Are you Melinda?

319
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,369
Yeah. Yes. And you are?

320
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,508
Sherry.

321
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,540
I'm...I'm looking for some things

322
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,199
that belonged to a friend of
mine, named Charlie Hammond.

323
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,959
Of course you are.

324
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,561
I think.

325
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,246
So what is that you're
specifically looking for?

326
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:46,087
Uh, everything his landlord gave you.

327
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:49,566
I guess you were a
really good friend of his.

328
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:51,855
He was a really good guy.

329
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,957
How did you know Charlie, exactly?

330
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:55,913
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,171
Why does that matter, exactly?

332
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,829
Well, it's just that
everything that came in

333
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,131
from his landlord was from his work.

334
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:06,965
And his parents have already gone
through his personal effects, so...

335
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,437
Maybe they missed something.

336
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,323
I'm sure that they were pretty upset.

337
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:13,506
Do you know what
Charlie did for a living?

338
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,741
He was a private detective.

339
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,243
So that's how you got to know
Charlie, through his work?

340
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:20,438
Uh, no.

341
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,101
We both did Tai Chi in
the park every morning.

342
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:25,701
Boy, you guys ask a lot of questions.

343
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,685
I'm sorry. I was just
wondering. You know, 'cause,

344
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:33,893
His work belongings, you
know, they might be private.

345
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:39,294
Well, then, you wouldn't want to
sell it to just anyone, would you?

346
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:43,841
Look, I'm... I'm looking for
anything of sentimental value;

347
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,065
Things that his family overlooked.

348
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:48,042
I'll pay you double whatever
you paid for the stuff.

349
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,129
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
have to catalog it first,

350
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,838
but if you want to leave
a number, I can call you.

351
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,640
And, Sherry, could you
just put your last name,

352
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:56,541
Please, for my records.

353
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,910
Parks. Sherry Parks.

354
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:03,892
Are you from here originally?

355
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:04,762
Nope.

356
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:05,893
Thanks.

357
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,810
Sherry, just one more question,

358
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,652
Since you were really
good friends with Charlie.

359
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:13,447
Did he ever talk to you
about a guy named Alex Cabot?

360
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,426
Alex Cabot, that's my boyfriend.

361
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,480
Why do you ask?

362
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,507
We've just... we've seen you with him.

363
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,732
You know, small town.

364
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:27,667
Guess so.

365
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:34,571
We just met S.P.

366
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,899
- Sherry Parks. 
- Yeah!

367
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,008
The girl that Charlie
mentioned on the tape.

368
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,610
Is that why she came here,
for surveillance notes?

369
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,472
Wait, you're thinking Charlie
was tailing the redhead.

370
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:45,747
or up to something with
A.C., her boyfriend.

371
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,621
You mean someone else hired
Charlie to keep an eye on them,

372
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,125
At the Cabot's house,
dressed as a clown.

373
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,698
Maybe it was the only disguise
he could get on such short notice.

374
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:55,356
Nope. He had plenty.

375
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,801
You're an 11, right?

376
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,859
What are you doing?

377
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:00,960
I am helping you find out what
happened to the clown at the party.

378
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:02,561
Ding dong.

379
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,677
I have a delivery for a Sherry Parks.

380
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,133
Here?

381
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,499
You gotta be kidding me.

382
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,115
Sorry. Wrong address?

383
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,397
No. I mean, yes, but no.

384
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:20,080
She doesn't live here. Yet.

385
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:21,647
Do you have a king suite?

386
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:22,648
Dad.

387
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:24,240
Do you have an ultra king suite?

388
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,499
Are there any room descriptions with
the word "ultra" in front of them,

389
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,169
'cause I'm bringing somebody
special, I want the best.

390
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:29,083
Dad!

391
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,712
It's a delivery. Handle it.

392
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:36,003
Let me guess, something
else fit for a queen.

393
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:37,027
Where do I sign?

394
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:41,759
You know, the last time I was here,

395
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,447
there was a big party going on.

396
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:44,651
I think it was your birthday.

397
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,623
A clown even came to the door. Nice guy.

398
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:49,851
I never really met him.

399
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,869
He was sort of a sad
clown, 'cause he died.

400
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,894
What?! That's awful,
but I gotta ask you.

401
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:58,630
You know, I mean, you seem a little
old to have a clown at your party.

402
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,841
Who hired him? Was it your dad?

403
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,230
I wanted the clown. It
was supposed to be ironic.

404
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:05,671
I don't get that.

405
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,623
So you want to give me the package?

406
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:09,214
You said Ms. Parks doesn't live here.

407
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,771
She's my dad's girlfriend.

408
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:12,357
You don't seem too happy about that.

409
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,388
Can you tell me what's
in there? In the box?

410
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,258
It's insured, it's from New York City.

411
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:21,869
It's probably from some
fancy jewelry store.

412
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:22,875
I think it is.

413
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:25,637
Ooh, Ingleman's. Yeah.
Hmm. It's a good one.

414
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,155
Here we go again. Idiot.

415
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,879
He's an idiot for buying
his girlfriend jewelry?

416
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,434
Expensive jewelry she's
just going to trade in,

417
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,560
take the cash and replace with fakes.

418
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,276
Well, that's a pretty
specific assumption.

419
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:38,133
He got her these diamond stud earrings.

420
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:40,150
She swapped them with cubic zirconia.

421
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,419
That's low!

422
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,210
- Did you tell your dad this? 
- Yep.

423
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,139
Did he believe you?

424
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,266
He's still ordering her expensive crap,

425
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:48,193
So what do you think?

426
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,244
He's, like, blinded by
love or lust or whatever.

427
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,066
I've never seen him work
this hard for a girl,

428
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,902
And believe me, there's been plenty.

429
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,397
Brittany, what are you doing
out there? Did you sign?

430
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,460
Give it to me. If I don't have the
receipt, I won't have any proof.

431
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:08,628
Oh, I love angry
teenagers. Total Paydirt.

432
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:09,921
I don't know what they're
going to think about

433
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,314
that chinese vase I packed, but...

434
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,940
Not the blue one, from my store.

435
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,197
I had to bring something.

436
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,819
Why, was it expensive?

437
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:20,141
Go on. I'm breathing deeply.

438
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:21,250
At least you got your foot in the door.

439
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:23,614
Ok, I still don't
know who hired Charlie,

440
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:26,521
But I think I know who he's
investigating... Sherry Parks.

441
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,303
The daughter thinks
she's a total scammer,

442
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:29,614
Just after her dad's money.

443
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:31,542
Does anyone else think
this? Does the father?

444
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,593
It's possible.

445
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,684
She told her dad about her suspicions.

446
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,451
Ok, so maybe he hired Charlie.

447
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,031
I wouldn't rule out the daughter.

448
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:39,334
She's 15.

449
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:41,125
- You haven't met her. 
- Ok.

450
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,501
Look, whoever Charlie was working for,

451
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:44,217
why is he still hanging around?

452
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,403
What is he trying to find out?

453
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,491
Or hide?

454
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,606
Keep your nose out of my business.

455
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,863
You're a clown again.

456
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,216
I need you to hear me.

457
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:22,367
By threatening me? Why?

458
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,331
Is this about that woman?

459
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,661
Sherry? 'cause...

460
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:28,382
I can help you.

461
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:31,502
Help me? No, you're the
one that ruined everything.

462
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:34,137
She's gonna run again, and
then it's going to be too late.

463
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:36,074
Too late for what?

464
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,155
You're saying he warned
you to keep your nose

465
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,245
out of his business
by removing your nose?

466
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:56,140
That's a little
literal, don't you think?

467
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,403
I guess. Why?

468
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,510
His other warning was
so cryptic, you know?

469
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,735
The whole fishbowl thing.

470
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,314
I don't know, I got something out of it.

471
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,031
Your nose?

472
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,648
Look, the best clue was when he said
that Sherry was going to run again,

473
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:08,154
Meaning she's run before.

474
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:10,355
- I wonder what from. 
- Or from who?

475
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,118
So these are all these case files?

476
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:16,641
Files would mean an
attempt at organization.

477
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:17,894
Yeah.

478
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,409
I'm thinking that he does
a lot of divorce work.

479
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,103
Yeah, except Sherry's not married,

480
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,202
And her boyfriend's
been divorced for years.

481
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,502
Maybe she was married before.

482
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:26,797
You know, I looked her up.

483
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:29,305
Do you have any idea how
common the name Sherry Parks is?

484
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,800
And I'm guessing not a lot of
those files had photos in them?

485
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,891
You got it.

486
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,800
Alex's daughter told Eli
that she was a gold digger;

487
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,245
That she sold the diamonds right
out of the earrings he gave her.

488
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,733
Maybe there was a guy
before Alex, you know,

489
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,248
Someone she ripped off before.

490
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:42,725
And who's still out
there looking for her.

491
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:45,958
I believe that these are Aiden's,

492
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,486
or else your P.I. has infiltrated
a stolen homework ring.

493
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,062
You know, can you explain to me
how he takes 6 apples out of 20

494
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,356
and gets an 8 million number?

495
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:58,224
Wow, he really does love
that number, doesn't he?

496
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:00,277
Yeah. You know, it's
like father, like son.

497
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,298
I was like this with your number.

498
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,571
I wrote it down everywhere.

499
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:04,877
I was really worried
that I would forget it.

500
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:06,696
I put it on milk cartons, banana peels,

501
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:07,798
my buddy's dashboard.

502
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:09,170
That's sweet.

503
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,740
Phone number.

504
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,784
What?

505
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,691
Todd Lieber.

506
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:15,614
Who's Todd Lieber?

507
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,863
Maybe a client of
Charlie's, but look at this.

508
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:20,345
He's in Weston, that's
only a couple towns away.

509
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:21,725
What, Sherry was from Weston?

510
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,637
I don't know, but look,
this was dated 10 days ago.

511
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,361
That's the most recent
thing in these files.

512
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,818
This must have been the case
he was working on when he died.

513
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:32,197
Wait a minute, you think maybe Sherry
pulled her gold digger act on Todd,

514
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,255
took all his money, and
then Todd hired Charlie

515
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,223
to go and look for her.

516
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,423
Well, if Todd is willing to talk to me,

517
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:37,657
I'm going to find out. Aiden!

518
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,107
Let's go, school!

519
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,108
Ok. Here.

520
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:43,225
I got it, mom.

521
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:44,702
Are you sure, you don't want any help?

522
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:46,763
- I'm fine. 
- Great.

523
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,681
Aiden...

524
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,431
What did you put in this backpack?

525
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:59,043
Did you pack rocks again for share day?

526
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,417
What's the matter?

527
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,779
Someone's inside the car.

528
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:04,940
Where?

529
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:09,550
I don't... I don't see
anyone. Is it a ghost in there?

530
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,718
Can't you feel it?

531
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:14,091
Someone's watching us again.

532
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:16,436
Ok.

533
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,463
Can you... can you tell me who?

534
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:20,627
I can't see them.

535
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,843
I just feel them nearby.

536
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,129
You know what?

537
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,376
I'll go check it out, ok?

538
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,372
Charlie?

539
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:38,793
If this is you, knock it off, Ok?

540
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,913
I'm just trying to help you.

541
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,524
It's all clear, baby.

542
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,331
You sure this is the right address?

543
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:01,068
Yep, it's what the invoice says.

544
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:02,786
Well, then, as far as gold diggers go,

545
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,921
this Sherry's not the
sharpest pick axe in the shed.

546
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,772
Yeah, well, maybe she is, and
this is what she left the guy.

547
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,706
Don't give that woman my number.

548
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:13,249
Todd? Lieber?

549
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:14,638
In the flesh.

550
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:16,388
What can I do you for?

551
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:21,096
You don't know a woman named
Sherry, by any chance, do you?

552
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:23,748
Sherry...my Sherry?

553
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:25,395
Oh, my god.

554
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:27,352
You found her.

555
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,964
I'm really sorry to hear about Charlie.

556
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:31,256
How long have you worked with him?

557
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,908
Not very long. We're just
contacting all of his clients

558
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:35,692
to make sure they've been debriefed.

559
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:39,433
What? What is it?

560
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,875
I messed up so bad.

561
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,831
We've been a couple since high school.

562
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:47,278
And I guess everyone
thought, me included,

563
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,652
that would never change.

564
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:50,121
And Sherry felt differently?

565
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,423
Well, she must have, because she left.

566
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,916
But you never would have known it.

567
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:57,083
All she did since we got out of
school was bug me to marry her.

568
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,992
Every time she'd ask, I'd
say, sure, yeah, sounds great.

569
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:04,890
But, you know, let's wait till
all our ducks are in a row.

570
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,117
What ducks were those?

571
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,919
Well, you know,

572
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,641
Like...me.

573
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,523
- You? 
- I mean, come on.

574
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:14,224
Marriage is for grown ups.

575
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,093
For people who get out
of bed in the morning

576
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,861
and take a lot of showers.

577
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,795
It's for people who
balance their checkbooks

578
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,518
and know how to, you
know, use their stoves.

579
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:25,192
And it's not like I don't shower. I do.

580
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,222
But not if I don't really need to.

581
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,536
And I guess I thought

582
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,327
getting married is like showering.

583
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,406
Why do it if you don't really need to?

584
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,458
And that went over big with Sherry, huh?

585
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,289
For the first 8 years, she was fine.

586
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:37,635
8 years?

587
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:38,969
Yeah.

588
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,138
We were great. Really great.

589
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,519
But then suddenly she
started acting all weird,

590
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,154
All kind of secretive.

591
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:48,016
I asked her if she met another guy,

592
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:49,720
she swore she hadn't.

593
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,955
So I started wondering,

594
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,923
what other secret could there be

595
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,031
that she would have to keep from me.

596
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:58,262
Then whammo.

597
00:25:58,262 --> 00:26:00,124
What if she's pregnant?

598
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:03,496
What if she's pregnant, and she
doesn't think I'm ready to be a dad.

599
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:04,306
Pregnant?

600
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,889
I know, right?

601
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:09,303
So I thought about being a
dad, how important that was.

602
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,738
And I made up my mind.

603
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,060
It was time to grow up.

604
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:17,088
So one day, while it was still morning,

605
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:18,632
I got out of bed,

606
00:26:18,632 --> 00:26:21,463
and I showered and I put on a shirt

607
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,048
and I asked her to marry me.

608
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,582
And what'd she say?

609
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,593
Nothing.

610
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:28,641
She just started crying.

611
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:31,366
Like those were the worst
words I could possibly say.

612
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:32,965
Then what happened?

613
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,888
The next day, she was gone.

614
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:36,199
Did you call the police?

615
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,299
No.

616
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,287
She left a note. I knew
she wasn't kidnapped.

617
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:42,020
But I had to find her.

618
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,810
I had to know what I did wrong.

619
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,693
Plus, if she really was
pregnant with our baby, then...

620
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,617
Ok, so how did you find Charlie?

621
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,304
A parking ticket from Grandview

622
00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:53,043
showed up in the mailbox
3 weeks after Sherry left.

623
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:55,531
I just looked in the phonebook,
and that's how I found him.

624
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,144
I had to sell my truck
to come up with his fee.

625
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,012
But it's good.

626
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:02,434
I'm walking much more.
I've lost 10 pounds already.

627
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,629
Well, what did Charlie
say? Did he find anything?

628
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:07,031
He got some leads early on, yeah.

629
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:09,653
But then he made it
sound like he'd lost her.

630
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:10,920
Made it sound like? What do you mean?

631
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:14,056
After a while, he kinda
stopped taking my checks.

632
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,357
or my calls.

633
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:16,692
I just figured he was a busy guy

634
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:19,494
and he didn't have anything
else he could tell me.

635
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,744
Why? Was there something
else he found out?

636
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:24,331
We would have to check his files,

637
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,867
but if we find anything,
we'll definitely let you know.

638
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:28,468
We better get going.

639
00:27:28,502 --> 00:27:30,553
Call me as soon as
you hear anything, ok?

640
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:31,968
You've got my number and address.

641
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,024
Oh, just one more question...

642
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:37,344
8351, does that mean anything to you?

643
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,134
That was Sherry's parents
street address here in Weston.

644
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:43,146
Ok, we'll be in touch.

645
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:46,648
8351, what was that about?

646
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:50,018
Maybe nothing. Maybe something.

647
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:54,988
She took off the moment
he asked her to marry him.

648
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:55,884
Yep.

649
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,418
After 8 years of bugging him for a ring.

650
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:01,486
And you said this guy, he's not rich?

651
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:03,945
Well, he had to sell
his car to hire a P.I.

652
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,664
All right, now am I
missing something here,

653
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:09,234
or is Sherry not the gold digging
gold digger that everyone says she is?

654
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:10,835
She's kind of the opposite.

655
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,447
What's so interesting?

656
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,046
The number that Aiden wrote,

657
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:18,443
it's a combination of Todd
and Sherry's street addresses,

658
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,444
624, 8351.

659
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,032
You think he picked
them up from the ghost.

660
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,170
Probably.

661
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,289
Charlie's been hanging around.

662
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:26,664
Aiden said he felt
like he was watching us.

663
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:29,635
Aiden wouldn't be seeing these numbers

664
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,730
unless it was something
important to the ghost.

665
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,246
But why would it be important?

666
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,204
It's just a couple of street addresses.

667
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:37,459
Maybe it's more.

668
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:40,358
Like what? And how am
I supposed to find it?

669
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,553
Asks the woman who practically
spends her life on the internet?

670
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:45,121
Good point.

671
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,300
Congratulations, you have
one the lotta lottery!

672
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:55,502
Oh, my god.

673
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:59,004
It's a lottery number. A winning one.

674
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,496
A big winning one?

675
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:03,477
Sherry doesn't need anybody's gold.

676
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:05,869
She's a multimillionaire.

677
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,986
Are you sure?

678
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:14,077
I thought you said her name
wasn't listed in the article.

679
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:17,022
Well, the story said that the
winner wanted to remain anonymous.

680
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,920
But they described her as a
25-year-old female from Weston.

681
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,862
Ok, so when did she win?

682
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,456
4 days before she left town.

683
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:26,884
And 3 days before he suddenly
lost his cold feet and proposed?

684
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,650
Look, he said he was
afraid she was pregnant,

685
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,920
and so he asked her to marry him.

686
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,782
Ok, or maybe she told him
that she won the lottery,

687
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:36,704
hence his sudden conversion to marriage.

688
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,925
Or maybe he found out and, you know,

689
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,667
needed to pretend 'cause
he didn't want her to think

690
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,120
that he married her for money.

691
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,219
And maybe she saw through his act,

692
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,628
and that's why she skipped town.

693
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:47,286
Unless they bought the tickets together,

694
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,142
and then she went running
away with his winnings.

695
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:51,429
Right. But in that case,
they would both be liars,

696
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:53,574
because he didn't mention
the lottery to you.

697
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:57,184
Money like that brings
out the worst in everyone.

698
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:58,407
Charlie.

699
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:01,348
Oh, now you show up.
Where have you been?

700
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:02,694
He's been around.

701
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,635
Yeah, that's right. Skulking and spying

702
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:07,824
and scaring everybody I
know while you're at it.

703
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:09,680
Sorry about that. Old habits.

704
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,911
I know why you wanted
me off Sherry's case.

705
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,951
You were trying to
keep her money a secret.

706
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:16,101
I saw what happened
when people found out.

707
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:17,277
You mean Todd.

708
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:18,674
What did he do?

709
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:20,158
He broke Sherry's heart.

710
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,360
That about face proposal?

711
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,217
I mean, how dumb was he
thinking she wouldn't know

712
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:26,598
why he changed his
mind about the marriage?

713
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,844
She told you about his proposal?

714
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,062
I guess you guys had
gotten pretty close.

715
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,898
Well, I'm good at my job.

716
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:33,951
What can I say?

717
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:35,412
Why would you care if she ran?

718
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:36,692
I mean, it got her away from Todd.

719
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:40,105
All she wanted was someone to
love her for who she really is.

720
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,010
She needs someone she can trust.

721
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:43,957
What did he say?

722
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:46,968
He was trying to help her find
somebody that she could trust.

723
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:48,962
Oh, really? Like you,

724
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:51,241
who never mentioned to
her why the two of you met,

725
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:53,759
or you, who pretended not to
know that she won the lottery?

726
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,564
Or you, who pretended you were a clown.

727
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:01,211
So that you could spy on her boyfriend?

728
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,068
Yeah, I'm a creep

729
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,910
who wears costumes to sneak
around following people.

730
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,853
And half the time, I
work for the bad guys.

731
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:10,275
But sometimes,

732
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:11,433
I dig up more than dirt.

733
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:14,275
Sometimes, I dig up something good.

734
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:17,092
Or someone, which is why
you were watching Sherry

735
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,661
even though you told
Todd that you'd lost her.

736
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:23,062
Look, here's this girl who
has millions of dollars,

737
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:24,999
and she spends it like water.

738
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,497
But guess how much
she spends on herself?

739
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:28,950
Not one dime.

740
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,609
Ok, so what does she spend it on?

741
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:31,959
Charity.

742
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:35,898
Every hopeless lost cause,
three-legged puppy she could find,

743
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:37,680
And all anonymous.

744
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,457
Sounds pretty special.

745
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:41,713
Well, she deserves a lot
better than some lazy bum

746
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,835
Looking to take a free
ride on the lotto train.

747
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,947
It still doesn't explain
why you spied on Alex.

748
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,084
He doesn't need a free ride.

749
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:48,363
He's got plenty of money on his own.

750
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:51,388
Yeah, well, sometimes these
rich guys like to play the field.

751
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:54,019
So you were watching him to see
if he was dating anyone else.

752
00:31:55,543 --> 00:31:57,890
I wanted to know if
he was right for her.

753
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:01,716
And I still do.

754
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:06,531
How many millions?

755
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:09,055
That's more zeroes than
I have actual dollars.

756
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:11,603
Remember when I said not
to give Sherry my number?

757
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,672
Yeah, I'm reappraising that.

758
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:15,047
Uh-oh, gotta go.

759
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:16,451
Hey, I know you.

760
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,312
Where's your uniform?

761
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,747
It's, um, uh, it's my day off.

762
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:27,229
Why does your bag have
a Rockland U. ID on it?

763
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:28,979
Professor James.

764
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,996
It's my brother. My twin brother.

765
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:34,798
Teaches psychology.
He's extremely talented.

766
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,494
Man, I could use a shrink right now.

767
00:32:37,494 --> 00:32:38,504
Really?

768
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:42,128
I want to strangle my dad for
giving away my wedding ring.

769
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,714
It's so oedipal!

770
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,056
Actually, that sounds a little
bit more like Electra than Oedipus.

771
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:48,433
I'm sure my twin brother would say.

772
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,112
So your dad gave your ring away?

773
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:52,109
I just knew he was
going to marry goldie.

774
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:54,911
He gave away my grandma's ring,
it was supposed to be mine!

775
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:56,112
Goldie?

776
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:58,399
I call her goldie because
she's a gold digger.

777
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,407
I knew she'd pawn the
ring the second she got it,

778
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:02,385
so I wanted to make sure
it was worth something.

779
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,335
She did it before it
was even on her finger.

780
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,152
Is that what the jeweler just told you?

781
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,735
She pulled the same stunt
she did with the earrings.

782
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,661
Now there's 2 carets of cubic
z where the diamond used to be.

783
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:16,037
Really? What do you think
she did with the money?

784
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,259
Bought drugs, I hope.

785
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:20,912
At least then my father
will see she's not worth it.

786
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:21,955
As if he'd listen.

787
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:23,580
'cause when you told
him about the earrings,

788
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,860
he didn't even blink.

789
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,983
Which is insane!

790
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:27,222
And I googled her.

791
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,926
Parks isn't even her last name.

792
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,704
And when I told him, guess what he did.

793
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:33,774
He got online and
researched her himself.

794
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:35,511
After that, he was full steam ahead.

795
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,914
He fell even more in love with her.

796
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,278
How dumb does he have to be to do that?

797
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:41,185
That's a good question.

798
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,247
Ok, thanks, Tom.

799
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:48,316
I promise I won't breathe a
word about how I heard. Bye.

800
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,339
Well, this confirms Eli's hunch.

801
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:52,502
Sherry's new boyfriend
is basically broke.

802
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,883
How? I mean, he owns all those stores.

803
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,916
Yeah, and mortgaged beyond the hilt.

804
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,242
And this is not a good
time to be over-extended.

805
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:01,324
So Alex must have found out
that Sherry won the lottery

806
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:02,901
And that's why he started
giving her jewelry.

807
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:04,789
To make it look like he
didn't need her millions.

808
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,164
And it cost him nothing because
he pawned off the diamonds

809
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,299
to stave off the creditors.

810
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,651
So how did Brittany know that
her father was going to propose?

811
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,004
He's been planning a special trip.

812
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:16,211
Yeah, him and Sherry. To Las Vegas.

813
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:17,608
He's such a romantic.

814
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:20,212
He keeps dropping hints that he
wants Elvis to be the best man.

815
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:20,984
Oh, boy.

816
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:22,396
- It gets worse. 
- How?

817
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,157
There's a limo outside
their house right now.

818
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:25,625
They're leaving for the airport.

819
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,836
- What? 
- Sherry's being taken for a ride.

820
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:29,522
We need to stop them.

821
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,043
You ready to go, babe?

822
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:44,868
Um, yeah, sure.

823
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:47,002
Can't wait.

824
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,856
Sherry!

825
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,597
Are you here?

826
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:04,185
Sherry!

827
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:06,852
Thank god we're not too late.

828
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:07,808
Excuse me.

829
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:09,737
I hate to be rude, but
we have a plane to catch.

830
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:10,891
I know you.

831
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,825
You're from the antique store.

832
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,393
What are you doing here?

833
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:16,249
I'm here to look after you,

834
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:19,048
because Charlie Hammond
can't do that anymore.

835
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:20,741
Baby, we gotta hit the road.

836
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:23,155
Whatever it is, I'll
call you when I get back.

837
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:25,769
Get in that car now,
and it'll be too late.

838
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:28,972
- Too late for what? 
- He knows.

839
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,107
Alex knows that you're rich.

840
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,587
What are you talking about?

841
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:34,608
Sherry, we have to go.

842
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:36,544
In just a minute. I want to hear this.

843
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:39,814
What is it that you think you know?

844
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:41,183
You didn't even know Charlie.

845
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,614
No, I didn't.

846
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,000
Not when he was alive.

847
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:46,269
But I've talked to him since,

848
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:48,320
and I can explain. I will.

849
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,872
Look, I don't know who
you two people are, but...

850
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:53,541
There's a reason that he was at
the party that day when he died.

851
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,415
Was he working for you?

852
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:00,338
Is that why you've been pushing
to take this trip so hard?

853
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:01,748
All the marriage talk?

854
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:03,483
Are we talking about
the poor, dead clown...

855
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:04,650
See, I've been wondering
who hired Charlie,

856
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,485
what he was doing here at the party

857
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,853
ever since I read his obit
and saw that he was a P.I.

858
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,252
Charlie was never working for Alex.

859
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,418
At that point, he was really
just looking after you.

860
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:17,047
But when Alex found out that
a P.I. had died in his house,

861
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:18,744
he decided to cover up the story.

862
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,426
Look, I want you people out
of my house, off my property.

863
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,500
Cover it up, why?

864
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,174
Because he thought that
Charlie was snooping around,

865
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,645
and if people were
snooping around Charlie,

866
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:26,838
then they'd find out your secret.

867
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:28,674
And if everyone knew that
you had won the lottery...

868
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:30,406
Then he couldn't pretend
to not know himself.

869
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:32,512
Why would I need to not know anything?

870
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:35,526
Because you're a gold digging
scum sucker.That's why.

871
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,856
Todd?!

872
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:38,645
Who's the homeless guy?

873
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:53,926
The benevolent electronics king
isn't going to press any charges.

874
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:56,013
He doesn't need the
extra publicity right now,

875
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,068
especially not this kind.

876
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:01,030
Are you sure that you're ok?

877
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:02,731
You look terrible.

878
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:04,587
I just spent the night
in the woods, is all.

879
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:07,602
Wait, you tracked us from
Weston to Grandview on foot?

880
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,632
I could tell you had
something on Sherry.

881
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:10,498
No offense,

882
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:12,319
but you guys don't look much like P.I.s.

883
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,408
None taken, I'm sure.

884
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:19,680
So I, uh, guess you
were pretty desperate

885
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:21,481
not to lose me and my money.

886
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:24,362
I didn't sell my ride
just to find you, girl.

887
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:26,465
I got 9 grand for that quad cab.

888
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:28,389
Four went to that P.I. Charlie,

889
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,912
and the other five I socked
away for college for T-Bone.

890
00:37:30,912 --> 00:37:32,024
T-Bone?

891
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:34,224
I always dreamed I'd name my firstborn

892
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:35,743
for my favorite blues man.

893
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:38,015
- But if it's a girl... 
- Your firstborn?

894
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:41,431
Well, ours, actually.

895
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,567
I thought you were pregnant.

896
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:46,669
But you're not, are you?

897
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,074
No.

898
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,091
You just ran because
you didn't trust me.

899
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:57,027
You expect me to believe that you
had no idea I'd won the lottery?

900
00:37:57,027 --> 00:38:00,240
Babe, when's the last time
you saw me touch a newspaper?

901
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:03,139
I just... I don't know.

902
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:06,095
You don't know if you trust me?

903
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:09,002
Or if I'm who you want to be with now?

904
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,321
So much has happened.

905
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:15,634
I can't figure out what's right.

906
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:19,442
Well... whatever you do,

907
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:20,658
I'm ok.

908
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:21,638
You know?

909
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:23,061
What do you mean?

910
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:24,763
When I thought I was going to be a dad,

911
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,494
I realized I had to stop
seeing myself as a loser.

912
00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:29,900
Because someone else, my kid,

913
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,278
was going to see me as
this awesome grown-up,

914
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:34,404
no matter what I really am.

915
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,459
Plus, which...

916
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:38,747
you were with me a really long time,

917
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:40,491
and wanting to marry me.

918
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:44,340
And that means you must
have seen something in me.

919
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,042
So...

920
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,678
If I'm ever lucky enough to
find someone like you again...

921
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:01,773
I'll sign a pre-nup.

922
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,686
I'll bunk in the trailer
behind your new mansion.

923
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:05,630
Will you shut up?

924
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,028
You tell them I'm sorry.

925
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,074
I didn't mean to keep them apart.

926
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:14,890
They'll understand. It's
your job not to trust people.

927
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,307
Yeah. You didn't even trust me.

928
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:17,586
I mean, you gave me all those visions

929
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:19,306
even though you knew
I was trying to help.

930
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:20,346
What visions?

931
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:22,599
The whole fishbowl
thing in my living room?

932
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,258
People staring at me.

933
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:25,899
I don't know what you're talking about.

934
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:27,831
Is Charlie here?

935
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:33,380
Will you tell him thanks
for looking out for me?

936
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:37,934
Should I tell her the real
reason you've hung in for so long?

937
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:40,720
I probably won't get another chance.

938
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:45,920
Ask Todd.

939
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,261
Sherry's the kind of girl, the
more time you spend with her,

940
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,947
the crazier things you'll do.

941
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:52,324
Sleep in the woods,

942
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:54,232
jog across the county,

943
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,435
even dress up as a clown.

944
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,204
Not even death could slow you down.

945
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:01,939
No.

946
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:09,878
But that might.

947
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:12,514
You see the light?

948
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:13,879
Yeah.

949
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,808
It's filled with people.

950
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:17,892
You know how I feel about people.

951
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:19,317
Yeah.

952
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:22,223
But Charlie, this place is different.

953
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:25,234
I can feel it.

954
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,118
Feel what?

955
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:30,529
Trust.

956
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:34,466
Blind, senseless,

957
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,735
bottomless trust.

958
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,295
Not so bad, is it?

959
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:46,145
Will you tell Sherry what I said?

960
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,852
Trust me.

961
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:06,210
I just kissed our
sleeping son good night.

962
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,126
How long does it take
to get him to go down?

963
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:11,369
Even longer than usual.

964
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:16,428
Is he still thinking
somebody's watching him?

965
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,696
I don't get it.

966
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,656
Didn't that private
eye go into the light?

967
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,656
I don't think it's that ghost.

968
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:25,288
What is it? Is it a shadow

969
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:27,775
or a shiny or another ghost?

970
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,402
He says it's something different.

971
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,578
That's good.

972
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:39,017
Ok, I gotta go...

973
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:42,340
Transcribe some patient
notes downstairs.

974
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,137
- Good night. 
- Good night.

975
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:50,028
Bedford.

976
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,063
What are you doing here?

977
00:41:53,864 --> 00:41:56,189
You should listen to your son.

978
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:00,350
What are you talking
about? What do you want?

979
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,552
It was never about what I want.

980
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:05,036
But it could be about what you want.

981
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:06,988
What do you mean?

982
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:10,807
You want to live.

983
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:13,463
Come on, you can do better than that.

984
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:16,836
You owe me, especially after
what you almost did to my friends.

985
00:42:16,836 --> 00:42:18,708
Owe you?

986
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:22,286
I've given up my life and my mother's,

987
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:24,906
and I'm still not done paying.

988
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,972
What's happening?

989
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:36,259
Remember this...

990
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:38,440
Nothing is what it seems.

991
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,110
Nothing and no one.

992
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:44,226
I don't understand.

993
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:47,717
Trust nothing and no one.
