1
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:29,471
Oh!

2
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,244
[both chuckle]

3
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:37,980
Oh, my.

4
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:56,265
15 minutes.

5
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,300
All right,
no problem.

6
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:20,589
[exhales]

7
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,466
[breathing heavily]

8
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:37,072
Jimmy?!

9
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,974
Are you doing that?

10
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,542
I can feel that, jimmy.

11
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,578
I know you're doing
that, man! stop!

12
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,147
[breathing heavily]

13
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,358
[screaming]

14
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,427
[kicking]

15
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:03,565
Let me out!
get me out!
open the door!

16
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,968
[breathing heavily]

17
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:07,669
Get me out,
i'm stuck!

18
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:09,905
[yelling]

19
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,909
[screaming]

20
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,183
Woman on p.a.:
paging dr. bender,
paging dr. bender.

21
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,184
Man: just calm down.

22
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:23,185
Don't tell me
to calm down.

23
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:24,186
That freaking morgue
is haunted, ok?!

24
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:25,988
Hi, dr. clancy.
hi.

25
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,223
I should be
suing you guys!

26
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,025
Look, it was
a stupid high school prank.

27
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:31,493
My grandson is sorry.

28
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,594
What are you talking
about? i'm not sorry!

29
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:33,896
Hey, vicky.
hey.

30
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:35,764
What's going on here?

31
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:38,701
Eh, i don't know.
some kids broke into
the morgue last night.

32
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:39,835
Why?

33
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:43,238
Bored. stupid.
all of the above.

34
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,840
Oh, wow, look at this.

35
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:48,377
Look at that clamp.
what year do you think that is?

36
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:50,112
Ah, fifties, i think.

37
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,047
The hospital's
clearing out storage,

38
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:53,849
Getting rid
of all this old junk.
oh.

39
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:55,451
Now that is beautiful.

40
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,052
You can take it
if you want it.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,287
Really?

42
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,488
Sure.

43
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,923
It's just going to get
melted down anyway.

44
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:01,957
[whispering] all right,
it's our secret. shh.

45
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,158
[whispering] shh.

46
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:07,529
Check this out.

47
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:09,765
How cool
is that, huh?

48
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,967
What is it?

49
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:13,836
Well, it's an old
version of a tool

50
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:14,937
That your dad
uses at work.

51
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,439
It's called
a suction cannula.

52
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,174
It's a suction tube,
really.

53
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,744
You use it
for an operation?

54
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:22,978
Yeah. yeah, we do.

55
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:23,979
Except now we use
better ones,

56
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,415
I mean, newer ones.

57
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,917
I don't like operations.

58
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,086
[laughs]
that's good.

59
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:32,421
Nobody likes
an operation.

60
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,889
But sometimes,
you know,

61
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:36,692
That's the only
way we can make
somebody healthy.

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,028
We have to go in
and fix something

63
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:41,597
Inside them, something
that's making them sick.

64
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:42,664
And this kind
of thing

65
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,566
Gives a person
a second chance.

66
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,609
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:56,111
Baby, sorry for what?

68
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,513
I don't know.

69
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,548
I just feel like
i did something wrong.

70
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,151
What? no, no,
we wanted you
to hold it.

71
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,385
No. you didn't
do anything wrong.

72
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,787
In fact, you are perfect.

73
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,854
Well, i don't know
about that.

74
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,389
What'd she say,
you're perfect?

75
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:08,490
Come here.

76
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:09,825
I think he's
pretty perfect.

77
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:11,894
You know, you're good
for a little boy.

78
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,328
You'll do all right.

79
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:14,630
I mean, you know,
he'll do in a pinch.

80
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:16,065
[aiden giggles]
i think he's tired.

81
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,232
I'm going
to take you up

82
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,467
And you're going
to have the best bath ever.

83
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:19,968
We're going to get
your teeth brushed.

84
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,071
We know how much
you like that, right?

85
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,507
Did you see
the new toothbrush
mom got you?

86
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,476
It's the purplest thing
you've ever seen.

87
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,714
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

88
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:37,715
Sync by honeybunny

89
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,689
Man: how cheesy
is that?

90
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:05,790
But i just had
to get it.
absolutely.

91
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,291
It is a must-have.

92
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,359
But i think you have
to have the whole
collection.

93
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:10,128
Like world's
greatest mom,

94
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:11,129
World's greatest boss.

95
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:13,331
You know,
all the categories.

96
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,299
Did you ever get
world's greatest lawyer?

97
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,802
Oddly...no.

98
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,470
Poor baby.

99
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,272
Is everything ok?
yeah.

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,840
You know,

101
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,343
I don't meet
too many people
with a sense of humor.

102
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,344
I know what you mean.

103
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,812
No, the truth is,

104
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,914
Cheesy figurines aside,

105
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,717
I don't really
know how to date.

106
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,352
I mean, i know how,

107
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,687
Just not, you know,
reading all the signals

108
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:37,989
And all that.

109
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:40,024
I mean, after
my divorce, i just--

110
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,193
I hibernated.

111
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:45,429
Look, dating is hard enough
for teenagers to figure out,

112
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,265
Let alone people our age.

113
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,433
An enigma wrapped
inside a riddle.

114
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,569
Exactly.

115
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,237
Oh! did you order wine?

116
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:56,707
No. i may have thought it,
but i didn't order it.

117
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,243
Please, this is
with my compliments.

118
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,746
Oh, that's very sweet,
but i can't have any right now.

119
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:03,881
Oh, no, no, no.
you must.

120
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,616
This is a beautiful vintage.

121
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,084
You'll love it.

122
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,086
That is so nice,
but if i drink in
the middle of the day,

123
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:10,087
I can't accomplish anything.

124
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:11,322
No, no, i insist.

125
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,490
Uh, excuse me.
the lady said--

126
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:13,858
Aah!
oh!

127
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,560
Oh, damn it!

128
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:17,228
What the hell
is wrong with you?
what are you, stupid?!

129
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,362
I am so sorry.

130
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,597
Don't just stand there,
you moron!

131
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,499
Get her some towels.
oh, it's ok.

132
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,934
I just didn't expect it.

133
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,702
Well, of course not.

134
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,404
I mean, how could
you expect someone
to be so stupid?

135
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:29,040
We didn't want
the damn wine
to start with,

136
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:30,908
And she certainly
doesn't want
to be wearing it!

137
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,610
What are you,
totally brainless?

138
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,579
I'm so sorry.
please let me pay
for the cleaning.

139
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,247
Really? you think?

140
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:37,248
You'll pay
for the cleaning

141
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:38,349
And you'll pay
for lunch!

142
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,417
Hey, that's enough.

143
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,853
I mean,
nobody died here, ok?

144
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,254
I'm just gonna, um--

145
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,656
I'm just gonna go
take care of this.

146
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,227
Is this really ok?

147
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,294
Yeah, it looks
great on you.

148
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,463
Ok, but do i smell
like wine?

149
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,265
Oh, it's ok.
it's a good year.

150
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,700
So besides all that,

151
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,002
How did you
enjoy the play,
mrs. lincoln?

152
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,805
You know, the irony is,
i was enjoying it just fine.

153
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:02,039
I've been dating
a lot of guys,

154
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:03,908
And they're all turning out
to be so dull.

155
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,310
Roger was kind of funny,
he was smart,

156
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:09,447
He was a little corny,
in a good way.

157
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,781
And he listened.

158
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,583
You know how hard
that is to find?

159
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,885
So, are you going
to go out with him
again?

160
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:16,520
You know, my mom
always told me

161
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,522
Never to date a guy
who was mean to waiters, so...

162
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,524
God, was he really
that bad?

163
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,059
Well, it's not like
the maitre'd wasn't obnoxious,

164
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:25,263
And it isn't the first time
he ever spilled something on me.

165
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,299
I guess i should just
wear a rain slicker
when i go to lento's.

166
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,434
But roger, i don't know.

167
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:33,971
I saw this meanness
underneath, so...

168
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,307
I think i'm just going
to have to throw that one back.

169
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,642
See you later?

170
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,143
Yep.

171
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,144
Thanks.
bye.

172
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:41,545
Bye.

173
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,728
[creaking]

174
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:22,887
[knock knock]

175
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:27,024
[scoffs]

176
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,933
[knocking]

177
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,221
Melinda:
you're kidding.

178
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,456
Jim: no,
i wish i was.

179
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:00,224
I just had to sedate
the attendant

180
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,193
Who now thinks
the morgue is haunted.

181
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,061
Well, can i come over
and check it out?

182
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,263
No, the morgue's got
back-to-back autopsies
all day long.

183
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,498
So maybe tomorrow
morning?

184
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,033
Yeah, after i put aiden
on the bus.

185
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:11,002
Maybe you could call
eli. he might know
something about it.

186
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,771
Eli's been sick all week.
we're on our own.

187
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,839
Let me try him at home.

188
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,674
All right. bye.

189
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,555
[water running]

190
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:12,496
Aiden?

191
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:28,412
Um...

192
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,314
Hello?

193
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,121
Can i ask
what you're doing?

194
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:39,190
Is everything ready?

195
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:41,192
Sorry?

196
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,527
Is everything ready

197
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:44,528
In the o.r.?

198
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:46,897
Patient is ready, doctor.

199
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,951
Jim: we have to find
this ghost, mel.

200
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:08,185
We only have
a few minutes.

201
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:09,620
Hello?

202
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:11,689
How can i help you?

203
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:12,823
You sound like
customer service.

204
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,992
Well, kind of is.

205
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,962
Oh, i feel something
toxic here.

206
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,830
Very dangerous.

207
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:26,937
What the...

208
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:28,639
What the...?

209
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:39,750
Oh!

210
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:46,624
Oh!

211
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:50,794
Yeah, you've got
a haunted morgue here.

212
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,417
Paul?

213
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,819
Paul jett?

214
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,387
Who wants to know?

215
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:06,888
My name is melinda gordon.
i'd like to talk to you

216
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:08,924
About what happened
at rockland memorial.

217
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,058
Are you 5-0?

218
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,426
I'm sorry, what now?

219
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,762
The po-po,
the man, the heat.

220
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,765
I am not the police,
if that's even remotely
close to what you're asking me.

221
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,201
Yo, then we got
nothin' to talk about.

222
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:21,002
[laughter]

223
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:25,440
Look, from what i heard,

224
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:27,809
You pretty thrilled
when the po-po showed up
the other night

225
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:31,079
As you were screaming
your head off in the morgue.

226
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,614
I talk to ghosts.

227
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,816
I can see ghosts.

228
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,586
It's not something
i want other people
to know about,

229
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,187
For obvious reasons.

230
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,423
But i am telling you
because i want to know

231
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:43,291
What happened
the other night.

232
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,565
15 minutes,

233
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,068
The alley
behind the station.

234
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,309
Ugh. ew.

235
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,778
Hey.

236
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,013
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

237
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,149
Do you want to go somewhere
more comfortable?

238
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:09,684
Oh, i know.

239
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,887
The tough guy thing,
it's just an act.

240
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,588
It's my mask.

241
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,257
I don't get it.

242
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:18,126
Survival. look,
i just moved here

243
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,494
To live with my grandfather.

244
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,897
At my old school,
they all said i was
this prodigy.

245
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:24,833
National honor society,
science club,

246
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,669
Future mathematicians,
blah, blah, blah.

247
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:28,904
You make it sound
like a bad thing.

248
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:32,741
You know what it's like
having an i.q. of 135?

249
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,643
No.
it's hell.

250
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,045
And all it ever got me
was ignored by girls

251
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:38,613
And my butt
kicked by jocks.

252
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,383
There's no way
i was going to be
the new nerd in town.

253
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,286
So you make
everybody believe
that you're a thug?

254
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:45,520
Semantics.
[laughs] right.

255
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,823
I prefer to think
of myself as a bad boy.

256
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,892
It's amazing, you know.
it's all about perception.

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,627
Everyone thinks
i'm a bad ass from day one,

258
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,796
And suddenly, it's like
i'm untouchable.

259
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:56,832
What happened
in the morgue?

260
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,800
It was an initiation.

261
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:02,337
Not into the future
mathematicians club,
i take it?

262
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:06,074
I was supposed to stay
in an empty morgue drawer
for 15 minutes.

263
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,210
What happened?
did you see something?

264
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:11,279
No, but i felt something.

265
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,748
Someone touching me.

266
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:15,717
You know, at first
i just thought it was

267
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:17,986
Like one of the guys
hazing me or something.

268
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:19,488
Did you hear anything?

269
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:20,922
Other than my heartbeat?

270
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,991
No.

271
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,594
So what if i need
to talk to you again?

272
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,230
Oh, uh, just text me.

273
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,165
9-1-1, i'll meet you here.

274
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,701
Ok.

275
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:46,281
[footsteps]

276
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,270
Is everything ready

277
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,738
In the o.r.?

278
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:10,473
Patient is prepared
and ready, doctor.

279
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,214
[monitor beeping]

280
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:52,514
We are going
to fix you up, son.

281
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,583
[monitor beeping]

282
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,402
[gasps]

283
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,170
They're killing me!

284
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,409
[inhaling, exhaling]

285
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:28,807
"roses are red,
violets are blue."

286
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,409
Ooh! i love this!

287
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:31,710
Do you know
who's doing it?

288
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:33,412
Yes.

289
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,682
Roger "i seem nice but
i'm really mean" shephard.

290
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,784
He's called me a few
times, but i'm not
calling him back.

291
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:39,818
All right,
so he's on a mission.

292
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:41,153
He wants to win you over.

293
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,521
Yeah, not gonna happen.

294
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,789
Famous last words.

295
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,258
So, is there any news

296
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,127
About all the weirdness
happening at the morgue?

297
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,396
She said,
changing the subject.

298
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,097
How do you know
about the morgue?

299
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:54,133
Are you kidding?
it's all over town.

300
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,968
People are saying
that dead bodies
are coming to life.

301
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,470
No. these bodies are dead.

302
00:17:58,538 --> 00:17:59,938
The ghost is just
manipulating them.

303
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:02,308
Oh. well, that ought to
make people feel better.

304
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,009
Now what are
the grown-ups

305
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:05,778
At the hospital saying?
oh, well,

306
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:08,781
It's explainable.
i mean, muscle spasms,
rigor mortis,

307
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:10,049
Blah, blah, blah.

308
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,384
How do you deal with
a haunting like this?

309
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,119
Ineptly, so far.
and i keep getting distracted

310
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:16,288
By all these visions
i'm getting from aiden.

311
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,956
He keeps having
weird surgery nightmares.

312
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:19,458
How do you know
that they're his?

313
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:21,126
It's been happening
a lot lately.

314
00:18:21,194 --> 00:18:23,796
Getting used to it.
oh, poor kid.

315
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:24,863
No, it's fine.

316
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:26,332
He doesn't remember
any of them.

317
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,700
I get them loud and clear.

318
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:31,303
Same one,
same time every night.

319
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,706
Man, you have got
so much on your plate.

320
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,941
And i'm sorry,
but i have to go.

321
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:39,611
Are you sure you don't want
to give roger a second chance?

322
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,480
A lot of fish
in the sea,

323
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:42,981
And all that.

324
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,450
But it proves he has
a romantic side!

325
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:46,485
And besides, you told me
that that maitre'd
was obnoxious

326
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,854
And had spilled things
on you before, so maybe

327
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:52,291
Roger was just,
i don't know,
protecting you.

328
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,926
Ok, i admit it,

329
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:56,528
The violets
were impressive.

330
00:18:56,596 --> 00:19:00,165
But they're not
a get out of jail card.

331
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,234
[door dings]

332
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:06,071
Eli...

333
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:07,940
There's no easy way
to break this to you,

334
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,542
So i'm just going to
give it to you straight.

335
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,979
You don't have
swine flu.

336
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,648
You have laryngitis.

337
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:20,285
No, and you don't
have flesh eating
bacteria, either.

338
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:22,688
It's probably
just hives.

339
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:26,425
You had hives all over
your rear end through
the whole fourth grade.

340
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:30,229
Eli, what is all
this stuff? ahh.

341
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,197
"define regular."

342
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:34,900
"this is what
i call clean."

343
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,769
"i am not hungry."

344
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,939
"typical morning
conversation with mom."

345
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,509
I'm just trying
to take care of you.

346
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,979
<i>did i just walk into
the middle of family feud?</i>

347
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,986
"a. you're smothering me.

348
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:55,954
"b. suggestions about...

349
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,523
"more fiber, inappropriate.

350
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,691
And c.,
i just want privacy."

351
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,629
You want privacy?
you got it.

352
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:06,064
I know when
i'm not wanted.

353
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,767
Eli, just take 2 aspirin
or whatever's your poison
and--

354
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,903
Ahem.

355
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,238
Be grateful i believe
in house calls.

356
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:17,075
Man: i can't change it,
he's gone. i--

357
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,744
What?

358
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:20,145
I killed him. i--

359
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,815
I killed him!

360
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:24,683
[sirens]

361
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:32,858
"murderous ghost
attached to this
instrument, big time."

362
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:37,696
What, you've had
two hauntings
from this surgeon ghost.

363
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,798
Why didn't you tell me
there was a spirit
attached to this thing?

364
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,333
I didn't know.
i thought the visions
that i was having

365
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,502
Were aiden's dreams,
and he was sending them to me.

366
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,103
Sorry. a guy
just likes to know
who's in his house,

367
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:46,839
Especially
if they're dead.

368
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:48,440
Do you have a date
or something?

369
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,342
Well, kind of.
just stay with me.

370
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,311
So what's the deal
with this ghost?

371
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,012
Well, if he's attached
to the instrument,

372
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,581
Then it's an imprint haunting.

373
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:57,850
Oh, not a ghost loop.
we've been through
that, right?

374
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,084
Yeah, exactly.

375
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:00,686
Where a ghost gets stuck
reliving a traumatic event

376
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:01,954
Over and over again

377
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,388
Until he can figure out
how to make it right.

378
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:04,590
Traumatic is an
understatement.

379
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:06,058
Look, how can i help?

380
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,193
Can you tell me what
kind of surgery this
ghost is performing?

381
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,162
Actually, i can do better
than tell you.

382
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,430
[footsteps]

383
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,065
I can watch it.

384
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,606
[breathing]

385
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:28,413
What do you see?

386
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,482
[suction]

387
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:40,158
Melinda:
everything's pretty old.

388
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:42,394
It's a long time ago.

389
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,400
Jim: can you
guess a date?

390
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,402
1950s.

391
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,038
There's a big machine
in the corner.

392
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:55,007
Lots of tubes.

393
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:56,875
Is there anything
written on it?
what does it say?

394
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:03,515
It says "oxygenator."

395
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,351
Oh, it's a heart-lung
machine, wow.

396
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,786
And if it's the fifties,

397
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:09,421
That's one of the first
of its kind.

398
00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:14,226
[suction]

399
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:18,564
[monitor beeping]

400
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,866
Patient off
heart-lung.

401
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:23,268
They just took him
off the machine.

402
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:24,670
They're operating
on his chest.

403
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:26,204
[monitor beeping]

404
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:27,839
All right, if that's
open heart surgery,

405
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:30,475
There's only a few
procedures they could
have done at that time.

406
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:33,078
[monitor beeping rapidly]

407
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:34,613
He's in cardiac arrest.

408
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:37,449
[monitor flatlining]
doctor, his heart stopped.

409
00:22:37,517 --> 00:22:39,885
Wait, wait!
do something!

410
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:41,386
[stammering]
doctor, do something!

411
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:42,788
We're losing him!

412
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:44,856
No, please!
wait, my patient!

413
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,124
Do something!

414
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:47,526
This can't be!

415
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:49,728
Get him outside.

416
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,866
We're losing him.

417
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:58,136
Keep trying.

418
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,639
He's gone.

419
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,040
Well, keep trying,
keep trying.

420
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:03,275
Jim: now what is it?

421
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:05,544
Something went wrong.

422
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,412
The doctor
made a mistake

423
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,815
And the patient
died on the table.

424
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:14,019
Jim: hey.

425
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:15,654
Hey, buddy.

426
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:17,990
What is it?
what's wrong?

427
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:21,360
Hey, did we
wake you up?

428
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:23,629
I feel like...

429
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:25,330
Like what, baby?

430
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:27,666
Like i did something wrong.

431
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:30,569
Like i did something
bad to somebody.

432
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:32,638
I didn't mean it.

433
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,139
You didn't do
anything wrong.

434
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:36,241
It was just
a bad dream.

435
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:38,777
[sighs]

436
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:42,147
Well, it explains
why aiden's been feeling

437
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:43,415
Like he's done
something wrong.

438
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:44,850
You know,
it's not his dreams.

439
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,818
It's the presence
of this ghost.

440
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,388
A ghost that accidentally
killed one of his patients

441
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:52,190
During surgery
over 50 years ago?

442
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,392
There was a lot
of confusion.

443
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:54,593
He was very upset,

444
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:56,194
And they had to take him
out of the o.r.

445
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:57,429
Think there's
any connection

446
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,531
Between
your surgery ghost
and my morgue ghost?

447
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,900
What if the morgue ghost
was the patient who was killed?

448
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:03,435
I mean, think about it,
you know?

449
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:06,204
All these hauntings
started the day you found
that instrument.

450
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:08,907
Yeah, i guess
that makes as much
sense as anything else.

451
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:11,710
Hmm. not really sure
how to take that.

452
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,812
Uh, with a little dose
of irony, my dear.

453
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,213
I thought so.

454
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:17,015
So...

455
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,584
How are we going
to find out more?

456
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:26,458
[indistinct chatter]

457
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:30,262
Woman on p.a.: dr. perry,
please check with
the medical center.

458
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:34,366
Dr. perry, please check
with the medical center.

459
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:11,403
[woman screaming]

460
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:16,074
Man: get out of here.
everybody out.
clear the morgue.

461
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,948
[man breathing heavily]

462
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,194
What the...?

463
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:37,929
[breathing stops]

464
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:53,311
[exhales]

465
00:25:57,897 --> 00:25:59,231
Oh, this ghost
is getting
on my nerves.

466
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:00,532
Your nerves?

467
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,867
My heartbeat's
still at warp speed.

468
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,569
Did you get
the ghost
surgeon's name?

469
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:06,438
Ah, yeah.
it's dr. albert glassman.

470
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:08,974
The guy ran cardiology.
but get this--

471
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:12,144
He died the same day
that the patient
he was operating died,

472
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:14,112
October 16th, 1959.

473
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,081
I don't get it.
how can that be?

474
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:18,050
I don't know. i mean,
sometimes the paperwork
can get messed up

475
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,252
And the dates
can get confused, but...

476
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,621
Ok, well, did you get
the patient's name
who died on the table?

477
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:23,922
No. not that, either.

478
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,024
I had one more page to go
when the screaming started.

479
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,926
Well, look, i mean
if the morgue ghost

480
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:29,928
Is the patient that
dr. glassman killed
during surgery,

481
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:31,530
We have to get those
two together.

482
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:32,631
Because then
the morgue ghost

483
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:33,832
Can forgive
dr. glassman,

484
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
Dr. glassman
can stop reliving

485
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:37,035
The same mistake
over and over again,

486
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,070
And hopefully,
at some point,

487
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,538
We can get
a good night's sleep.

488
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,073
What?

489
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,042
Why is there a mime
following delia?

490
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,258
Oh!

491
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,592
Please go away.

492
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,694
I'm begging you.

493
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:04,663
Ok.

494
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,864
Thank you so much.
i've got it.

495
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:07,766
Bye-bye now.

496
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:13,872
I'm gonna read it.

497
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,109
Oh, sweet.
very sweet, ok.

498
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,212
[sighs]

499
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,047
Ok.

500
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:25,350
"roses red,
violets are blue,

501
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:28,053
I can't hide my feelings."

502
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:30,522
Ok. i'm gonna go now,

503
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,790
And i wish you would
stop that,

504
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,225
'cause you're kinda
creeping me out.

505
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,862
Ok, please.

506
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,196
Would you please stop?
just stop crying.

507
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:40,532
Stop crying.
would you please
stop crying?

508
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,967
I'm sorry
i hurt your feelings--

509
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,469
Seriously?

510
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:48,273
You want a tip. ok.

511
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:50,742
There's your tip.
thanks so much.

512
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,678
You're very, uh...

513
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,546
Talented.

514
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:01,353
Taxi!

515
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:14,466
I know who you are.

516
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:18,537
You're a patient
of dr. albert glassman.

517
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:21,440
You had a congenital
heart defect.

518
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:23,442
He was trying to repair it.

519
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:26,011
You died in surgery.

520
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,180
[sighs]

521
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,215
Look, i know
that you're angry.

522
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:31,950
And just so you know,

523
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:33,652
Dr. glassman
is very upset, too,

524
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,822
But you're
both stuck here.

525
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,525
Earthbound because
of your anger and...

526
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,027
His guilt.

527
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,899
It's time to end it.

528
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,203
What's your name?

529
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,505
You know me.

530
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,308
I've seen you,
but i don't know your name.

531
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,579
I can feel your anger.

532
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:02,714
You want revenge.

533
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,852
[breathing]

534
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:14,493
What happened to you
was terrible....

535
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,963
And it was just an accident.

536
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,231
What happened to me,

537
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:21,233
What happened
to everybody here,

538
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,135
Was no accident.

539
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:25,203
[breathing]

540
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:31,410
[screaming]

541
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:38,383
[monitor beeping]

542
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,727
I don't know
who you are,

543
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:51,963
Or if you even know
what's going on.

544
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,966
But what's about
to happen

545
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:57,736
Was an accident.

546
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:00,539
And you're going
to feel angry,

547
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:03,675
Like you want revenge,
but please,

548
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:07,446
Just cross over
and find some peace.

549
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:11,650
I'm so sorry
that i don't know your name.

550
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:27,933
[cell phone dings]

551
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:33,205
Sorry
to pull you away

552
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:34,973
From all
the grandview
unrulies,

553
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,075
But i have a very
important question.

554
00:30:37,143 --> 00:30:38,343
Speak.

555
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,345
Do you know if
you're related
to a william jett?

556
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,247
What's it to you?

557
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:44,249
Sorry. i mean,
why do you ask?

558
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,485
Sometimes,
in the spirit world,

559
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:48,587
A ghost can be
earth-bound but dormant.

560
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:50,088
I think when you
broke into the morgue

561
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:53,992
That you stirred up
the ghost of your
relative, william jett.

562
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,028
The ghost of william jett?

563
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,630
He's been haunting
the hospital.

564
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:00,065
He's still angry
with the surgeon

565
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,534
He thinks caused
his death all those
years ago.

566
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:06,037
Look, no judgment,
but whatever you're on,

567
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:07,272
There is help available.

568
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,374
Ok, i know
it's a lot to take in,

569
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:11,776
But i really
need you to reach out
to your relative

570
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:13,478
And see if you can
get him to forgive

571
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:15,180
The surgeon he blames
for his death.

572
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,849
Now, how are you related
to william jett?

573
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,951
Bill jett.

574
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,087
That's my grandfather.

575
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:23,822
[chuckles]
wait a minute.

576
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,290
How can he be
your grandfather?

577
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:28,960
He died in 1959,
and he was only
a teenager.

578
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:31,830
Dude, my grandfather
is a lot of things,

579
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,098
But dead is not one of them.

580
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,500
He just ran
the senior triathlon.

581
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:37,202
He's alive and well
and totally disgusted

582
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,604
With my newfound
street cred.

583
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,940
[indistinct chatter]

584
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:43,675
Yeah, it's just me
and my grandfather.

585
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:44,676
Can't wait for you
to meet him.

586
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:46,378
Paul!
grandpa.

587
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:47,379
Hey.

588
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,647
This is
melinda gordon.

589
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:50,916
She thinks
you're dead.

590
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,817
[laughs]

591
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:55,220
Well, if you're
the welcoming committee,

592
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,821
That's fine.

593
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:58,690
Please, bear with me.

594
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:00,458
Aren't you
the william jett

595
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:03,628
Who had heart surgery
in 1959?

596
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,931
True. on my 16th birthday,
no less.

597
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:07,699
But you didn't--

598
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,935
I saw it--

599
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:13,138
I thought that the doctor
made a mistake,

600
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,774
And that you died
on the table.

601
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:19,644
Ahh.

602
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,682
Dr. glassman
didn't kill me.

603
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,586
I killed him.

604
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:38,569
Most people don't
accept it so easily

605
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:40,003
When i say
i can see ghosts.

606
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,106
Are you kidding?
i think it's a great gift.

607
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:44,308
Yeah, but you were
wrong this time.

608
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,976
Don't be rude, gangsta.

609
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:49,413
Can one of your ghosts
help me understand
why my grandson

610
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,948
Thinks its cooler
to hang

611
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:52,783
With a group
of monosyllabic morons

612
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:55,352
Than use the brain
he was blessed with?

613
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,087
Now don't diss me,
pa-pa.

614
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:59,823
[laughs] no idea.

615
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:03,460
Could you tell me
what happened
during the operation?

616
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:06,630
Well...

617
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:09,567
The fact is, i did die
for a few minutes.

618
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,003
[monitor beeping]

619
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:13,104
He's in cardiac arrest!

620
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:16,106
It was amazing.
doctor! his heart stopped!

621
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:17,475
I could see and hear
everything,

622
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:18,710
And nobody could see me.

623
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:21,145
Do something!
we're losing him!

624
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,679
No, please!

625
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:24,248
Dr. glassman
looked so stricken,

626
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,049
So panicky.

627
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:27,985
I wanted to tell him
i was fine.

628
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:31,388
Heh, in fact,
i never felt better.

629
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,125
Leave me alone,
leave me alone.

630
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,360
Leave me alone.

631
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:37,861
Then i could see
the doctor was in trouble.

632
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:40,364
There was something
wrong with him.

633
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:46,103
I tried calling to him,
to the other doctors,

634
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:47,805
But of course,
no one could hear me.

635
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,410
[groaning]

636
00:33:57,683 --> 00:33:59,184
William: the poor man
had a heart attack

637
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:03,221
In the hospital hallway,
and died within seconds.

638
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:07,258
He's back!

639
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:08,393
They were able
to bring me back.

640
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:12,597
I was dead for three full
minutes, so they told me.

641
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:14,999
For me, it seemed
like a split second.

642
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:18,203
Or maybe a lifetime.

643
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,405
I decided that day
i'd never waste
another second.

644
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,540
Learn everything
i could,

645
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:24,676
Go everywhere i could.

646
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:25,977
Teach.

647
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:29,214
Live a full life.

648
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,584
But...i almost
felt guilty.

649
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:35,852
I had a second chance
at life,

650
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,988
And dr. glassman
lost his.

651
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:41,358
I thought if only
he'd known i could be revived,

652
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,193
Maybe he wouldn't
have had his heart attack.

653
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:45,329
How come you never
told me this?

654
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:46,563
Ahh.

655
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:48,031
Past has a way
of slowing you down.

656
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:49,900
Who needs it?

657
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,371
Well, sometimes,
the past can teach us.

658
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,373
Did they ever find out
what happened?

659
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:59,076
Did dr. glassman
make a mistake?

660
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:00,344
I don't think
they ever

661
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:02,346
Fully understood why
i went into arrest,

662
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:03,547
But, uh,

663
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:05,582
Cardiac surgery
was in its infancy.

664
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,684
But i'll tell you
one thing for sure--

665
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,920
Dr. glassman
fixed the hole
in my heart.

666
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:13,523
I'm alive today
because of what
he did.

667
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:16,426
Looks like you had
a great life.

668
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,262
Still having it.

669
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:20,497
Would you mind
waiting here for me?

670
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:23,233
I'll be right back.
it's important.

671
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:28,038
Thank you.

672
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:31,241
Hey. i'll have
a double latte.

673
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:34,044
Hey, delia,
someone just
left this for you.

674
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:35,779
Really?
mm-hmm.

675
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:37,614
Roger: hey, you close
escrow on the house?

676
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,717
You did? that's fantastic.
congratulations, you guys.

677
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:41,952
I'll see you later.

678
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:45,155
I'll be right back.

679
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:51,261
Hey.

680
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,564
Oh! hi.

681
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:54,631
Hi.

682
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,600
I see you got
the gift.

683
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:57,801
Yes.

684
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,038
Look, um...

685
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:03,407
I can't say
what happened at lento's

686
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,409
Still doesn't
bother me a little bit,

687
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:07,878
And i'm not really
big on second chances,

688
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:12,182
But at the end of the day,
anyone this persistent

689
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,884
Deserves a second chance.

690
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,453
You lost me
at persistent.

691
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,255
What? i--

692
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:20,691
I don't know
what you mean.

693
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:25,129
The gifts, the notes,
the, um, the mime?

694
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:26,730
Mimes creep me out.

695
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,366
Oh. so, um...

696
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:32,036
You didn't do
any of that stuff?

697
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:34,371
Well, no.
i mean...

698
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,073
You didn't
return my calls,

699
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:38,375
I got the message.
you know.

700
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,210
I moved on.

701
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:42,513
Oh, i just noticed
there was a box in there

702
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,983
With your name on it
when i was picking up
my coffee just now, so...

703
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:49,887
Well, uh, i gotta run.

704
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:51,121
Take care.

705
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:53,290
Yeah. you, too.

706
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,475
"roses are red,
violets are blue,

707
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:13,811
"i can't hide my feelings,

708
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:16,713
That's why i keep
spilling things on you."

709
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:32,429
You?

710
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:39,369
It is just that since
the first time i saw you,

711
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:43,841
And for months now,
every time i try
to talk to you,

712
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,709
Or do something
to impress you,

713
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:47,511
I-i get nervous.

714
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,047
So i mess it all up.

715
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:54,084
You were on the rooftop
with the flowers?

716
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,754
I know. i must
come across like
a total buffalo.

717
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,690
A buffoon?

718
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,925
Yes. yes,
thank you,
a buffoon.

719
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,461
And if i had
to do it all over,

720
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:07,097
I would definitely
rethink the mime.

721
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:10,334
[laughs]
but still, i--

722
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:13,170
I have to keep
trying with you.

723
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:16,039
Because the truth is,

724
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:18,942
Whenever
i see you smile,

725
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,944
It makes me forget

726
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,914
Whatever i'm saying.

727
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,949
Whatever
i'm thinking.

728
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:27,551
Even what i'm doing.

729
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,656
How can i ignore this?

730
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:38,962
[exhales]

731
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,765
Melinda: if i use this
to bring him here,

732
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,169
It might break him out
of his ghost loop.

733
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,704
What are we doing?

734
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:51,308
You're about
to meet dr. glassman.

735
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:54,044
Dr. glassman: suction,
where's the suction?

736
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,879
He's here.

737
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:04,688
Who are you?

738
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,391
Where's my patient?

739
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,559
This is your patient.

740
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:10,594
Bill jett.

741
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,730
He survived
the operation.

742
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,766
You didn't
cause his death.

743
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,167
No.

744
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:20,437
This isn't my patient.

745
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,406
No, that's his grandson.

746
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:25,409
This is your patient.
[chuckles]

747
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:28,111
No.

748
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:31,114
My patient is just a boy.

749
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:32,616
Yes.

750
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:34,718
He was 50 years ago.

751
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,521
But he survived.

752
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,356
And he's right here.

753
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:43,026
You've been stuck here
this whole time trying
to make it right.

754
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:45,195
No, i killed him.
i made a mistake.

755
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:46,797
He's saying
that he killed you.

756
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:48,498
Oh, no, doc.

757
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,133
Can he hear me?

758
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,736
No, doc,
you saved me.

759
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:54,238
But you had
a heart attack

760
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,539
And died
before you knew.

761
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:58,542
That's right, i died.

762
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,043
And i died a failure.

763
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:03,647
I couldn't figure out
what i did wrong.

764
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,850
Dr. glassman, i died
for a few minutes,

765
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,753
But they were able
to restart my heart,

766
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,321
The heart you fixed.

767
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,725
I lived.

768
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,460
You didn't kill him.

769
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:18,562
You saved him.

770
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,530
I saved him?

771
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:22,532
Yes.

772
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,936
Look at these pictures.

773
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:30,240
His family, his kids,

774
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:34,444
His...brilliant grandson.

775
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:38,649
Look at all the accomplishments
he had as a teacher.

776
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:41,551
Look at all the accomplishments
of his students.

777
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:46,923
Look at all the love
and the joy in these pictures.

778
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,359
Look at all the things
that are in the world

779
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:52,462
Because bill jett
is in the world.

780
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,433
Because you held his heart
in your hands

781
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,435
And you fixed it.

782
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:01,972
He's not wasted one minute.

783
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,408
You gave him
a second chance.

784
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:07,144
And by giving him
that second chance,

785
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:11,548
You've given everybody else
in his life a first chance.

786
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,817
Doctor, you have no
reason to feel guilty.

787
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:16,019
I'm the one
who feels bad.

788
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:17,187
Because of what
happened to me,

789
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:18,355
You had
a heart attack.

790
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:20,590
No, no, it wasn't
your fault.

791
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:23,193
My heart was in bad shape,
it was just a matter of time.

792
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,861
He doesn't want you
to feel guilty.

793
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,963
His heart
was in bad shape.

794
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,232
So he can hear me, right?

795
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,102
Yes.

796
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,937
I just want to say...

797
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:36,039
Thanks.

798
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:38,809
Thanks for giving me
my grandfather.

799
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:41,378
I never realized

800
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:44,348
How lucky i was
to come from him.

801
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:49,653
He seems like
a nice kid.

802
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:51,588
Why is he dressed
like a thug?

803
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:52,689
[laughs]

804
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:55,792
Oh, it's
a long story.

805
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:20,384
He's crossing over now.

806
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:24,287
He's gone.

807
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:29,493
Are you ok?

808
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,728
Yeah, i'm cool.

809
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,565
I love you,
grandpa.

810
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:41,638
Ok, wait, wait, wait,
all right.

811
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,107
[both laugh]

812
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:46,143
Very nice.

813
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,178
[indistinct]

814
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,514
Well, i'm sorry you had
to go through all that.

815
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,649
That's all right,
for you, it was
worth it.

816
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:54,284
Salud.

817
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:56,853
Good morning.

818
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,360
[laughter]

819
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:11,635
[record scratches]

820
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:13,303
What?

821
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:16,773
We thought bill jett
was the ghost who was
haunting the morgue.

822
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:18,241
But he's not.

823
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:20,844
So who is?

824
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:28,989
