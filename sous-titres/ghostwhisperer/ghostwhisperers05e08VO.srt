00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:04,695
Melinda:

2
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:06,265
I've been stuck here

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:08,233
Jim: gridlock

4
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:09,901
Yeah, it's a building
renovation,

5
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,870
And the square's
a parking lot.

6
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:13,939
Hey, i've got a few hours

7

11

Cool. no problem.

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,780
Ah, you're the best.

13
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:24,516
Oh, wait. never mind.

14
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:26,485
I'm not the best anymore?

You are the best.

16
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:30,823
Love you, too.

17
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:31,991
Man: i need--hey! hey!

I--i need your--

20
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:35,862
You got--you gotta help me.

21
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,197
I'm right--
i'm right down there. i'm--

22
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,366
Uh-oh.

23
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,968
Oh, god, not right now.

24
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:44,703
Stop!
ooh.

25
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,540
Oh, boy.

26
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,008
Whoa. i need your help.

27
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,944
Uh, sorry.

28
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,280
I-i'm still not used
to this whole, uh, ghost thing.

29
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,983
Uh, ok. well,
i have to pick up my kid
from soccer, so...

30
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,518
You know, i need you
to help me.

31
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:01,019
I've been in there
for 2 days,

32
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:02,521
And none of the workers
have noticed me.

33
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:03,689
Your body?

34
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:06,792
In that building over there,
facedown in the dirt.

35
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,328
I don't want my loved ones
to see me like that. please.

36
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,462
Don't let me rot.

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,965
[sighs] let me
call my husband.

38
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,534
Ok. come on. come on.
come on. come on. come on.

39
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:17,970
Hey...

40
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,972
Go. go. see?
it's down there.

41
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,374
Go! go! go! go! go!
come on.

42
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:27,546
[gasps] ohh.

43
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:29,047
Yeah, i-i'm down there.

44
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:37,189
All i'm asking for
is my dignity.

45
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,730
[water dripping]

46
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,006
A little further in.

47
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,073
[beep]

48
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:09,521
Do you mind, uh,
calling the police?

49
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,058
Watch the quarter.

50
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:18,063
Well, how can we watch it
if you're hiding it?

51
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,731
You can't, because
it's disappeared.

52
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,401
How'd you do that?!
that was so cool.

53
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:23,402
It's magic.

54
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:24,569
Real magic?

55
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:27,072
A magician never tells.

56
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,373
Hey, gus, i wanna go
play at your house.

57
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,808
I thought you were
coming to my house.

58
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,777
I wanna see
some more magic.

59
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:33,945
I can do stuff, too,
things you can't.

60
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:35,313
Yeah, right.
do another one.

61
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,948
Hey, uh, guys,
sorry i'm late.

62
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:37,949
What's goin' on?

63
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:38,950
Gus is magic.

64
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,085
Not real magic.

65
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,953
Uh, let's talk about it
in the car, huh?

66
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,256
Go buckle up.
doors are open.

67
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:46,792
How you doin'?

68
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:47,959
What's goin' on?

69
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,161
I wanna go home.

70
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:50,228
All right.

71
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,599
[siren]

72
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,202
Don't forget
to have the coroner
sign the report, ok?

73
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,905
Eli: oh,
detective blair, hi.

74
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,940
And how'd you find
this one?

75
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:04,242
Oh, it's, uh,
simple, really.

76
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,243
Um...

77
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:08,413
Yeah. yeah, because,
uh, he--he...

78
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:09,448
Dropped his cellphone,

79
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:12,117
And then he went to go
and retrieve it.

80
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:13,318
And i saw shoes.

81
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:14,319
Uh-huh.

82
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,321
Why is it
everywhere you go,

83
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,490
You seem to keep
finding bodies?

84
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,258
Because people
keep dying.

85
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,626
Do--do you know
who he is?

86
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:24,429
Uh, his i.d.
was in his wallet.

87
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,831
Name's kirk jansen.

88
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,432
His wife is
on her way now.

89
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,202
Now it gets
interesting.

90
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,503
What does
that mean?

91
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,839
Means we called her.

92
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,108
Woman: where is he?

93
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,909
Where's my husband?

94
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,712
Oh, my god.

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,813
Kirk, no!

96
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:44,282
Wow. she's really
convincing.

97
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,284
Don't go anywhere,
either of you.

98
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,920
I'll take it from here.
oh, my god! kirk!

99
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:50,722
No! no!

100
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,723
No!

101
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,458
Look, i know how
hard it is to watch

102
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:54,626
Someone you love
grieve like this.

103
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,495
You know,
we can help you
talk to her

104
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,463
If you want
before you go
into the light.

105
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,398
Oh, uh-uh. no, no, no.
i'm not going anywhere.

106
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,268
Well, you need
to let go and let
your wife mourn you.

107
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,636
Rita, mourn?

108
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,872
Don't count on it.
those tears are an act.

109
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,074
That bitch killed me.

110
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,616
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

111
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:23,617
Sync by honeybunny

112
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,048
Ready?

113
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,084
[resumes humming] nuh!

114
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,986
[gasps] where is it?

115
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,087
Mm.

116
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:06,088
Ta-da!

117
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,323
Cool. can i do it?

118
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,560
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to practice a lot, ok?

119
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,629
Uh-huh!

120
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,631
There's more
where that came from.

121
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,065
Thanks, daddy.

122
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,233
You're welcome.

123
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,234
See ya.
this is awesome!

124
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,236
Since when
is he into magic?

125
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:24,640
Oh, ever since little gus
started showing him some tricks.

126
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:27,109
I've never seen him
look so left out.

127
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:28,343
That nearly killed me.

128
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,778
Aww. well,
you know what?

129
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,581
It's good for him
to have a hobby
besides ghosts.

130
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,549
Especially since he's
started telling his friends

131
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:34,817
That he can do things,

132
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,152
Um, other people can't.

133
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,389
Wait. did he tell them
about the ghosts?

134
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,190
No. no, i stopped him
before he could finish,

135
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,960
And then i took him out to buy
this magic kit to distract him.

136
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:45,061
Genius.
thank you.

137
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,929
Oh. hey, your body came
into the morgue today.

138
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,232
They're gonna try to get to it
tonight for the autopsy.

139
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,566
Please stop calling it
"my body."

140
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,569
Look, do you really think
his wife murdered him?

141
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:54,703
That's what he said.

142
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,071
And if he's telling
the truth,

143
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,873
I'm never gonna
get him into the light.

144
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,441
It's hard to say,
"i forgive you,"

145
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,576
After your spouse
whacks you.

146
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:03,579
Yeah. should you leave
this one to the police?

147
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:04,914
I always do.

148
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:07,983
But i have to get him
into the light.

149
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,251
All right.

150
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,653
Let's say
she really is guilty.

151
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,088
But what if the police
can't solve the crime

152
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,225
And you are the only one
who knows the truth?

153
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,294
Scrub brush.

154
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:21,564
Thank you.

155
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,600
Yeah, of course i know
rita and kirk jansen.

156
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,836
They're like the power
couple of grandview
real estate.

157
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,171
They're married.
they're successful.

158
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,506
They're witty.
they're charming.

159
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:31,907
They get all
the best listings.

160
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,009
Sound like you're the president
of their fan club.

161
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,177
Oh, are you kidding me?

162
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,745
I pretty much hate them.

163
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,448
Kirk beat me out
for the golden key
2 years ago.

164
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,550
Golden key?
yeah.

165
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:44,186
It's a sales award from
the realty association,

166
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,188
And he doubled
his listings after that.

167
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:50,059
And you wanna know why?
because...

168
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,627
He's a genius.

169
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,128
Listen to this.

170
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,631
"the kitchen
will make you want
to kick off your shoes,

171
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,533
"pour a glass
of ice cold prosecco

172
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,868
"from the stainless
steel fridge while
sinatra croons

173
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,238
On the room-to-room
digital sound system."

174
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,773
I mean, it's poetry.

175
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,709
Ok. so then if they were
such a perfect couple,

176
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:09,311
Then how come he said that
she wanted to murder him?

177
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,413
I mean, something
obviously went sour
at some point.

178
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,982
Wait. didn't we
have a rule

179
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,217
Where we let the police figure
out who-dunnits when they can?

180
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,019
Yeah, but if we're gonna
cross this ghost over,

181
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,454
We need to figure out
the why-dunnit,

182
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,688
For lack
of a better word.

183
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,624
Give me a shout
when you do.

184
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,726
So you said that your wife
wanted to murder you,

185
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,928
And now you don't know why?

186
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:27,162
He's here.

187
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,564
Oh. um...

188
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,565
Hi, kirk.

189
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm really
sorry about...

190
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:32,701
You know. yeah.

191
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,236
It's simple.
she hated me.

192
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,904
Lots of married couples
hate each other.

193
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,139
How'd she do it, anyway?

194
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,240
Ah, you don't
wanna know.

195
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,442
Uh, if we're gonna help you,
we have to know.

196
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,444
Well, trust me.
it was horrible.

197
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,480
All i can say
is everything
about rita is toxic.

198
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,248
I wouldn't
put it past her

199
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:47,249
If she poisoned me.

200
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:48,784
I--you know, i would
have walked barefoot

201
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:50,119
Over burning, broken
glass for her.

202
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,954
I did
everything i could

203
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,822
To make her happy.

204
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,358
Obviously not happy enough.

205
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,703
Who's there?

206
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:12,007
Kirk?

207
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,309
[gasping]

208
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,056
That's how she
killed me.

209
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,427
Since you asked.

210
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,567
Anaphylactic shock.

211
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:39,568
He died from allergies?

212
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:40,569
It can happen.

213
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:41,737
I mean, the symptoms
you described

214
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,138
Sounded like
a severe reaction.

215
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:46,741
Ok, was it from
something he touched,
inhaled, or ate?

216
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,310
I don't know.
we'll have to wait

217
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:49,345
For the tox screen
to come back, but, uh,

218
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,280
The police think
he was poisoned.

219
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:52,314
Yeah, so does the ghost.

220
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:54,049
I mean, could his wife
have deliberately

221
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,285
Exposed him to something
that he was allergic to?

222
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:58,020
Absolutely,
but did she drag him

223
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,055
Down to that basement
by herself?

224
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,357
Actually, i overheard
the police saying

225
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:03,125
That he crawled
in there on his own.

226
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,126
In a $2,000 suit?

227
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,528
He was a realtor,
you know.

228
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,363
Maybe the building was
one of his listings,

229
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,665
Or maybe
he was there doing
some sort of inspection.

230
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,500
Whatever it is,
he's not coughing it up.

231
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:12,868
So to speak.

232
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,837
[p.a.] dr. travis,
you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

233
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:15,905
Eli?

234
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,139
No, delia.
i wanna see

235
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,642
If she can get me
the skinny on that
building. bye.

236
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,643
Bye.

237
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,977
Watch the magic ball.

238
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,879
Gus: i think
i've seen this one.

239
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,081
Well, it's a lovely
classic brownstone,

240
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,817
And it was sold twice
within the past few months.

241
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:29,951
So somebody flipped it?

242
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,120
Well, if they did,
they weren't very smart,

243
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,755
Because they took
a huge loss.

244
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,024
Well, did either
represent the buyer
or seller?

245
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,993
Mm-mmm. both transactions
were private.

246
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:41,863
It was sold by some company
named brokerage investments,

247
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:45,534
And before that, it was
purchased by arcmod limited.

248
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:49,104
I wonder if rita or kirk
have anything to do
with those companies.

249
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,840
Well, according to the chain
of title, they didn't,

250
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:55,043
But, you know, it's not
really hard to hide
those kind of things.

251
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,678
Abracadabra.
[snaps photo]

252
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:57,712
There's an open house
tomorrow,

253
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,281
A big property
that rita's listing.

254
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,383
I'm sure people from her work
are gonna be there.

255
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:02,417
I could go,
ask some questions,

256
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,718
[snaps photo]
see what they know.

257
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,353
Oh.
gus: let me guess.
the ball's disappeared,

258
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:07,589
And now it's
in your pocket.

259
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,592
That one's easy.

260
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,394
You know, it still
just doesn't explain

261
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,129
What kirk was doing
crawling around
in that basement.

262
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,331
That building
wasn't even for sale,

263
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,365
So he wouldn't have
had any interest in it.

264
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,868
Hey, check this out.

265
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,570
Cool.

266
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,905
Bet you can't do this.

267
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,215
Abracadabra.

268
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,351
Do that again.

269
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,653
Wow. he is good.

270
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,255
Really good.

271
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:41,323
Gus:
how'd you do that?

272
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,058
A magician
never tells.

273
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,759
Remember?

274
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,465
Well, that's weird.

275
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,466
Magic is weird.

276
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,934
No, no, no.
not that.

277
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,971
My camera. how did
these photographs
get here?

278
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:03,145
Because you just took them.

279
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,248
No. sorry.
i--i just saw rita
kissing another guy.

280
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,316
Oh, a guy that
wasn't kirk?

281
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:11,453
Yeah. um, i guess
there's a lot more
to the story

282
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,121
Than the ghost
is letting on.

283
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:14,122
I guess.

284
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,124
Oh, yeah.
you bet there is.

285
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,626
Rita was
cheating on you?

286
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:20,128
She's also plotting
with that hottie
on how they can

287
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:22,397
Get their hands
on my $2 million
life insurance policy.

288
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:23,932
That's why she killed me.

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,968
You cannot let her
get away with this.

290
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:42,005
Oh. thank you.

291
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:45,109
Mmm. hey...

292
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,644
Who was that guy
in the photo?

293
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,113
You know,
the one's kirk's wife's

294
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,014
Gonna be
spending all her
insurance money on.

295
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:52,316
I have no idea.

296
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:53,917
The pictures
that i saw vanished.

297
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,285
Otherwise,
delia would have known.

298
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,653
They all know each other.

299
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,555
Maybe mr. hottie
runs in that circle.

300
00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:00,491
I'm sorry. uh...

301
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:01,492
Mr. hottie?

302
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,826
Heh. i only call him that

303
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,161
Because he has
a certain appeal.

304
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:07,464
Wow. that's how it goes,
huh? all right.

305
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:09,400
Yeah, i guess
you couldn't ask
his wife, uh,

306
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,034
"who's this guy you're
makin' out with?" right?

307
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:13,103
Uh, no, not this time.

308
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:14,772
No. melinda,
i don't think this is

309
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,374
The kind of woman
you're gonna wanna
back into a corner.

310
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:21,111
If she did it,
which i don't know if she did.

311
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,846
Really? why?
well, first of all,

312
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,915
Kirk isn't really sure
how he died.

313
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,451
Wait. his bout with
anaphylactic shock's
not specific enough?

314
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,452
If that's what killed him.

315
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,720
Oh, no,
i checked my e-mail.

316
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:30,921
It did.
i'm sure of it.

317
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:32,756
They haven't exactly
found the allergen yet,

318
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:33,924
But they're
gonna find out.

319
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,426
Ok, so then what?

320
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,894
Well, the police'll
check his medical
history, right,

321
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,129
And then they'll
go and see if she knew
about the allergy

322
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,597
And then
purposely exposed him
to the substance.

323
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,132
You know,
i have to admit it.

324
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,867
Maybe he didn't know
how she did it,

325
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:45,803
But why is he
so sure that she did?

326
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,438
'cause of the affair.

327
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,440
Which he didn't
tell me about,

328
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:52,075
Which is weird,
because i think he knew.

329
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:54,645
Hmm. wait.
don't you get all your
visions through him?

330
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:55,913
Not necessarily.

331
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,081
Sometimes i can see things
that ghosts don't intend,

332
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:59,783
But he wasn't
surprised by the photos.

333
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:02,319
He was just angry and smug,
like he was kind of happy

334
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:03,821
That all the details
were coming out.

335
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:07,090
Yeah, the details
that'll nail her,
right? justice.

336
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:08,091
Yeah, or revenge.

337
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,060
Is this aiden's?

338
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:11,061
Yeah, it is.

339
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,263
This is part
of his magic kit.

340
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,565
This is
his on-the-go,

341
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:15,899
Traveling
bag of tricks.

342
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,068
You know, he--he was
doing a trick today

343
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:21,004
Where he moved the ball
from one hand to the other,

344
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:22,172
And you were helping
him with that, right?

345
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,307
Did you--
did you teach him that?

346
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,308
No.

347
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,677
Well, then where
did he learn it?

348
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,879
Ah, maybe his friends
or tv or...

349
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,515
The book has
illustrations.

350
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:35,419
You think he got
some ghostly help?

351
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,421
It's possible.

352
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,989
Ah, speaking of help,
hold on.

353
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:40,657
No, no, no.
it's fine. relax.

354
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,977
[gasps] oh, my god.

355
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,411
Oh, my god.

356
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,080
Honey, what is it?
eww.

357
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,481
Wh-what--
there were these--

358
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,688
I sw--i swear i...

359
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:13,023
I know. i know.

360
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,024
Delia: intestines?

361
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,559
What the hell
do those mean?

362
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,628
That he hates her guts.
funny.

363
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:20,497
I don't understand.
i mean, usually
when i get a vision,

364
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,833
It's something
that the ghost
wants me to feel.

365
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:24,701
Yeah, or torture you with.

366
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,403
Well,
there's always that.
but you know what?

367
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:28,305
I have done everything
that this ghost asked me.

368
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,240
I mean, i've even been
helping with the police.

369
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:31,708
How are you doing that?
through jim.

370
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:33,977
You know, i don't
think the coroner
would have even thought

371
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,879
To look for allergens if
jim hadn't mentioned it.

372
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:37,915
Ok, about that,
didn't you say

373
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:39,716
That kirk died
from some exposure to mold?

374
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,185
Yeah. they just
found out he's allergic
to a certain strain.

375
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:44,221
Ok, well, that's interesting,

376
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:47,658
Because this building had mold.
it's in the report.

377
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,893
You know the inspections
that you get

378
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:52,696
Every time that you're
gonna buy a house?
mm-hmm.

379
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:55,232
Well, nowadays almost everybody
has these inspections done,

380
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,200
Since an entire industry
kind of sprung up

381
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,902
Convincing people
that it could kill you.

382
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,138
Uh, in this case,
it did.

383
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,439
Well, usually it's harmless,

384
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:05,108
But not something
that people wanna deal with.

385
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:08,912
Maybe that's why the building
flipped ownership so fast.

386
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:12,382
There's lots
of different
kinds of molds.

387
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,817
What are you lookin' for?

388
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,185
Well, here it is.
"aflatoxin."

389
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,186
Jim called earlier.

390
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,521
This is what
killed kirk.

391
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:18,855
Who would have
gotten this?

392
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:21,558
Um, the realtors
who handled the sale,

393
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,226
The owner, and the buyer,

394
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,761
Would rita
have seen it?

395
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:26,930
I mean, it's possible.
it's just something

396
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:30,400
That the seller has
to disclose to the buyer,
but she was neither.

397
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,502
So that would mean
she would have to know

398
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,071
Exactly what
he was allergic to

399
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,740
And then scour
every building listing
looking for a building

400
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:38,342
With that exact
kind of mold.

401
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,943
Come on.
that's a little nutty.

402
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:40,944
Or genius.

403
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,613
It's the perfect crime.

404
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,648
She let me
right into a trap.

405
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,083
How did she do that?

406
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,584
I was supposed to
meet her there that day.

407
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:48,819
Under the building?

408
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:49,920
Well, maybe she, uh--

409
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:51,722
I don't know--
moved my--moved my body.

410
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,190
The police said
that your body
was never moved.

411
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:54,524
Did you tell them
everything that you know?

412
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:56,059
Did you tell them everything
that i told you?

413
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,427
Uh, more than i'm
comfortable with.

414
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:58,895
Look, i know that
you're angry with her,

415
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:00,364
But this is your wife
we're talking about.

416
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:01,632
Why would she
do this to you?

417
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,834
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

418
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,069
Probably because
you never answer any.

419
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,171
And what was with
the entrails?

420
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,440
What? wh-what are you
talking about? what--

421
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,342
How'd you find out
about that?

422
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,677
Oh, you didn't mean
for me to see them?

423
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,846
I thought all you cared about
was bringing me peace.

424
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:17,648
[bell rings]

425
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,150
Rita jansen
was taken in
by the police.

426
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,619
Right. you see?
she did it. i was right.

427
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,354
Oh. hey, kirk.

428
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:26,490
Was she placed
under arrest?

429
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,425
No. officially she's
a person of interest.

430
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:29,493
The cops are
all over her.

431
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,028
They found
some incriminating
photographs.

432
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,596
I was just
with detective blair.
i saw them.

433
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:34,031
They were taken by
a private investigator.

434
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,866
See? i knew she was
lying about something,

435
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,234
And when i saw
those photos--

436
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:39,036
Establishes motive.
they just have
to prove means.

437
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:40,937
You have to show them
the mold report.

438
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,372
She had to know
about that.

439
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,840
She had to--
you don't know that.

440
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:45,075
You know what i know?

441
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,743
I know that rita's
gonna hate jail,

442
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:48,945
And for the first time
since my trachea shut

443
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:51,515
And my tongue
got as big as your shoe,

444
00:16:51,582 --> 00:16:53,083
I'm feeling a little peace.

445
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,825
Police are questioning rita now.
you can't just barge in there.

446
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,894
I'm not. what's the name
of the detective
who took those photos?

447
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,529
Nick. nick sexton.
delia's gonna call you

448
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:09,997
With the address.
what's the rush?

449
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,599
I just need to find out
what was going on
in that marriage

450
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,168
Before rita
says anything
to incriminate herself.

451
00:17:14,235 --> 00:17:15,736
It's a little
too late for that.

452
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:17,471
Here.

453
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,839
This is what
you saw, right?

454
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:19,840
Yeah. that's it.

455
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,208
Well, the cops
saw it, too.

456
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:23,243
When they get ahold
of that mold report,

457
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:24,678
It's not gonna
look good for her.

458
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:26,079
Wait. what's this?

459
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,914
I didn't see
this picture.

460
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,749
That's the brownstone
where kirk died.

461
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,051
The ghost said
she lured him there.

462
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,285
Could this be
what he meant?

463
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:35,255
Maybe the p.i. wasn't
the only one following rita.

464
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,656
Maybe kirk was going
to confront her.

465
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,225
In a crawl space?

466
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,360
You really won't let go
of that crawl space, will you?

467
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,095
It's the only thing
he can't explain away.

468
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:43,463
What do you mean?

469
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,632
His story keeps
changing every time
we find something new.

470
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,400
Well, if she didn't
do it, who did?

471
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:49,136
Mold spores,
as far as i know.

472
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,770
At first, it was all,
"i'm sad, and i'm lost,

473
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,339
And i can't believe
she'd try to kill me,"

474
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,441
And then the next thing,
he was admitting that
she had cheated.

475
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,009
Guess it's all just
a part of his motive.

476
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:57,110
Because he hated her.

477
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:58,778
I'm just not sure
how much.

478
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,680
Maybe enough
to frame her.

479
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,682
How are you
gonna undo that?

480
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,017
I don't know.

481
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,921
And i started doing magic
when i was 9.

482
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,055
I thought that was young.

483
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,423
How long have
you been practicing?

484
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,491
Aiden: few days.

485
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,993
You've already outgrown
your magic kit?

486
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,562
I think it's 'cause
his friends have
seen all his tricks,

487
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,197
And he's just
looking for new ones.

488
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:18,465
Like these.

489
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,134
Wait. you've mastered
every one of those tricks?

490
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:23,136
You wanna see
a mind-reading trick?

491
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,338
Ok, kid. sure.

492
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:32,179
Turn around and write
down any word you want.

493
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,014
All right.

494
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:42,022
All right. i'm ready.

495
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:44,658
Turtle.

496
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:48,862
That's awesome.

497
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,898
Wait a minute. buddy,
how did--how did
you just do that?

498
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:54,534
Are there some mirrors
back there?

499
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,336
Wait. did you guys
just exchange
a magician's code word?

500
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:58,004
No. really.

501
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,408
Can i look
at some more stuff?

502
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,576
Yeah. yeah. go ahead.

503
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,914
That's incredible.

504
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,249
Yeah, it is incredible,

505
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:12,485
Especially since
he can't even read yet.

506
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:15,689
Yeah, we have
all the listings
you asked for.

507
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,691
Hi. ok, sure,
we'll get right on it.

508
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,659
Thank you, bye.

509
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:20,727
Rita.

510
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,495
Hello, delia.

511
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,331
Wh-what's goin' on?
what are you doing here?

512
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:27,500
Well, i hear you've been
asking around about
some of my listings.

513
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,035
You did?

514
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,338
Sidling up to every
agent in my office.

515
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,906
The faylans' open house.

516
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,975
Just so you know,
i'm still in the game.

517
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,510
I haven't missed
a single showing
since the day kirk died.

518
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:40,013
You think i'm poaching
your listings?

519
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,281
I'm a highly
functioning person.

520
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,016
I'm hardly undone
by my husband's death.

521
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,252
Oh, and don't
be going after
his listings either.

522
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,987
His clients know me,
and they trust me.

523
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,458
Would you, uh, mind
going and finding

524
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,294
The, uh, parkside paperwork?
mm-hmm.

525
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:55,829
Yeah, and just, um--

526
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:59,266
Just take your time
till you find it.

527
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,436
Rita, i swear
to you i am not trying
to get your business

528
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,772
Or kirk's. i was...

529
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:11,444
I was asking about you
because i was concerned

530
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:14,547
And, ok,
because i'm nosy.

531
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,249
Well, that, i buy.

532
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:17,951
Why don't you come
and sit down?

533
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,886
You look like
you've had a bad day.

534
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,888
You have no idea.

535
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,295
They think i did it.

536
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,729
Who? the police?

537
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,464
And it is so unfair.

538
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,133
I know, honey.
it must be awful.

539
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,103
Because now i'm gonna
have to wait so long
and act all broken up

540
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,105
Before i get on
with my life,

541
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,675
Assuming i'm not serving
a life sentence, i mean.

542
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,145
I--i just don't want
people to think i'm cold.

543
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,781
I know. we seemed like
the perfect couple.

544
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,317
We did, didn't we?

545
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:53,586
Yes. of course.

546
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:54,587
Perfect.

547
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,356
But we weren't.

548
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,459
You're a widow, right?

549
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:02,696
Um, yes. mm-hmm.

550
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,264
Well, how long
did you wait?

551
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:07,467
I mean, how long
were you off the market

552
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,469
Before you started
dating again?

553
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,138
A long time.

554
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,473
Was it difficult

555
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,376
Finding someone
you clicked with,
who was your equal?

556
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:18,144
Yes.

557
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm gonna give you
some free advice.

558
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:21,948
Date anyone.

559
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,616
Just have fun.

560
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:26,152
Only, don't get caught up
in something that could--

561
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,320
That could destroy you.

562
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:31,891
Passion, it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

563
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,567
I didn't work
for kirk for long,

564
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,035
Just a couple
of weeks,

565
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,570
Usually as
an independent
contractor--

566
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,438
Or private
investigator,
as you say.

567
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:46,806
But don't worry.
no offense.

568
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:47,874
What a relief.

569
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,276
Uh, normally i don't
share the details

570
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:51,611
Of my employment
with anyone.

571
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,346
Well, you talked
to the police.
thank you.

572
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:55,382
Well, so it's, uh,
public record.

573
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:56,416
I guess.

574
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:58,718
You said you were
a friend of rita's?

575
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,286
I'm just trying
to find out

576
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:02,355
What went on between
her and her husband.

577
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,224
Well, maybe it's better
you don't know.

578
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,859
It's not gonna
help her case.

579
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:06,993
Because she was
seeing another man?

580
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,095
No, because she
hated her husband.

581
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,764
The other man thing,
those things happen.

582
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:14,100
Look, what i'm trying
to say is it's one thing
to have an affair.

583
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,269
It's another to throw it
in your husband's face.

584
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:18,671
So if kirk knew, then
why did he hire you?

585
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,206
Well, he wasn't sure
at first,

586
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:22,041
But she got onto me
pretty quick.

587
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,577
Look. let me show you.

588
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:26,546
Heh heh. yeah.

589
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:29,649
Yeah, let me show you
the whole picture.

590
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,651
Is that rita
flipping you the--

591
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,652
And then some.

592
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,521
Yeah, she knew
i was working for kirk,

593
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,423
But she just kept on
seein' that guy.

594
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,791
So why didn't
she leave him?

595
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,192
Why didn't he leave her?

596
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,861
Look, by the time i met him,
he was sick of her, too.

597
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,898
But they had a business
together, reputations to keep.

598
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,534
Neither one wanted
to be perceived as the bad guy,

599
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,036
But really,
nobody wanted to lose.

600
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,204
Lose what?

601
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:52,639
This weird game
that they had started

602
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,241
Of hurtin' each other.
it was like a competition.

603
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,578
The stuff that they
came up with was very inventive,

604
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:01,047
But sickening,

605
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:02,315
Disgusting.

606
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:06,719
Did any of their games
involve intestines?

607
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,455
Oh, you heard about that?

608
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:10,256
Oh ho!
that was vintage kirk

609
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:14,294
He put entrails
into a refrigerator
at one of her open houses.

610
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,563
Yeah, i bet she didn't
sell any condos that day.

611
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,997
Heh heh heh heh.

612
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,667
But i bet she didn't tell you
how it came on, though,

613
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,302
Her little
stroke of genius,

614
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,770
The shrimp incident.

615
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:24,771
The shrimp incident?

616
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,140
Yeah. yeah, kirk had
this huge property,

617
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,975
All right?
a--a total mcmansion.

618
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:33,413
So she sneaks in
and sews raw shrimp
into the custom drapes.

619
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,514
Ohh...

620
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,783
Man, it took days
to find the smell.

621
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,351
By then, the stench
was so bad,

622
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,186
The owners just
took it off the market.

623
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,921
Do you think
that she could have
actually killed him?

624
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:44,824
To be honest, he could have
just as easily have killed her.

625
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:47,360
Look, this thing
wasn't gonna end

626
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,395
Until they both
woke up and realized

627
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:51,097
That they had married
the perfect--

628
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:53,366
And i mean perfect--
person for each other

629
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:54,801
Or one of 'em
ended up dead.

630
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,338
And maybe
not even then.

631
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,874
Yeah, it was hell.
the police kept
at me for hours.

632
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,976
My lawyer kept
telling me to shut up.

633
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:06,079
No, i don't know
when i'm gonna be back
in the office,

634
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:09,749
But the party line
is that i am on top
of all my listings,

635
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:11,384
Even if i'm in jail.

636
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:14,020
No, i'm not joking.
it's entirely possible.

637
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:15,355
Listen, i'm exhausted,

638
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:17,357
And i might
get arrested tomorrow.

639
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:18,758
I've gotta go.

640
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,434
[sighing]

641
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:30,503
[moaning]

642
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,135
Aah!

643
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,741
[winces]

644
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,810
[gasping]

645
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,485
Hi, rita.
melinda.

646
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,337
So nice to meet you.

647
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,239
Thanks for coming by.

648
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,907
Well, anything for
a friend of delia's.

649
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,842
This is a lovely home.

650
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,811
Great curb appeal.

651
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,579
We're not gonna have
any problem selling it.

652
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:34,281
Great.

653
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:35,349
Come on in.

654
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,817
Thank you.

655
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,621
Um, i hope you don't
mind me asking,

656
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:41,955
But are you ok?

657
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:44,124
Oh, for someone who's been
in a thousand homes,

658
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,093
You'd think i'd know
my own well enough

659
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,828
Not to trip over
my bathroom scale.

660
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,396
Is that really
all that happened?

661
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,565
Did i mention
i fell into my mirror?

662
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,236
Look, i'm gonna
be honest with you.

663
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,904
I'm not selling my house.

664
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:01,441
I wanted to talk to you because
i think that you need my help.

665
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,110
With what?

666
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:04,411
Whatever hurt you last night

667
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,514
Is the same thing that got you
in trouble with the police,

668
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,983
And i believe
it's your husband kirk.

669
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,486
Kirk? i'm--my lawyer
doesn't want me
discussing that.

670
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:15,088
That's because he's trying
to keep you out of jail,

671
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,290
But jail is gonna be
the least of your problems

672
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,292
If we don't fix things
with your husband.

673
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,527
Oh, my husband is dead.

674
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:21,828
But he's not gone.

675
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:23,163
I beg your pardon?

676
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,967
I have a gift.

677
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:28,135
I see spirits.

678
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:29,836
They have
unfinished business,

679
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:32,105
And i've talked
to your husband.

680
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,306
Really?

681
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,542
I know that it's hard
to believe, but trust me.

682
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,511
This is just the beginning,

683
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:40,147
Because he thinks
that you murdered him,

684
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:41,848
And he is gonna continue
to punish you

685
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,851
Until we can find
a way to make peace
for the two of you.

686
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,453
I-is he here right now?

687
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,156
No, but he's never
very far, so we don't
have a lot of time.

688
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:50,991
Heh. i should have known

689
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,993
The minute
i saw those shrimp.

690
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,729
Ok, well, maybe if you
could just tell me
what went wrong--

691
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:57,798
Are you gonna see kirk
anytime soon?

692
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,267
Great, because i'd
like you to give him
this message for me.

693
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:05,572
Please tell that
fluffed-up money-pit
hole in the ground

694
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,574
I hope he burns in hell.

695
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,843
Oh, that probably
isn't the best idea.

696
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:12,746
Uh, kirk, you wanna
haunt me that bad,
bring it on.

697
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,315
Uh, also probably
not the wisest choice.

698
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,617
Wait. you really
wanna know what
went wrong with us?

699
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:19,719
Kirk cheated
in his career,

700
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:21,154
And he cheated
in our marriage.

701
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,289
He had p.i.s
following me around,

702
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:24,324
Taking my picture
all over town,

703
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,126
But he was the one
who stepping out.

704
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,395
Bet he didn't bother to
tell you that, did he?

705
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,769
[door closes]

706
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:38,905
It's like i was a part
of a reality show.

707
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:41,741
I mean, why else would
anyone talk about their
husband that way? ooh.

708
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,243
And her dead husband,
no less.

709
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:44,611
Ok, i hate
to say it,
but it looks

710
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:45,612
Like they've
picked up the fight

711
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
Just where
they left it off.

712
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,081
I mean,
if that p.i.'s
tellin' the truth.

713
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:49,182
I think he was,

714
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,984
At least, if you go by
what they're saying

715
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,586
On the caravans and
at the open houses

716
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:54,354
And what rita told me.

717
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,858
It turns out there
was trouble in camelot
long before kirk died.

718
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:00,227
Did anything happen
to trigger the change?

719
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,028
The golden key happened.

720
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,263
What, that goofy
sales award?

721
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:05,132
I mean that really
cool sales award.

722
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:07,567
No, he's right.
it is goofy.

723
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:11,705
I mean, it's not even
an award for merit
or skill or character.

724
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,340
No, it's just
the person who has

725
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:14,374
The highest sales,
right?

726
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,775
Yeah. i mean,
i don't even understand

727
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:16,977
Why anybody even
cares about it.

728
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:19,379
You know,
until i win one.

729
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,382
God, i really just wanna
take one of those babies home.

730
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,584
I guess rita wanted
to win one, too.

731
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:26,753
Yeah, and she probably
deserved to get one,

732
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:29,022
But he put his name
on enough of her listings,

733
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,925
And they say that he took credit
for a lot of her sales.

734
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:33,493
Why would she
let him do that?

735
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:34,628
They were partners,
you know?

736
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:36,897
She had her name
on some of his listings,

737
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:39,166
But after the golden key,
you just started seeing

738
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,935
His name on more and more
of the deals without hers.

739
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,504
You know, i just assumed
it was marketing,

740
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:46,673
That they both
agreed to it.

741
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,441
Ok, she was jealous
of his new high profile.

742
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:51,211
But, i mean, i gotta
say that's still not a
reason to kill somebody.

743
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,512
Uh, she said
he was cheating

744
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,047
In their marriage
and in their business.

745
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:55,782
Oh, well.
did kirk ever
mention anybody else?

746
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,185
No. he never stuck around
long enough

747
00:28:58,252 --> 00:29:00,353
To do anything but
throw accusations at her.

748
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:03,623
You know what?
i do have those photos
that the p.i. took,

749
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,691
You know,
with the other man.

750
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,959
I mean,
eli mailed them to me.

751
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:07,060
Yeah, let me
look at 'em.

752
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,795
Maybe it's somebody
in the biz.

753
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,263
Do you mean
mr. hottie?

754
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,264
Oh, my god.

755
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,934
Everybody
knows this guy.

756
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,268
That's javier torres.

757
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,038
He's the mortgage officer
over at the savings and loan.

758
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,373
You can't do a deal
without him.

759
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,943
And honestly,
who would want to?

760
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,012
Rumor is, he's quite
the ladies man.
hmm.

761
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,714
This is your
monthly payment now,

762
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:29,382
And this is your
estimated payment

763
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,318
With the new
lower rate.

764
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:33,987
God, you make it
sound so simple.

765
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:36,456
I am just hopeless
with numbers.

766
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,225
Oh, i don't
believe that.

767
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,926
It's lovely
for you to say that.

768
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:42,862
Very lovely.

769
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:44,998
What?

770
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,132
[stammering]

771
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,402
Uh, i was--i was
just saying that--

772
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,039
That i don't--
i don't know anything
about real estate

773
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:57,377
Except--you know,
i hate to gossip
about the dead,

774
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,679
But you knew kirk, right,

775
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:00,680
And rita?

776
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:02,349
Yeah, it was very sad.

777
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,651
And with the police
involved now, too...

778
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,319
How well
did you know them?

779
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,687
They brought
business to me,

780
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:09,022
Especially rita.

781
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,724
Hmm.

782
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,761
It wasn't like that.

783
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:16,796
Rita and i only got
to know each other well

784
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:18,832
When she came
to me to finance
her own purchase.

785
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,100
What was the purchase?

786
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,701
She was buying
a brownstone.

787
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,737
It was a stretch
for her on her own,

788
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:25,572
So i helped her out
with the terms.

789
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:27,741
On her own?

790
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,709
So her husband wasn't
involved in the purchase?

791
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,878
That would
defeat the purpose.

792
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:33,546
What was the purpose?

793
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,882
The building
was supposed
to be a surprise

794
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,883
For him.

795
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,785
See, they'd always
talked about

796
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,520
Starting a bakery
together,

797
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,890
An escape from
the real estate
rat race.

798
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,026
"supposed to be a surprise."
so did he know that?

799
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,360
I mean, what happened?

800
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,162
I don't know.
i just know

801
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,664
That she suddenly
changed her mind.

802
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:54,367
She came to me, and
she begged me to take
the place off her hands.

803
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,336
I couldn't afford
what she paid,

804
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:59,272
So i made a low offer.
and she jumped.

805
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,507
Look, i felt bad,

806
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,909
But she said
i saved her life.

807
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,678
Why would she sell so fast?

808
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:05,979
I don't know
that either.

809
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,814
But it turns out
she didn't get

810
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,983
Such a bad price
from me after all,

811
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:11,551
Because right after
i took possession,

812
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,453
They found toxic mold
in the basement.

813
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:16,056
So she didn't know
about the mold?

814
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:18,892
If i thought she did,
i would have sued her.

815
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:22,729
But the report
wasn't released
till after the closing.

816
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,699
If she didn't know
about the mold, then she
couldn't have killed him.

817
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:26,766
Excuse me?

818
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,644
[gasps]

819
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,182
What?
my best clothes!

820
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,860
Unbelievable.

821
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,195
Aah! god.

822
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,534
There's more
where that came from.

823
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:05,071
You should check
every toilet in the house.

824
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,506
Sorry. some got stuck.

825
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,575
So that woman was right.

826
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:10,276
If you're really here.

827
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,045
Mm-hmm.

828
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,848
Well, i'm glad.

829
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:17,517
Because there's
something i'd
like you to see.

830
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:18,585
What?

831
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,423
Ah.

832
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,658
This is the first
house you sold.

833
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,894
The new gates
community, remember.

834
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:28,928
Oh, but wait.

835
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,131
Wasn't i the one
that found the buyer

836
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:32,799
Over at cliff daly's
open house?

837
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,901
And somehow you got
all the credit.

838
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:36,035
I don't think
this belongs

839
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:38,238
On the leader board,
do you?

840
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:40,006
[grunting]

841
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:43,009
Oh, and the east river
development.

842
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,011
The investor that
tipped the scale,

843
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,713
Making you
the community leader.

844
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,615
Sorry. my doing.

845
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:51,017
Not yours.

846
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:54,587
I will not watch you
wreck everything i built!

847
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:56,356
This is fun!

848
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,759
I'm warning you!

849
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,094
Aah!

850
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,962
Oh, i'm--i'm sorry.

851
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,197
You don't
like me smashing

852
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:07,267
All your undeserved,
unearned smarmy awards?

853
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:08,701
Ok.

854
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,603
I'll just have to smash
something else.

855
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,238
What--rita.
rita. rita.

856
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,174
No. rita! don't!
[grunting]

857
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:15,775
Rita, don't do it.

858
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:17,343
Rita, stop!

859
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:19,345
Rita!

860
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,014
Stop it!

861
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:23,016
No, no, no, no.
calm--calm down.
calm--calm down.

862
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,318
Rita! calm down.
don't do it.
don't do it!

863
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,023
Oh, is that you,
dumpling?

864
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,324
Oh, god.

865
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,227
You're not
feeling very happy
right now, are you?

866
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:36,863
Then why do
i feel so good?!

867
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,164
Rita! rita!

868
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:40,800
[grunting]

869
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:43,636
All right, say good-bye
to everything
you've ever loved!

870
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,805
Rita, don't! don't--
don't do it!
aah!

871
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:53,152
Thanks for calling.

872
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,422
You said
there's something
you need us to see?

873
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,757
[gasps] oh, my god.

874
00:33:57,824 --> 00:34:00,426
It's the golden key.
can i hold it?

875
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:05,531
Oh, look how it shimmers.
you just bask in its glow.

876
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,599
[sighs]
all right.

877
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,234
Deep breath.
your day will come.

878
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:09,735
Why did you want us
to see this?

879
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:10,936
Read
the inscription.

880
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:12,238
"realtor of the year,

881
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:14,306
Kirk jansen
and rita jansen."

882
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:15,841
Why is her name on it?

883
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,543
Look closer
at the engraving.

884
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:22,248
The "rita jansen"
is new.

885
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,849
You think kirk
added her name?

886
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,484
I mean, why would
he do that?

887
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:26,652
Yeah. what's it
doing here?

888
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,854
My workmen
found it under
the crawl space.

889
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:30,990
They dropped
a drill bit
through this hole,

890
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:33,225
And when they went
to look for it,

891
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:35,995
They saw this thing
glittering straight
underneath us.

892
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:37,763
He must have
followed her here.

893
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:38,964
And lost the award

894
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:41,467
Just like the workers
lost the drill bit

895
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:43,002
And then went down
to get it.

896
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,937
And that's when he got
too close to the mold.

897
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:47,173
So do you think
that this award

898
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,775
Was a peace offering
from him to her?

899
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:52,511
Yeah, just like this building
was supposed to be
from her to him.

900
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,915
So they were actually
trying to make up with
each other,

901
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:57,950
And neither of them
knows it.

902
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:00,119
[sighs] all right.
i'll explain everything to rita.

903
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:02,788
You know, i tried calling her,
but she didn't answer.

904
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:04,390
I think you should
try and find her.

905
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,458
Ok.

906
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:10,029
Let go.

907
00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:12,865
Ok.

908
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:13,899
Now i'm fine.

909
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:15,167
Ok.

910
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,887
Rita.

911
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:42,394
[gasps] rita,
what did you do?

912
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:45,364
Little overkill maybe,
but...

913
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:46,699
I made my point.

914
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,868
[sighs] is kirk here?

915
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,903
I think he went
looking for glue.

916
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:54,907
It didn't have to go
this way, the destruction--

917
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:56,208
Oh, yes, it did.

918
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:57,276
He had it coming.

919
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,778
You didn't always
feel that way.

920
00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:00,880
I know about the brownstone
that you bought him.

921
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:02,248
Because i'm an idiot.

922
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:03,582
I thought he changed.

923
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,850
What do you mean?

924
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:06,085
Kirk's
a good-looking guy.

925
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:08,554
He always got
lots of attention
from women.

926
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:10,456
I mean, i got attention
from men, too,

927
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:13,425
But we both knew
we used it for business.

928
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:14,860
After the award,
he gave me

929
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:16,762
Some speech
about leveraging
all the attention,

930
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,130
Like it was
just business,

931
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:20,699
But he loved the glory.

932
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:22,902
He started
colisting properties

933
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:25,204
With female agents,
attractive ones,

934
00:36:25,272 --> 00:36:27,373
So i started pulling
listings from him.

935
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,775
And that's when
the feud started.

936
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:31,577
I canceled one
of his open houses.

937
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:32,845
He canceled
one of mine.

938
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:34,113
The next thing you knew,

939
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,948
I was sewing shrimp
into the curtains.

940
00:36:36,016 --> 00:36:38,951
I will never
touch scampi again.

941
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,553
But you knew
it had to stop.

942
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,255
Which is why
i bought the brownstone.

943
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:45,958
It was
a peace offering.

944
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:48,294
We'd met in a bakery,

945
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:50,296
And we always talked
about having one.

946
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,832
And all i got
for my efforts

947
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:54,166
Was a fistful
of entrails

948
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,335
And a p.i. who tracked
my every move.

949
00:36:56,403 --> 00:36:59,104
Do you know i think
he was planning
to divorce me?

950
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,874
I think you're wrong
about that.

951
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,547
He had it re-engraved--
oh.

952
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:09,682
Just a few days ago
i think he was trying

953
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,016
To give it to you
before he died.

954
00:37:11,084 --> 00:37:12,251
No, no. it's a trick.

955
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,253
He was planning to pull
the rug out. i'm sure.

956
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:15,921
The first thing
i learned in this business

957
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:17,189
Is if someone
doesn't trust you,

958
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,190
You can't trust them.

959
00:37:18,258 --> 00:37:20,593
Do you know how many
hours he spent

960
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,127
In cars and houses
with beautiful,
rich women?

961
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:24,029
Of course
he didn't want me
to be with him.

962
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:27,032
And i did it all for you,
you lying, cheating--

963
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,968
Ah-ah--
yeah, it takes
one to know one,

964
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:32,938
You--you sad,
pathetic,
egomaniacal--

965
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:35,174
W-wait a minute.

966
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:36,442
You're dead.

967
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:38,010
Funny you should notice,
considering you killed me.

968
00:37:38,078 --> 00:37:40,446
Well, how can
i see you?

969
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:43,782
I was trying to find
a way to tell you.

970
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,651
Uh, you died.

971
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,586
You didn't have to.

972
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
The light table.

973
00:37:57,564 --> 00:38:00,032
The metal golf club
must have touched
a wire.

974
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:01,567
I electrocuted
myself.

975
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,770
And you didn't realize
that he was trying
to make it up to you.

976
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:06,271
What?
y-you see?

977
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:07,706
I'm--i'm a good guy.

978
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,308
And you should have
trusted your wife.

979
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,176
She didn't kill you.
she didn't even know
about the mold.

980
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:12,611
Hmm.

981
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,679
What are you
talking about?

982
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:15,214
[sighs] it was a gift,

983
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,616
The bakery that you
both had dreamt of.

984
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:21,486
You know, and then she
found out that you had
somebody following her,

985
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:24,690
And so she
got rid of it,
you know, out of anger,

986
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:27,693
And that was
before she even knew
about the mold report.

987
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,694
Is that true?

988
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:30,696
You couldn't
just trust me?

989
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:33,165
I--i always thought
the bakery was a dream,

990
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,666
Something
that we made up.

991
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:36,068
It was,

992
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:39,438
But isn't everything
until you decide
to make it real?

993
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:42,941
I feel terrible.

994
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:44,476
That means
everything i--

995
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:47,980
I made up all the--
all the mistrust,
the--the...

996
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:49,815
Uh...
suspicion.

997
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:52,417
The--the suspicion.
i--

998
00:38:52,485 --> 00:38:54,553
I got us
both killed. i...

999
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:57,422
I'm sorry, too.

1000
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,159
But look on the bright side.
it's not a teardown.

1001
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:02,394
Yeah.

1002
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:04,763
We're both still here.

1003
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:06,765
Yeah.

1004
00:39:08,234 --> 00:39:10,535
And you're partners,
right?

1005
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:12,437
Mm-hmm.

1006
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,239
Yeah.

1007
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:16,875
Oh, sorry.

1008
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:19,077
I still have
a bit of a charge.

1009
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:20,078
It'll pass.

1010
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:22,147
No, not for me.

1011
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:29,755
Do you smell that?

1012
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:35,127
Fresh baked bread.

1013
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:36,828
Heh.

1014
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:01,086
There's no way he
could have known that
the word was "turtle."

1015
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:03,155
I mean,
obviously i didn't
notice anything, but--

1016
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:04,523
You don't seem
very surprised.

1017
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,160
[sighs] why would i be?
i did that stuff as a kid.

1018
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:10,829
Wait. you conned
your friends with
ghost magic?

1019
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:13,999
Well, not that part,
but they did help me
with test answers.

1020
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:18,904
Ooh, and they would
always tell me when a boyfriend
was flirting with another girl.

1021
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,906
That is unfair.
you did that?

1022
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:22,240
Of course i did.

1023
00:40:22,308 --> 00:40:25,243
It was the only perk
to being a freak...

1024
00:40:25,311 --> 00:40:29,614
Until my grandmother
sat me down and explained
that it wasn't right.

1025
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:31,650
Hmm.

1026
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:35,320
Does that mean
it's time for us
to sit aiden down?

1027
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:37,522
Yeah. poor little guy.

1028
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:42,627
Ok. ready?

1029
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:45,364
Now take over.

1030
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:49,668
Heh heh.

1031
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:53,505
Gus is gonna
love this.

1032
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:55,207
Melinda: aiden.

1033
00:40:57,076 --> 00:40:58,210
We need to talk.

1034
00:40:58,277 --> 00:40:59,277
Am i in trouble?

1035
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:01,380
A little.

1036
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:03,682
What'd i do?

1037
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,750
Here's the thing.

1038
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:07,052
You have a mom

1039
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,654
Who can do things
that other moms can't.

1040
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:11,390
And you're a kid

1041
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:14,493
Who can do things
that other kids can't.

1042
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,495
But since those things
are secret--

1043
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:18,830
So you think
if i do tricks,

1044
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:20,832
They'll find out
our secret?

1045
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,769
No.

1046
00:41:23,836 --> 00:41:25,203
No, i just--

1047
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:26,938
I don't think it's fair.

1048
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:32,010
I don't understand.

1049
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:40,218
Ok, um...

1050
00:41:42,054 --> 00:41:46,691
Sometimes magic tricks
can be like lies.

1051
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:49,694
But it's ok
for a magician
to fool people,

1052
00:41:49,762 --> 00:41:52,364
Because they know
that they're being
fooled, right?

1053
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:54,499
Mm-hmm.
ok, but if you get help,

1054
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,303
Like from a--a ghost
or a shiny.

1055
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:01,206
Yeah. then
people don't know
that stuff's real.

1056
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,210
So it's like a lie.

1057
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:06,678
Yeah.

1058
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:10,715
Aiden, who helped you?

1059
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:13,785
Was it a ghost
or a shiny?

1060
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:15,420
It was a ghost.

1061
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:17,756
Which one?

1062
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:19,825
Different ghosts.

1063
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:22,427
There's a lot around.

1064
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,230
Yeah.

1065
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,865
I know.

1066
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,534
Sorry, mom.

1067
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:31,770
I promise i'll
never do it again.

1068
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,705
Hey...

1069
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:35,373
You're a good boy, aiden,

1070
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:37,275
And we trust you.

1071
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:40,779
[kiss]
you know that, right?

1072
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:41,947
Yeah.
all right.

1073
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,882
Let's get ready for bed.

1074
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,650
Can i play
some more?

1075
00:42:45,718 --> 00:42:47,586
Heh. all right.

1076
00:42:47,653 --> 00:42:50,655
5 minutes,
and then you
get ready for bed.

1077
00:42:53,526 --> 00:42:54,626
Love you, mom.

1078
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:57,829
Sleep tight, baby.

1079
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:01,299
Night, dad.

1080
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:05,270
All right, 5 minutes.

1081
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:07,606
[door closes]

1082
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:15,580
I don't like lying.

1083
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:16,581
I know,

1084
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:18,483
But it's important.

1085
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:20,185
No one can know i'm here.

1086
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:21,620
Why not?

1087
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:22,621
'cause...

1088
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:24,723
If they find out,

1089
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,691
Something bad
will happen.

1090
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:28,360
What?

1091
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:30,395
Something really bad.
