<i>Previously on
ghost whisperer...</i>

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,000
Melinda: there's a door in the
archives that leads to the tunnels.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,600
Wait a minute,
are you saying

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,900
What i think you're saying?

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,500
Let's have a baby.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,500
Oh! Oh, god,
i love you.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,500
Melinda: what?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,900
That's weird.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,900
There's six of us, but
there's only five shadows.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,600
Are you ok?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
Promise me something.
Anything.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,600
That no matter
how long it takes,

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
We never stop trying
to get pregnant.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
I promise.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,700
Ok. Even after we're pregnant,
we have to keep trying.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,500
Check the fine print. I think
it's in the wedding vows.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,400
Come on.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you think
that delia noticed

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700
I didn't have any wine
with dinner tonight?

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,500
No. I don't think
she did.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,800
But maybe you should
tell her we're trying.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,300
She is your best
friend, huh?

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
It's just such
a letdown, you know?

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,300
Every time it doesn't
happen, i-

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,700
I don't want
to let her down, too.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
Hey, it's gonna happen.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,300
We've only been
trying 4 months.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,100
I know.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Oh, no.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,800
Clancy, yeah.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,300
Right. Ok.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
I'll be there
in 5 minutes.

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,600
There's a multiple victim
fire at rockland university,

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,300
One of the office
buildings.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Did they which
office building?

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,600
No.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Jim: honey, i'm gonna go
check with the commander.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,800
Melinda: excuse me,
have you seen rick payne?

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,500
Professor payne?

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
Hey, what do we got?

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,400
Has anyone seen rick payne?

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,000
I have, but usually when i'm
standing in front of a mirror.

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,900
You're ok.
Yeah.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm more than ok. I mean,
ask around. You'll hear that-

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
So why the hell didn't
you answer your phone?!

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,300
Melinda, i talked you on
the telephone an hour ago!

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,800
I talked to you
inside my home.

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,700
What would make you think
that i was in that building?

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,600
Get the paddles
ready.

50
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh. The shadow thing.

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,500
You thought it was
a bad omen, huh?

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
You thought
my number was up.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
But i'm ok.
I'm here.

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,700
I should have
called you.

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,900
That's what a friend
would have done.

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,500
A friend would have
done more than that.

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,000
Jim: charging.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
What just happened?
Clear.

59
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Let's do it again.

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,200
Let's try 200.

61
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,100
Clear.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Nothing. Give me 360.

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,600
Jim: clear.
Clear.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,500
Jim: i see life.

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,100
Yes, we got him.

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
Yeah, he's responsive.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
I see life.

68
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,400
That's what i see.

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Check his blood
pressure, huh?

70
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,200
Man: please, help me out.

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Congratulations
on saving that guy.

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Nice job.
Well done.

73
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,300
Hi.

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,700
How long has this
been going on?

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Ever since he regained
consciousness.

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,100
Who is he?

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,900
His name's
eli james.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
He's a psychology
professor

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
With a therapy practice
at the university.

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
His office was in the
building that burned.

81
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Are his eyes ok?

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Yeah, it's just swelling
from the smoke.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,700
He's fine.

84
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,300
How long has he lived
in grandview?

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know. Why?

86
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
And so it caught me,
like, horrifically,

87
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,900
And then i-
Hi...

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,100
Eli, my name
is melinda gordon.

89
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh, uh...

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
Sorry if i don't
get up.

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,800
This is my friend fiona.

92
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,500
Hi.

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,400
Nice to meet you.

94
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,600
Should i know
that name?

95
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,200
We've never met before,

96
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,900
Which is... odd,
in a way.

97
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,100
Why? Are you in
the psych department?

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,300
No.

99
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,700
Gambler's anonymous?

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,900
No.
Wait.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
If you're that girl from
the electric shock study,

102
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Those electrodes
were not supposed to-

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,100
Ok, it's ok, eli,

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
I understand. I...

105
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,800
I can talk to them, too.

106
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,100
Talk to who?

107
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,100
Ghosts.

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
If you work
in the hospital,

109
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,000
This is definitely not
post-Trauma counseling protocol.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,700
No one told you.
Told me what?

111
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,700
You know what,
it's really better if i-

112
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,300
Told me what?

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Eli, fiona died

114
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,100
In that fire with you.

115
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,800
They couldn't bring her back,
i'm so sorry.

116
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,900
Where's fiona?

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
I just told you.

118
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,200
She's dead.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,100
Then who was i
talking to?

120
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,900
You were talking
to her ghost.

Ghost whisperer   s04e01</font>

124
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,200
So do you think he's
another one like you?

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
And that's what
brought him to grandview,

126
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,900
Like your mom and gabriel
and all those others?

127
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,200
I don't think so.

128
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,850
There's something
different about him.

129
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,350
I don't think he's here
for the same reasons i am.

130
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,050
And i'm guessing
that you're wishing

131
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,750
I wouldn't have
brought ned into this.

132
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,150
No, i-I wish i knew
how to participate,

133
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,050
But it's like you're speaking
some strange foreign language.

134
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,750
I understand the words,
but it all...

135
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,650
Adds up to gibberish.

136
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,750
So what do you know
about the ghost?

137
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,950
She was one of his patients.

138
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,350
They were caught
in the fire together.

139
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,850
He was revived.
I wish i knew more.

140
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,750
Yeah, like what they were doing
together in his office at 10 p.M.

141
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,450
Well, that part
i understood.

142
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,250
Melinda: hey.

143
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,250
Mind if i come in?

144
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,750
Melinda, hey.

145
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
How are you doing?

146
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,850
<i>You're asking me that?</i>

147
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
You're the one
with the ghost problem.

148
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,650
No, i'm the one with
post traumatic stress.

149
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,150
I lost a patient,
and in case you forgot,

150
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,550
I kinda died.

151
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,450
It takes a lot less to make
someone think you heard voices.

152
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,150
Sounds very rational.

153
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,750
Look, if this is a cry
for help, i can help you-

154
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,850
With your depression,
your anxiety.

155
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,850
Even your self-Esteem
issues.

156
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,050
But i gotta tell you,

157
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,050
I don't do well with
your type of nut job.

158
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,750
My type of nut job?

159
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,950
Yeah. Bizarre beliefs,
superstitious behavior.

160
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,550
People use that to hide
from their real problems, ok?

161
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,550
I don't have the patience,
you might say.

162
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,350
Wow. Is this the kind
of bedside manner

163
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,950
That they're teaching
these days?

164
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,350
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,350
I like
to keep it real.

166
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,350
So i take it you haven't
seen anymore ghosts?

167
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,450
Safe assumption.
That's a lie!

168
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,750
Really? You can see
through my eyes?

169
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,550
You're a mind reader now?

170
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,150
You're telling the truth.

171
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,350
I'm telling the truth,
i'm lying,

172
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,850
Make up your mind, lady.

173
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,050
You can't see them,
but you can hear them.

174
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,350
Say that again.

175
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,750
Why don't you tell him?

176
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,250
Whenever i talk to him, he shouts
at the nurses to quiet down,

177
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,150
Acting like
i'm not here.

178
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,850
But i know he hears me.

179
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,350
I can
see him reacting.

180
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,250
Why won't he
listen to me?

181
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,450
Because he doesn't want
to believe it.

182
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,250
Because if it's true
and he hears you,

183
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,550
Then he might be a nut job.

184
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,650
I think
we're done here, ok?

185
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,150
You can't just
shut them out.

186
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,650
It's only going
to get worse.

187
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,250
Look, i can help you.
Just please-

188
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,850
It's not just that he had
never heard ghosts before this.

189
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,150
I was there.
Ok, i saw eli's spirit

190
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,850
Leave his body
and then come back.

191
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,150
I've never seen
anything like it.

192
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,950
Oh, and that's why i'm
giving you these books.

193
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,350
These books cover all
of that and more, ok?

194
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,250
Paranormal phenomena, myths,
theories about the beyond.

195
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,650
You're all right.

196
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,950
How come everyone
is trying to get away from me?

197
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,250
Ah, finally,
the real issue,

198
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,450
Instead of this ghost story
that you're hiding behind.

199
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,850
Yeah, i have enough shrinks
in my life, thank you.

200
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,950
Melinda, i'm not a very
sensitive guy, ok?

201
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,150
It once took a girlfriend
6 months to break up with me

202
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,650
'Cause i thought she was
expressing disbelief

203
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,850
Every time she said,
"get out."

204
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,050
Even i can tell
you're upset.

205
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,650
I am not upset.

206
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,750
There is nothing about me
that is upset, ok?

207
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,850
You're leaving for a
sabbatical in a few days

208
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,450
For some new, important find
in the himalayas,

209
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,350
And i am very happy for you.
What more do you want?

210
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,550
I'm glad we had
this chat.

211
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,450
It was very refreshing,
cleansing.

212
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,150
You'd like to know why this
eli character, all of a sudden,

213
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,650
He can hear
ghosts, right?

214
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,850
Right. And it obviously
has something to do

215
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,550
With him dying
and then coming back.

216
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,550
It has everything
to do with that.

217
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,850
N.D.E. Literature is chock
full of stories like his.

218
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,050
N.D.E., you mean
near death experience?

219
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,450
Yeah. Uh, here's how
it usually works-

220
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,850
You die,
you come back to life,

221
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,650
And in some
very rare cases,

222
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,650
There's a, uh, a thread

223
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,350
That connects you
to where you were,

224
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,050
A tether,
if you will.

225
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,550
So how come he can hear ghosts
but he can't see them?

226
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,250
Some n.D.E.S can
see the ghosts,

227
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,550
Some can hear them,
some can even smell them,

228
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,350
And that's the worst because
everything on the other side

229
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,350
Smells like stinky,
rotten eggs.

230
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,250
Ugh. And that's permanent?

231
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,450
It varies, it varies.

232
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,950
Sometimes your senses
got strong

233
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,450
As your brain processes
the new input,

234
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,850
Other times
the thread snaps,

235
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,350
And you're just a poor,
sightless mole like me.

236
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,450
Your friend eli, not
universally liked here at school.

237
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,750
Who doesn't like him?

238
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,150
A lot of people.

239
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,850
But most of members of the "i
don't like that guy eli" fan club

240
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,250
Are in his own
department.

241
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,650
They think he's a bit
of a cowboy.

242
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,250
Breaks a lot of rules,

243
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,150
Which normally i would applaud... but?

244
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,750
But they say he does so at
the expense of his patients.

245
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,750
You keep thinking
every new day

246
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,250
Will be different,

247
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,950
But it never is.

248
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,550
Day after day-

249
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,550
Buddy?

250
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,950
After day-
Buddy.

251
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,450
After day-

252
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,950
Hey, buddy.
After day-

253
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,550
You said you wanted a shot
of something. What will it be?

254
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,350
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

255
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,850
I already turned
down the music.

256
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,950
What's your problem?

257
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,450
Hey!

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,750
I think maybe you need to call somebody.

259
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,850
You think?

260
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,250
Look! Whoever
you people are,

261
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,050
I can't help any of you!

262
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,450
Especially
if i'm under a bus,

263
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,900
And that's my next stop!

264
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,700
Everybody just shut up!

265
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,650
You're the one
who called me?

266
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,250
Yeah, he said you
might be able to help.

267
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,050
He scared all my business
away, i had to call the police.

268
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,350
Well, you can call
the police back

269
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,350
And tell them everything's
going to be ok.

270
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,750
Who are you,
his doctor?

271
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,750
I know this is gonna
sound strange,

272
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,150
But if you want your bar back-

273
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,450
Hey, do whatever
you have to.

274
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
Great.

275
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,550
Ok, everyone,
let's quiet down.

276
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,050
Quiet down.

277
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,250
I said quiet!

278
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,450
Look, you all want help,

279
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,050
And i really
understand that.

280
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,850
But it's gonna have
to happen one at a time,

281
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,150
And later or not at all.

282
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,750
Or not at all!

283
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,550
Now leave us alone.

284
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,650
Go.

285
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,450
Sometimes it helps
to pretend it's real.

286
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,850
How did you get them
to listen to you?

287
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,750
I just told them that i would
do the same for them later.

288
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,950
Yeah, great, but how do you
keep them from coming back?

289
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,350
You don't.

290
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,650
Who are you?

291
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,950
Hmm, it's
a long story.

292
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,150
Let's have a seat.

293
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,450
So the good news is,
i'm not dead.

294
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,750
The bad news is, i'm going to
have to spend the rest of my life

295
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,050
Listening to people who are?

296
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,750
And helping them.

297
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,050
It's how
they can get peace,

298
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,150
And you can get
a little for yourself.

299
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,950
You said it might
change over time,

300
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,750
Like the ghost voices
might go away?

301
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,350
Anything
is possible, yes.

302
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,050
Any chance i can
speed up that process?

303
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,250
I mean, with like a
baseball bat to my head?

304
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,550
Some meds?

305
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,150
My mother tried everything
but the baseball bat,

306
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,350
And trust me, it's not a good way to go.

307
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,850
I think you're looking
at this the wrong way.

308
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,850
Hey...

309
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,250
What you have
is a gift.

310
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,950
Yeah, from someone
who really hates me.

311
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,750
Eli...

312
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,650
Fiona, you're back.

313
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,250
Tell eli how
he can help you.

314
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,250
I want him to know
i don't blame him.

315
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,850
Blame him? What is
she talking about?

316
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,950
Man: excuse me...

317
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,250
Are you eli james?

318
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,550
And friends.

319
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,150
Who are you?

320
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,550
Detective neely.

321
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,750
You're wanted
for questioning

322
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,450
In connection to the
death of fiona raine.

323
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,950
Melinda: what makes him
so sure it was arson?

324
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,750
They're not sure
about anything,

325
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,850
But they found accelerant
traces near the point of origin.

326
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,150
And that would be
near eli's office?

327
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,050
Right outside.

328
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,450
So he's a suspect?

329
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,950
No, officially he's
a "person of interest."

330
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,050
They don't have enough
evidence to hold him here.

331
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,350
But unofficially?

332
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,750
Unofficially,
they're trying to figure out

333
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,150
If he had a reason
to burn down his own office.

334
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,550
I think it had
something to do

335
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,650
With the argument
people heard.

336
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,950
Between he and fiona.

337
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,150
You know, payne
said that he has

338
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,850
A really bad reputation
at school.

339
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,950
And there's the ghost.

340
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,550
And what about her?

341
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,750
Right before
the police came in,

342
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,050
She said that she didn't blame him.

343
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,650
Blame him for what?
Who knows?

344
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,450
But she's a ghost.

345
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,250
I'll see you
at home?

346
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,850
Mm-Hmm.
Ok.

347
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,550
So is it true?

348
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,250
Did you start the fire?

349
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,350
No!

350
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,750
But thanks for asking.

351
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,950
You know, we need
to talk about fiona.

352
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,050
I can shrink
my own head, thanks.

353
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,350
Look, i told you if
she's not in the light,

354
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,150
That she's obviously
here for a reason.

355
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,050
So she needs
something from you.

356
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,450
Not to mention
what you need from her.

357
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,450
Oh, what's that?

358
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,750
Well, if you didn't
start that fire,

359
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,550
She may be the only
one who can prove it.

360
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,450
Ok, look. Let's just
pretend for a minute

361
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,250
That this whole thing
isn't nuts.

362
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,950
And neither are you.

363
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,950
Or me. What am i
supposed to do?

364
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,750
Start telling
the truth.

365
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,150
And all of it.

366
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,950
At first, when we met in my office,

367
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,450
She would just sit there with
her arms folded and glare at me.

368
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,950
So i shook it up.

369
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,050
I knew she liked
horses,

370
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,950
So i took her
to the track.

371
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,150
And she started
to talk.

372
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,750
What were you
treating her for?

373
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,450
General attachment issues.
I was helping her dump

374
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,450
An on again-Off again
boyfriend named ken

375
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,850
Who'd been messing with
her head since high school.

376
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,350
Did the boyfriend know
that you were talking to her?

377
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,850
I don't think so.

378
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,150
She moved a few towns away
to put distance between them.

379
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,350
She rents a place here with
roommates that she met through school.

380
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,650
A dead-End, long-Distance
relationship.

381
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,250
That's how co-Dependent
they were.

382
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,450
She even asked my advice
on treatment for him.

383
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,650
Do you think he could be
the one who started the fire?

384
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,150
This guy's got
a lot of problems,

385
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,750
But arson's
not one of them.

386
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,550
What kind of problems?

387
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,150
This guy never met a cult or
superstition he didn't like.

388
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,850
He once kept fiona
on the phone all night

389
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,050
Because an aura reader
convinced him

390
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,450
She was seeing
another man.

391
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,750
Was she?

392
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,050
Eli, did you get involved
with your patient?

393
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,850
No.

394
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,550
But she was coming down with
a classic case of transference.

395
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,550
So she was
falling in love with you?

396
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,550
Night of the fire,

397
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,650
I just told fiona i
couldn't treat her anymore.

398
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,650
She freaked.

399
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,250
That's why we were
at my office so late.

400
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,050
She called and said
she had to see me.

401
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,250
People heard you arguing.

402
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,450
What happened?

403
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,450
I told i would refer her
to one of my colleagues.

404
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,150
She said she only
wanted to see me.

405
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,150
I kept telling her
that couldn't happen.

406
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,050
She just kept
yelling.

407
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,050
Then what?

408
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,050
Smoke started coming
under the door,

409
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,150
And i remember
it was so thick,

410
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,550
It felt like
my lungs were on fire.

411
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,850
Next thing i knew,

412
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,150
I guess i was dead.

413
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,850
This is our other
roommate.

414
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,650
Christian, melinda.

415
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,450
She was just
asking about fiona-

416
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,750
Hi, nice to meet you.

417
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,050
And eli.

418
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,750
Oh.

419
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,450
I take it you guys are
not big fans of eli.

420
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,850
We don't want to get anyone in trouble.

421
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,050
That's ok. I'm not the
police or the press, so...

422
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,050
What don't you
like about him?

423
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,550
Well, he was
her shrink, right?

424
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,350
Yes.
Hmm.

425
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,450
He sure didn't
act like one.

426
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,450
Can you be more specific?

427
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
Shrinks are supposed
to have, like,

428
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,750
Office hours, right?

429
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,450
It's usually
how it works.

430
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,550
Well, this guy, he'd come
by at all different times,

431
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,450
Day and night,

432
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,250
Taking her to
restaurants, bars.

433
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,850
It was so obvious
something was going on.

434
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,350
Something romantic?

435
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,450
Heh. He sure
wished it was.

436
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,050
What about fiona?

437
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,750
She liked the attention.

438
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,450
The drinks were free.

439
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,950
And that's as far
as it went with her?

440
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,450
Definitely.
For sure.

441
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,150
She has lots of pictures
of the three of you,

442
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,750
But no family photos.

443
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,050
Do you know where
she might keep them?

444
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,050
I don't know.

445
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,550
But i only moved in
in the spring.

446
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,950
You guys have been
roommates for longer.

447
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,850
Did she ever talk
about that stuff with you?

448
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,450
Fiona: eli, no...

449
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,250
Fiona?

450
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,350
Fiona: please...

451
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,150
Please.

452
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,350
Make it stop.

453
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,850
Make what stop?

454
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,950
Her.

455
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,550
Make her leave us alone,
or i'll make her,

456
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,550
Like i made you.

457
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,950
Ghosts have the ability
to manipulate energy,

458
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,760
Especially angry ghosts.

459
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,460
This one seems to have
done it a lot like

460
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Sunshine through
a magnifying glass.

461
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,460
So you think
this is a pattern

462
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Because fiona had
a history of arson?

463
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,560
She burned down
the house

464
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,560
That she was living in
when she was 12.

465
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,760
How come the police
didn't know this?

466
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,860
How come we didn't know
about this?

467
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,060
'Cause she was so young,

468
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
There was never
any charges.

469
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,960
There was never
any criminal record.

470
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,660
But she was a ward
of the state,

471
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,960
And it went into
family service's files.

472
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,160
As her therapist,

473
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,460
I had access
to those files.

474
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,360
So that's why she didn't
have any family pictures,

475
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,560
Because she didn't
have a family.

476
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,360
They died
when she was a 3.

477
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,260
The house that she burned
down was her foster father's.

478
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,060
I take it she wasn't
too fond of the guy.

479
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,360
Or his physical
and mental abuse.

480
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,260
Where does he live now,
an ashtray?

481
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,060
He was out of the house
when she burned it down.

482
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,060
But she made her point.

483
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,360
She got placed
with another family.

484
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,860
Why didn't you
say anything before?

485
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,160
Because i-I thought she
started that fire because of me.

486
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,860
I think she died
because of me.

487
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,260
How could she have
started it?

488
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,960
She was with you
in the same room.

489
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,460
I don't know.

490
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,460
A homemade device
with a fuse hanging out,

491
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,260
She dropped it off at the
front right before she came in.

492
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,460
So you think that she
wanted to kill you.

493
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,560
Or at least threaten me,

494
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,260
Like she did
her foster father.

495
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,760
But she had no idea the
fire was going to spread.

496
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,260
Ok, so you feel responsible,
why come clean now?

497
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,560
Last night, i...

498
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,860
I heard her voice again.

499
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,860
She was making threats.

500
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,760
I warned you
about this.

501
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,060
Against you.

502
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,960
She said, "tell her
to leave us alone,

503
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,260
Or i'll do the same thing
to her that i did to you."

504
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,460
Ok. So we need to get her to cross over.

505
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,860
She's obviously
sticking around

506
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,860
For some reason, and it's
not to apologize to eli.

507
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,760
Here's something
very mysterious.

508
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,860
How come all your notes
smell like beer?

509
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,160
Because they were
on fire.

510
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,060
The bottle was closer
than the extinguisher.

511
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm smelling a pilsner,

512
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,460
Maybe something czech.

513
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,060
Not bad.
I went to college.

514
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,360
Ok. We know that
she's haunting someone.

515
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,560
We can't find
the boyfriend.

516
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,760
What about
the foster dad?

517
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,260
Yeah, he's the first person
she tried to cook.

518
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,860
He died 6 years ago,
heart attack, i think.

519
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,360
Good riddance,
if you ask me.

520
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,060
How did fiona get along with
her foster families afterwards,

521
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Were there
any more problems?

522
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,660
No, she was a good girl.

523
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,060
She was one of my favorites.

524
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,860
Wish i could have done
more for her.

525
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
Do you know why we're
asking these questions?

526
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
It's about the fire
at rockland u.

527
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,260
Some people think
fiona started it.

528
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,660
Is there a reason
maybe they shouldn't?

529
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
You know what,

530
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,560
Forget we asked.
I'm sorry.

531
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,260
You shouldn't have to violate
patient confidentiality.

532
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,260
Screw confidentiality.

533
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,160
Those rules are there
to protect those kids,

534
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
And they're not
protecting fiona.

535
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,860
Look, i'm not saying arson's
a good way to solve anything,

536
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,660
But there were three
other fosters in that home.

537
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,660
I sure wish we'd known
what was going on.

538
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,360
If fiona started that fire,

539
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,460
She didn't just save herself,
she saved all of their lives.

540
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,860
And if she didn't...

541
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,360
You keep saying "if."

542
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,460
Do the math.

543
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
One kid was younger,
2 kids were older.

544
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,060
Old enough to be tried as adults?

545
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,460
Can you give us
their names?

546
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,360
I can't.

547
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,660
But i can tell you this-

548
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,660
After the fire, when i
asked fiona what happened,

549
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,160
She zipped those lips tight.

550
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,460
But the second the cops started
questioning her older siblings,

551
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,760
She came right out and
practically shouted, "i did it!"

552
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,860
So you're saying
you've seen her ghost,

553
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,360
But now you can't find
her, so you came here?

554
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,260
Sometimes spirits attach
themselves to places they know.

555
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,660
I thought maybe i could
find her in her bedroom.

556
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,360
That still doesn't
tell me why he's here.

557
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,760
I, um...

558
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,460
I can talk to them, too.

559
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,860
Ghosts.

560
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I know, it sounds nuts.

561
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,560
I still think so myself.

562
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,860
Do you really expect us
to believe that-

563
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,460
I believe him.
What?

564
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
Ever since fi died,

565
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,060
We've both had
this feeling...

566
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,060
I don't know how
to describe it,

567
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,960
Bubut somehow
we felt her.

568
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Haven't we, marley?

569
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,660
And that's because
she's still here.

570
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
But she doesn't belong here.
She really needs to cross over.

571
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,760
Well, go talk
to her then.

572
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,560
Christian!
Why not?

573
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,060
What is the harm?

574
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Oh, one favor.

575
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,060
She has this cd.

576
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,560
Could you ask her
if it'd be ok

577
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
If i was to keep it,

578
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Before we release the rest of her stuff?

579
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,260
We'd be happy to.

580
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,860
Fiona?

581
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,760
If you're nearby
and you can hear me,

582
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,160
We really need
to talk to you.

583
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,560
What do you want
from me?

584
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,860
The same as i always did.

585
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,060
I want to help you.

586
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,660
Since when did you
ever help anyone?

587
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,260
Look, we need to know
the truth.

588
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,960
Did you start the fires
or didn't you?

589
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,560
It was outside
his office.

590
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I knew he'd be in there. Who
else would have started it?

591
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,060
I wasn't talking about
that fire.

592
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,060
I was talking about the one
at your foster dad's house.

593
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,860
I started both.

594
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,560
Why work so hard to make me
think you're an arsonist?

595
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,960
Why work so hard to make me
think you really cared about me?

596
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,860
Come on, this is serious.

597
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,360
This isn't a game.

598
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,760
That's funny,
coming from you.

599
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
I just remember something.

600
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,560
What you said to eli, you said,
"leave us alone." Isn't that right?

601
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Back in my apartment, yes.

602
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,360
Ok, so then
who's the "us," fiona?

603
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,260
Because at first, i thought it had
to do with you and eli, but now-

604
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,060
I started those fires.

605
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Don't make me
start more.

606
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,560
Look, if you're hiding
something

607
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
Or someone,
we're not the police.

608
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,460
Ok? We don't want to-

609
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,060
Eli: whoa,
what just happened?

610
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,260
Melinda: she's gone.

611
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
What if she's telling
the truth?

612
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,960
She's covering for someone.
Maybe it's that boyfriend,

613
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,560
But i just think it has something
to do with that first fire, you know,

614
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,960
Like a foster kid.

615
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,160
We have to find out who
else lived in that house.

616
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,460
Guess i won't take
anything out today.

617
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,260
"Structure empty
at time of fire.

618
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,960
"Occupants later
accounted for.

619
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,360
Owner tom moody"-

620
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,060
"Minors female, 12 years,

621
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,460
Female, 16 years,
male, 18 years."

622
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,260
Fiona!

623
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,460
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

624
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,360
You were just trying
to be a good sister.

625
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,560
Which one are you
covering for, him or her?

626
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,760
I warned you.
Stay away.

627
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,760
I'll move on
when you will.

628
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,460
Maybe some things
are better off left alone,

629
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,260
You ever think about that?

630
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,160
Fiona, no.

631
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,460
I'm sorry.

632
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,960
I really am,

633
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
But you brought
this on yourself,

634
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,860
And now you have
to pay the price.

635
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,900
That was a longshot,
anyway.

636
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,400
Without a court order,

637
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
The county keeps family
service records sealed.

638
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
Why hasn't melinda
called by now?

639
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
She must have
found something.

640
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,300
Maybe she has called.

641
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Have you checked
your esp-Mail?

642
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,200
I don't know
what's crazier,

643
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,800
The fact that she believes
in all this stuff,

644
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,100
Or the fact
that i believe her.

645
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,900
I heard that.
It doesn't change the fact

646
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,700
That she's the most
amazing person i've met since...

647
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,500
She's the most amazing person
i've ever met.

648
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,800
I hear that, too.

649
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,600
Yeah. What's so significant
about these notes, eli?

650
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,900
Fiona always described
him in so much detail,

651
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,400
But she never used
his last name.

652
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,100
He, who's he?

653
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Her boyfriend.
And something else,

654
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,100
How was he packing up her
stuff when there were no boxes?

655
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
He who? You said
you never met him.

656
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,800
Christian, the roommate.

657
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,100
He said he was
piling up her stuff

658
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
So he could release it.

659
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,900
Release it? That's the
word he used, release?

660
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,100
Yeah. I found that odd
at the time.

661
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,700
The whole thing was.
Releasing her stuff,

662
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,400
But wanting to keep
some random folk music cd?

663
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,600
What kind of folk music?

664
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,500
African, i think.
Ok.

665
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,100
But what did he put her
things in if it wasn't boxes?

666
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,500
He had some kind
of metal tub.

667
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,700
Didn't you say her boyfriend
was into the occult,

668
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,200
And weird beliefs?

669
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,800
Yeah, why? Well, it
was an african custom,

670
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,400
Part of the yoruba
tradition,

671
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,800
Where possessions of someone
who's passed prematurely

672
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,800
Are set fire to.

673
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,200
That way it'll release
their spirit.

674
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,900
You know, why else
would he use a metal tub

675
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
Unless he was going
to tie-Dye everything?

676
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,200
She said her boyfriend
lived out of town.

677
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,300
Well, what if she
made that part up?

678
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,000
What if she had
no boyfriend?

679
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,500
What if she had all the
problems she told you about,

680
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,800
But with someone she wasn't
romantically involved with?

681
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,000
Someone she wanted
to get away from,

682
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,600
But she didn't know how to.

683
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,400
Who she felt she needed
to protect at the same time.

684
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,400
I think we already know this
quote, unquote boyfriend.

685
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,000
And the foster brother.

686
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
And they're both.

687
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,800
Christian!

688
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,200
What are you doing here?

689
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,900
Here,

690
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,300
Breathe through this, ok?

691
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,500
Because you could get killed.

692
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,800
That's the whole idea.

693
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,500
They'll find me, then
they'll know the truth.

694
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,900
Christian, look, i get it.
Ok, you wanted to protect her

695
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
And that's why
you followed me here.

696
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,300
We took care
of each other.

697
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Ok, well,
let's tell her that,

698
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,200
All right? Let's get out
of here, come on.

699
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,600
She wouldn't want you
to get hurt.

700
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,700
Then why'd she have
to start seeing him?

701
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,000
Because! She needed help
for the both of you.

702
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,900
Ok, she just wanted
advice from eli.

703
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,500
Come on!

704
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,000
She was trying
to get rid of me.

705
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,500
I was more like a family
than anyone she ever had!

706
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,500
No, she wanted to help you
just like you helped her.

707
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,400
I didn't help her,
i killed her!

708
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,700
But you didn't mean to.

709
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,600
You didn't want her to talk
to eli, isn't that right?

710
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
I saw her crying
after she talked to him.

711
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,600
I saw what
he did to her.

712
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,500
So i went to his office
and started the fire.

713
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,800
I was just trying
to scare him away.

714
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,300
Like i did in the first
fire when we were kids.

715
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,700
Eli needs to hear this, ok?

716
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,200
We just-Let's just
get out of here!

717
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,600
She'll never
forgive me!

718
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm sure that
she's already forgiven you!

719
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
What are you
talking about?

720
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,700
Why do you think

721
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,900
She wanted us to believe
she was the arsonist?

722
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,300
It's because she loves you.

723
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,800
Ok, because she wanted
to protect you.

724
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,600
She's right, christian,
listen to her!

725
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,600
She's here!
She's here, ok?

726
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
She wants you to live, so
please, please just take this.

727
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,300
Just-Please!

728
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,200
Oh, god, he's dying!

729
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,000
It's too late!

730
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,500
No, it is not too late!
All right, go and get eli!

731
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Quick! Christian, come on!

732
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,700
Fiona: eli, i need you.
I need you to hear me.

733
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,300
I'm right here in front of
you. I need your help, please.

734
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,100
She still hasn't answered.
She's not picking up.

735
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
There's a fire.
I couldn't help them...

736
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,800
Whoa.
What?

737
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,000
What was that?
The ghost.

738
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,300
The ghost, where? I thought
you couldn't see them.

739
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,500
It's right by me.
The archives, hurry!

740
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,600
Fiona, is that you?

741
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,200
They need you
to come right now.

742
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,300
Slow down, i can't
see your lips move.

743
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,900
You have to speak slowly.

744
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,900
They're in trouble,
christian and that woman.

745
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
Melinda? Where is she?

746
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,900
The archives! Hurry!

747
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,400
Melinda: the tunnel door.

748
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,300
Eli? Eli, what's going on?

749
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,700
I can't understand you.

750
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,100
What's going on
at the archives?

751
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,500
Oh, my god, melinda!

752
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,700
Hey, we got a fire at
the archives. Gotta go.

753
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,800
You're the one
from the hospital.

754
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
And the fire, you-

755
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,700
You were there, too.

756
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,100
We're in many places,
it's true.

757
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,800
Why?

758
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,500
What are you here for?

759
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,000
To watch.

760
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,600
But just now...

761
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,000
You did more than watch.
You-You saved me,

762
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,000
Didn't you?

763
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,300
We were only
returning a favor.

764
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,900
How did i ever
help you?

765
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,900
That's not important now.

766
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,800
What's important
is you have to understand.

767
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,600
Understand what?

768
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,300
We watch many like you
who do what you do

769
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,500
But don't understand.

770
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,700
If you're trying to
tell me i should stop,

771
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,100
You can save yourself.

772
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,400
Understand the price.

773
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
You don't know the price.

774
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,100
What price?

775
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,900
You move between the world
of life and death.

776
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,300
Like your friend eli,

777
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,900
Sometimes you come back from
one with a touch of the other.

778
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
A touch?

779
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,800
Of death.

780
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
Be careful.

781
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,000
It might brush off.

782
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,900
On what?

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
On what you touch.

784
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,400
Melinda: it's ok. I
barely breathed any smoke.

785
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,100
Jim: it's just a precaution.

786
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,500
Look, i used my clothing like
you taught me a thousand times.

787
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,900
Stayed low to the ground?

788
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm here, aren't i?

789
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,700
Don't i get any credit
for that?

790
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,500
Full credit, ok?

791
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
All the credit in the world.
Do you want anything?

792
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,500
I'll get you some water.
Yes.

793
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,000
I'll be right back.

794
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,000
Hey, thanks for letting
them have a minute together.

795
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
I still don't get
a guy tries to kill her

796
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,400
And all she wants to do
is get him help.

797
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Melinda: fiona
understands, christian.

798
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,400
She loves and forgives you.

799
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,100
It's time for you
to both say good-Bye.

800
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,700
What can i tell you?

801
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
That's my wife.

802
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,800
We kept in touch
after they put us

803
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,500
In different
foster homes.

804
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,100
Then after i got a job
and my own place,

805
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,900
I heard he'd been getting
into fights and stuff.

806
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,700
I asked him to move in,

807
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
But i made him
pretend he was just

808
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,500
Some roommate
i met on the internet.

809
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,500
I was afraid people
would figure out

810
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Where we came from.

811
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,300
The fire and everything.

812
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,900
What made you decide
to get help?

813
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,400
I needed to talk to someone
who wouldn't tell anyone.

814
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,100
Christian liked to pretend
he was my brother

815
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,700
Taking care of
his little sister.

816
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,300
But he has so many issues.

817
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,000
After a while, it was just
too much for me.

818
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,400
And i have my own
issues, too.

819
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,800
Now i feel like
i've made everything worse.

820
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,500
How do i know they're not going
to send him to jail for killing me?

821
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
The lawyers say, based
on his mental state,

822
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,900
He'll stay out
of prison.

823
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,400
So he's going to rot
in some awful asylum?

824
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Fiona, you have my word,
i'll take care of him.

825
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,800
I think with the right
medication-

826
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,200
Your word? That's what
christian's depending on?

827
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Look, eli's done everything
he can for both of you.

828
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
No. Fiona's right.

829
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,300
My word hasn't meant
much, not to her.

830
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,600
What does that mean?

831
00:37:47,538 --> 00:37:48,800
Remember that night
when i called

832
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,500
And i told you that we
couldn't work together anymore?

833
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,200
But i know, i know you have
feelings for me, i know it!

834
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,300
No, no,
you are confused.

835
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
No, i'm not!

836
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,600
I can feel it.

837
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,600
You are
a very nice person.

838
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,500
I've enjoyed
our sessions.

839
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,200
But there is
nothing more there.

840
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,500
I lied.

841
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,200
There was more.

842
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,000
Much more.

843
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't understand.

844
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,900
Fiona, you've seen
my apartment.

845
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,900
I have pictures of you
everywhere.

846
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,300
Next to all of your
other patients, so what?

847
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
All that i thought about,

848
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,900
Day after day,
night after night,

849
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,100
Was how i could
make you feel better.

850
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
If you were unhappy,
so was i.

851
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,300
You don't feel that way about
all of your other patients?

852
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,700
Fiona, if i cared about them
all that much, i'd lose my mind.

853
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
If i cared about you
any more...

854
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,500
I'd lose my job.

855
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,300
Ok.

856
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,500
What am i supposed to do
with all of that right now?

857
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Take it with you.

858
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,500
Wherever you're going.

859
00:39:10,673 --> 00:39:12,100
What's that light?

860
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,400
That's where
you're going.

861
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,900
It's amazing.

862
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,400
You're a really good doctor,
you know that?

863
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm not so sure.

864
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,000
Be sure.

865
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,600
My heart was broken,

866
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,900
And now it's fixed.

867
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,300
She's gone.

868
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,500
Man.

869
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,600
Is it always like that?

870
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,600
No.

871
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,000
Sometimes it's better.

872
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,900
Come on.

873
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
Hey.
Hey.

874
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Everybody got
what they wanted?

875
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,000
Perfect.
Oh, yeah.

876
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,800
Honey, they're being polite.

877
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,300
Melinda asked for chopsticks,

878
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,900
And jim asked
for low sodium soy sauce.

879
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,500
Right. Sorry. Sorry.
Be right back.

880
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,900
Bad enough you guys make him
work at the store too, right?

881
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,800
He needs 2 jobs
if he's going to pay

882
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,000
For that video game
that he's so addicted to.

883
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Which, by the way,
he has no time to play.

884
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,800
What?

885
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,000
Do you think
i'm hard on him?

886
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,300
No. Not at all.
Not us.

887
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,000
You know, parenting is a
lot harder than it looks.

888
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,500
And when you two
decide to have kids,

889
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,100
You will know
what i'm talkin' about.

890
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,000
Well...

891
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,000
Here's to us
finding out someday.

892
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,200
Soon.

893
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,000
Here, here.
Mmm.

894
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,300
Excuse me.

895
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,000
I'll be right back.

896
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,200
Hey.

897
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,800
What's with that email
you sent me?

898
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,200
"Come see me before you
leave, if not, be careful."

899
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,100
What, did you have
another bad omen?

900
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
What's the difference?

901
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,000
I mean, no matter what,
you should be careful.

902
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,700
You're going to
a third world country.

903
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,300
There's politics,
scary food.

904
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,900
You care about me.

905
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,100
That's why you've been
so mad.

906
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,600
I figured it out.
You don't want me to go.

907
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,900
Of course i care.

908
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,300
A lot?

909
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,400
You care about me a lot.

910
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400
What do you want me to say?

911
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,300
That you're one
of my best friends,

912
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,100
And that although i full
understand why you have to go,

913
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,000
It hurts... to know
that you would pick

914
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,200
An old pile
of artifacts over me?

915
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,200
Yeah, something like
that would be nice.

916
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,000
Happy?

917
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,300
Can i have a hug
for the road,

918
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,000
Maybe a big squeezy,
chesty one?

919
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,600
Don't be an idiot.

920
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,600
I know i pushed it,
i knew it.

921
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,000
Don't be an idiot,
be safe.

922
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,400
Hey, i'm coming back here,

923
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,900
And i'm coming back
safe and sound, ok?

924
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,999
I promise you that.

925
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,100
Ok

926
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:37,300
