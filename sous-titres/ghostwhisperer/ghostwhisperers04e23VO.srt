1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,630
- Breathe, breathe--
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,450
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,420
In with the good air, out with the bad.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,120
Ok, breathe. We're almost there, ok?

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,030
Melinda, I'm right here. Just keep breathing.

6
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,031
Grab me!

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,130
This is it, this is it?

8
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,331
This is it here.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,200
There we are, number 4, that's it.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
Ok, ok. And one, two, three.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,490
Come on, it's ok, push!

12
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,491
Come on, it's ok, push!

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,830
It's ok, come on, Mel!

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,400
Push! One, two, three.

15
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:51,901
Ok! Push!

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:52,902
Ok!

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,870
You did great.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,030
Can I see my baby?

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,300
Don't you mean babies?

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,990
What?

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,320
How bad was that one?

22
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,510
Well, let's just say "meow" and leave it at that.

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,470
You think maybe you should mention
these dreams to your doctor?

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,230
No, no, I'm sure it's nothing.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,340
I got my dress today.

26
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,200
Yeah, that's right.

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,500
Hey, you think I could have a little look?

28
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,220
Absolutely not!

29
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,350
Ok? Store remains off limits until further notice.

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,760
That's breathtaking.

31
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,150
- Really, you think?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,740
Well said.

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,440
Why don't you put your eyes
back in your head,

34
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,141
and give me one of those lattes.

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
- Are you sure it's not too much? I mean--
- No!

36
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,820
Definitely not.

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,970
She was asking me.

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,380
And it is perfect.

39
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,690
You're perfect.

40
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,130
- All right.
- Ok.

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,210
- Ok.
- I know.

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,580
Let's cut me out of this thing.

43
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,081
I'm gonna be late for lunch with Eli.

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,630
Melinda Gordon?

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,730
I'm Gordon Brady.

46
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,520
And I'm here to give you
the wedding of your dreams.

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,790
You must not be too familiar with my dreams.

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,100
Who are you?

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,230
Some call me a wedding planner,

50
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:56,131
others a dream weaver.

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,200
You can call me an ambassador of love.

52
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,840
Didn't your mother tell you?

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,890
No!

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,530
No, my mother didn't tell me!

55
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,260
A surprise! I hope that doesn't
hinder cooperation.

56
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,130
Your mother reached out to me
to look after your wedding day.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,850
She said, and I quote,

58
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:12,351
"make it unforgettable."

59
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,010
Nice dress, by the way. Is the lace a must?

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,820
It just clashes ever so slightly
with the linens I had in mind.

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,610
Ok, all right, maybe we should just
take a breath for a minute.

62
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,680
No, no, no. You take a breath.

63
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,381
In, in, in. Hold...

64
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,490
Gordon is here.
It's my wedding now.

65
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,190
Eli!

66
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:53,891
<i>Sorry.</i>

67
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,250
Eli?

68
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,640
Zoe.

69
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,510
Didn't see you there.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,910
Eli, this is Jeremy Bishop.

71
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,820
How you doing?

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,980
Jeremy and I met at the university.

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,750
Jeremy is going to the--

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,750
No, it's fine. No need to explain, really.

75
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,310
Explain what?

76
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,500
Anything, really.

77
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,501
Explanations are usually boring in general.

78
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,590
So... you guys are having lunch?

79
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,780
Yeah.

80
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,590
How's that going?

81
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a little too early to tell.

82
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,960
Meaning we just got our salads.

83
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,690
Are you here by yourself?

84
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,020
No, no, I have a lunch date.

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,180
- Female one.
- Good for you!

86
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,790
Nothing serious. Just playing the field.

87
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,670
I mean, out in the field playing.

88
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,670
I mean, I'm just...

89
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,371
running the bases, just trying to...

90
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,900
Get to the stadium. I--
There she is, all right.

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,470
So better never than late,
so you guys...

92
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,650
- Be good. Yeah. You...
- Bye.

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,960
- Did you bring a shovel?
- Why?

94
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,400
Because I need to be hit with one,
hard, in the face right now.

95
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,590
I didn't really feel like a sit-Down lunch anyway.

96
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,680
So because you're jealous of Zoe and that guy,

97
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,781
I have to have lunch at the umbrella room?

98
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,590
Jealous? Please!

99
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,810
I could care less who zoe has lunch with.

100
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,100
Who is this guy? It's driving me nuts.

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,030
The last time I saw Zoe,
she was in tears

102
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,030
because the University's selling
its book collection to raise money.

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,750
- Ouch.
- Yeah. The next thing I know,

104
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,880
her and George Clooney are feeding
each other bon bons at lunch.

105
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,820
Can we please talk about my dream?

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,830
Ok. So you're in the delivery room
and you ask to see your baby.

107
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,400
Yes, and then the nurse says,
"don't you mean babies?"

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,470
Plural. Then she wheels out this basinet full of--

109
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
- Kittens.
- Kittens.

110
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,630
How did you know that?

111
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,860
'Cause it's a totally typical
pregnant woman dream.

112
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,200
Sometimes its puppies,

113
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,549
but either way, there's usually paws involved.

114
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,820
Hello?

115
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,370
You know, I should probably get going
anyway, and I'm sorry for being distracted.

117
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,250
Next time we have lunch, promise, totally present.

118
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,750
Ok, well, bring a shovel.

119
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,800
- Just in case.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you doing here?

121
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,090
There's something you need to know.

122
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,190
What?

123
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,470
Your future is in her hands.

124
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,830
It's a matter of life and death.

Wait a minute, he said "her"?

131
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,301
Your future is in her hands.

132
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,070
What does he mean?

133
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,940
I don't know, he was looking at my belly.

134
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,590
Maybe he just got it, you know, backwards.

135
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,560
Yeah, I don't think the watchers
do an opposite day.

136
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,700
Then maybe we need to go to your doctor

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,430
and ask him whether or not we're
having a boy or girl.

138
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,630
We said we didn't want to know.

139
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,790
No, no, you said, and then I was pressured into--

140
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,770
No, I said that I wanted it to be a surprise,

141
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:24,871
and you agreed.

142
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,930
- You're right.
- Ok.

143
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:29,431
And Eli says that weird dreams are typical

144
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:31,632
of pregnant women, so maybe this qualifies.

145
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,820
When have you ever had a typical dream?

146
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,850
I know.

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,810
Look, I just-- I don't want to worry
about anything else, you know,

148
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,919
especially with this big wedding, and...

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,260
really, a big wedding...
it just doesn't feel right.

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,440
I hear you. But look, if your mom wants to
do this, I think we should let her, you know?

151
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,749
I mean, it's just her way of saying she cares.

152
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:52,554
No, it is her way of dealing with guilt

153
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,583
because she doesn't even come back from
her trip until the day before the wedding.

154
00:07:58,532 --> 00:07:59,732
Here's to your mom.

155
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,440
And to the comfort of predictability.

156
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,580
And... to our big wedding.

157
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,991
Because no matter how big it gets, it's still

158
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,670
just about you and me.

159
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,700
Here's to that.

160
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,590
Jim?

161
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,730
Who are you?

162
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:33,789
And...

163
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,010
at that point, well, you know,
I warned him not to move,

164
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,914
and I told him to drop the book.

165
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,059
We struggled.

166
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,590
Had him pinned pretty good, but...

167
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,820
he managed to get past me.

168
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:45,921
Dr. James,

169
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,370
I might have thought you'd be
in the middle of all of this.

170
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,349
It's good to see you, too, sir.

171
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,840
Zoe Ramos, this is Mr. Bedford,

172
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,650
chairman of the fundraising committee.

173
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,170
Oh, really? Just the person
I wanted to speak to, you know,

174
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,630
I've been researching the Von Drake collection--

175
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,140
Oh, luckily we only lost one book,
and it was the least

176
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,050
valuable of the bunch, so,
we can still make a sale.

177
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,370
Still combing your hair with a firecracker
I see, Dr. James.

178
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:11,871
Pleasure.

179
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,620
Likewise.

180
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
He loves me. He just--

181
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,120
he has affection issues.

182
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,221
You were very brave.

183
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,980
Well, you know, you don't think in
situations like that.

184
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,600
You just act, you know.

185
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,550
He's wrong about that book.

186
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,030
The one that was stolen?

187
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,870
I've been studying it. It's very valuable.

188
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,060
It's special.

189
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,920
It shouldn't end up in the wrong hands.

190
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,640
Speaking of being in the wrong hands,

191
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,270
is it serious?

192
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,950
- You and the lunch guy.
- Eli, please.

193
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,960
What is it? Better table manners?

194
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh, no, I knew it was a bad
idea for us to reconnect.

195
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,300
We said we should keep our distance
when we broke up,

196
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,400
- and we should have just stuck to that.
- Look, I know you're stressed out...

197
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,290
Damn right I'm stressed!
Do you know that the school

198
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,450
is selling the entire Von Drake collection?

199
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,590
These are books that I have spent years studying!

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,670
Hey, I hear you. Ok.

201
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,860
So, let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.

202
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,540
That's you hearing me?
Inviting me on a date?

203
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,260
No! That's me telling you,
that I can be a grown-up.

204
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,161
And we can have a platonic dinner

205
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,010
and learn to just be friends.

206
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,020
Come on, I'll take you to a terrible restaurant

207
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,549
with bad lighting and no atmosphere.

208
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,770
It'll be great. Huh?

209
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,050
Well, I'm really glad you're all right.

210
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,550
If that had been me, I would have
screamed and frozen in place.

211
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,220
Well, you never know how you're gonna...

212
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,010
Anyway,

213
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:31,269
point is, he only got away
with one book.

214
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,860
A valuable book, according to Zoe.

215
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,430
There was a book in my dream.

216
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,870
The kittens had a book?

217
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,780
I'm way past the kittens.

218
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,440
No, this was a little girl with no face,

219
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,870
And she kept showing me a book--
leather, old, bound.

220
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,970
Just like the one that was stolen.

221
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,010
And not only that, but right after
the last time that I saw you,

222
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,629
I saw one of those watchers.

223
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,840
And he said that my future was in her hands.

224
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,100
- Whose hands?
- I don't know.

225
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,320
My kid's? I mean, could this be
connected in some way?

226
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,910
what was in that book that was stolen.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,450
I was too much in a jealous rage
to really follow up.

228
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,770
I'm having dinner with Zoe tonight,
though. I'll find out more.

229
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,980
- Dinner?
- Yeah,

230
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,250
but it's just to prove that,

231
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,155
we can spend meaningless time together.

232
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,770
Oh, wow, that sounds great.

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,880
Well, good news.

234
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,809
I've managed to rearrange the entire floor plan

235
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,950
to accommodate the orchestra.

236
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,070
Orchestra? I thought I had a DJ.

237
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,100
You have such a quirky sense of humor.

238
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,640
But the problem remains of getting
you in and out of the church.

239
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,340
- Problem?
- Musically speaking.

240
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,610
But the solution came to me on my way here.

241
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,820
It was a message... from Cupid.

242
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,990
I have one word for you-- Bagpipes.

243
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,170
<i>Hey, it's Zoe. You know what to do, so do it.</i>

244
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,190
So I guess being 45 minutes late

245
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,199
is part of the zero romance policy we're pursuing.

246
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,300
Zoe?

247
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,130
<i>Not now, go away.</i>

248
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,570
Are you all right? Let me in.

249
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,640
<i>Everything's changed.</i>

250
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,730
What are you talking about?

251
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,750
Let me in!

252
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,310
<i>I'm sorry. It's just I'm in a totally
different place right now.</i>

253
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,760
<i>Can you just come back later or something?</i>

254
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,940
Is there someone in there with you?

255
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,030
<i>I need to be by myself right now.</i>

256
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,130
Zoe?

257
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,120
<i>Eli, I'm all right. Just go away, please.</i>

258
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,340
As soon as I see for myself.

259
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,630
<i>I'm kind of confused right now.
Please just leave.</i>

260
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,820
Zoe?

261
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,970
<i>Why won't you just leave me alone?!</i>

262
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,990
- No!
- Eli, just go.

263
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,400
Please, just go.

264
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,450
Eli, please, this has nothing to do with you.
Just walk out the door.

265
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,430
Eli, please, just leave.

266
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,440
<i>- Come on, let's go.
- I didn't touch her, I swear!

267
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,780
I don't even know how I got here!

268
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,920
Do you have any reason to believe
that Zoe knew the intruder?

269
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,560
I don't think so,

270
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:52,061
Zoe didn't see him when he broke in the library.

271
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,730
What do you think happened?

272
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,931
Well the intruder claims that Zoe
was coming down the stairs.

273
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,840
She freaked when she saw
him and lost her footing.

274
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,740
This can't be happening. I think...

275
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm waiting for her to just come in,

276
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,190
and just say it was all a joke. I--

277
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,490
Look, get some rest, all right?

278
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:13,299
If I need anything else, I'll call you.

279
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,280
She's here.

280
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,490
Is there anything that you want to
say to Eli before you cross over?

281
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,670
I can't cross over.

282
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,740
Why not?

283
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,470
I know what I have to do now,
and I can't go until it's done.

284
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,990
This is too much information. I gotta go home.

285
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,040
He's just a common street thief, really.

286
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,960
Half a dozen arrests for breaking and entering.

287
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,040
There are warrants out for him
in several other counties.

288
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm glad he's off the streets.

289
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,790
Yeah, this arrest is going to solve a lot of cases.

290
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,850
We're waiting for the public defender's office
to send someone over to represent him.

291
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,570
- Did Eli tell you what I wanted?
- Yeah.

292
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,920
Look, it's a little unusual,
but Eli's helped us on a lot of cases

293
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,579
so I'm happy to do the favor.

294
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,300
Just know that when I say 5 minutes, I mean it.

295
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,810
Got it.

296
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,940
I heard you say you didn't know
how you got to that house.

297
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,370
I don't. It was the same thing with the library.

298
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,820
It's like I don't have any say in it,

299
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,910
like I was sleepwalking or something.

300
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,810
What were you doing at the house?
What were you trying to steal?

301
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,870
I wasn't trying to steal anything!

302
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,040
Look, I know that it can be hard to--

303
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,290
I wasn't supposed to take anything.

304
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,470
I was supposed to put something there.

305
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,540
What?

306
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,320
I got nothing else to say.

307
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,047
<i>Hey, it's Zoe. You know what to do, so do it.</i>

308
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,230
I don't know if you're listening...

309
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,840
If you're still here.

310
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,790
I feel like I have so many things
I want to say I'm sorry for.

311
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,820
And if I could just see you, just hear you,

312
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,640
just one more time,

313
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,269
Even if it's just to say good-Bye,

314
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,590
I would just...

315
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,720
What are you doing? Eli!

316
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,200
You put people on medication
for doing things like this.

317
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,310
<i>Sir,</i>

318
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,349
<i>excuse me, is the library up ahead?</i>

319
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,730
<i>Yeah, sure, it's right down here, you'll see it.</i>

320
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,940
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

321
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:47,441
<i>- Mr. Bedford, good to see you again.
- It's my pleasure.</i>

322
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:52,442
<i>- So how is everything coming along?
- Good.</i>

323
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,043
<i>I see you got everything you need here.</i>

324
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>I will, you, too.</i>

325
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:05,996
Mr. Bedford...

326
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,398
Who is that guy?

327
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,799
That guy is Jeremy Bishop.

328
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,220
He represents the collector

329
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,580
who is buying the entire Von Drake collection,

330
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,310
which is saving our bacon.

331
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,790
And the check that he's writing
will help keep you paid

332
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,430
for the next 2 semesters.

333
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,810
I don't think I needed that exact example,

334
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,611
but, ok.

335
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,740
Try not to touch anything.

336
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
Yeah.

337
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,381
So you really think this thief doesn't know why

338
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,330
he broke in the library or Zoe's?

339
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,430
He described it as sleepwalking.

340
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,580
Wait, you don't think that...

341
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,510
A ghost could be controlling him? Could be.

342
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:43,711
But why? Why steal that book?
Why break into Zoe's?

343
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,790
He said he felt like he was meant
to put something there.

344
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,680
- The book?
- Yeah.

345
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,209
The book is the one common thread.

346
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,112
I mean, my dream, zoe, the thief.

347
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,817
And I just found out the guy
Zoe was having lunch

348
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,330
with is buying the whole Von Drake
collection from the University.

349
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,690
Yeah, see, why would she be having lunch
with the guy who took her books away?

350
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,620
I mean, how is he connected in all this?

351
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,890
We gotta talk to Zoe.

352
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,080
I can't get her to come to me.

353
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,290
Do you think she crossed over?

354
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,280
No, but I haven't seen her either. Listen,

355
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,810
if we don't find Zoe, we have to find that book.

356
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,690
I know that look.

357
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,310
That's the "we gotta sneak into some
place we don't belong" look.

358
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,310
We shouldn't be breaking into Zoe's house.

359
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,620
Zoe won't mind.

360
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,670
What if we get caught?

361
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,750
Well, I'll let you do all the talking.

362
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,840
Where'd you learn how to do that?

363
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,650
What, you think just because I'm an
academic I don't have any other skills?

364
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,880
Evidently you don't know me very well.

365
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,590
Evidently the door was open the entire time.

366
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:54,819
Well, I loosened it.

367
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,349
Guess there's no bonus miles for
breaking and entering.

368
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,750
Where do we start?

369
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:07,451
It would have to be somewhere on
the first floor. He never got upstairs.

370
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,630
What do we do?

371
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,720
- Grab him.
- What?!

372
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,340
Whoever the guy is, he might have answers.

373
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,149
Just grab him like you did the guy in the library.

374
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,800
Listen, about the guy in the library,
it wasn't so much

375
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,010
- I grabbed him--
- Eli, just go.

376
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,849
Zoe was begging me.

377
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,650
Not to buy the Von Drake collection,

378
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,480
or at least, let the book
stay at the University,

379
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,320
so she could continue her research.

380
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,200
So that's what that lunch was about.

381
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,239
So what did you tell her?

382
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,470
I told her I'd think about it.

383
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,399
So what, you were just gonna string her along?

384
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,290
It was a good excuse to see her again.

385
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,380
So shoot me.

386
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,950
What are you doing here?

387
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,700
Well, when someone tried to steal the books,

388
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,680
I thought maybe Zoe was behind it.

389
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,030
You actually think Zoe would
stoop to stealing books?

390
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,470
She was a professor.

391
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,190
Said the professor who just
broke into Zoe's house,

392
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,550
Looking for the same thing I am, I am sure.

393
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,390
The missing book.

394
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,930
Seems we all thought it was here.

395
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,739
You know, I thought it was
the least valuable one,

396
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,630
So why would you risk breaking
and entering just to find it?

397
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,810
Why would you?

398
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,200
There are many different
definitions of valuable.

399
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,640
The people that I work
for want the complete set.

400
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,410
Who exactly do you work for?

401
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,740
Privileged.

402
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,670
So, do we call the police on each other,

403
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,640
or do we all just walk away?

404
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,430
I'd go for the walk away thing.

405
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Zoe...

406
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,481
Please don't hide from me.

407
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,270
We need to talk.

408
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,680
- Please?
- I'm here.

409
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,740
You know, just because I'm an
insecure, jealous maniac,

410
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,310
is no reason to ignore me.

411
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,670
I came because you almost got hurt tonight.

412
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,670
You need to step away from this.
You'll understand everything someday.

414
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:39,671
I need to know now, Zoe.

415
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,430
What's in that book?

416
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,710
Where is it?

417
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,510
The book is the key to everything.

418
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,640
The book is always changing--

419
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,850
New things are written,
old things are erased.

420
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,500
You still there?

421
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,401
There's others here.

422
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,260
There are so many things on this side,
that I don't understand yet.

423
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,620
Yeah, well, it's not much better
on this side, I can tell you that.

424
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,750
The book taught me what I have to do.

425
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,051
Who I have to help.

426
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,570
When the time comes, I'll be there to guide you.

427
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,030
Guide me where?

428
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:23,331
You didn't have to apologize for not believing me.

429
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
I knew you didn't.

430
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,910
It wasn't that, I--

431
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:28,011
You listened to me.

432
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,780
Even though you didn't believe...

433
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,530
That's what I loved.

434
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,410
Zoe, I miss you.

435
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,280
Excuse me, but did you just
say horse and carriage?

436
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,081
Breathtaking, isn't it?

437
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,640
The entire wedding party arrive at the
reception hall by horse and carriage.

438
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,890
The whole thing just drips romance.

439
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,350
If I know I say it myself.

440
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,370
I know that you're an artist,
but really--

441
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,020
Please, there's no need to state
the obvious, but thank you.

442
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,400
Now, your mother has called and announced

443
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,200
that another family contingent are
flying in from vermont-Cousins.

444
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,809
Half a dozen. Well, six to be exact.

445
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,860
But don't worry.

446
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,560
We need a bigger reception hall anyway.

447
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,060
We simply cannot fit a decent-sized
arbor in this space.

448
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,060
It's impossible.

449
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,730
You know what, I have to go get
something from the basement.

450
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,940
Ok.

451
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,330
Now, the rooftop is available
at the Sunset Manor, but then

452
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:40,020
there are weather worries,
and the carpet there's just dreadful.

453
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,130
What do you want?

454
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,470
You can't.

455
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:51,671
Can't what?

456
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,800
Save her.

457
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,940
You can't.

458
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,620
Look...

459
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:04,921
You're in a fair amount of trouble,

460
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:06,822
but I can help you.

461
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,670
The people I work for have
a lot of resources.

462
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,350
We can get you a decent attorney,

463
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,050
maybe even arrange bail.

464
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:15,151
How?

465
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,230
Before I can help you,

466
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,631
I have to know one thing.

467
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,810
- Where's the book?
- The what?

468
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,930
The book you took from the library.

469
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,820
Did you put it in the woman's
house, did you hide it somewhere?

470
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,230
Dude, I don't even know
how I got in that house.

471
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,410
Why won't anyone believe me?

472
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,510
Maybe it's because you're a low-life thief.

473
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,590
Look at me.

474
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,180
Look at my eyes.

475
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,110
Now think.

476
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,810
Remember.

477
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,130
Think harder.

478
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,970
We're not letting you
anywhere near that book.

479
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,990
You're overmatched.

480
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,491
Do you really think you can stop us

481
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,300
with marionette tricks?

482
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:53,535
You all right?

483
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,836
Not really.

484
00:26:57,037 --> 00:27:00,637
Melinda, tell me, these visions you're having,
they're all of a little girl, right?

485
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,580
I just know this is about our baby,
I just know it.

486
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,000
No, Mel, it's not.

487
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,700
It's not, trust me.

488
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,280
What makes you so sure?

489
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,060
What are you not telling me?

490
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,820
Look, are you sure you want to know?

491
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,050
Don't mess with me right now, please.

492
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,400
Our child is not going to be a she.

493
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,719
We're gonna have a little boy.

494
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,130
- You know?
- Yeah.

495
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
How? I thought that we were gonna-

496
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,690
I know, I didn't do it on purpose, but...

497
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,140
I found a little note attached
to your last sonogram.

498
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,320
and I wasn't going to tell you, but--

499
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,140
- A boy?
- yeah.

500
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,180
Who's the "she"?

501
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,690
Who holds my future in her hands,
who is it that I can't save?

502
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:35,343
I really miss pizza.

503
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:38,145
Pizza made me happy.

504
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:39,446
Who is that?!

505
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,948
I need your help.

506
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:43,649
You've really got to find that book

507
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,350
before Jeremy Bishop does.

508
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,310
Yeah, well, it's not like we haven't been trying.

509
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,960
- Who are you?
- Not important.

510
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,470
Are you one of the watchers?

511
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,060
That sounds so pretensions.
Just call me Carl.

512
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,820
Carl. Yeah, I remember you.

513
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,840
Carl the watcher.

514
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,930
Did you have to come when
I was in my underwear, Carl?

515
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,980
Don't worry about it.

516
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,840
Since I've been dead, I've walked in on lots worse.

517
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,160
Who's this Jeremy guy anyway?

518
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,700
It's not so much about Jeremy

519
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,120
as who controls him and what they want.

520
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,380
The book has been safe up to now

521
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,280
because it was hidden in the larger collection.

522
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,080
But then Jeremy found out about it?

523
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,070
Yes, and he was sent to buy the collection.

524
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,080
So I took control of that repulsive little thief,

525
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,740
and made him steal the book

526
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,440
and then I made him put it in Zoe's house.

527
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,549
I was improvising.

528
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,450
Wait, I thought watchers weren't supposed to--

529
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:35,051
Interfere. True.

530
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:38,552
And there was a reprimand involved,

531
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,790
believe me.

532
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,790
Apparently we're supposed to give
warnings, clues,

533
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,790
but not really affect the future ourselves,

534
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,950
just influence others.

535
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,210
So you influenced a thief to steal the book.

536
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,570
Why did you pick this particular thief?

537
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,960
It's not so hard to find these lost souls.

538
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,280
That, and he was about to break into
my wife's house for the second time

539
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,130
and I can't have that, so,

540
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:06,031
2 birds, one stone kind of thing.

541
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
Well, I'm sorry.

542
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:09,461
I don't know where the book is.

543
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:10,662
I do.

544
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,830
I'll tell you where the book is,
but you have to promise me

545
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,020
that you'll keep it safe. And one other thing--

546
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,900
Melinda can't touch the book or even see it.

547
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,250
Well, how am I supposed to do that?

548
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,140
I can't lie to Melinda.

549
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,950
Eli...

550
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,410
If this stuff was easy,

551
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,811
anybody could do it.

552
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:04,913
Sorry to crash your party, but they're not gonna
turn on mejust because I'm a man, are they?

553
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:06,015
What are you doing here?

554
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:08,216
I've got some good news and bad news,
and neither can wait.

555
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,818
Ok, so what's the good news?

556
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,370
- I found the book.
- That's great.

557
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:13,071
What's the bad news?

558
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,060
What do you mean, I can't see the book?

559
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,100
- Or touch it, technically.
- Excuse me?

560
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,310
Look, I don't know why,

561
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,470
but Carl the reluctant watcher made me promise.

562
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:25,771
The thing is, I looked at the
book last night and at its names,

563
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,520
and there was something
really scary under Zoe's name.

564
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,190
But you can't show me?

565
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,720
No.

566
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:31,921
Next best thing.

567
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:33,722
I scanned the page.

568
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,490
I figure you can read it without seeing the book.

569
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,440
Carl may not approve, but he doesn't seem
like a letter of the law type of ghost.

570
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,590
What are these numbers?

571
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,600
No idea.

572
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
But look at this.

573
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,900
<i><b>She helps the listener join the dead. </b></i>

574
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,020
You're the listener?

575
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,850
Yeah!

576
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:53,151
What does that mean?
I'm marked for death or something?

577
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,440
We don't know that for sure.

578
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:55,641
That's why Zoe's not crossing over.

579
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,142
She knows I'm gonna die soon, and
she's here to help me cross over.

580
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,810
Ok.

581
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,460
Hey, Mel, there's still a couple more gifts to open.

582
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,200
Ok.

583
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,570
Please just stay calm, all right?

584
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,890
I'll only be a few minutes.

585
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:08,491
Don't go anywhere, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight.

586
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,060
All right, here's the next one.

587
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,790
Ok!

588
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,900
Oh, you guys, baby names!

589
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,360
That's great, 'cause we have no clue

590
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:19,064
what the baby's name is going to be.

591
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,810
- Where's the book?
- In my office.

592
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,811
- I need to see it right now!
- But the watcher said--

593
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:47,112
Don't give me the watcher crap, all right?

594
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:48,813
Just take me to the book or I'll hurt you.

595
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:09,623
Who is sending you these messages?

596
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,827
I don't know. The watchers, my unconscious...

597
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,820
They could be from the baby.

598
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:14,429
I don't even want to go there.

599
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,690
Look, if my baby is in danger, I have to know it.

600
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,150
What?

601
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,151
I think I know what's going on here.

602
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:52,152
Andrea 2804,

603
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:54,553
Eli 310, Jim 711,

604
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,470
Sam 1411, Zoe 1505.

605
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,390
There are all dates, they're just backwards.

606
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:01,891
Dates for what?

607
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:06,192
April 28th, Andrea died in that plane crash.

608
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,050
You were hurt in the fire October 3rd.

609
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,330
Jim died November 7th.

610
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,260
<i>No!</i>

611
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,000
And Sam died November 14th,
and Zoe, May 15th.

612
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:36,951
What does it mean?

613
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,552
The book of changes.

614
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,553
This book isn't about the future,

615
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,159
this book is about the past.

616
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,180
Every one of these names is a normal person

617
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,190
who died and came back in one way or another.

618
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,410
Who's keeping track of it and why?

619
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,540
I don't know. The watchers, maybe?

620
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,041
Melinda...

621
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,742
There's one more page you need to see.

622
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,200
It's probably why you weren't
supposed to see the book.

623
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,690
September 25th.

624
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,120
What happened on that day?

625
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,621
This one is about the future.

626
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:07,922
What?

627
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,930
My due date.

628
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,490
September 25th.

629
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,970
Zoe, I have to talk to you. Please.

630
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,110
It's never been more important.

631
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,430
It's not about me or you.

632
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,390
It's about Melinda's baby.

633
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,690
She's scared.

634
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,780
You've got to tell me what you know.

635
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,880
Tell Melinda the other side is giving
her those visions, to try to scare her.

636
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,660
They want the child to be scared, too.

637
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,510
The other side?

638
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,620
If I knew more, I would tell you, but there's
so many things I haven't figured out yet.

639
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,950
You don't have to figure out
anything anymore.

640
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,650
You can cross over.

641
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,430
No, I have to help you.

642
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,780
Zoe, the book says you help
the listener join the dead.

643
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,790
But you already have.

644
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,270
How?

645
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,970
I did something stupid.

646
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,950
I let myself get involved with a patient.

647
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,230
I let it get too personal,

648
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,510
which led me right to being in that fire,

649
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,590
which led me directly to
being able to hear the dead.

650
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,180
You did what you were meant to do.

651
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,180
There's more.

652
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,290
The book needs a caretaker.

653
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,970
It was me for all these years
and I didn't even know it.

654
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,540
And now?

655
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,050
It's you.

656
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,890
But you can't keep the book in one place.

657
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,220
Now that they know it's here,
they'll never stop looking.

658
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,060
Who?

659
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,350
They're different faces all the
time, but they're always there.

660
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,100
Zoe, I'll take care of the book.

661
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,470
You're free now, Zoe.

662
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,250
You can cross over.

663
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,420
I don't feel right leaving you.

664
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,770
But you were right to leave me before.

665
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,110
And you're right now.

666
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,550
And you're leaving a lot of good behind.

667
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,110
I'm not.

668
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,760
I haven't had time to do anything...

669
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,640
To finish anything.

670
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,640
You're wrong.

671
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,140
Look how you helped me.

672
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,880
You taught me how to care about somebody.

673
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,920
Even if I was all awkward and stupid about it.

674
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,860
And you showed me that maybe
somebody could care about me.

675
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,960
You know, in a way like

676
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,060
I always wanted to be cared about
but never thought I would.

677
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,940
That's kinda huge.

678
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,290
You gone?

679
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,380
But not forgotten.

680
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:51,317
Carl?

681
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:53,519
Are you here?

682
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,510
I really need to talk to you.

683
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,440
I didn't know where else to look.

684
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,880
I want some answers.

685
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,840
I know the feeling.

686
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,830
I understand now.

687
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,431
That it was Zoe who held
my future in her hands

688
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,100
because she knew what was in the book.

689
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,990
Which you were not supposed to read.

690
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,491
So sue me.

691
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,250
Look, I'm not asking for anything for myself,

692
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,390
but I do need to know if my baby is in danger.

693
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,320
I am not supposed to tell you too much.

694
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,070
I've already had my wrists slapped.

695
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,290
You owe me, Carl.

696
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:28,791
When you were being haunted,
I helped you find peace.

697
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,670
All I can tell you, Melinda, is that
you have to prepare your child.

698
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,750
Don't let the other side scare you into
shielding him,

699
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,000
but you must teach him.

700
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,470
There's a lot of white light around you.

701
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,030
Many spirits watching over you.

702
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,220
More than you know,
but one tear in the curtain,

703
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,800
and the balance could shift.

704
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,760
And your son is the key.

705
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,160
Will my son be able to do what I do?

706
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,030
No.

707
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,320
Ok.

708
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,230
Well, that's a relief.

709
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:01,731
He'll be able to do much, much more.

710
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,340
That takes care of the bridesmaids.

711
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:14,841
Now, on to the orchestra samples.

712
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:17,899
Take your time listening to them,
but I need your choice by 7:00.

713
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,320
Now, can we talk about the ice sculpture?

714
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,340
Imagine this 50 times as big.

715
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,860
Excuse me.

716
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,040
Can you come with me?

717
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,400
- Hello?
- Delia, you, too.

718
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,740
Hello? We're just trying to design
the wedding of the decade here.

719
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,420
<i>I haven't even spoken
about the fireworks yet!</i>

720
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,950
- So what are we doing?
- You know what?

721
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,800
Melinda, you were right.

722
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,980
No matter how big this wedding gets,

723
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,760
in the end, it is still only about--

724
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,430
you and me.

725
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:13,501
You recognize the street?

726
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:15,503
Yes.

727
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:18,205
It's the street where we first met.

728
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,730
You know, this wedding...

729
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,350
This marriage is just about us.

730
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:42,751
It's not about your mom, or,
you know, our relatives or

731
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:44,352
the ice sculpture.

732
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,380
It's just you and me.

733
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,160
The way it's always been.

734
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,361
Well, I mean, almost the
way it's always been.

735
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,480
But I've always been married
to you, Melinda Gordon.

736
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,040
No matter what comes between us,
and I always will be.

737
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,030
No matter what's waiting for us.

738
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,870
And no matter what we can't foresee.

739
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,850
I promise you.

740
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,200
You're unbelievable.

741
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:34,901
This isn't a wedding.

742
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:36,702
This is just...

743
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,400
a renewal of what we have always had.

744
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,170
Of what we'll never lose.

745
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,110
And you know why?

746
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,820
Because you can't kill love.

747
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,710
Oh, hey, maid of honor.

748
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:03,611
Best man.

749
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:07,712
Let's do this.

750
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:14,913
<i>Dearly beloved,

751
00:43:15,814 --> 00:43:18,814
<i>We are gathered here today
to join Sam and Melinda,

752
00:43:18,825 --> 00:43:20,815
<i>in holy matrimony.

753
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:22,716
<i>No other human ties are more tender,

754
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,917
<i>no other vows more sacred

755
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:27,117
<i>than those you are about to make tonight...
