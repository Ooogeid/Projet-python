1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,700
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON GHOST WHISPERER...</i>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,900
PLEASE, NOT YOU!

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,600
- YOU HAVE TO CROSS OVER.
- I DON'T WANT TO.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,900
???

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,000
- YOU'RE BACK!
- DO I KNOW YOU?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
LOOK, I SEE THE SAME
GUY THAT YOU SEE...

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,800
DIFFERENT HAIR, NOSE,
EYES, IT'S NOT JIM.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,300
HE'S IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
HE JUST HAS TO BE.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,700
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME YOU
THINK I'M YOUR HUSBAND REINCARNATED

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,300
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY SANE
PERSON I'VE MET SINCE I WOKE UP.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,200
IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT MAYBE
YOU COULD HELP ME FINISH MY GARAGE,

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
AND YOU COULD LIVE THERE
WHILE YOU DO THE WORK,

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
JUST UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT
YOUR NEXT MOVE.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,000
OH, MY GOD, IT'S TRUE.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, DO YOU?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
YOU MUST BE NICOLE.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
- THE FIANC?
- SHE IS NOT HIS FIANC?

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,300
UNTIL HE PUTS A RING
ON HER FINGER.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,200
BYE.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Hi.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,600
YOU MEAN, NIKKI REALLY LEFT?
JUST LIKE THAT?

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
YEAH. I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,300
AND SO AFTER SHE DROVE AWAY,
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,600
WELL, IT WAS...

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,300
INTENSE.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
WE JUST STOOD THERE,
STARING AT EACH OTHER.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,000
THAT REALLY HAPPENS?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,900
I'M TELLING YOU, IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING
AROUND US JUST DROPPED AWAY,

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,400
YOU KNOW? AS IF THERE WAS
SOME KIND OF...

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,100
MAGNETIC FIELD DRAWING US
TOGETHER AS THOUGH...

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,100
NOTHING COULD STOP
WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,800
SO?! WHAT HAPPENED?

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,100
I CALLED YOU.

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,400
REALLY? PLEASE.

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,100
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

35
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,900
THEN YOU REALLY DO
NEED THERAPY.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
IT'S JUST ALL BEEN
SO CRAZY, YOU KNOW?

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
STARTING WITH THE FIRST DAY

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,600
WHEN I WOKE UP IN THAT HOSPITAL,
AND THERE SHE WAS.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,200
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR!

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,100
THERE IS NOTHING
STANDING IN YOUR WAY.

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,200
YEAH, NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER HE'S JIM.

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,700
AND HE MIGHT NOT, MEL.

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,700
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S
JIM'S SPIRIT IN THERE,

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,800
AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT
TO BE WITH HIM.

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,900
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S JUST STARTING
FRESH WITH THIS NEW JIM,

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,300
- IT'S SO...
- WEIRD!

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,900
I MEAN, I BARELY
KN THIS GIRL,

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,900
AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND,
I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN HER FOREVER.

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,000
I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED TO THIS MAN.
YOU KNOW? WE LIVED A LOT OF LIFE TOGETHER.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,600
I HAVE THESE REALLY STRONG
FEELINGS ABOUT HER!

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
SO NOW I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO
START FALLING IN LOVE WITH A MAN

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,200
THAT I'VE ALREADY
BEEN IN LOVE WITH FOR YEARS?

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK?

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,900
WHERE DO WE START?

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,600
A SCHOOL DANCE?

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,600
I MEAN, THAT'S, UH...

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,900
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW. IT'S JUST, 

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,900
I PROMISED DELIA
THAT I WOULD CHAPERONE TONIGHT.

59
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,700
BUT THEY'RE RAISING MONEY TO
FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER, SO...

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,700
WELL, ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO SAY
THAT IN A WAY, IT'S KINDA PERFECT.

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,800
- OH. IT IS?
- YEAH.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
I MEAN, SURE.
IT'S, UM...

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,600
I MEAN, WHAT BETTER WAY TO GET OVER
THE AWKWARD FIRST DATE JITTERS

64
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,400
THAN IN A CROWD OF
AWKWARD TEENAGERS?

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,000
(Grant High School
Dance Against Hunger)

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,900
HEY. HERE WE ARE, LADIES.
Here we go.

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,300
CAREFUL.

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
JUDGING BY THE DANCE FLOOR,
I THINK THESE ARE SPIKED.

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,400
I AM AS OPEN-MINDED AS THE NEXT PERSON,
BUT WHO CALLS THAT DANCING?!

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,900
I MEAN, THIS IS A PUBLIC
PLACE FOR GOD SAKE!

71
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,000
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY!
HEY, HEY, HEY!

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,800

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,900
PLEASE DON'TELL ME
THESE ARE FRIENDS OF YOURS!

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
NO, AND THEY NEVER WILL BE,
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP.

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,700
COME ON. COME ON!

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,100
OH, YOUTH.

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
OH! WHEN DID WE BECOME
THE OLD FOGIES?

78
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I DON'T THINK SO.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,300

81
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,600

ALL RIGHT. I GOTTA GET MY VIBE ON HERE.

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,600

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500

86
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,700
- DON'T BE A BUZZ KILL.
- NO, I'M DONE.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,200
No, no, no.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,700
I GUESS THIS IS THE PART
WHERE WE FIND OUT IF I HAVE... UH,

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,300
2 LEFT FEET.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IS THIS OK?

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,200
YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,200

YOU'RE BEING GROSS.

93
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,900
JEFF, STOP IT, DON'T!

94
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,500
HEY, HEY!

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,100
GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HER!

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,300
I TOLD YOU
HE WAS COMING, CREEP.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,200
COME ON. LET'S GO.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,600
- ARE YOU OK?
- YEAH, YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,400
OK?

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,700
- SORRY.
- EXCUSE ME.

101
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
THOSE KIDS THAT JUST LEFT,
DO YOU KNOW THEM?

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,200
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.
THE GIRL'S KRISTY MARKS.

103
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
WE WERE IN EIGHTH GRADE
ORCHESTRA TOGETHER.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
ANYONE AROUND HER DIE LATELY?

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,400
SURE CAN PICK 'EM.

106
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,500
HER MOM. I HEARD IT WAS SOME KIND
OF FREAK ACCIDENT IN THEIR HOUSE.

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,900
DON'T TELL ME...
SHE'S HERE?

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,400
I'M NOT SURE YET.

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,200
- ??
- IT'S JAMMED!

110
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,900
- THAT'S HOT.
- OH, MY GOD!

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
ARE YOU OK?

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,900
YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,200
??

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,700
I SAID STAY AWAY FROM HER!

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,500
THERE YOU ARE.

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,300
I WAS WONDERING
WHERE YOU WERE.

118
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,100
- THAT LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE.
- YEAH.

122
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,500
WELL,I KNOW THAT DELIA
APPRECIATED US BEING THERE,

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,600
EVEN IF IT WASN'T
A PERFECT FIRST DATE.

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,900
I THOUGHT IT WAS
ROMANTIC.

125
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

126
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I SAW 2 BREAK-UPS,
3 HOOK-UPS,

127
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,600
AND THEN ONE KID GET SICK
ON HIS DATE'S VERY NICE SHOES.

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,800
AND ALL IN THE SHORT TIME
THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'M SORRY AGAIN
FOR BEING SO DISTRACTED.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
- I...
- DON'T BE.

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,100
YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KIDS.

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,500
YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM.

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
WAS SOMETHING THERE?

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,300
NO, IT'S JUST
I'M OFF THE CLOCK, SO LATER!

137
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,100
- OK, LATER...
- NO, I MEAN...

138
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,600
WE ARE DONE WITH OUR...
OUR CHAPERONE DUTIES,

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,500
SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A GLASS OF WINE LATER?

140
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,100
WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS
RIGHT NOW.

141
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,800
OK. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

142
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,000
DOES IT?

143
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,000
- SURE.
- OK.

144
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,400
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE ME.

145
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,200
PLEASE, HELP.

146
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

147
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,400
IT'S LATE, AND WE BOTH
HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW,

148
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,800
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME.

149
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,500
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S FINE, TOO.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,700
PLEASE, STOP THEM!

151
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,000
I HAD A GREAT TIME,

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,100
AND I REALLY THANK YOU
FOR... FOR GOING.

153
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,200
YEAH.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,100
- SO...
- BYE.

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,100
'NIGHT.

156
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,700
OK. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

157
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,900
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT BETTER BE IMPORTANT!

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
YOU'RE KRISTY'S MOM,
AREN'T YOU?

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
YES.

160
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT BOY
AWAY FROM HER.

161
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,700
- WHICH BOY?
- TIM.

162
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,100
THE ONE SHE DROVE OFF WITH.

163
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,300
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS TRYING TO HELP HER.

164
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
NO. HE'S BAD.

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,300
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHO HE IS.

166
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,100
OK, WELL, YOU HAVE TO
TELL HER. I'LL HELP YOU.

167
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,000
SHE WON'T LISTEN TO ME,
SHE NEVER HAS.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
YOU NEED TO STOP THIS.

169
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,800
YOU'RE IN EARLY,
WHAT'S UP?

170
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,900
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
AFTER THE DANCE?

171
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
NOPE. NOTHING.

172
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,400
OH, BUMMER.
WHY NOT?

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
SOMEONE'S MOM SHOWED UP.

174
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,200
WHAT, SAM'S MOM'S BACK?

175
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,400
NO, NOT SAM'S.
A GHOST MOM.

176
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
SHE WAS AT THE DANCE LAST NIGHT KEEPING
TABS ON HER DAUGHTER KRISTY.

177
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,100
OH, SHE DIDN'T LIKE
THE WAY WE CHAPERONED?

178
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,500
APPARENTLY NOT. HER DAUGHTER
LEFT WITH A COLLEGE GUY

179
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,100
AFTER DRINKING
SOME SPIKED PUNCH.PPU

180
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,800
I ROUNDED UP ALL THE KIDS WHO WERE
DRINKING, I CALLED THEIR PARENTS.

181
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,500
DON'T WORRY, SHE HAD
A DESIGNATED DRIVER.

182
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
THE PROBLEM WAS, GHOST MOM DIDN'T APPROVE
OF HIM AND THINKS HE'S BAD NEWS.

183
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,300
SO ANY IDEA
WHO THESPEOPLE ARE?

184
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
NED KNEW THE GIRL.
KRISTY FROM ORCHESTRA.

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,700
BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
THERE WE GO.

187
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,100
IT'S DEFINITELY MY GHOST.

188
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,900
DEBORAH MARKS.
SHE DIED A MONTH AGO,

189
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,500
AN ACCIDENT AT THE HOME.

190
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,100
WOW. THAT IS SOME
POWER COUPLE.

191
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,900
YEAH, SHE WAS A CIVIL
LITIGATION LAWYER.

192
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,000
???

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,600
?? FOR A SEAT
ON THE APPEALS COURT.

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
THAT'S WEIRD.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THE GHOST'S HAIR
WAS SINGED,

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,300
AND I KEEP GETTING
VISIONS OF ASHES AND BURNING.

197
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,600
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT A FIRE.

198
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,700
OR ABOUT THE BOY SHE'S TRYING TO
KEEP HER DAUGHTER AWAY FROM.

199
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,000
SO DO YOU WANT ME TO ASK NED TO
SCOPE THE GIRL OUT AT SCHOOL TOMORROW?

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
THANKS, BUT MY LOVE LIFE
CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG,

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700
IF I STILL HAVE ONE.

202
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,100
HI.

203
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,500
I'M REALLY SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

204
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
BUT I WAS A CHAPERONE
AT LAST NIGHT'S DANCE,

205
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
AND I WAS HOPING I COULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
I HAD A FEELING THE SCHOOL
WOULD BE SENDING SOMEONE.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
- COME IN, PLEASE.
- THANK YOU.

208
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,000
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE DRINKING,
SHE TOLD ME THE WHOLE STORY.

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,700
HER BOYFRIEND, OR RATHER EX-BOYFRIEND,
SPIKED HER PUNCHED.

210
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,100
JEFF. YEAH,
WE FIGURED THAT PART OUT.

211
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,400
I'M NOT SAYING
SHE'S NOT CULPABLE.

212
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
NO ONE MADE HER DRINK.

213
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,500
BUT I HESITATE
TO BE TOO SEVERE RIGHT NOW.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,700
HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY RECENTLY.

215
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,000
I HEARD.

216
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,900
WAS IT SUDDEN?

217
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,400
JUST ONE OF THOSE FREAK THINGS.
SHE TOOK A BAD FALL.

218
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
WAS THERE FIRE INVOLVED?

219
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,500
NO. WHY DO YOU ASK?

220
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,600
JUST SOMETHING THAT KRISTY SAID.

221
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
WELL, MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE PUNCH TALKING.

222
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,000
I'M JUST GLAD JEFF'S MOM
DROVE HER HOME.

223
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
ACTUALLY, A FRIEND
PICKED HER UP.

224
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,700
AN OLDER BOY,
HE WASN A GREEN CAR.

225
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
THAT WOULD BE TIM DWIGHT.

226
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,600
I APPRECIATE YOUR TELLING ME.

227
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,200
KRISTY KNOWS I DON'T
WANT HER SEEING HIM.

228
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT HE WAS
SAVING HER FROM A BAD SITUATION.

229
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,100
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT TIM IS NOT A GOOD GUY.

230
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,600
THOUGH YOU ARE NOT
THE FIRST ONE HE'S FOOLED.

231
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
DEBORAH, MY LATE WIFE,
WAS A GIFTED LAWYER,

232
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,900
BUT HER PASSION WAS FOR HELPING TROUBLED KIDS,
GIVING THEM A SECOND CHANCE.

233
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
TIM WAS ONE OF THOSE.

234
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,500
HE'D BEEN IN BRADFORD COUNTY JUVIE
FOR ROBBERY TILL 8 MONTHS AGO.

235
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,800
SHE ARRANGED A WORK PROBATION
AS ONE OF HER ASSISTANTS.

236
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I GUESS SHE THOUGHT
HE HAD SOME KIND OF FUTURE.

237
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,800
AND YOU DISAGREED?

238
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,100
LOOK, MOST OF THE KIDS THAT DEBORAH
TOOK IN WERE BASICALLY GOOD,

239
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,600
THEY JUST NEEDED A BREAK.

240
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,600
BUT NOT TIM.

241
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,700
HE CAME FROM A FAMILY
THAT CARED ABOUT HIM.

242
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
HE WAS GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY,
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

243
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,300
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF EVERY
KINDNESS MY WIFE EXTENDED HIM.

244
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,500
WE'D ALL HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF
IF THEY'D NEVER COME INTO OUR LIVES.

245
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
I KNOW THAT NOW.

246
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
HELLO?

247
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,500
- ARE YOU OK?
- YES. I'M SORRY,
I WAS JUST...

248
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
THINKING ABOUT HOW HARD
THIS MUST BE ON KRISTY.

249
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,600
WAS SHE OR ANYONE IN THE HOUSE
WHEN YOUR WIFE'S ACCIDENT HAPPENED?

250
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,800
NO. DEBORAH WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

251
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
SHE WAS MEETING ME
AT A CHARITY EVENT.

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,600
RIGHT, I THINK I READ
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT,

253
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,200
WHERE SOMEONE WALKED IN
ON THE BREAK-IN.

254
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,600
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE WAS NO BREAK-IN AT ALL.

255
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
IN FACT, WHEN I GOT HOME
FROM THE EVENT,

256
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,100
THE ALARM WAS ON,
THE DOORS WERE ALL LOCKED,

257
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
NOTHING HAD BEEN DISTURBED.

258
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
???

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,800
SO, YOU THINK THIS BAD BOY TIM
COULD HAVE KILLED YOUR GHOST?

260
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,500
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS KILLED,
BUT IN THE VISION I HAD,

261
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,100
IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WALKED IN ON A ROBBERY.

262
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
AND SHE DEFINITELY ???

263
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,000
YUM, ANCHOVIES.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,300
OK, SO SHE MUST HAVE
TRIPPED TRYING TO RUN,

265
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,500
OR SHE WAS KNOCKED OVER,
HIT HER HEAD ON THE ANDIRON.

266
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,100
YEAH, BUT WHEN THE HUSBAND CAME HOME,
THERWAS NO SIGN OF A BREAK-IN.

267
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,200
NO, HE SAID
THE ALARM WAS ON,
THE DOORS WERE LOCKED,

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,000
AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
SHOCKING TO FIND HER THERE.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
YEAH, WELL, THIS TIM
WORKED FOR HER.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,100
HE PROBABLY HAD THE KEYS, THE CODE,
AND MAYBE EVEN THE SAFE COMBATION.

271
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,300
HE COULD HAVE CLEANED UP
AND LOCKED AFTER HIMSELF.

272
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,800
HUSBAND NEVER EVEN
SUSPECTED FOUL PLAY.

273
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,100
DANG, I ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT.

274
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,300
YOU KNOW, THE GHOST SAID THAT KRISTY
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO TIM WAS.

275
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
SO MAYBE SHE WAS SAYING
HE WAS A MURDERER,

276
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
WHY WOULDN'T SHE JUST TELL ME?

277
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,900
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE,
DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

278
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
OR SHE WANTS
TO PUNISH HIM HERSELF.

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,900
NO WAY.

280
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,400
IF A MOM KNEW THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS HANGING
AROUND WITH A MURDERER,

281
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,800
SHE WOULD TELL EVERYBODY THAT SHE COULD
AND THEN SHE WOULD PUNISH HIM.

282
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,900
I KNOW. SO I'M STUMPED.

283
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,200
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HELP A GHOST
THAT WON'T COME CLEAN?

284
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,200
HEY. KRISTY, RIGHT?

285
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
YEAH...

286
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,500
OH, HEY, YOU USED
TO BE IN ORCHESTRA.

287
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,400
NED.

288
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,000
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

289
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,900
HEY, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU,
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.

290
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,600
THANKS,
BUT I'M COPING.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
HEY, I SAW YOU AT THE DANCE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

292
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,600
OH, YEAH,

293
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,200
IF I DID SOMETHING STUPID,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

294
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,200
HELLO, MY MOM BUSTED THE GUY
THAT SPIKED THE PUNCH.

295
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
NOTHING TOPS OUT
ON THE EMBARRASSING SCALE.

296
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,800
UH, HOW ABOUT
THAT CREEP WAS MY DATE?

297
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,700
WAIT, SO WHO'S THE GUY
THAT PICKED YOU UP?

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,300
TIM. WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
HE USED TO WORK FOR MY MOM,

299
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,500
WHICH IS WHY WE WERE JUST FRIENDS.
SHE DIDN'T APPROVE.

300
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,200
CAUSED PLENTY OF FIGHTS
BEFORE SHE DIED.

301
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,400
HE SEEMED COOL.
WHY DIDN'T YOUR MOM LIKE HIM?

302
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
NO, AT FIRST SHE DID.

303
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
HE HUNG OUT AT
OUR HOUSE ALL THE TIME.

304
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
HE WAS LIKE
A WORK STUDY KID.

305
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,800
YEAH, SHE GOT HIM
A CLERKSHIP, A SCHOLARSHIP.

306
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,900
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

307
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,500
I GOT KIND OF
A CRUSH ON HIM.

308
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,300
THANK YOU.

309
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,800
THEY JUST WON THIS BIG CLASS
ACTION SUIT AT MY MOM'S FIRM,

310
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,300
AND WE WERE CELEBRATING.

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
IT WAS ALWAYS FUN
WHEN TIM WAS OVER.

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,300
- SORRY ABOUT MY PARENTS.
- IT'S OK, IT WAS FUN.

313
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,700
WHEN HE WAS LEAVIN
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

314
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,000
TIM WASN'T EVEN INTO ME.

315
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,600
HE SAID HE ONLY THOUGHT I WAS INTO HIM
TO GET TO MY MOM, WHICH I DID.

316
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
I CAN SEE YOUR MOM'S POINT.
HE WAS OLDER.

317
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,600
YEAH, SHE GAVE ME
PLENTY OF REASONS.

318
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,600
BUT YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

319
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,100
LOOK, I FEEL BAD TALKING LIKE THIS
NOW THAT SHE'S GONE,

320
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,400
BUT IF HE WAS SUCH BAD NEWS,

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,400
WHY DID SHE KEEP PAYING FOR HIS SCHOOL,
HIS TUTORING, HIS TRIPS HOME?

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,700
SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

323
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,000
OK, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,900
YEAH,I MEAN,I GOTTA SAY,THE WHOLE COUGAR THING
IS A LITTLE OUTSIDE MY KICK ZONE.

325
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,400
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN IT EXPLAINS
WHY THE GHOST IS BEING SO SECRETIVE.

326
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,300
THANKS.

327
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,800
- HELLO?
- ELI, HEY, IT'S MELINDA.

328
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
LISTEN, I'M TRYING
TO DIG UP INFORMATION ON TIM,

329
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
BUT I CAN'T FIND
ANYTHING ONLINE.

330
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
IS BECAUSE
JUVIE RECORDS ARE SEALED.

331
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,100
REPORTERS CAN'T EVEN
MENTION THEM BY NAME.

332
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,200
WELL, THEN I GOTTA TALK TO HIM.
CAN YOU GET AN ADDRESS FOR ME?

333
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,300
WHY THE RUSH?
HE'S STILL IN TOWN, RIGHT?

334
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,500
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

335
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
HI! GLAD TO SEE YOU.

336
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,100
- UM, HI.
- HI, YEAH.

337
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

338
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,800
UM, CAN WE...

339
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,600
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW,

340
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,300
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT,

341
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,000
- AND...
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

342
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,800
DID I MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

343
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
NO.

344
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,000
NO, NOT AT ALL.

345
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
IT JUST SEEMS THAT YOU WERE
A LITTLE SKITTISH,

346
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,400
AND I WON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY. I JUST...

347
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL PRESSURED.

348
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,300
NOT ATLL. OK?
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT, OK?

349
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
THERE ARE NO
SECOND THOUGHTS HERE.

350
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
GOOD. 'CAUSE I JUST
SAW ON THE MARQUEE

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
THAT IT'S FRIGHT NIGHT WEEK AT
THE LITTLE THEATER.YOU WANT TO GO?


352
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,900
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU LIKE SCARY MOVIES?

353
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,500
I'D REALLY LIKE TO FIND OUT.

354
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,800
AND I'D ESPECIALLY
LIKE TO FIND OUT WITH YOU.

355
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,100
I'D LIKE THAT, TOO.

356
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,200
- ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?
- YES!

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,900
THAT WAS A LITTLE
TOO ENTHUSIASTIC.

358
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,800
NAH.

359
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
IT WAS JUST ABOUT
THE REACTION I WAS HOPING FOR.

360
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,300
- 6:00 SEEM OK?
- YEAH, 6:00 IS...

361
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
IS PERFECT, OK?

362
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
AND, UM, AND I'M GOING
TO BE WORKING,

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,400
SO YOU CAN JUST COME
AND GET ME HERE.

364
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,500
- OK.
- OK. BYE, DELIA.

365
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,500
- BYE.
- BYE.

366
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,700
WHERE IS SHE ALWAYS
RUNNING OFF TO?

367
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,300
OH, YOU'LL LRN
NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY. OK?

368
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,400
TIM?

369
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,100
HI, UM, I'M MELINDA GORDON,
I'M A FRIEND OF THE MARKS.

370
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,800
IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

371
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,100
NO, I WAS A CHAPERONE
THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE DANCE,

372
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,500
AND I SAW YOU
LEAVE WITH KRISTY.

373
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,400
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
SHE CALLED ME, OK?

374
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,300
SHE WAS BUZZED.
THAT CREEP WAS ALL OVER HER.

375
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
I JUST WANTED TO GET HER
HOME SAFE, THAT'S IT.

376
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE,

377
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,200
LIKE YOU WERE JUST
HELPING HER OUT OF A JAM.

378
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,100
SO WHAT? DID KRISTY'S DAD
SEND YOU TO CHECK THAT STORY OUT?

379
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
NO. ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT HERE FOR HIM.

380
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
I'M TRYING TO HELP THE FAMILY
DEAL WITH THEIR LOSS,

381
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
AND SO I WAS HOPING I COULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT MRS. MARKS.

382
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
WELL, LOOK, SHE'S GONE NOW,

383
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
SO REALLY, WHAT IS THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

384
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,700
WELL, I KNOW
YOU TWO WERE CLOSE.

385
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,400
KRISTY SD THAT YOU
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOTHER.

386
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,100
MRS. MARKS WAS GOOD TO ME.

387
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,600
SHE GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE
WHEN I NEEDED ONE, THAT'S IT.

388
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT.

389
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,400
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

390
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,700
YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOUR FRIEND MRS. MARKS SAID

391
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,300
WHEN SHE BAILED ME OUT OF JUVIE.

392
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,400
AND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO REALIZE
THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHARITY.

393
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,400
EVERYONE WANTS SOMETHING.

394
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,000
OK, BUT YOU JUST SAID
THAT SHE WAS GOOD TO YOU.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
SO WHICH IS IT?

396
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,400
HE'S BEEN A REAL DOWNER LATELY.

397
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,200
DID I OVERHEAR YOU SAY
YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH MRS. MARKS?

398
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,600
ARE YOU TIM'S ROOMMATE?

399
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,800
I AM. BOY, HE WAS SULKING
AROUND THE HOUSE AFTER THAT.

400
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,600
REALLY? HE WAS UPSET?
'CAUSE HE JUST SEEMED PRETTY MAD.

401
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,500
I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD
HIS THING WITH HER.

402
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,500
WHAT, LIKE A ROMANTIC THING?

403
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,800
WELL, THE WAY TIM TALKED,
MRS. MARKS WAS HIS MENTOR.

404
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,700
BUT THEN ONE DAY, HER HUSBAND
DROPPED BY UNEXPECTEDLY LOOKING FOR TIM,

405
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,800
BUT HE WAS ON
A BUSINESS TRIP WITH MRS. MARKS.

406
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,800
AND MR. MARKS HAD NO IDEA?

407
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,300
NOT THE WAY HE REACTED.
HE WAS PRETTY UPSET.

408
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,700
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
KEEP HIM AWAY FROM MY GIRL.

409
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,100
YOU DIDN'T KEEP YOUR PROMISE.

410
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,000
BECAUSE I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
DID YOU AND TIM
HAVE AN AFFAIR?

412
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,000
IS THAT WHAT
ALL THIS ASH IS ABOUT?

413
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,400
EMBERS OF YOUR LOVE?

414
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,200
STOP IT. I ASKED YOU TO
DO ONE THING. ONE THING!

415
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
DID YOUR HUSBAND FIND OUT?

416
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
WAS HE THERE THE NIGHT THAT YOU DIED?

417
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,700
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!

418
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,300
I DON'T WANT
YOUR KIND OF HELP.

419
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,400
STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

420
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,000
??

421
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,300
???

422
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,800
EXCEPT IF HE DID IT,
WHY WAS THE SAFE BROKEN INTO?

423
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS LOOKING FOR
EVIDENCE OF AN AFFAIR, YOU KNOW?

424
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,300
OUR GHOST, HIS WIFE, CAME IN,
CATCHES HIM, THEY FIGHT.

425
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,100
YOU GET THE PICTURE,
RIGHT?

426
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,900
NOW SHE'S PROTECTING HIM
OUT OF GUILT, YOU KNOW?

427
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,200
AND LEST WE FORGET,
HE'S A JUDGE.

428
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,400
SO I DOUBT THE COPS LOOKED AT THIS DEATH
OR HIS ALIBI VERY CLOSELY.

429
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,500
YEAH, BUT IF HUBBY KILLED HER,

430
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,300
WHY IS THE GHOST SET ON
KEEPING TIM AND KRISTY APART?

431
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
HELLO! DO YOU BLAME HER?

432
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,900
I MEAN, IT MUST BE SO PAINFUL
WATCHING YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER

433
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,000
HOOK UP WITH YOUR YOUNG LOVER
ONCE YOU'RE DEAD.

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,900
I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS IS ABOUT JEALOUSLY.

435
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,400
IT'S ABOUT A MOM PROTECTING
HER DAUGHTER FROM SOMETHING BAD.

436
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,800
WHAT AREN'T YOU
PUTTING IN THERE?

437
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,800
PICKLES.

438
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,000
- CABINET.
- NICE.

439
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
OK, I SAY WE HAVE A WHODUNIT COUNTDOWN
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO FIVE,

440
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,000
WHOSE PRINTS ARE ON THAT SAFE?
STARTING WITH THE HUSBAND.

441
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,900
OK, MAYBE THREE
IS A BETTER BET.

442
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,200
WHY DO WE NEED A VOTE?

443
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,700
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
HAVE IT CHECKED OUT?

444
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,200
BECAUSE MR. MARKS
WILL NEVER ALLOW IT.

445
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,500
WELL, THEN MAYBE THAT
TELLS US SOMETHING, TOO.

446
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,000
NO.

447
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,600
LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
THERE WAS NO ROBBERY.

448
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,300
NOW WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

449
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,300
I HAVE A GIFT.

450
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
I CAN SEE GHOSTS, AND...

451
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,900
THE OTHER DAY,
YOUR WIFE'S SPIRIT WAS WITH ME.

452
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,100
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

453
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,900
SHE GAVE ME A VISION ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED THE NIGHT THAT SHE DIED,

454
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,100
AND IT LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD
WALKED IN ON A ROBBERY.

455
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,600
WHICH IS ODD, CONSIDERING
YOU SAID THERE WASN'T ONE.

456
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU BOTH TO LEAVE.

457
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,200
THE SAFE BEHIND
THAT PICTURE FRAME,

458
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,900
IT HAD BEEN RUMMAGED.

459
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,200
AND SHE WAS EITHER HIT OR TRIPPED
OR FELL SOMEWHERE OVER THERE.

460
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,700
THAT INFORMATION
WASN'T IN ANY OF THE NEWSPAPERS.

461
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,900
SOMETIMES SPIRITS
STAY EARTH-BOUND.

462
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,300
IT'S USUALLY
FOR A REASON.

463
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,000
I THINK THAT SHE'S
PROTECTING SOMEONE...

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
TIM, KRISTY, OR...
MAYBE EVEN YOU.

465
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,500
AND WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE
TO PROTECT ME FROM?

466
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME,

467
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,700
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF.

468
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,500
MELINDA SPOKE
WITH TIM'S ROOMMATE.

469
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,300
HE SAID YOU'D BEEN THERE LOOKING
FOR TIM BEFORE YOUR WIFE DIED.

470
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,700
HE WAS WORRIED THAT YOU THOUGHT
MAYBE THEY HAD HAD AN AFFAIR.

471
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,400
OK, THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

472
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,700
UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR
WANTING MY WIFE'S MEMORY TARNISHED.

473
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,100
ACTUALLY, WE THINK
IT'S YOUR STERLING EPUTATION

474
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
YOUR WIFE IS TRYING
TO KEEP UNTARNISHED.

475
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,000
YOU KEEP SAYING
THERE WASN'T A FIRE,

476
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,700
BUT I SEE ASHES;
SOMETHING BURNING.

477
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,100
WAS THERE ANYTHING
MISSING FROM THE SAFE,

478
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,900
ANYTHING AT ALL THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN BURNED?

479
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,800
I HAVEN'T HAD THE HEART
TO OPEN IT SINCE SHE DIED.

480
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I'VE BEEN AFRAID
OF WHAT I MIGHT FIND.

481
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
LIKE EVIDENCE OF AN AFFAIR?

482
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
NONE OF IT MATTERS NOW.

483
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
I LOVED MY WIFE,

484
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,500
AND IF TIM HAD SOMETNG
TO DO WITH HER DEATH,

485
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
THEN YES,
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

486
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,300
BUT IT'S NONE OF YOUR CONCERN,
SO IF YOU'LL PLEASE EXCUSE ME...

487
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,800
SO THE BURNING PAPER IN YOUR VISION,
ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS?

488
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,900
IT WAS CHARRED, 

489
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,500
BUT I COULD MAKE OUT THAT IT WAS
A WOMAN'S HANDWRITING, SO...

490
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
SEE? CAN I CALL IT OR WHAT!

491
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,200
A LOVE LETTER.
IT'S GOTTA BE.

492
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
THE GHOST COULD HAVE BEEN
BURNING IT.

493
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,900
TIM WALKED IN,
THEY FOUGHT, AND KABONK!

494
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,800
OR TIM COULD HAVE BEEN BURNING IT
WHEN MRS. MARKS WALKED IN.

495
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,900
OR MR. MARKS BURNED IT.

496
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,400
WELL, ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT,
THE PAPER WAS BURNED.

497
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,600
SO SOMEONE WANTED WHATEVER WAS
ON IT TO BE KEPT A SECRET.

498
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,400
YEAH, AND THE GHOST
STILL DOES.

499
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,300
OOH, I'LL GET IT.

500
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,000
MAYBE SAM IS EARLY.

501
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,800
KRISTY!

502
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,100
WHAT'S WRONG?

503
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,000
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
- DO WHAT?

504
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,400
THE COPS JUST TOOK TIM IN FOR QUESTIONING
ABOUT SOME SUPPOSED ROBBERY AT MY HOUSE!

505
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,200
MY DAD HAD THE SAFE FINGERPRINTED
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID!

506
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,100
WELL, IF HIS FINGERPRINTS
WERE THERE...

507
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,800
OF COURSE THEY WERE THERE!

508
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
HE WAS MY MOM'S ASSISTANT!

509
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,600
KRISTY,
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

510
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
BUT MAYBE YOUR FEELINGS
FOR TIM ARE CLOUDING YOUR JUDGMENT.

511
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,300
HE'S INNOCENT!

512
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
HE WAS WITH ME,
WE WERE AT THE BOOKSTORE.

513
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,500
- DID YOU TELL YOUR DAD THAT?
- YEAH.

514
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,800
MY DAD THINKS THAT
I'M JUST LYING TO PROTECT TIM,

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
AND HE WON'T EVEN
LOOKT ME.

516
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,100
LIKE I WOULD PROTECT MY OWN
MOM'S MURDERER, THAT'S INSANE!

517
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,400
LOOK, YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS A HISTORY
AND A CRIMINAL RECORD,

518
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,200
AND MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT HE ISN'T WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

519
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,900
I KNOW THAT HE WOULD
NOT HURT ANYONE.

520
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,500
AND IF YOU DO TALK TO
GHOSTS LIKE MY DAD SAID,

521
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK MY MOM?

522
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,400
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
SHE'D TALK TO ME.

523
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,800
SHE'S MAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T
KEEP YOU AND TIM APART.

524
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,700
WHAT?!

525
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,300
SOMETIMES I JUST HATE HER.

526
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,200
THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANTED.

527
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,600
THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT?

528
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,900
PLEASE, JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED,

529
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,200
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN FIX THIS.

530
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
I REALLY WISH I COULD.

531
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,800
BUT SOME SECRETS
ARE BETTER LEFT ALONE.

532
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,300
I GOT NOTHIN'.
TIM'S STILL BEING QUESTIONED.

533
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,800
DETECTIVE BLAIR COULDN'T
TELL ME ANYTHING YET.

534
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
WELL, DID THEY FIND ANYTHING
MISSING FROM THE SAFE?

535
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
WHAT PART OF "I GOT NOTHIN'"
DIDN'T YOU GET?

536
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,900
ALL RIGHT. SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU COULD PULL SOME WEIGHT IN THERE.

537
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
NO, BUT APPARENTLY
JUDGE MARKS DOES.

538
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,700
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THIS
AS A POSSIBLE MURDER CASE.

539
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
MY GUESS IS, TIM'S GOING TO
BE IN THERE FOR A WHILE.

540
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,300
OH, I HOPE I DID THE RIGHT THING
BY HAVING THEM CHECK THAT SAFE.

541
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,900
DON'T BE SUCH A SOFTIE.

542
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,400
YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF YOU HAD A VISION
OF MRS. MARKS WALKING IN ON A BREAK-IN.

543
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,700
TIM'S PRINTS ARE
ALL OVER THAT SAFE,

544
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,300
OK? HE SEEMS
PRETTY GUILTY TO ME.

545
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,900
YEAH, BUT...

546
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,700
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS

547
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,300
BECAUSE DEBORAH NEVER ACTUALLY
SAID SHE SAW TIM DO IT.

548
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,900
WE BOTH KNOW SHE JUST
SAYING WHAT SHE DID.

549
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,700
OK, STILL...
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR

550
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,700
PLEAS THAT KRISTY SAID
SHE SWEARS HE WAS WITH HER.

551
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,000
SHE'S NO MORE RELIABLE
THAN HER MOTHER.

552
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,600
EXCEPT...

553
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE FALLING FOR TIM, TOO.

554
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,700
NO! ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OUT LOUD,

555
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,000
WHICH WOULD BE EASIER
WITHOUT SO MANY INTERRUPTIONS.

556
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
SORRY.

557
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
THE GHOST SAID THAT KRISTY
DOESN'T KNOW WHO TIM IS,

558
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,800
SO COULDN'T THAT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HIS RECORD?

559
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,100
I MEAN, MAYBE
THAT'S WHAT SHE BURNED.

560
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,000
- THE POLICE REPORT, OR...
- WHICH WE CAN'T ACCESS.

561
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,700
YEAH, BUT WE COULD TALK
TO SOMEBODY WHO KNEW HIM,

562
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,300
HIS MOM ONLY LIVES LIKE
AN HOUR AWAY... CRAP!

563
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
MY DATE WITH SAM!
I ALMOST FORGOT.

564
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
I KNEW YOU DIDN'T
WEAR THAT FOR ME.

565
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
I CAN'T CANCEL, OK?

566
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,700
- CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?
- I'D LOVE TO,

567
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,900
BUT STARTING AT 3:00,
I GOT BACK-TO-BACK CASES.

568
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,100
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF I RUSH, I'LL MAKE ITBACK IN TIME.

569
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,600
I ONLY FOUND OUT MY SON WAS IN TROUBLE
AGAIN WHEN I CALLED HIS APARTMENT.

570
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,800
TIM DIDN'T WANT ME
TO BE UPSET, I GUESS.

571
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,600
YOU'RE A FRIEND
OF MRS. MARKS?

572
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,700
YES.

573
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,300
SHE THOUGHT A LOT OF YOUR SON.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

574
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,400
YEAH.

575
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,900
SHE WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON,
REALLY BELIEVED IN TIM.

576
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,300
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

577
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,800
THERE'S NO WAY HE HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HER DEATH.

578
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,600
BUT HE WAS ARRESTED
BEFORE FOR ROBBERY.

579
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
HE WAS INNOCENT THEN, TOO.

580
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,600
TIM'S GIRLFRIEND'S
OLDER BROTHER DID IT.

581
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,500
SO WHY DID TIM TAKE THE BLAME?

582
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,300
THE GIRL CAME TO HIM CRYING,

583
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,800
SAID THAT HER BROTHER
BROKE INTO AN ELECTRONICS STORE.

584
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,400
TIM WENT TO STOP HIM,
ONLY THE COPS SHOWED UP.

585
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,700
HE KNEW THE OLDER BOY
HAD 2 STRIKES,

586
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,200
SO HE SAID HE DID IT.

587
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,900
DO YOU MIND IF LOOK AT SOME
OF HIS THINGS? IT MIGHT HELP.

588
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,000
YOU CAN SCOUR THE WHOLE HOUSE
IF YOU LIKE.

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I JUST WANT MY BOY'S
NAME CLEARED.

590
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,200
THAT'S TIM AND HIS
BROTHER GEORGE.

591
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,600
- OLDER?
- MMM, BY ABOUT 8 YEARS.

592
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,800
TIM WAS AN UNEXPECTED BLESSING.

593
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,100
<i>THE LITTLE PRINCE.</i>

594
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
THAT WAS TIM'S FIRST BOOK.

595
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,500
THERE'S A PAGE MISSING.

596
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,300
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

597
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,300
GOD KNOWS.

598
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,000
IT'S A WONDER THIS THING
HAS ANY PAGES LEFT AT ALL.

599
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,700
TIM JUST LOVED
THAT STORY.

600
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
IT CAME HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL WITH HIM.

601
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,100
WELL, THAT'S SWEET.

602
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,900
USUALLY IT'S BLANKETS
AND BOOTIES.

603
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
I'M AFRAID THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE FIT OUR TIMMY.

604
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,700
HE WAS ALMOST 6 MONTHS OLD
WHEN WE BROUGHT HIM HOME.

605
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
WHY? WAS SOMETHING WRONG?

606
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,800
NO, IT WAS JUST
THE AGENCY PROTOCOL.

607
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,800
TIM WAS ADOPTED.

608
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,500
I RUINED EVERYTHING.

609
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,200
IT'S OK.

610
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,800
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP SECRETS ANYMORE.

611
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,200
I KNOW WHY YOU CARE
SO MUCH ABOUT TIM,

612
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,300
AND I KNOW WHY YOU DON'T WANT
HIM TO BE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

613
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
HE'S HER BROTHER,
ISN'T HE?

614
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,300
YES.

615
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,100
TIM'S MY SON.

616
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,100
IT WAS THE HARDEST THING
I EVER DID,LETTING HIM GO.

617
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,100
AND THEN WHEN I FOUND HIM AGAIN,
IT WAS LIKE A GIFT.

618
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

619
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,400
DOUGLAS AND I FELL IN LOVE
WHEN HE WAS IN LAW SCHOOL.

620
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
I WAS AN UNDERGRAD.

621
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,800
NOT LONG AFTER THAT,
I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

622
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
AND HE DIDN'T
WANT CHILDREN YET?

623
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
IT WASN'T HIS.

624
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,200
IT WAS SOMEBODY
I DATED BEFORE HIM.

625
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,400
SO I TOLD DOUG
THAT I WAS TAKING A YEAR ABROAD,

626
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,000
AND I WENT HOME
TO HAVE THE BABY.

627
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,400
I TRIED TO KEEP HIM,
BUT I WAS 18,

628
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
BARELY OLDER THAN KRISTY.

629
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,300
IN THE END, I HAD TO DO
WHAT WAS BEST FOR MY BABY.

630
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,300
AND YOU NEVER TOLD DOUGLAS?

631
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,500
I TRIED TO PUT IT BEHIND ME,

632
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,400
BUT IT HAUNTED ME.

633
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,300
I LOOKED FOR TIM IN THE
FACE OF EVERY BOY HIS AGE.

634
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,800
AND FINALLY I HIRED
A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

635
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
AND HE FOUND TIM IN JAIL.

636
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,800
I COULDN'T STAND SEEING
MY BOY IN THAT PLACE.

637
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,600
I HAD TO GET HIM OUT.

638
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,500
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL YOUR FAMILY?

639
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
OR HIS?

640
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,000
I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WAS A WAY I COULD
HELP HIM WITHOUT STIRRING THINGS UP.

641
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,300
AND THEN KRISTY FELL FOR TIM.

642
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,800
SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A GOOD TIME TO SAY SOMETHING.

643
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,000
AND I WOULD HAVE IF IT WEREN'T FOR
DOUGLAS' APPOINTMENT TO THE BENCH.

644
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
SO I FIGURED I WOULD JUST KEEP
TIM AND KRISTY APART

645
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,200
UNTIL HE WAS CONFIRMED,
AND THEN I'D TELL EVERYONE.

646
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,100
SO THE BUSINESS TRIP,
WITH TIM,

647
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,800
THAT WAS REALLY JUST TO
SPEND TIME WITH YOUR CHILD?

648
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
YES.

649
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,700
AND THEN A WEEK LATER,

650
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,600
I LOST THE CHANCE
OF EVER TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.

651
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,600
I'D STOPPED BY THE HOUSE
TO GET MY CELL PHONE.

652
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
I COULDN'T HELP
BUT THINK IT WAS TIM.

653
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,300
MAYBE HE WAS GETTING
BACK AT ME ABOUT KRISTY.

654
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,800
AND THEN I SAW THAT THE NOTE I WROTE HIM
WHEN HE WAS A BABY WAS GONE.

655
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,300
I PANICKED.

656
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,400
KRISTY WAS ALWAYS GOING ON ABOUT
HOW I WAS IN LOVE WITH TIM.

657
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,600
I MEAN, MAYBE HE THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS A LOVE LETTER.

658
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,800
SO I CLEANED UP.

659
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,900
I COULDN'T LET ANYONE
KNOW THAT TIM WAS THERE.

660
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,700
I FELT SO RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BREAK-IN, FOR EVERYTHING.

661
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I BROUGHT IT ALL ON MYSELF.

662
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,800
AND THAT'S WHEN
I SAW IT.

663
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,700
I DOT BLAME HIM
FOR BURNING IT.

664
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,100
IT WAS THE MISSING PAGE
FROM HIS BOOK, WASN'T IT?

665
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,300
IT WAS CLOSED ADOPTION.

666
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
A PERSONAL NOTE
WASN'T PERMITTED.

667
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
SO YOU RIPPED OUT THE PAGE,
AND YOU GA HIM THE BOOK.

668
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
I WANTED HIM TO HAVE
SOMETHING FROM ME.

669
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,600
AND I KEPT THE NOTE ALL THAT TIME
BECAUSE IT WAS A PIECE OF HIM.

670
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
DEBORAH, I...

671
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
I DON'T THINK TIM THOUGHT
IT WAS A LOVE LETTER.

672
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,000
I THINK HE KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS,

673
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,100
AND THAT'S WHY
HE'S BEEN SO UPSET.

674
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,000
HE WASN'T MAD, HE...

675
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
HE WAS MOURNING YOU.

676
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,900
BUT IF TIM KNEW THAT HE WAS MY SON,
WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL KRISTY?

677
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,100
UNLESS...

678
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,100
HE THINKS HE'S PROTECTING HER.
HIS SISTER.

679
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,400
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

680
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,800
AT SOME POINT,
YOU BROKE INTO THAT SAFE,

681
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,400
AND EITHER YOU OR TIM BURNT A NOTE
THAT YOU FOUND INSIDE OF IT.

682
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,300
JUST TELL ME WHY YOU
WERE IN THE SAFE THAT NIGHT.

683
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
BECAUSE...

684
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,700
I COULDN'T LOOK
AT MY OWN MOM ANYMORE.

685
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,600
IT WAS SICK.SHE FALLS
FOR SOMEBO THAT I LIKE,

686
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,500
AND THENAKES IT SEEM
LIKE I DID SOTHING WRONG.

687
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,800
AND MY DAD WOULDN'T LISTEN.

688
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,200
IT WAS LIKE I DIDN'T EXIST.

689
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,100
AND I NEEDED OUT.

690
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,900
SO WHY WAS TIM HERE?

691
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,000
TO TRY AND STOP ME.

692
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
KRISTY, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

693
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
NO, I REALLY DO.

694
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,400
WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?
WHERE IS IT?

695
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,200
WHERE DOES SHE KEEP
HER CASH?!

696
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,000
ONE OF THESE THINGS
HAS GOT TO HAVE MONEY IN IT!

697
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,300
OH, MY GOD, SOMEONE'S COMING!
COME ON, LET'S GO!

698
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,300
THEN WE RAN OUT
THE BACK DOOR.

699
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I SWEAR, WE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT HAD HAPPENED

700
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
TIM DIDN'T BREAK IN?

701
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,000
IT WAS KRISTY?

702
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,900
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING
WHEN THEY BROUGHT TIM IN TODAY?

703
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,000
I WAS AFRAID THAT IF
I SAID HE WAS HERE,

704
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,400
IT WOULD MAKE THINGS
WORSE FOR HIM.

705
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,600
BUT I KNEW THAT
HE DID NOT HURT MY MOM,

706
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,900
BECAUSE HE WAS WITH ME
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

707
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,200
I DID THAT, TOO...

708
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,000
TRIED TO HIDE THE TRUTH
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY.

709
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,600
BUT THE LIES HURT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

710
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,500
KRISTY, YOUR MOM'S HERE.

711
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,800
AND WHAT TIM FOUND OUT THAT NIGHT,
SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW, TOO.

712
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,000
HE WAS HER SON.

713
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,800
SHE'D PUT HIM UP FOR ADOPTION
WHEN HE WAS A BABY.

714
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,100
HE'S... MY BROTHER?

715
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
WHAT'S GOING ON?

716
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,900
DADDY...

717
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
YOUR WIFE IS HERE.

718
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

719
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,100
I COULD NEVER
UNDERSTAND,
WHY ME?

720
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,400
I MEAN, THERE WERE
PLENTY OF OTHER KIDS IN JUVIE,

721
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,600
ONES THAT COULD HAVE USED THE BREAK.
BUT WHY'D SHE PICK ME?

722
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,200
I KNEW IT WASN'T
BECAUSE OF WHAT KRISTY SAID.

723
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,800
I MEAN, IT JUST
WASN'T LIKE THAT.

724
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,700
AND THEN YOU FOUND THE NOTE?

725
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,500
I MUST HAVE READ THAT
BOOK A THOUSAND TIMES.

726
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,000
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

727
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,500
AND I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT PAGE.

728
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,200
BUT WHY HIDE IT?

729
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,300
WHY HIDE IT FROM HER FAMILY
THAT I WAS HER SON,FROM HER FAMILY?

730
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,400
I COULD ONLY THINK THAT IT WAS
BECAUSE SHE WAS ASHAMED OF ME.

731
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
OH, GOD, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

732
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,100
I CHERISHED YOU.

733
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,400
SHE WASN'T ASHAMED OF YOU.

734
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
SHE CHERISHED YOU.

735
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,700
SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
HOW SORRY SHE IS.

736
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,700
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOUR FAMILY
WOULD DO, OR MINE.

737
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,700
I'D BROKEN ALL KINDS OF CLOSED
ADOPTION RULES IN CONTACTING YOU.

738
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,300
SHE WAS SCARED.

739
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,900
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
TO YOUR FAMILY, AND HERS.

740
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,500
BUT SHE'S HERE.

741
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,200
I WAS ALWAYS SO SCARED.

742
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,800
SINCE THE MOMENT
YOU WERE BORN,

743
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,400
LOOKING AT YOUR...
YOUR FACE.

744
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,100
I LOVED YOU SO MUCH,
AND IT TERRIFIED ME.

745
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
I WAS SCARED THAT...

746
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,900
THAT I COULDN'T
TAKE CARE OF YOU,

747

00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
OR THAT YOUR NEW FAMILY
WOULDN'T BE GOOD TO YOU,

748
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,700
OR WHEN I FOUND YOAGAIN,
I WAS SCARED OF WHO YOU'D BE.

749
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I JUST WANTED
SO BADLY TO DO GOOD;

750
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,100
TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT.

751
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,600
BUT IT ALL WENT WRONG.

752
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,100
SHE WAS SCARED

753
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,500
THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEEDED.

754
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,500
SHE REALLY WANTED TO DO
WHAT WAS BEST FOR YOU,

755
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,400
AND SHE'S AFRAID
SHE DIDN'T.

756
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,000
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

757
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,000
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

758
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,300
YOU TELL HER SHE DID
THE BEST SHE COULD.

759
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,200
SHE'S LISTENING.

760
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,400
SHE DID SO MUCH RIGHT.

761
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,100
YOU GAVE ME A GREAT LIFE,
AND A WONDERFUL FAMILY
THAT LOVES ME.

762
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,100
AND WHEN I NEEDED HELP,
WHEN I GOT IN TROUBLE,

763
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,200
YOU GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE.

764
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,700
AND I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED.

765
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,300
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
PROUD OF ME, I PROMISE.

766
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,700
OH, SWEETHEART.

767
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,400
I ALREADY AM.

768
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,200
SHE SAID SHE ALREADY IS
PROUD OF YOU.

769
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

770
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,000
IN THAT NOTE
THAT YOU LEFT FOR ME,

771
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,200
I ONLY REMEMBER
THE FIRST PART...

772
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,400
"MY TIM, MY LITTLE PRINCE,

773
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,000
ALL THE PLACES
YOU'LL GO... "

774
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,300
"ALL THE WORLDS
YOU WILL SEE.

775
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
"MY LOVE IS ALWAYS
WITH YOU.

776
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,300
"I WRAP YOU IN IT,

777
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,700
"LIKE A PRINCE'S CAPE,

778
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,900
MY SWEET, SWEET BOY."

779
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,100
THE WORLDS YOU'LL SEE.

780
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,400
MY LOVE IS ALWAYS WITH YOU,

781
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
WRAPPED AROUND YOU
LIKE A PRINCE'S CAPE,

782
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,400
MY SWEET, SWEET BOY.

783
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
SHE'S READY.

784
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,200
SHE'S NOT SCARED ANYMORE.

785
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,800
THANK YOU.

786
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,700
??

787
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,300
PLEASE LEAVE ME A MESSAGE
AFTER THE BEEP.??

788
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,400
YEAH, HI. UM, IT'S ME.
UM, MELINDA.

789
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
I HOPE THAT, UH,

790
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,600
WELL, I HOPE THAT YOU'RE
GETTING ALL OF MY MESSAGES.

791
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,900
UM, I'M STILL HOPING
FOR THAT... THAT RAIN CHECK,

792
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,300
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
THAT I'VE MENTIONED NOW,

793
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,200
WELL, A MILLION TIMES,
ACTUALLY.

794
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,100
OK.

795
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,900
COULD YOU...
COULD YOU JUST...

796
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
CALL ME BACK?

797
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
COME IN.

798
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,300
- HI.
- HEY.

799
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
I'M SORRY I FLAKED.

800
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,200
I WAS JUST WONDERING
ABOUT THAT RAIN CHECK.

801
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

802
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,900
DIDN'T YOU GET MY MESSAGES?

803
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,800
NO, NOT YET.

804
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,200
I SAW THAT YOU CALLED.

805
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,900
SO YOU JUST
DIDN'T PICK UP.

806
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
NO.

807
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,100
IT WAS 7:00 AND I WAS STANDING ON
THE DEWALK IN FRONT OF A DARK STORE.

808
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,200
I'D BEEN THERE
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

809
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,200
AS ADORABLE AND COCKAMAMIE
AS YOUR EXCUSE SURELY IS,

810
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,400
I DIDN'T PICK UP.

811
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,100
LOOK,I KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

812
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,400
WHAT? WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

813
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,000
THAT YOU'RE NOT READY
TO START DATING YET,

814
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,500
AND IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
I UNDERSTAND,

815
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,600
AND THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS.

816
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
NO, BUT I AM READY!

817
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,800
YOUR HEAD SAYS YOU ARE...

818
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,400
BUT YOUR HEART
SAYS NO, NOT YET.

819
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,800
NO, IT DOESN'T!

820
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,900
OK? MY HEART
DOESN'T SAY THAT.

821
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,300
I THINK I WOULD KNOW
WHAT MY HEART SAYS.

822
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,000
MELINDA, I GET IT. IT'S OK.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO...

823
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,200
OK.

824
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,500
WHAT ABOUT THE RAIN CHECK?

825
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
I'M FREE RIGHT NOW,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

826
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,600
YEAH.

827
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,300
I'M READY.

828
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,700
ME TOO.

829
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,700
YOU'RE GONNA FREEZE.
HERE, TAKE THIS.

830
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
OH, THANK YOU.

831
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,300
