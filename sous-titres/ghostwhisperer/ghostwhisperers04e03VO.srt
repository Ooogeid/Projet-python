00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on Ghost Whisperer

2
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:03,117
Give me 360.

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,320
- Clear?  - Clear.

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:07,289
He's alive.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,387
Who is he?

6
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:09,101
His name's Eli James.

7
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,573
He is a psychology professor

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,640
with a therapy practice at the university.

9
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:14,875
So I take it you haven't seen any more ghosts?

10
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,856
- Safe assumption.  - That's a lie!

11
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:19,174
You can't see them, but you can hear them.

12
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,088
So the good news is, I am not dead.

13
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,877
The bad news is I am going to spend the rest of my life

14
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:24,631
listening to people who are?

15
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,001
and helping them.

16
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,742
Please help me.

17
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,034
I need you to help me.

18
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:30,058
Why wouldn't you just listen?

19
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:31,320
I know you can hear...

20
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:35,986
The ghost chatter is somewhat down. Doesn't sound like the floor

21
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:37,502
of the New York Stock Exchange in my head any more

22
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:39,910
But there is this one little bugger

23
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,371
who speaks up every night by humming.

24
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,073
Sounds like you have a new since ghost,

25
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,088
they pass to you, because they are scared

26
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:53,103
and no one's listening.

27
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:55,302
Usually you try to help them as they can

28
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,010
or learn to tune them out

29
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,107
and our time is up for today.

30
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:00,553
Wow, what?

31
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,311
Now I know how my psych patients feel?

32
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,705
I have someone coming to perform CPR on my computer

33
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:08,491
and by the way, antique store

34
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,165
My tech can fix anything.

35
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:12,713
Oh, and he's even early.

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,905
Only because all his friends are hanging out at the arcade leader.

37
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:17,016
Oh, it's working.

38
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:18,151
You're my hero.

39
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,647
If I lost the inventory, your mom would quit.

40
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:21,283
The files are all there,

41
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:22,775
and I just have to defrag your hard drives.

42
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,641
Please watch your language,we have company.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,904
Ned, Eli. Eli, Ned.

44
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:28,642
Cool. You are the guy who hears the ghosts.

45
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,882
You're Delia's kid

46
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,386
The one who hears about the ghosts.

47
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,531
It's wild you all of a sudden get the gifts.

48
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. There was a catch.

49
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:36,365
I had to die first.

50
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,766
But good job on the ..

51
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,658
Alt world-2.

52
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,982
Is this version high for now?

53
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,134
Yeah, sort of kinks...

54
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:46,350
but if you overclock your rig, it kicks

55
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,515
Your kid's amazing...

56
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,620
Wait, this is not the archive you are

57
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:51,008
Me and my friends, yeah.

58
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,260
I am online right now.

59
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,414
That's my avatar.

60
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,826
Avatar?

61
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,951
What is that? Some sort of ancient weapon?

62
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,674
No, it's me,

63
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,950
or what I look like in the game,

64
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,575
an animated version.

65
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,433
- It could look like...  - The actual gamer

66
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,571
or be a complete fantasy

67
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,845
You can pick hair, skin colour, clothes,

68
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:12,109
and you can be anyone do anything.

69
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:14,664
Yeah, that's why I keep a closed eye.

70
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,562
See, there you are.

71
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,817
you just went virtual

72
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:21,891
Yeah, but I'll never wear my hair like that.

73
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,287
Your avatar does.

74
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,687
So instead of going to an actual place to play games--

75
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,054
Ooh, could you make me taller?

76
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,020
There are games in here.

77
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:33,020
Mostly it's a place where kids go to hang out in world.

78
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,254
And it's educational.

79
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,921
I mean, you can meet people from around the world.

80
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,954
Ned, show her.

81
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,621
Oh, here come the campus crusaders,

82
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:42,721
Or...

83
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,454
Are they girl scouts?

84
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,854
The fringe girls. They're from the Halliwell Academy,

85
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,887
Private school. In real life,

86
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,187
yhey wear uniforms.

87
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,854
It's like through the looking glass.

88
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,220
Nothing is ever what it seems.

89
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,787
What about the guy who's standing next to him?

90
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:58,787
I mean, why is he giving Ned's avatar the evil eye?

91
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:01,220
That's Phoenix. He's always here,

92
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:02,988
Always with that same geek look.

93
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:05,721
Yeah, but, I mean, you guys see the way that he's looking at Ned.

94
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,487
Not really.

95
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:11,088
He looks the same to me.

96
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,454
Well, how about now?

97
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,754
I mean, he's looking right at me.

98
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,153
Oh, come on!

99
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:30,253
What?

100
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,420
What's happening? He's not moving.

101
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,821
His gamer must have left his machine.

102
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:36,287
Didn't log off.

103
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,220
Who are you?

104
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,088
Who are you?! Where am I?!

105
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,153
Who is that? What's happening?

106
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,153
Ok, just--just try to calm down.

107
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,821
Where is she?!

108
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,687
-That can't be good.  -That was a ghost, right?

109
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:56,621
Who--who are you looking for?

110
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,454
I don't have control!

111
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,120
Ok, that wasn't an avatar I just heard by any chance, was it?

112
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,621
Yes, Phoenix, or a ghost that looked just like him.

113
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,253
I swear it was nothing I did.

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,021
No, it was something I did.

115
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:23,554
I just drew a ghost out of my machine.

116
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,521
Did that ghost just trash your store

117
00:04:58,588 --> 00:04:59,987
because he was angry about something?

118
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:02,387
I once had a patient in therapy

119
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:04,521
who compulsively smashed animal figurines.

120
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:06,821
No, he was more confused than anything.

121
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,420
He said he wasn't in control.

122
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,654
Like the real world's a new kind of game to him?

123
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,637
Oh, that's so trippy.

124
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,237
Is any of this even possible?

125
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,570
I've seen ghosts interact with electronics before,

126
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:18,804
But nothing like this.

127
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,270
What would make a ghost decide to go into a game?

128
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,237
Why would he come out looking like his avatar?

129
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:25,704
Sometimes spirits appear as they remember themselves,

130
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,138
So if he died playing the game,

131
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,270
maybe he thinks he's his own avatar.

132
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,604
Didn't I hear him say, "where is she?"

133
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,270
Means he was looking for someone.

134
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:34,671
Phoenix hangs out mostly with one of the fringe girls.

135
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,671
Ok, where do they hang?

136
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:37,971
I'll show you. Come on.

137
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,637
Bookstore cafe.

138
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:45,871
Free internet and half-decent coffee.

139
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:49,337
He's here.

140
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:53,270
Tell me about the girl he likes.

141
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:56,270
I don't know her name, but her avatar's name is Sedona.

142
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:59,203
Looks like he just found her.

143
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,337
Hi, honey.

144
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,237
Wait, point me in his direction.

145
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,504
I'm dying to ask him some questions.

146
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,370
He's gone.

147
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,504
And so is Sedona.

148
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,837
Sorry, I couldn't sleep.

149
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,270
I kept thinking about this ghost.

150
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:26,071
Oh, Phoenix, the avatar ghost.

151
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,671
Ned says he was always online,

152
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:29,871
So I'm going with the theory

153
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:31,637
That he died while playing.

154
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:34,671
Death by gaming O.D. Wow.

155
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:37,004
Although, you know, it's very possible in college,

156
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:39,637
I may have collapsed after 10 straight hours of playing asteroids.

157
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,737
You sure that wasn't the kegger?

158
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:44,237
I did a search for anyone who died while gaming,

159
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,138
and suprisingly, there're a few.

160
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:47,504
I've narrowed it down to that guy,

161
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,504
One in Korea and one in Oregon, Curtis Green.

162
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,737
Wait, died after 5 straight days of gaming. Huh.

163
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,038
What, he didn't eat, he didn't sleep,

164
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:57,270
He didn't drink?

165
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,004
Nope, he died of dehydration.

166
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,203
Wait, shouldn't the internet gaming people

167
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,570
be able to tell you who Phoenix really was?

168
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:04,237
Yeah, maybe, except the only thing I could access

169
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:05,771
was his avatar bio.

170
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,104
FYI, he's into fast cars and coldplay.

171
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,004
Coldplay. Could be any teenager anywhere, huh?

172
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,971
Exactly, it's the world wide web for god sakes.

173
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:14,537
He could be a 10-year-old in Siberia.

174
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,203
Wait, what about the girl from the bookstore?

175
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,004
She hung out with Phoenix online.

176
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,837
Maybe she knows something about him.

177
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,937
That's what I'm hoping.

178
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,038
That looks like the girl that Phoenix was haunting yesterday.

179
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,871
I'm betting that's Sedona.

180
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,837
And those are her laced-up pals

181
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:36,470
with the tatted up avatars. Got it.

182
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:38,804
So assuming this guy died from gaming,

183
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:41,138
Here's what Mel's come up with.

184
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:43,971
These are from all around the world.

185
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,038
Would the ghost have an accent?

186
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:47,570
This one didn't.

187
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,170
So, uh...

188
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,038
Go make nice. See what she knows about Phoenix

189
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:54,804
and this Curtis kid from Oregon.

190
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,470
She doesn't look much like a chit-chatter.

191
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,404
Than use some other language.

192
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,570
Oh, well, that was

193
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,904
a relatively painless inventory,

194
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,704
besides the little computer glitch,

195
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,604
or should I say computer ghost.

196
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,704
Only apparently he's an out here ghost now

197
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:17,437
because his avatar has not budged since yesterday.

198
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,871
Is that what you've been watching all day?

199
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:21,504
And all night. I'm obsessed.

200
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,170
I mean, I have no idea how to work my own avatar,

201
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:24,270
But I can't stop watching his.

202
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,637
I mean, I drew a spirit

203
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:28,004
out of a computer game. How freaky is that?

204
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,771
Yeah, half the time I'm online,

205
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,937
I am sure that there's a ghost in there.

206
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:33,671
You know, speaking metaphorically.

207
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:35,671
Yeah, well, this one might actually be. And if he is,

208
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,704
he's a ghost that communicates with the living,

209
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:40,004
which is why I'd like to figure out what his story is.

210
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:43,038
Yeah, it sounds like maybe this guy is into cosplay,

211
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:46,071
You know, people who dress up like their avatars.

212
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:47,804
No, I don't know, and how do you?

213
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,138
Well, when you have a teenager, it's kind of dangerous not to know.

214
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,671
Hey, I bet you did't know

215
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:54,804
that it only takes an I.M. Chat

216
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:56,604
for someone to access your webcam.

217
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,537
Yeah, but Ned is smarter than that.

218
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,971
Yeah, I know, I know. It's just...

219
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:02,570
everybody else I'm worried about.

220
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:16,570
Ha, take that, sucka!

221
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:20,004
Hey, give a newbie a break.

222
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:38,237
It's not right.

223
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,138
You have mad skills and a fast machine.

224
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:44,337
My dad guilt-gifted it to me after he moved out.

225
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:45,671
Sorry.

226
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:48,337
Thanks, but I'm over it.

227
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,570
So, uh, you're redstar?

228
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,370
Ned. Yeah, I've seen you in there, too.

229
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:54,071
I'm Alise.

230
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:57,104
Yeah, so you hang out with that Phoenix guy, right?

231
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,771
-What's up with him?  -Oh, don't know.

232
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,370
Probably stopped playing and forgot to log off.

233
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,370
Do you know the guy, the gamer?

234
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,104
I only know him online.

235
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,203
Ever think something might have happened?

236
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,404
Like I heard about that guy in Oregon who died gaming.

237
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,737
What, you think it could be Phoenix?

238
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:14,270
That would be so sad. I really like him.

239
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,470
Stay away from her!

240
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:17,270
The guy who keeled, Curtis Green,

241
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:18,904
died like 3 weeks ago.

242
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,737
Well, then it's not him for sure.

243
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,437
Phoenix just froze up yesterday.

244
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,270
I was hanging in world with him when it happened.

245
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:27,138
I said, leave her alone!

246
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:29,370
You, over here! Talk to me.

247
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,937
Do you know him?

248
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,971
What's your game with her?

249
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,837
What's your game?

250
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,071
No, I've never seen him before.

251
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:43,470
You think you're her boyfriend?

252
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,504
She doesn't even have a clue who you even are.

253
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,104
This isn't real.

254
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,270
You're in a game, it's all fantasy.

255
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:51,504
She knows I'm real. That's why she talks to me.

256
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,470
You're real in a sense, Yes. But that is not the issue.

257
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:58,038
The issue is, who am I talking to?!

258
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,437
I'm Phoenix, ok?

259
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:05,138
That's all you need to know. Now leave us alone!

260
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:10,904
It's the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder.

261
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,971
He believes he's her boyfriend,

262
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,504
And she's the perfect target...

263
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,954
Sweet, shy, troubled,

264
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,300
And she lives online.

265
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,901
And how do you usually treat something like this?

266
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,167
Change their frame of reference.

267
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:21,767
Jar them out of their fiction.

268
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,934
Like tell him who he actually is?

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,601
That's a good start,

270
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,667
If we knew who he really is.

271
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:31,100
Well, could we track his I.P. address through the game?

272
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,867
Hey, they did it on CSI!

273
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,600
I think there'd have to be a criminal investigation.

274
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,400
or we could just...

275
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,267
talk to someone where he lives,

276
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,134
in here.

277
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,834
He's gone!

278
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:46,700
Phoenix isn't there anymore.

279
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,367
I've been watching since he first came out.

280
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,833
He's been frozen. He was right there!

281
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:12,967
He was in there.

282
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:15,467
What happened? Your avatar started to move.

283
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,634
Because I was in there, too. I had a vision.

284
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,401
Only, it was different.

285
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,000
It was like I was a part of that world, you know?

286
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,134
I think I was seeing the game the way that he does.

287
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,134
Ok, I don't like the idea of that guy in your head.

288
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,067
Me either.

289
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:29,300
But if we want to find out who Phoenix is

290
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,100
Or why he's haunting Alise,

291
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,067
It might be the only way.

292
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,967
Hey, I'm looking for Phoenix.

293
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,367
He was just here.

294
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,934
Are you friends with him?

295
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,967
Who wants to know?

296
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,167
You don't belong here.

297
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,100
You don't belong here, either.

298
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,100
Just tell me who you are.

299
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,267
No! You're ruining everything!

300
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,834
This wasn't real when you were alive,

301
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,434
And it's not real now.

302
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:33,133
There has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.

303
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,868
I can help you!

304
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,968
All right, that's enough!

305
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,667
I don't think so.

306
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,901
If you see a light, pal, go for it.

307
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,701
No...way!

308
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,200
Melinda!

309
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,601
Ok, that's enough fun.

310
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,133
It was...

311
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,400
everything in there, it was real for my ghost.

312
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,334
You were kickin' some ass.

313
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,267
I was, right?

314
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,934
Looked like he landed a few good hits, too.

315
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,668
Looked like he was kind of hurting you.

316
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,701
No. I mean, I felt it in the game,

317
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,600
But not now.

318
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,034
Hey, his avatar's gone again.

319
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:58,700
That's ok. He'll be back.

320
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,267
It's the only way he can talk to Alise.

321
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,734
That's not the only way he can be with her.

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,834
He's a ghost.

323
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,767
How can we find a guy who doesn't want to be found?

324
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,567
We get lucky.

325
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:12,067
Looks like Phoenix sent you an email.

326
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,434
I don't understand. Now he wants me to find him?

327
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,001
He's a gamer. Maybe he likes to play games.

328
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:19,334
Ok then.

329
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,301
Let's play.

330
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:27,434
No good.

331
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,134
Guess it would be, seeing how the guy is dead.

332
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,167
Some kind of business address.


334
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,368
Ingram, Nash, Reynolds, Coben and company.

335
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:42,201
That's an ad firm in Hamilton.

336
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,401
So our dead guy's this Berrit dude?

337
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,317
Ok, you go see if Phoenix ever

338
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,167
sent Alise any emails from this address.

339
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:51,334
We'll see if we can find our ghost.

340
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:55,867
Berrit, incr-c.com? Never heard of him.

341
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,134
Is he one of those guys who died gaming?

342
00:15:58,201 --> 00:15:59,867
No, he's just someone I met in-world.

343
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,600
You spend too much time online.

344
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,301
I wish I could spend that much time online.

345
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:06,167
My mom thinks the internet's evil.

346
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:07,600
Did you want something?

347
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,234
Oh, no, thanks.

348
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,601
- Mine's the opposite. - Oh, your mom?

349
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,668
With the web, she's cool,

350
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,634
But she doesn't trust me to blow my nose out here in the real world.

351
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,833
Well, it would be worse if your parents didn't care, right?

352
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,401
Yeah, I've got one of them, too.

353
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,934
Anyway,

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,301
At least I have my online friends I can gripe to.

355
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:29,501
Ok, but how do you know they're your friends

356
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:30,733
You don't really know who they are.

357
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,767
I don't really know you.

358
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,534
True that.

359
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,833
I think you get to know who people really are more online.

360
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,534
Barriers come down.

361
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,034
I guess, but...

362
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,534
what about when it goes offline,

363
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,267
And it's not what you thought?

364
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,668
Have you ever had a thing go offline?

365
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,034
I've emailed, talked on cell, sure.

366
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,201
You felt safe doing that?

367
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:56,867
Safe as anything in real life turned out to be.

368
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,134
You mean, like your family?

369
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:03,201
Thought we'd always be together.

370
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:06,234
Then one day I come home, and it's gone.

371
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,900
No more.

372
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:12,134
At least with this, I can always count on it being there.

373
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:20,401
Mr. Berrit...

374
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,568
No, sorry, he's not with the firm.

375
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,167
Well, I know he wouldn't be anymore,

376
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:25,601
But did he ever work here?

377
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:28,900
Wait, do you mean Errit, Mr. Bill Errit?

378
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,767
He's in now.

379
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

380
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,601
Curioser and curioser.

381
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,800
Oh, god, not again.

382
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,700
I thought I was through with this.

383
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:41,900
With what?

384
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:45,367
About 2 weeks ago, the FBI shows up here.

385
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:48,167
Accuses me of cyber-stalking...

386
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,100
Luring underage girls and transmitting pornography.

387
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,867
So you didn't send the email?

388
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:55,100
Of course not. Someone stole my address,

389
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,000
And the guy who did's a real winner,

390
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,967
judging from the stuff they thought I did.

391
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,767
What kind of stuff?

392
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,134
He deals in candid, suggestive photos

393
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:07,501
of beautiful young women. Of teenagers, mostly.

394
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:09,401
God knows how he gets them to do it.

395
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,550
Cops said some of them even

396
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,634
end in webcam shots of themselves.

397
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
I saw the stuff, and I wish I hadn't.

398
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,201
So the guy who sent me the email, he's a predator?

399
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,733
And a good one.

400
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,733
They've traced stolen emails to him all across the country,

401
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,534
But he's always gone by the time they get there.

402
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,401
That's the agent handling the case.

403
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,301
If this pervert's after you now,

404
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,668
I'd call him.

405
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,800
Can't be too sad when a perv bites it.

406
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,167
Yeah, except it doesn't change anything.

407
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,067
I mean, the ghost controls a computer.

408
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,833
It can get young girls to do things,

409
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,534
like maybe even turn on a webcam.

410
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,301
Well, I know a cop.

411
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,700
I used to help her profile some cases.

412
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,067
Let me call her.

413
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:50,999
Look, whoever created Phoenix

414
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,568
is a cyber-perv.

415
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:55,301
He gets pics of teens and puts them on the web!

416
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,367
Ok, but if the FBI is handling this case,

417
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:58,668
Why are you talking to me?

418
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,501
Because I don't know them. I know you.

419
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:02,700
And you owe me, remember?

420
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,467
What?

421
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,900
Oh, um, the I.D. thief I helped you profile?

422
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:12,733
Fine. I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID.

423
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,900
But don't get your hopes up.

424
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:15,434
These guys switch servers all the time.

425
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,001
Internet cafes, motels,

426
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,700
Your random, roaming WI-FI.

427
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,934
So even if we get an address,

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,733
I doubt the guy will still be there.

429
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,601
Unless he's dead

430
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,767
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.

431
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,733
It turns out this ghost is a total creep, so...

432
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,334
Uh, you know what?

433
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:34,867
I'm gonna have to call you back.

434
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:39,100
I want you to stay the hell away from Alise.

435
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,900
No! I told you--

436
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,034
Save it. I know who you are.

437
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
I know what you've done to those girls,

438
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,867
I know that you've tried to ruin their lives,

439
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,967
And you're doing the same thing to Alise.

440
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:49,000
- I would never... - Yeah, but you did!

441
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,601
Again and again.

442
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:51,767
I mean, you had to have known better,

443
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,401
But you didn't stop, not even after you died.

444
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,733
You're still stalking Alise.

445
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,967
You're confused.

446
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,401
You don't know who I am.

447
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,833
I just want to protect her.

448
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,568
Did you have a good day?

449
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,700
Yeah!

450
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,568
Get your travel shoes on.

451
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:08,767
I know where the real Phoenix lives.

452
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,367
Let's go.

453
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:13,167
Of course he said he was protecting Alise.

454
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:14,668
He might even believe it.

455
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,267
The guy's a sicko.

456
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,701
Is that a technical term?

457
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,967
Oh, I'm sorry. Twisted sicko.

458
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,267
I don't know, it felt sincere.

459
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,034
Welcome to his world of deception.

460
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,067
These guys find out people's weaknesses, and they prey on it.

461
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:28,401
What's my weakness?

462
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,367
Trusting sickos.

463
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:32,667
Oh, come on...

464
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:33,867
Come on.

465
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,801
We're just going to help ourselves?

466
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:46,434
Not so sure this is such a good idea.

467
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,868
I'm thinking it may be time

468
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,601
- to call in a higher power... - Shh.

469
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,200
like maybe... the cops.

470
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:04,767
Ok, from the smell,

471
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,901
I'm guessing that guy is not asleep.

472
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,434
That's the real Phoenix.

473
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:19,667
Did I call it?

474
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:21,767
It's a twisted sicko.

475
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,501
Something's not right.

476
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,434
Oh, my god.

477
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,834
He was telling the truth.

478
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,267
He really did just want to protect Alise.

479
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,334
I mean, all of these photos are her.

480
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,367
He's not a predator.

481
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:59,133
He's Larry Jones.

482
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,968
Alise's dad.

483
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:11,834
You think he's been dead for what?

484
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,901
Yeah, it was an apparenent heart attack.

485
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,200
They think he's been dead 3 days.

486
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,550
So that's when the ghost must

487
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,834
have gone into the computer.

488
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,400
So he's protecting his daughter, but from what?

489
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,267
And why was he even in the computer? That's just...

490
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:25,934
I don't know, but he does.

491
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,534
It's the only way I could be a part of her life.

492
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:31,267
I had a stupid affair.

493
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,934
My wife was bitter, and it rubbed off on Alise.

494
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,383
My daughter made it clear

495
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:36,767
she didn't want to have anything to do with me,

496
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:39,234
And I didn't blame her for hating me, but...

497
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,000
god, I missed her.

498
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,601
That's when you came up with Phoenix.

499
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,033
Well, in there, I felt connected to her.

500
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,834
Then what happened?

501
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,200
Well, after I died, I found myself back at home

502
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,767
with Alise, and I saw that she was emailing someone.

503
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,634
Someone in the game?

504
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,267
Yeah, she met him in there.

505
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,801
I mean, I was Phoenix,

506
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,501
and Phoenix was her friend,

507
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,400
But this guy was... more.

508
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:04,267
I mean, the emails were pretty intimate.

509
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:06,133
So you suspected he was a predator?

510
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,467
Or a lusty teenager. I didn't know.

511
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:10,968
I mean, I didn't know if I was being an overprotective dad.

512
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,501
Like when you threw me across the street in the game.

513
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,167
Look, I just didn't want you

514
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,767
to blow my cover with this creep.

515
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:17,717
But then when I realized that

516
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:18,601
you were actually trying to help,

517
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,133
That's when I forwarded you on the emails

518
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,300
that this guy sent Alise.

519
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,100
The ones we traced.

520
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,801
So the guy who sent the emails,

521
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:28,267
He was the same guy that the cops wanted for teen porn?

522
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,500
And when you found that out,

523
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,968
I went back in the game and I tried to warn her,

524
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,133
but she s convinced that he was just a...

525
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,867
happy teen, just like she was,

526
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,133
and she would not listen to me.

527
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,367
It wasn't always like that.

528
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,233
I mean, we used to do things.

529
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,467
We used to laugh.

530
00:23:48,534 --> 00:23:50,434
I know.

531
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,934
I saw your pictures.

532
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,867
The one in the jeep?

533
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,300
Yeah.

534
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,901
We took that in Sedona.

535
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:03,100
She said that we were the Indiana Joneses.

536
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,867
We ran up this hill

537
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,167
looking for treasure,

538
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:10,400
and we came down with this leather pouch full of...

539
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,867
I mean, I don't know what.

540
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:16,200
Rocks and feathers and dirt and...

541
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:20,100
She said it was magic.

542
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,267
And that it would protect us forever.

543
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,934
Look, you have to warn her.

544
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,133
You have to tell her to be careful.

545
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,001
Please.

546
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:42,534
Don't worry.

547
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:45,801
Come on.

548
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,667
Excuse me...

549
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,667
Alise, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon.

550
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:56,434
I knew your dad, and I'm so sorry.

551
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,968
What's this about?

552
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,434
I think your daughter might be in danger.

553
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,200
Well, the police didn't say anything about that.

554
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:04,500
That's because they don't know about it.

555
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,467
The predators reached out to Alise online.

556
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,434
He collects pictures of young girls.

557
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,968
Who are you?

558
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:12,200
I know this is a bad time.

559
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,734
I asked you a question.

560
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,934
Look, I...

561
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:21,467
we, um, talk to spirits,

562
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:23,667
And Alise's dad contacted me, so...

563
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:24,867
Ok, that's enough.

564
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,400
My daughter just lost her dad,

565
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,334
So whatever your story is, tell it to the police.

566
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,534
Follow them! Tell them!

567
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,801
What do you want me to say?

568
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:39,001
That her dad is a ghost avatar?

569
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:40,400
It'll never work.

570
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:41,734
There's only one thing that will.

571
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,100
What?

572
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,200
We find this guy and we stop him.

573
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:49,834
Are we ready yet?

574
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:52,334
You're set. All you need to do is get him

575
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,467
to email you, then Eli's friend

576
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,534
can track the I.P.

577
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,067
And wherever that is, Sam said

578
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,534
the FBI can send someone there fast.

579
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,934
Whoa, that's me?

580
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:01,467
You said you want to lure him, didn't you?

581
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:03,334
This I gotta see.

582
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,367
There's Alise's avatar,

583
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,500
And that's Cal.

584
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,300
That's who I'm looking for?

585
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,267
I think so. The avatar Alise is talking to,

586
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,200
he's the guy you saw in the game the other day.

587
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,400
Same guy.

588
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,968
Are you ready? You're my only way in.

589
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,901
Ok.

590
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:26,300
Let's catch a predator.

591
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,901
Melinda, Melinda!

592
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,233
It's...a...

593
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,601
private chatroom!

594
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,334
You can't get in!

595
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,701
All right, I get it, minus an eardrum.

596
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,801
Well, what are you waiting for?

597
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,133
Give him your email, for god sakes.

598
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,400
Be brazen. There's no dating protocol there.

599
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:18,534
How do we even know he heard me?

600
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,634
We wait.







607
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,300
Hey, dude.

608
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,434
Second  hey, man, let's get out of here.

609
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,400
Thanks for picking us up.

610
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,367
Cal. Hey. Where are you?

611
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:17,300
I didn't see you in there.

612
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:18,601
I'm outside.

613
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:21,100
Oh, snap. I was inside looking for you,

614
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,267
but my friends made me bail.

615
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:24,901
I was wearing a red shirt.

616
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:27,400
Geek, you didn't see me? You know what I look like.

617
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:28,667
I sent you that picture.

618
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,100
No. But a bunch of us are going

619
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,834
to the dance pad contest later at Brookside Mall.

620
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,601
How does that sound?

621
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,300
Well, I don't know, I don't have a car.

622
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,200
I do. I'll pick you up.

623
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:43,634
You're the Jones that lives on Latimer Road, right?

624
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:47,001
Wow, you do your homework.

625
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:50,601
What can I say? I like you.

626
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,934
So I'll be there at 6:00.


628
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,100
Is he still there?

629
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:31,634
No, he left.

630
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:32,901
Maybe he's at the virtual cafe.

631
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:35,233
No, he's not.

632
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,567
Cal and Alise have both logged off,

633
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,934
So what do we do now?

634
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:41,567
We wait for him to email Melinda's avatar back.

635
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:42,968
No, I can't wait!

636
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,801
Look, he wants pictures.

637
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:48,034
All it takes is one weak moment,

638
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,534
and she's very vulnerable right now.

639
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,233
Which is why you have to keep an eye on her.

640
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,434
Ok, let us know if he contacts her again.

641
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,601
Get a cell phone number, email address, anything.

642
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,068
Ok, ok, ok.

643
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,001
Go watch your girl.

644
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,968
We're gonna get this guy, we are.

645
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
Are we?

646
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:07,467
It's looking more promising.

647
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,267
Check this out, just came in.

648
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,467
Obviously he read my cry for help.

649
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,167
Got his service provider.

650
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:19,534
Eli's cop friend just needs to track his I.P.

651
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,068
Hopefully before he moves again.

652
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:26,567
Detective Sam Blair, please.

653
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,267
I can't believe he's in Grandview.

654
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,701
Yeah, where's the FBI, the camera, the balloons?

655
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,068
We're about to catch a predator in our hometown.

656
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,701
Look, after that last false alarm,

657
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,934
You're lucky I'm even here.

658
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:37,701
He's a regular. About a day every month.

659
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,901
Brings his laptop, says he likes quiet.

660
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:41,167
Sounds like a cyber criminal.

661
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,867
Or a cheating spouse.

662
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,601
Would you mind opening it, please?

663
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,701
Ok, maybe you were right.

664
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,734
Or maybe you were.

665
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:05,233
Looks like we found his private stash.

666
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,233
He's here for Alise.

667
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,001
All right, I'm going to need address, phone numbers,

668
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,968
and nobody touch anything else in here.

669
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,901
Hey, Cal, what's up? Where are you?

670
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:24,089
Home. My brother's not back with my mom's car.

671
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,234
Bummer.

672
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,634
I know. This thing's starting in 20.

673
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:29,567
We're all headin' over.

674
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:31,200
Ok, well, have fun.

675
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,467
No, freak, I'm tryin' to tell you,

676
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,501
My brother's near your house.

677
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,467
He'll probably drive by on his way home.

678
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,334
Well, I don't know.

679
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,133
Oh, right.

680
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,534
You probably need to ask your mom first.

681
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,100
No, it's not that. It's just...

682
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:49,501
Sorry, my friends are here.

683
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,434
I can't hear.

684
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,133
Whatever you decide's ok.

685
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:20,567
We got in touch with the mom.

686
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:21,767
Alise was supposed to be home,

687
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,934
but she hasn't been answering her cell.

688
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,934
Has anyone checked the house?

689
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
A patrol car's driving by now.

690
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,801
They're in a blue minivan.

691
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:28,667
I am never going to get used to that.

692
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:30,300
What?

693
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,234
That I forgot to tell you

694
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,667
that the predator's driving a blue minivan.

695
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:37,200
License number GRK998.

696
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,300
License plate number GRK998.

697
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:44,601
Ok. Not sure how you forgot that, but I'll tell them.

698
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,334
Look, you don't understand, he's there now.

699
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,701
He's picking her up, now, now!

700
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,334
Ok, just... please go and tell Sam that he's already there.

701
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,334
Don't worry, all right?

702
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,234
The police are on their way.

703
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,133
You must be Alise. I'm Cal's brother.

704
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,100
Hop in. We'll pick up the others on the way.

705
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:11,200
- What's wrong?  - Well, it's just,

706
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,200
I just... I don't know.

707
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:18,133
Ah, I get it.

708
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,167
You're not sure you should go anywhere with the big bad brother.

709
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:23,534
No, it's not that.

710
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,667
It's just... well, I don't know you.

711
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,667
It's cool. Cal told me

712
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,167
How your mom has you on a short leash.

713
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,534
I get it. I'm older,

714
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:33,234
practically an only kid.

715
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,801
You just want to say,"hey,I have a brain,

716
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:38,868
I can think for myself."

717
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:42,267
Yeah, that's for sure.

718
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,334
Look, maybe when your mom gets home,

719
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,868
She can drive you over.

720
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:52,868
Yeah.Yeah, she's...whatever.

721
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:58,267
Anyway, I, uh, I gotta get going.

722
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:00,567
Little bro's gonna be pissed if I make him late,

723
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:06,067
So...you comin'?

724
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:12,934
Yeah. Um, just wait one sec.

725
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:44,634
All set?

726
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,567
Get out!

727
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:47,868
Get out of the car!

728
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:49,033
Ready.

729
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:51,868
Get out! Alise, No. No!

730
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:57,767
No! Alise!

731
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,634
They just left, you can catch them.

732
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,967
I've been calling her on her cell. She's not picking up.

733
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:14,201
No, no, no, they're not in there!

734
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:16,001
They're in a van, a blue van!

735
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:19,533
Argh, this is not happening!

736
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,067
Sam said there's no word yet.

737
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:22,368
She's in the car.

738
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,201
I don't know what to do, I'm completely helpless!

739
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,101
I just don't know how to protect her.

740
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,034
Ok, where are they? Where were they heading?

741
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,101
They started toward Brookside, and they turned off the highway.

742
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,368
I'll tell Sam.

743
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:32,500
There's still something you can do.

744
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,001
No, no, she got in the car!

745
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,368
I couldn't stop her!

746
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:36,767
Yeah, but you can stop him.

747
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:38,433
Hello, I tried!

748
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,934
I'm a ghost, people walk through me!

749
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,368
I know that, but you're the only one

750
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,800
who can help Alise right now.

751
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,467
Look, you love your little girl.

752
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,400
Ok, now believe that you can do this.

753
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:49,600
You have the power to stop him.

754
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,901
This isn't Brookside.

755
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,700
I think you should me out here.

756
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,001
Huh? What are you...

757
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,034
Look, no one made you get in this car.

758
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:26,567
You wanted to.

759
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:28,067
Relax, it's only pictures.

760
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:29,867
I didn't know.

761
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:32,667
Oh, come on! You knew.

762
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:36,368
Let's not pretend. You knew.


764
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,134
Daddy's dead.

765
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,834
He can't help you anymore.

766
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:13,901
Hazard, hazard. Stop the car.

767
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,167
Stop the car.

768
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:16,567
At the end of the road

769
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:17,767
What is going on?

770
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,001
- Did you touch something? - I don't

771
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,667
Turn left now.

772
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:34,667
Oh! What the

773
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:45,700
Come here.

774
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:46,867
Get away!

775
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:48,533
No way in hell!

776
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You gotta be kidding me.

777
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,000
Freeze! Don't move!

778
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,534
All right, ok!

779
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,066
On the ground, on the ground now!

780
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,267
Ok!

781
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,367
Let me see your hands!

782
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,433
It's ok, sweetheart.

783
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:19,500
Thank god you're ok.

784
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,799
Thanks.

785
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:40,333
So the FBI's been tracking this guy for over a year.

786
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,766
How'd you get all this information?

787
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,933
I do what any good shrink does

788
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,733
I talk to ghosts.

789
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,000
I do, really.

790
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,333
No, one showed up last night. It...

791
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,733
I don't know how or why you did or what you did,

792
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,733
But I'll never be able to thank you enough.

793
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:59,367
It wasn't me.

794
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:01,666
It was your husband.

795
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,066
I don't understand.

796
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:08,367
It's ok. I'll explain later.

797
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,666
I didn't realize how insignificant Alise felt

798
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:13,300
after the divorce,

799
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:17,367
So I guess I was just too busy trying to get through another day.

800
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:19,534
Ok, mom, enough sharing.

801
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,033
- I think I need a minute alone.  - Sure.

802
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,534
That was him, wasn't it?

803
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,000
He did all those things in the car?

804
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,333
Yes.

805
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,400
And he's here with us right now.

806
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,100
He can hear you.

807
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:46,634
He told me about the day that you filled that.

808
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:51,467
He said you,  you thought it was magic.

809
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,699
Because we did it together.

810
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:57,833
And then he left.

811
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,799
He fought for me today,

812
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:01,699
but why didn't he fight for me back then?

813
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:03,200
Why did he just leave?

814
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:05,500
Tell her... tell her I'm sorry.

815
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:08,866
I did fight. I just... it was too little, too late.

816
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,300
He's sorry.

817
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,133
He never wanted to stop being a part of your life.

818
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,567
- Is that true?  - Yes.

819
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:21,167
Oh... tell her,tell her what I did.

820
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,699
He was your friend.

821
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:26,200
In the game.  He was Phoenix.

822
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:28,899
He created that avatar just so he could be with you.

823
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:32,333
My dad?  It's computers.

824
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,866
He can hardly work a cell phone.

825
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,834
Well, he figured out how.

826
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:39,133
just to be with you.

827
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,899
Wish I could stay now.

828
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,166
I love you, too, daddy.

829
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:11,966
He sees the light.

830
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:17,899
And now that he knows you're safe, he can go.

831
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:24,300
Thank you.

832
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:26,200
Tell him good-bye.

833
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,966
It's ok.

834
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:50,933
She's gonna be fine.

835
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:14,600
- Sam offered me a job.  - And?

836
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,100
I said I was happy shrinking heads

837
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,866
and sending disembodied voices into the light.

838
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:22,233
Come on.

839
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,266
You know, you've got to stop

840
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,600
telling everybody that you can hear ghosts.

841
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,266
Why?  No one believes me.

842
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,266
People are gonna start thinking you're nuts.

843
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,200
Trust me, I've been there.

844
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:34,700
People think I'm nuts already.
