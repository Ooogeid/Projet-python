1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,634
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,298
No!

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,866
I'll always love you, Melinda.

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,667
Please. not you.

5
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:10,966
You have to cross over.

6
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,866
I don't want to.

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,233
Jim, no!

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,699
You're back.

9
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,200
Do I know you?

10
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:22,816
I see the same guy that you see,

11
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:24,366
Different hair, nose, eyes.

12
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,866
It's not Jim. he's in there somewhere.

13
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,567
He just has to be.

14
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:29,682
You're not gonna tell me that you think

15
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:30,732
I'm your husband reincarnated.

16
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,433
Because you're the only sane
person I've met since I woke up.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,200
It's not much. but maybe you
can help me finish my garage.

18
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,766
And you could live there
while you do the work.

19
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:40,033
Just until you figure
out your next move.

20
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,366
Do you know how lucky you are?

21
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,699
You are gonna get a second
shot at your one true love.

22
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,866
That's strange. I've
been hoping for a clue,

23
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,699
Something to tell me who I was.

24
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,999
Guess I got more than I bargained for.

25
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:52,866
I bought that less than a month ago.

26
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,066
Question is... who did I buy it for?

27
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,766
Hey!

28
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,567
Hey. you're looking
chipper this morning.

29
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,799
That's how a morning off effects me.

30
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,133
Oh, yeah. you got a little...

31
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:27,966
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

32
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,133
Where you running off to?

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,600
The farmer's market. we're supposed
to meet Delia there at 9:00.

34
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,466
We are?

35
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,933
Oh, that's right.

36
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:43,200
Melinda, I'm so sorry. I gotta do a job.

37
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,866
Yeah... yeah. anything interesting?

38
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:51,099
Well, if you call making kitchen
cabinets interesting, then yeah.

39
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,466
Cabinets are great. I
mean, I love cabinets.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,333
You found that... that ring...

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,799
Did you ever look into it?

42
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,999
Right. yeah.

43
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,133
- The ring...
- Right.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,300
Did you find out anything?

45
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:15,233
You don't want to know. sorry.

46
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:21,667
Of course I want to know.
that's all I want... is to know.

47
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,966
Charlie used to say that. drove me nuts.

48
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,366
Jim never did. because Jim
was never a question dodger.

49
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,699
What does that even mean,
"you don't want to know"?

50
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:31,667
Well, with Charlie it either meant
that he didn't want to talk about it,

51
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:33,366
Or he didn't want me to talk about it,

52
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,933
Or that he actually wanted to
talk, but wasn't sure if I did.

53
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,200
Well, thank you. that's helpful.

54
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,233
So, what do you think Sammeant?

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,781
What else could he mean?

56
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,333
He found her... his girlfriend,

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,466
His soon-to-be
future wife.

58
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:46,766
That's why he blew me off today.

59
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,567
That's why he's been
so distracted lately.

60
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,832
Because he found her.

61
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,133
And he's probably gonna get on a plane.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,732
He's gonna fly all the
way to Michigan or Paris

63
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,433
Or wherever it is she is right now.

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,166
Mel, I seriously doubt that Jim's spirit

65
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,233
Would have gone through all the
trouble of taking over Sam's body

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,933
Just to run off with another woman.

67
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,433
Please tell me nobody heard me say that.

68
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,333
Yeah. but he doesn't
even know that he's Jim.

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,732
I mean, what if he smells her perfume

70
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,533
And he gets confused or attracted or...

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,300
Honey, you are spinning.

72
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,567
I wouldn't have to if he
wasn't dodging my questions.

73
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:19,966
It's just too loaded.

74
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,600
I mean, I don't know
how to approach it...

75
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,033
Oh, you could.

76
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,567
That's perfect!

77
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:27,899
It's not perfect. it's bruised.

78
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,633
They all are. see?

79
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,300
No, not again!

80
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,533
I'm sorry. did I do that?

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,099
No, it happens all the time.

82
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,166
And you wonder why?

83
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,033
Well if I could get
some help around here!

84
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,033
I need to get home and cook dinner.

85
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,066
Well, maybe I can help you.

86
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,200
Oh thank god, finally
somebody with manners!

87
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,566
You know I have been
coming here every Saturday

88
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,866
for God knows how long,

89
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,366
All of a sudden he decides to ignore me.

90
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,799
I don't you how long I've been waiting.

91
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,799
How long do you think?

92
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,133
I... I'm not sure.

93
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,799
Let me guess, a ghost wants pie?

94
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,431
I'm not sure what she wants.

95
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,066
I don't even think she knows she's dead.

96
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,832
Wait!

97
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:12,999
Could I,get 4 of those? thank you.

98
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,866
They're for you. maybe I
could give you a ride home.

99
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,999
Oh, that's so sweet. thank you.

100
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:21,567
My name is Tammy. Tammy Gardner.

101
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,667
You... you did get the
organic ones, right?

102
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,300
You know what, I better go and check.

103
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:31,233
Did you just offer to give
a ride home to a ghost?

104
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,732
Only because she doesn't
realize that she's dead.

105
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,300
Hi.

106
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,866
Hi, I'm Melinda Gordon.
Are you Mr. Gardner?

107
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,181
Yes, I am. I'm sorry.

108
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,500
Like I tell all you
realtors, we're not selling.

109
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,366
Actually, I'm here about your wife.

110
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:52,999
My wife? oh, she's not
here. she's at the market.

111
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,567
Did something happen?

112
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,899
How long ago did she leave?

113
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,066
Over an hour ago. she was due back...

114
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,466
Ah, there she is now!

115
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,667
Hey, sweetheart.

116
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Who's she?

117
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,166
I was getting worried.

118
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,667
Melinda, this is my wife, Elizabeth.

119
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,433
Unless you two know each other?

120
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,600
No.

121
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,999
No, the thing is I own
an antique store in town,

122
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,699
And someone left a vase on consignment,

123
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,533
And I was just trying to track her down.

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,333
Hmm. that wasn't me. I'm sorry.

125
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,866
You know, just so there are no mix-ups,

126
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,681
The woman who left the vase,

127
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,500
Her name was Tammy... Tammy Gardner.

128
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,633
Tammy, um...

129
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,466
Tammy was my first wife. we're divorced.

130
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:50,699
Oh. you wouldn't have a recent
address change for her maybe?

131
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,466
No, I'm sorry.

132
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,066
I haven't heard from her since
she walked out on me 2 years ago.

133
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,033
Wish I could've been more help.

134
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,433
Good day.

135
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,399
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

136
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,032
But I went by your
store. but it was closed.

137
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:03,700
And your address was listed...

138
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,132
So is my phone number.

139
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,366
I know, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,766
I wanted to see to you in person.

141
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,600
I need you to tell me what
you know about my wife.

142
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,867
When exactly did she leave?

143
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,900
Just about 2 years ago, October 15.

144
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,700
I remember that day because
it was our fourth anniversary.

145
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,600
At first I wasn't worried.

146
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,166
She'd disappeared before.
sort of a pattern for her.

147
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,833
But she'd always come back
after a couple of days.

148
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,066
When she didn't show up after 3 days,

149
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,099
I knew something was wrong.

150
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,999
I just can't understand
why she hasn't contacted me.

151
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,966
You said this was a
pattern? her disappearing?

152
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:46,600
Maybe in a way it's good
she hasn't contacted me.

153
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,233
Means she's probably
staying out of trouble.

154
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,200
What kind of trouble?

155
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:53,567
She had mood swings.

156
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,667
What did she do?

157
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,900
She couldn't stand feeling confined.

158
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:00,733
She'd run away, then come back,

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,099
Looking disheveled and confused.

160
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,934
That doesn't sound at
all like the Tammy I met.

161
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,700
That's part of the illness.

162
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,467
I mean, she could be
delightful and happy one day,

163
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,800
And then... and then
depressed and angry the next.

164
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,900
Was she ever diagnosed?

165
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,233
Oh, no. no. she refused to see a doctor.

166
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,633
I talked to plenty myself.

167
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,900
Said it was some sort
of bipolar disorder.

168
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,900
I loved her so much.

169
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,900
But it's so painful living with someone

170
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,200
You can't break through to.

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,567
I know what you mean.

172
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,674
Why didn't you tell that poor guy

173
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:40,970
That his ex-wife is haunting him?

174
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,567
Because I don't want
to make things worse...

175
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,633
Roger's already got a ghost
in his house because of me.

176
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,333
Besides, I need a little more
information, like how she died.

177
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,797
Do you still think there's a chance

178
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:50,798
that she could've moved on?

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,133
I can hope. something tells
me she'll be here soon.

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,133
Because this is where
I saw her yesterday.

181
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,133
Which would tell us she's
still stuck in the loop,

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,999
Still playing Suzie homemaker.

183
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:01,233
I'm just wondering if her
imprint has something to do with

184
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,800
mental illness and not her death.

185
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,867
She's stuck in a loop because
she's loopy? makes sense.

186
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,266
You're not helping.

187
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,433
No, it does. really.

188
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,966
People in the manic
stage of bipolar disorder

189
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,266
Often have trouble assimilating
anything negative...

190
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,800
Like being dead, for instance?

191
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,999
That's the fourth person
you let go before me.

192
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,999
I just need my husband's shirt...

193
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,934
It's the blue one in the plastic,

194
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,900
And I said no plastic.

195
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:26,900
Hi.

196
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,600
- Ok. 3 pieces.
- Thanks.

197
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,966
Somebody help!

198
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,300
Stop this thing!

199
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,433
Somebody help!

200
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,433
Tammy! stop it!

201
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,913
Oh, I'm so glad you're
here!It's a blue shirt,

202
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:58,500
and Roger likes light
starch if you could just...

203
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:02,633
We are not gonna pick up
your husband's dry cleaning.

204
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,567
You don't need to take
care of him anymore.

205
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,834
It's time for you to move on.

206
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,066
I can't do that.

207
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,999
What would happen to my family?

208
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,366
I need to take care of them, of Roger.

209
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,133
No, you don't. they'll be fine...

210
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,966
Stop it. Don't say that. Roger needs me.

211
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,733
He has a new wife.

212
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,700
Ok? he's moved on.

213
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,133
You can let go now, really. it's ok.

214
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Why are you being so
mean? You helped me before.

215
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,333
Why can't you help me now?

216
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Make those people listen to me!

217
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,366
They can't. not anymore.

218
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,586
The day that they stopped hearing you

219
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:33,587
Was the day that you died.

220
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,999
Look, you know, don't
you? what happened?

221
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,867
Oh dear...

222
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,533
There was something...

223
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:52,077
It happened after I fell
asleep. I remember thinking

224
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,166
It was strange how fast
I was falling asleep.

225
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,867
And then what happened?

226
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,467
I was floating.

227
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,433
There was a big grassy field

228
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,400
And lots of tall trees below me.

229
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,233
My car was there.

230
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,467
And colors,

231
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:14,633
Lots of bright colors
flying all around me.

232
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,934
Oh, no... I have to get home.

233
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,433
Lots of colors? sounds
like a hallucination.

234
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,834
Yeah or maybe not.

235
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,834
She said that she was above a field,

236
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,834
There were tall trees.

237
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,400
She disappeared in October.

238
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:40,459
Is this what you saw that day, Tammy?

239
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,700
Kites? floating colors? Am I close?

240
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,999
Hot? cold? lukewarm?

241
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,533
Crap. need some dialogue here,

242
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
A little back and forth.

243
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:01,567
It's not so easy when you
have a client that's invisible.

244
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,066
Ok, I've hiked far enough.

245
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,966
And I draw the line at thistles.

246
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:18,662
What's that? look, I'm sweating now.

247
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:20,912
So if it turns out to
be another dead end...

248
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,800
No. no!

249
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,667
This can't be true.

250
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,800
I can't be dead. not like this.

251
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:15,599
I told my friend detective Blair

252
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,731
that I found the body hiking,

253
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,233
As opposed to breaking and entering,

254
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,238
Which is how I found the last dead body

255
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,239
That I called into her.

256
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,361
How many times can you do that

257
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:23,197
Before they haul you away?

258
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,433
Well, they haven't locked me up yet.

259
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,466
That's wildly reassuring. that's nice.

260
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,967
At least now we know
how and when she died.

261
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:34,033
Possibly why she's stuck
here... out of guilt.

262
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Because she abandoned
her husband and kids?

263
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,866
Yeah. maybe that's why
she's trying so hard now

264
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:39,867
To take care of them.

265
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,789
I just don't understand

266
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,998
Why this ghost is so
hard to get through to.

267
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,703
I mean, she's seen
her husband's new wife,

268
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,301
Her own dead body...

269
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,366
You'd think that would bring
up something. but it hasn't it.

270
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,100
If she's drawn to that square,

271
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,172
Maybe something happened there

272
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,209
That she doesn't want to remember.

273
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,600
Like, an affair?

274
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,466
Roger said she used to disappear a lot,

275
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:56,900
Maybe she was meeting someone there.

276
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,628
Right, maybe she was seeing someone

277
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:00,428
And her husband never knew.

278
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:02,900
Yeah. or he did, and
didn't want to believe it.

279
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey, Roger.

280
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,433
It's Melinda Gordon. I
was hoping we could talk.

281
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,633
So, call me. ok. thanks.

282
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,499
I don't know what's happening to me.

283
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:55,733
I see that woman in my
house. something's very wrong.

284
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
It's because you don't
belong there anymore.

285
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,566
And you know that somewhere deep down.

286
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,000
You left the house. and that's hard.

287
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,967
But you really have to remember why.

288
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:11,833
I remember... trying
to make Roger happy.

289
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,717
How I felt like it was
the most important thing

290
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:16,718
I could ever do.

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,666
And... and how I'd always
worry about my kids.

292
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,234
I don't... I don't have any kids.

293
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,766
But I used to feel that
way about my husband.

294
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:36,142
Spirits often don't remember things

295
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,760
because somewhere deep down,

296
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,466
They don't want to.

297
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,533
Why wouldn't I want to?

298
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,533
Usually guilt.

299
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,100
You talk about your family a lot.

300
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,033
Maybe that's what you feel
guilty about? Or maybe...

301
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,300
maybe you just need to say
goodbye to your children.

302
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,833
I don't know. God.

303
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,000
I can't think about it anymore.

304
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,766
I have to get home.

305
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,433
I can't be late.

306
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,200
Hey, what's up? Come on in.

307
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,967
Oh, thanks.

308
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,933
You look like you're running off.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,933
Yeah, it's really urgent.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,366
What is?

311
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,200
I have to get to the laundromat

312
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,700
before every T-shirt I own

313
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,133
starts standing up by itself.

314
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,967
Oh, so that's your...

315
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,000
You're not planning a trip?

316
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,433
No. why? You trying to get rid of me?

317
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:47,867
No... no, it's just that, uh...

318
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,433
My mom might come, and she stays here...

319
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,867
Here in the garage?

320
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,433
Allergy thing.

321
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,716
So if you were gonna plan a trip to,

322
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,933
I don't know, Paris or Michigan.

323
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,933
I would need a heads-up.

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,433
Ok.

325
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:07,267
Well, the contractor guy I
work for has got a spare room

326
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,465
No. No. No. Cause,

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,666
cause you know, she might not come.

328
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,000
You know what?

329
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,234
Your mom lives just over in Hamilton.

330
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,833
Right. Right. Which is why

331
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:21,366
she might not stay over.

332
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,100
So you should stay put.

333
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,099
You know, the doctors
didn't tell me if my

334
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,766
subtext decoder was
damaged in that accident

335
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,900
But are you're trying
to tell me something?

336
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,984
No.

337
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,033
Yes.

338
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,764
Yes. I just realized that

339
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,499
I have a washer and dryer inside.

340
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:45,633
And you could use them.

341
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:54,234
Thank you.

342
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Delia, I was an absolute idiot.

343
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,633
No, there's no need to
coddle me, I was there.

344
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,666
I was an idiot.

345
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,733
I'm at Roger's house.

346
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,133
I just want to, I don't
know, feel him out,

347
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,066
See if he ever suspected

348
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,933
Tammy of any kind of affair.

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

350
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:13,915
Listen, you know what?

351
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,033
I'll talk to you soon, ok? bye.

352
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,167
Excuse me.

353
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,900
Do you know the kids
who live in this house?

354
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,265
There's no kids there,

355
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,633
just that lady and her husband.

356
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Oh. Do you ever remember there

357
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,700
ever being kids in this house?

358
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,867
Nope. Never. And we've
lived here forever.

359
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,234
Ok. Thanks.

360
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:36,916
This isn't a good time.

361
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm about to be arrested.

362
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,067
Det. Blair asked me to come down.

363
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,700
I guess she wants to read me my rights

364
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:43,234
Yeah. There are no kids.

365
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,933
- Where?
- At Roger's house.

366
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,516
One of the neighborhood kids said

367
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,033
they've never seen any kids.

368
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,800
Wait. Tammy always talked about family,

369
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:50,366
I assumed...

370
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,334
Yeah, so did I. But
it never dawned on me

371
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,399
That they may not be Roger's kids.

372
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,399
I mean, maybe she was married before.

373
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,464
So where's the family

374
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:58,533
she's always been talking about?

375
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,183
That's what I was hoping you

376
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:01,766
could ask Det. Blair.

377
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,648
I gotta go,

378
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:07,766
If you don't hear from me,bring bail.

379
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:11,800
Have a seat.

380
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,300
I had nothing to do with it.

381
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:14,833
What?

382
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,164
I found another dead body,

383
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,499
You want to arrest me, admit it.

384
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:19,200
Look, you're a talented profiler.

385
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:20,550
You help me solve cases.

386
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:21,833
I don't care how it works.

387
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,300
Oh. Ok.

388
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,167
So, uh, was it a suicide?

389
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,067
Well, it looks that way.

390
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,816
The dental records confirmed

391
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:34,499
the woman was a Tammy Gardner.

392
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,334
Her husband's been informed.

393
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,631
What about her kids?

394
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,933
Do you have any records of the children?

395
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,300
No.

396
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,649
Says here the only family

397
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:42,933
she had was a Roger Gardner.

398
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,067
He filed the missing person's report.

399
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,967
But Sarah Evers had 2 children.

400
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,100
Who?

401
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,133
Well, that's why I called you down here.

402
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,769
The dental records also matched a woman

403
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:54,700
who's husband reported
her missing 6 years ago

404
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:55,900
Sarah Evers.

405
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,600
Wait. So, Tammy was also
Sarah? She had 2 identities?

406
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,334
Maybe more. We don't know yet.

407
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,867
So, does the first husband know?

408
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:05,600
Well, we're still trying to
track him, see what his story is.

409
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,334
Did Sarah's family live nearby?

410
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,900
Thomas Evers filed the missing
person's report from Lake Forest.

411
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,300
That's 3 counties over.

412
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,833
They don't know about their mom yet.

413
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,200
Haven't had the heart to tell them.

414
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,967
I never thought it would end like this.

415
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,399
Even after all these years,

416
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,967
I always thought she'd come back.

417
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,766
So, you said you were
a friend of Sarah's?

418
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,067
When she lived in Grandview.

419
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,466
Right.

420
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,583
I'll tell you what, when she left me,

421
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:49,633
I was blindsided.

422
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,600
I never saw it coming.

423
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,234
There were no signs of trouble?

424
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,533
No.

425
00:20:56,433 --> 00:21:00,399
We were happy or so I thought.

426
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,982
Apparently everyone knew

427
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,867
what was really going on but me.

428
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,300
What do you mean?

429
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,199
After she left, the neighbors said

430
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:13,033
they'd suspected something.

431
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,433
We had an electrician,
did some work for us.

432
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:23,900
Said things that made them think affair.

433
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:26,533
Turns out, it was.

434
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,633
About a month later I get a postcard,

435
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:30,666
saying she's never coming back.

436
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,300
That must've been devastating.

437
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,566
You have no idea.

438
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,200
Especially for the boys...

439
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,532
7 and 10 at the time...

440
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,867
Their mother abandoned them.

441
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:51,566
I wanted to grow old with her so bad.

442
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,366
What did I do?

443
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
You ready?

444
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,466
I left them for Roger.

445
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:42,033
Sam!

446
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,867
Hey, Sam!

447
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,700
Sam!

448
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:54,099
Sam, hi.

449
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,300
Oh, sorry.

450
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,233
I just, uh... I brought
this stuff by for Mel.

451
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,533
It's just got some fixtures
in it for the remodel.

452
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Great. Thanks.

453
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,667
Sorry about the racket.

454
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,066
Oh, yeah. I understand.

455
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,116
You're just cranking it up

456
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,099
when the landlady's away.

457
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,767
Right. I know it's juvenile.

458
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,482
But it works perfectly when

459
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,200
you're trying to take
your mind of things.

460
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,033
You want some water?
Fruit juice? Anything?

461
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,366
Yeah. Sure. Some water.

462
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,467
And what kind of things?

463
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,115
Or is it something

464
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,767
you don't want to talk about?

465
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,867
I'm sure Melinda's told you

466
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,900
about this engagement ring.

467
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,867
Yeah. She mentioned it.

468
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,567
I really appreciate her concern.

469
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,333
But I feel weird
talking to her about it.

470
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,766
Because I know she's got

471
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,133
a lot going on in her life.

472
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,515
I think that she just

473
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,900
wants to make sure you're ok.

474
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:42,900
You know, I'm ok.

475
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:47,467
So are you thinking about
going to look for her?

476
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,867
Yeah. But what do I say
to her when I find her?

477
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,117
"Hi, I was about I was going to

478
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:57,300
propose marriage to you,

479
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:59,500
but I've got a serious head injury.

480
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,633
But by the way, was it chicken

481
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,700
or fish for the wedding?"

482
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:07,233
Yeah. I suppose that
would be kinda awkward.

483
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,683
I mean, I already
broke my family's heart

484
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:10,066
by not remembering them.

485
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,500
Do I really need to
add to the body count?

486
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:17,900
And besides, if this woman
is the love of my life,

487
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:20,966
How come she hasn't found me?

488
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,533
I don't know why I kept all this stuff.

489
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,700
It's hard letting go.

490
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,166
I guess some part of me
was hoping she was ok,

491
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:30,066
And that she'd want
her things back one day.

492
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,266
How is Elizabeth dealing with the news?

493
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,700
Well, it's been hard.

494
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,667
It's part of the reason I'm out here.

495
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:39,733
I figured it's time to put
the past behind us, you know?

496
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,400
So if this is about the vase,
you can go ahead and keep it.

497
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,166
No. actually it's not about that.

498
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,066
It's about Tammy.

499
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,900
I think it's time for
her to move on as well.

500
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:50,066
What do you mean?

501
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:54,033
I have a gift. I see earthbound spirits.

502
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,667
And I've seen Tammy. she's confused.

503
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,934
She has no memory about
what happened to her.

504
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,400
Is this some kind of joke?

505
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,066
I know how it must sound.

506
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,916
Ghosts that get stuck here like Tammy,

507
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,700
It's usually because of guilt.

508
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,382
I think hers has to do with the fact

509
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,433
That she left her
husband and boys for you.

510
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,200
Look, I don't know what you're after,

511
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:16,133
Or how you even know that.

512
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,934
But taking Tammy from her boys
is not something I'm proud of.

513
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,467
We fell in love. passionately in love.

514
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:26,033
Didn't mean to. just happened.

515
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,233
But lots of people get divorced.

516
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,567
Not so many flee in
the middle of the night.

517
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,567
Lots of people don't
have husbands like Thomas.

518
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,567
What does that mean?

519
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,867
Tammy made him out to be pretty awful.

520
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:42,099
But now, you know, I'm not
really sure about anything.

521
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,500
Because she left you, too.

522
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:51,166
Look. it doesn't matter
anymore. she's dead.

523
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,934
I tried to help her find
peace when she was alive.

524
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,834
I tried to give her a
good life. but I couldn't.

525
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,834
I guess nobody could.

526
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,767
He's all torn up. he doesn't
want anyone else to get hurt

527
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:06,633
So he's doing what men
do best... avoiding it.

528
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,200
So he hasn't found her? or
even started looking for her?

529
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,200
Nope.

530
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:11,567
Well, at least that buys me some time.

531
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,567
Although his fiancee could
still show up at any minute.

532
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:18,233
Hey, by then Sam will have
remembered that he's Jim.

533
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,066
And you will live
happily ever after. right?

534
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:25,867
Hey. hand me that box. I'll
take it out to the recycling bin.

535
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:30,300
I can see now... how I
left my boys, my family.

536
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:34,834
But I can't remember why. what happened?

537
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,467
You're the only one who
knows. try and think back.

538
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,767
You left Thomas, and
then you left Roger, too.

539
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,166
I know you say that, but
that couldn't have happened.

540
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,500
I'd never leave Roger.

541
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:48,366
Please. why can't I remember?

542
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:53,834
What happened? did
someone do that to you?

543
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,300
Sweetheart, you poor thing.

544
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:09,133
It's ok. I'm here now.

545
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:16,033
I don't know how that happened.

546
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,133
Was it Thomas?

547
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,366
Cause Roger said that he
didn't treat you very well.

548
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:25,200
Or was it Roger? or someone else?

549
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:28,966
No. Roger would never hurt
me. he always took care of me.

550
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:32,033
Ok. well, either way, it's
something Roger knows about you.

551
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,633
Maybe he talked to Elizabeth.

552
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,200
His new wife?

553
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:40,467
Well, she had to have asked
about you, about what happened.

554
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,567
You've been hanging
around the old house.

555
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,033
Is Elizabeth home right now?

556
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,900
No. she went out.

557
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,900
She's at the farmer's market.

558
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:02,133
Hi, I was at your house the other day.

559
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,900
Melinda, right?

560
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:08,433
Sorry to bother you. I know
this is a difficult time.

561
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I'm sorry? what do you mean?

562
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,999
Well, Roger must be upset
about his first wife.

563
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,300
What are you talking about?

564
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:18,600
Tammy's dead.

565
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,266
They found her body yesterday.

566
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,733
How did... how did... what happened?

567
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,966
They're calling it a suicide.

568
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,400
But she had bruises on her wrists.

569
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,166
I think she was abused.

570
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:37,867
Did she tell you that?

571
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:41,533
No, she just looked really scared.

572
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,066
Like you do right now.

573
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,733
I'm going to tell you the
same thing that I told her.

574
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,266
You're not alone.

575
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,834
There are people that can help.

576
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,700
I can help.

577
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,099
It's safe to talk to me.

578
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,633
I'm sorry. I have to get
home. I can't be late.

579
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:15,300
Elizabeth!

580
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,166
You're starting to remember, aren't you?

581
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,300
I was just like her.

582
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:28,633
I was so scared. I was
in such a dark place.

583
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,366
You were abused, of course
you were in a dark place.

584
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,800
No. no.

585
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:41,233
I was in a really dark place.

586
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,066
Tammy?

587
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,966
I don't know how long I'd been in there.

588
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:06,900
It seemed like forever.

589
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,183
So, after you left your husband,

590
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:11,400
Is that how Roger would punish you?

591
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,500
No.

592
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:17,767
That's where Roger kept
me after he kidnapped me.

593
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,083
Thomas was working late,
I was up doing the dishes.

594
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:40,430
I thought Roger had gone
home. But suddenly he was...

595
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:46,039
standing right behind me. He
said he knew that I wasn't happy.

596
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,900
And that he could make me happy.

597
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,000
Was there something
going on between you two?

598
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,167
No! I barely knew him.

599
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:58,100
He was... he was just some
guy doing work on our house.

600
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,267
But the neighbors told your
husband they suspected something.

601
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:02,766
I remember seeing him talking to them.

602
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:07,434
I just... i just thought he was
just trying to round up more work.

603
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:11,766
So he wanted them to suspect
something to cover his tracks.

604
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,334
What happened after he locked you up?

605
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
I lost count of the days.

606
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,100
I thought I was losing my mind.

607
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:26,233
I remember hearing my boys' voices.

608
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,866
I couldn't tell what was real anymore.

609
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:35,466
Then one day, it all just changed.

610
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,566
Upsy-daisey. there we go.

611
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:43,033
Ooh, these are a little tight, huh?

612
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:50,833
Suddenly he was so kind and caring.

613
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:57,133
It's ok.

614
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,167
At first it was just food.

615
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,100
And then it was bigger things.

616
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,434
Like letting me go outside.

617
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:08,533
Eventually he let me take
trips to the market alone.

618
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,833
So you started to trust him.

619
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,599
Oh God, how could I have?!

620
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,434
You were brainwashed.

621
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,033
It happens. I don't know why.

622
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,434
It's called stockholm syndrome.

623
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:25,434
Did you ever try to get away?

624
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:27,700
No. no!

625
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,267
I couldn't.

626
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:33,466
He threatened that if I did, he
would kill my family, my boys.

627
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,733
So the only escape was to kill yourself.

628
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
No, I wouldn't.

629
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:40,533
Then what happened that day?

630
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,633
I was at the market.

631
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,434
For some reason I was late getting home.

632
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,400
Hey, honey.

633
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,967
I was worried about you.

634
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:55,200
Sorry, I'm fine.

635
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,499
No, you're not fine.

636
00:32:58,566 --> 00:32:59,766
What's going on, darling?

637
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:04,167
Nothing, it's... nothing.

638
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:10,766
You know you can't lie to me.

639
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,416
Did something happen in town

640
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:16,000
you want to tell me about? Hmm?

641
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:20,933
No, I must've lost track of time.

642
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,100
After that he told me to
go upstairs and rest...

643
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:27,566
That he would make me something to eat.

644
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:28,866
We ate.

645
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:33,000
Then, I felt sleepy.

646
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:45,100
And I wanted to say something, but...

647
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:49,067
But the words wouldn't come out.

648
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,733
Roger always told me,

649
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,967
"I decide when you leave. "

650
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,967
I guess he decided it was time.

651
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,367
After he kidnapped and stockholmed her?

652
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:05,981
That's possible. Right?

653
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:07,599
I mean, I'm not making this stuff up?

654
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,133
No, what you're describing
is exactly how it works.

655
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,067
He grabs her. He locks her up.

656
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,233
He threatens to kill
her family if she runs.

657
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,000
She's scared out of her wits.

658
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:19,100
So what if he's doing the
same thing to Elizabeth?

659
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,933
You said Elizabeth seemed
scared, which is good,

660
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,599
That tells me she isn't
completely brainwashed.

661
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,367
Look, I want you to call
Det. Blair and find out

662
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,100
if anyone matching
Elizabeth's description

663
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,900
has gone up missing in the last year.

664
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,181
If she has a family anywhere,

665
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:30,466
we need to get them somewhere safe.

666
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,967
And what're you gonna do?

667
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,566
Just call me when it's done.

668
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,434
Elizabeth, are you here?

669
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,499
Roger spied on me sometimes.

670
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:01,233
I never knew when it would be.

671
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,683
So you're saying he could've seen me

672
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:06,067
talking to Elizabeth at the market.

673
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,600
Is someone there?

674
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,500
Help.

675
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,600
Help.

676
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,200
Oh, my God.

677
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,167
Are you ok?

678
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:03,933
I'm so sorry.

679
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,200
Stay away from her!

680
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,334
Don't do this! I love you.

681
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,600
Is that what you said to Tammy? is it?

682
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,033
Before you killed her?!

683
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,867
She told you that?! she's insane!

684
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:35,867
She says she sees ghosts!

685
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:40,766
Well, maybe she'll see yours soon!

686
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:41,867
That's enough!

687
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,033
Get out of the way!

688
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,933
Put it down, the police
are on their way. Ok?

689
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,967
He's gonna get his
punishment. Put it down.

690
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:50,200
Punishment for what? having a wife?

691
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:53,399
Who is gonna believe
that I was held captive?

692
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:56,000
They'll say I could've
run. He'll get away with it.

693
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:57,867
He thinks of everything.

694
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:00,167
Then you have to think of
everything... your family.

695
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:03,633
All right, if you kill him,
you're gonna get put away.

696
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,533
And you'll be kept
away from them forever.

697
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,100
Think of your family. Put it down.

698
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,433
Now you'll know what it
feels like to be a prisoner.

699
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:26,416
No, no, please. Don't leave.

700
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:30,000
Help me! Please! Elizabeth!

701
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:43,167
At least one of us got to go home.

702
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,399
Thank you.

703
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,500
I can help you talk to your family.

704
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,067
You could say goodbye.

705
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:55,683
No, they think I abandoned them.

706
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:58,234
And I almost did.

707
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,833
How could they ever forgive me?

708
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,733
You didn't abandon them, not really.

709
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,700
There was always a piece
of you that remembered.

710
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:14,733
I got your personal
effects from the station.

711
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,533
I almost missed this, it
was folded so many times.

712
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,800
That's my little boy.

713
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:28,967
That's Rich.

714
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:35,267
That's why I was late that night.

715
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,533
I stared at that picture for hours.

716
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,433
My heart just aching.

717
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:55,700
You must've put it in
your wallet that day.

718
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,800
Roger knew that you
were covering something.

719
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,633
He knew that he was losing control.

720
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,967
And he just couldn't let that happen.

721
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,133
Let's go home.

722
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:09,334
Do me a favor, get
your brother a soda, ok?

723
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,533
Thanks.

724
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,766
So you're saying you talked
with my wife's spirit.

725
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:21,033
That's why you came to me first.

726
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,399
That's, uh...

727
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:25,234
Crazy. Yeah, I know.

728
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,900
Um, Tammy...

729
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:31,000
Sarah, she needed some
answers about things.

730
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:34,100
She couldn't remember
what happened to her.

731
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,466
And now she does.

732
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm so sorry, Thomas.

733
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:40,967
I wanted to grow old with you, too.

734
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:46,133
I wanted to see Joe hit
his first grand slam,

735
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,967
And Rich get his braces off

736
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:52,133
And I wanted to buy that
houseboat on the lake

737
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,167
And fill it with grandkids
just like we talked about.

738
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:58,900
She says there's so much that
she wanted to do with you,

739
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,533
The houseboat on the lake.

740
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,766
How did you know about that?

741
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,399
We had this joke.

742
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:09,133
We were gonna name
the boat, 2 old coots.

743
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,499
2 old coots?

744
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:20,633
She's really here, isn't she?

745
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,566
Oh God, she must hate me.

746
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:25,600
I just left her there!

747
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:29,399
6 years and I never went after her.

748
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:32,666
I should've looked harder for her.

749
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:36,067
All she went through. I did nothing.

750
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,499
How can I forgive myself?

751
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:44,600
You have to. please tell him that.

752
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:48,100
Roger kept me prisoner for so long.

753
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:52,000
He used guilt, fear,
remorse to keep me tied up.

754
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:54,766
Don't let him do that to you,

755
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,466
don't give him that victory.

756
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm free now.

757
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,600
I want you to be, too.

758
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,833
She needs that to move on,

759
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,433
to know that you're free, like she is.

760
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:12,267
I love you so much. You were our world.

761
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:17,600
I know. I felt that.

762
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,566
She knows that.

763
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,915
And you did helped her

764
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,267
even if you didn't know it.

765
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,533
Hey, dad.

766
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,598
Will you make sure

767
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,566
that he tells them
everything that happened?

768
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:39,733
That I always loved them?

769
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,666
I see something.

770
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:46,867
It's a light.

771
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:48,800
That's for you.

772
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,334
Come here.

773
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:30,833
Thanks.

774
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,700
Anything good in there?

775
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,733
Yeah. Huge story.

776
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,348
Did you read about

777
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:37,967
that guy who kidnapped those 2 women?

778
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,133
Yeah. Crazy, huh?

779
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,967
What a happy ending for the woman.

780
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,766
Can you imagine what it was like

781
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:46,499
for her to see her family again?

782
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:49,100
Yeah. Thank God the
police got there in time.

783
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:54,300
She gets a real second chance.

784
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,300
Kinda like me.

785
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:04,366
I just can't keep
carrying this thing around.

786
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:08,267
I mean, I might have
somebody worrying about me.

787
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:10,633
Just like these women did.

788
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:17,133
And if you find that person, what then?

789
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,267
I don't know...
