00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on Ghost Whisperer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
You move between the world of life and death.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,667
You don't know the price.

4
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:08,234
What price?

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:12,367
No! please, not you!

6
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:13,634
You have to cross over.

7
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't want to.

8
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,500
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.

9
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,467
You're back!

10
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:21,767
Do I know you?

11
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,501
I see the same guy that you see,

12
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:26,135
Different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.

13
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:27,801
He's in there somewhere.

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:28,801
He just has to be.

15
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,801
You're not gonna tell me that

16
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,101
you think I'm your husband reincarnated.

17
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:34,035
Because your are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.

18
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,701
It's not much. But maybe you could help me finish my garage.

19
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,202
And you could live there while you do the work.

20
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:40,035
Just until you figure out your next move.

21
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:42,035
That's strange. I've been hoping for a clue.

22
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:43,801
Something to tell me who I was.

23
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:45,569
I bought that less than a month ago.

24
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:48,368
Question is, who did I buy it for?

25
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:49,801
Sam?

26
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,302
Oh, my god. It's true. You don't know who I am, do you?

27
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:53,535
You must be Nicole.

28
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:54,301
The fiance?

29
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,802
She is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.

30
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,535
Ok. So where are they now?

31
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:04,168
I don't know. He hasn't been home all day.

32
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:06,635
But he's with her? Nikki.

33
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,834
I assume so.

34
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,135
How much time are they actually spending together?

35
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:13,135
Well, he's not working, and she's in town. so...

36
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:15,435
You didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.

37
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,168
What about the nights? Is she still staying at the hotel?

38
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:19,268
Yes.

39
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:22,468
But they're spending all day together.

40
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:24,768
I'm really trying not to think about it.

41
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,669
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her

42
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,251
So that he could explain to her what happened

43
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:29,768
and then say goodbye.

44
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,035
Well, guess what. They're saying hello.

45
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,268
I think I hear them.

46
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,935
No. No. No. They're just gonna see you.

47
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,768
Oh, yeah. That's a lot better.

48
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,701
Did she see me?

49
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:43,701
Can I?

50
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,535
- No. - Hold on a second, Sam.

51
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:47,768
Uh, Melinda?

52
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,935
This is nuts.

53
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,302
Hi. I am Delia.

54
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,602
Hi, Delia. I'm Nikki.

55
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:53,901
I was looking for Melinda.

56
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,801
- Found it!  -Oh, gosh!

57
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,168
Nikki, Delia. Have you met Delia?

58
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:03,801
Yes. We did.

59
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,301
- I found it.  - Oh, great.

60
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,468
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.

61
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,768
No. It's great.

62
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,435
Hey, Melinda.

63
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:14,502
Hi, Sam.

64
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,301
Uh, Nikki left her cell phone here. So...

65
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,468
Right. So...

66
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:19,868
I guess I'll be taking you back...

67
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:21,569
Well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.

68
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,268
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.

69
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:25,402
It's fine and everything.

70
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,168
But I'm actually going to be spending

71
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,834
a little bit more time than I originally planned.

72
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:32,659
And I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.

73
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,125
But I was only able to get a week off from work.

74
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:37,991
And I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.

75
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,592
So, you are here. And just if you didn't mind?

76
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,158
Mind?

77
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:46,458
Just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.

78
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:47,924
Obviously.

79
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,791
No. No.

80
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,592
Because we're really just getting to know each other.

81
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,791
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

82
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:58,058
Really? It's ok. I can stay with you?

83
00:02:59,025 --> 00:02:59,958
Sure.

84
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,500
- Great.  - Great.

85
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,992
Great.

86
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,758
We were walking around the house into the back.

87
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:09,692
And we get there.

88
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,392
And her grandmother and grandfather are there.

89
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,325
Oh, my god!

90
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,759
What are you doing?

91
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,058
Swimming.

92
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:23,158
Are you crazy? What are you thinking?

93
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,025
Paula, come on, it's freezing!

94
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,698
No way!

95
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,125
She's going in.

96
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,525
- No.  - Catch me if you can!

97
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,891
Paula, don't go out there.

98
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,425
Oh, my God! This is no£¡

99
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:34,991
Is she serious?

100
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,191
I'm not going in there, no way!

101
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,191
Paula, come back!

102
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,191
Mark, do something.

103
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:40,875
Paula, come on! Wait!

104
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,559
Paula, come on! It's freezing.

105
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,559
Seriously, come on!

106
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,425
Paula, come on, it's freezing.

107
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:00,492
Where is she?

108
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,525
Mark, look down.

109
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,325
- Fish, oh, gross. - Oh, sick.

110
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:09,258
Paula, come back, ok?

111
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:12,092
Very funny, we get it. Just come back, seriously.

112
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:13,125
Come on.

113
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,191
Come on, guys. The water's great.

114
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,192
- Come on, Paula. - All right, let's go.

115
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:22,758
Paula, come back.

116
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:24,658
Yeah, Paula. It's not funny. Seriously.

117
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,225
What was that?

118
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,591
Oh, my god. I think there's...

119
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,691
Paula, look, I'm worried! Paula! Hold that.

120
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,791
She's not kidding, get her out of there!

121
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,425
Oh, my god, what's going on?

122
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:41,158
Get her out of there!

123
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,724
Oh, my god!

124
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,225
I think something's in there! What is that?!

125
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,658
What's the matter?! Hurry! Oh, my god!

126
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,125
Swim this way, come on! Mark, get her!

127
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,858
Oh, my god.

128
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:57,791
Hurry, hurry, get out! What the hell was that?

129
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,025
- Here, give me your coat. - Here, put this on.

130
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,825
Hey, it's ok. You're ok now.

131
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:06,958
Just get me out of here.

132
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,925
Ok, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?

133
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,617
Getting your mind off the fact

134
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,973
that your husband's dating your roomie.

135
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,991
She is not my roomie. Ok?

136
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,158
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.

137
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:25,092
You're literally the girl that can't say no.

138
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,025
Should've made you very popular in high school.

139
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:28,392
Hey! I can say "no."

140
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,591
Then what are you doing up here with me?

141
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,459
You said you needed a favor.

142
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,225
And I need a favor, too. Ok?

143
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,724
Just please keep working with Sam...

144
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,591
No matter what it takes to get his memory back...

145
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:40,591
before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.

146
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,624
Just please help us.

147
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:45,492
Of course. I'll do whatever I can.

148
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:48,358
But now my favor.

149
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:51,025
Ew. Do you smell that?

150
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,691
Dead fish everywhere.

151
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:59,392
A biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.

152
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,492
But I thought you might get results faster.

153
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,160
Me?

154
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,273
A student of mine was up here swimming

155
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:05,274
with some friends last night.

156
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,158
The whole experience freaked her out.

157
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,525
And not just the dead fish.

158
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:13,125
She said something was pulling her under.

159
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,292
She called it a presence.

160
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:19,858
Look, I know it's a long shot,

161
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:22,624
but her father died earlier this year...

162
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:27,225
What was his name?

163
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,459
Edwin Hathaway.

164
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,358
He's here.

165
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,225
But do you hear that?

166
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,225
He's not alone.

167
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:49,225
Tell no one.

168
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,191
You're sure that's the ghost you saw?

169
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:26,991
I think so. He responded to his name, anyway.

170
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:29,293
According to his obituary, he was 52.

171
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:30,292
Died of a stroke.

172
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:33,025
Well ,that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.

173
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:34,491
How they looked at the moment of their death,

174
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:35,592
or how they looked in life.

175
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:37,591
Half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.

176
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,358
It says here he died at the hospital.

177
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:41,758
What was he even doing at the lake?

178
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,958
Sometimes spirits gather. I've seen it before.

179
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,425
But it's usually around the place of their death.

180
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,392
So this is where they all died?

181
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,158
You'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.

182
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:54,325
Do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?

183
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,258
Yeah. But that was almost 20 miles away.

184
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,216
So what are they doing there?

185
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:02,025
Keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one."

186
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:03,624
Not a lot of subtext there.

187
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,392
Unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.

188
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,658
It's the biologist I told you about from the university.

189
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:12,039
He found heavy concentrations

190
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,057
of a particular pathogen in the water.

191
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,258
The same pathogen found in the waters

192
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,624
filled with bodies after hurricane Katrina.

193
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,425
So they're actually in there?

194
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,420
We'll know soon enough.

195
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:20,231
Health department's gonna dredge the lake.

196
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:24,025
Oh! That's my appointment with Sam.

197
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:26,325
Well, go! Go. Get out of here.

198
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:30,624
What?

199
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,624
No, but I want it back. Give it back!

200
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,991
You gave it to me.

201
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,258
I did not give it to you.

202
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,724
Give it.

203
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,691
Well, here look. If you want it so badly.

204
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:42,758
Well, I just wanted to show you the article.

205
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,758
You always do this.

206
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:49,025
Hey, Eli.

207
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:50,292
Hey.

208
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:51,225
This is Nikki.

209
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,692
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

210
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,625
Nice to meet you, too.

211
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,158
Ok. Buddy. Take care.

212
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,325
Well, listen. Thank you so much for helping us out.

213
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:03,958
Oh, sure. Um...

214
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,158
Is this going to be a joint session?

215
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:08,692
No, it's just me. But we were running so late,

216
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,091
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...

217
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,358
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Not a problem.

218
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:14,759
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.

219
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,658
Thank you.

220
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:23,425
Past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.

221
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:24,924
With all due respect,

222
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,158
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life

223
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,891
Is going to help me find this one.

224
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,759
All right. The one that I lost.

225
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:35,392
It loosens the subconscious.

226
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,291
My subconscious?

227
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,759
Do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?

228
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:44,058
It is telling me that something off.

229
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,792
Good, that's good. Keep going.

230
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,492
Well, Nikki for example. Ok?

231
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,592
She's beautiful. She's smart. She's blonde?

232
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,692
Blonde? You're into blondes?

233
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,392
No. That she has nice hair.

234
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,958
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.

235
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,658
I mean, I remember how it smelled.

236
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,395
Well, then why can't I remember at all

237
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,312
jerking her around for 10 years?

238
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:06,858
Maybe you just didn't want to marry her.

239
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,659
Ok. So I was Mr. Can't Commit.

240
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,325
That's what everyone says.

241
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:16,025
You know what I think? I think I remember wanting to get married.

242
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,991
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...

243
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:21,824
Tell me about her.

244
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:25,358
Well, that we wanted to have kids.

245
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,691
I mean, maybe we were even trying.

246
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:31,059
If that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?

247
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,099
By she you mean...?

248
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,698
Nikki. Who else?

249
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,099
You tell me.

250
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,565
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.

251
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:43,365
I want you to consider that maybe...just maybe...

252
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:45,498
There's someone else.

253
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,865
Wait, someone more important

254
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,632
than the woman I spent half my adult life with?

255
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,531
Look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.

256
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:59,065
Look, I...I really gotta talk to her.

257
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,065
But thanks. This has been a big help.

258
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:45,898
Did they find anything?

259
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,231
Yeah. Plenty.

260
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:50,065
A reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.

261
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,732
Victims? Is that what they are?

262
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,531
Paula's father died in a hospital.

263
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:55,398
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.

264
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,099
Maybe the paper got it wrong.

265
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:59,065
Anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.

266
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,365
I don't hear anything.

267
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,798
They're here.

268
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:08,295
- So how'd it go with Sam? - So-so.

269
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,596
As his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.

270
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,700
what I almost told him.

271
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,734
Which was?

272
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,201
That he's Jim, your husband.

273
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:17,201
And anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.

274
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,400
So he remembered something?

275
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,700
Just that he wanted to have kids.

276
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,134
Well, that's huge!

277
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,301
He thinks he wants to have them with her.

278
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,400
What am I going to do?

279
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,667
You've disturbed us. All of us.

280
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,834
All we asked for was your silence.

281
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,467
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.

282
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,334
It's the health department and the police.

283
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,667
They want answers.

284
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,334
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.

285
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,433
They deserve to find out what happened to you.

286
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,067
Just tell us how we can help.

287
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:44,767
What is it that you want...

288
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:46,634
To protect the living.

289
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,800
From what?

290
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Got another one.

291
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,634
What if they just all died of the same thing?

292
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,167
Some chemical, toxic-something?

293
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,367
In the lake?

294
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:00,850
I think the C.D.C. would say that

295
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,267
the dead people are the problem.

296
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,434
And bothers me is not how they got there,

297
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,534
but why they stayed.

298
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,367
- Your Latte, and the cappuccino. - Thanks.

299
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:12,067
Well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?

300
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:13,167
Yeah. That's the upside.

301
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:14,733
That's an upside?

302
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,601
You know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured

303
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:19,067
there by someone or something.

304
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:22,700
What do you mean? Like some kinda ghost cult?

305
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,217
No. More like the ghosts in the tunnels,

306
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:27,668
you know, or the watchers.

307
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,334
The watchers?

308
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:32,867
A group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.

309
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:37,167
They said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.

310
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,301
Ahh. There's Sam.

311
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,934
And no Nikki. And he's heading toward the store.

312
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,467
Go. Go be with him.

313
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:47,568
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.

314
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:48,934
Go!

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,401
All right. Ok.

316
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,634
Sam.

317
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,301
Hey, Melinda. That's funny.

318
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,934
I was just coming to see you.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,501
Do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?

320
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,100
- No. I'm good.  - Great.

321
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,967
Thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.

322
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,501
Oh, yeah. It's no problem.

323
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,033
I didn't even see her last night.

324
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,267
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.

325
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,434
And she was asleep when I left. So.

326
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:20,067
Yeah. She's a night person.

327
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,534
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.

328
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:23,968
I guess both of us were.

329
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,133
She'd do crosswords. I would read the sports pages.

330
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,601
We'd stay up... I hate crosswords.

331
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:30,968
I don't even remember.

332
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,467
Although, you know it's funny.

333
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:35,701
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average...

334
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,033
3-13

335
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,701
Wait. How do you know that?

336
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,901
You hear something enough times it kinda sticks.

337
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:50,734
Look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,

338
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:54,200
How is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia

339
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,400
But I don't remember something that

340
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,534
Nikki and I fought about for years?

341
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:04,934
In my head, I remember wanting to have kids.

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,934
And Nikki didn't?

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,734
No, she says she did.

344
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:12,300
So this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.

345
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:14,968
And she's gotta be right.

346
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:16,100
I mean, she sounds right.

347
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:19,167
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.

348
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,834
Not all guys are like that.

349
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,767
My husband wasn't.

350
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:26,367
I was always the one dragging my heels.

351
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,567
But Jim, he...

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,767
He wanted everything that you're remembering...

353
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
which has to mean something, right?

354
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,367
What to me and Nikki?

355
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,100
No, to you.

356
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,534
It's none of my business.

357
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:48,017
But maybe you...maybe you shouldn't

358
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:51,434
listen to what everyone else says,

359
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,334
not about the stuff that really matters.

360
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,701
You know who you are.

361
00:15:55,767 --> 00:16:00,000
When you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...

362
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,701
To what? To being the guy like your husband?

363
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,667
Committed, confident enough in himself,

364
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:10,000
In the world, to bring another human being into it?

365
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,717
But you see, I wasn't.

366
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:15,367
So pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.

367
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,434
Thank you so much for coming.

368
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,834
Of course, you seemed upset.

369
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,234
I don't understand.

370
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,133
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,

371
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,450
And then the next thing I know I get

372
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,701
a call from the health department

373
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:34,501
recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.

374
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,200
And then I turn on the TV

375
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,250
and see them pulling dead bodies out

376
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,834
of water that I was just swimming in.

377
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,601
I know this must be scary...

378
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,167
It's disgusting.

379
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,701
I wish I could make you feel better.

380
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:47,701
But unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.

381
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,267
What are you talking about?

382
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,000
I need to ask you about your father.

383
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,367
First I need you to consider the possibility

384
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:58,734
that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.

385
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,200
Why?

386
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,801
Because I've talked to your father's ghost.

387
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,167
He was up at the lake.

388
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,300
He's there...

389
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,000
No, this is...this is crazy.

390
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,234
Paula, you said you felt a presence,

391
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,467
You think my dad is one of the corpses

392
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,067
They're pulling out of that water?

393
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,300
Look, I know this is hard to accept...

394
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,300
No, literally. There's no way.

395
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,968
Why?

396
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,767
He's right here.

397
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,534
Your father was cremated...where?



400
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:12,167
Is this what you wanted? To be cremated?

401
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,601
I was done with my body.

402
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:18,834
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.

403
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:23,234
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.

404
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,834
And now they have to feel your loss all over again.

405
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,467
"Protect the living."

406
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,234
You meant, from what happened to you.

407
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,167
We were betrayed.

408
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:34,868
Look what's become of us.

409
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,334
It's just how you see yourselves.

410
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
No. It's how they'll see us too.

411
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,534
My wife, my daughter.

412
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,601
They'll be forced to...

413
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,733
No. No. You can talk to them.

414
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,534
You can help them through this.

415
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:52,067
And they'll remember you just as you were.

416
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,733
And then you can move on.

417
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,967
We're not going anywhere.

418
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,733
We've waited.

419
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,434
There's business to finish.

420
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,800
What is it that you want to finish?

421
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,234
You mean who.

422
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,733
If they went to the movies they should been back by now.

423
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,166
Or if they went to dinner...

424
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:21,733
I don't know where they are.

425
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,466
And I don't want to know.

426
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,199
Well, you should want to know

427
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,499
When your competition looks like this.

428
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,033
It's tough love, girlfriend. And you gotta hear this.

429
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,132
Ok. So what do you want me to do?

430
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,433
Get into the game!

431
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,566
You gotta fight fire with fire!

432
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,283
Look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini

433
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:38,933
and mud wrestle for the guy.

434
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.

435
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,166
Does it look like I'm doing nothing?

436
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,366
No, it looks like you're helping another ghost.

437
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,433
Not just one ghost, a lot of them.

438
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:48,166
Ok, and they left loved ones behind.

439
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,366
And if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...

440
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,566
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.

441
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:56,333
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.

442
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,733
I'm not so sure Sam can.

443
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,466
Yeah. Neither am I.

444
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,733
Then why don't you do something about it?

445
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,166
Because nothing...

446
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:10,132
Nothing I can do will get him to remember me...

447
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,433
Or choose me.

448
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:15,232
All I can do is have faith.

449
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,766
That's all I have right now.

450
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,466
Faith.

451
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,683
It's so nice to meet you.

452
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,833
Carl gets so few visitors lately.

453
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,700
Not that we're surprised in his business.

454
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:30,000
Who wants to watch someone dying?

455
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:32,566
When did he close the funeral home?

456
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:38,366
When the cancer made it impossible for him to work.

457
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:41,666
Did he take care of your family?

458
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,633
No. He...helped some friends of mine.

459
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:51,533
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.

460
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,633
He doesn't listen to me anymore.

461
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,333
Get through to him?

462
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:03,967
He has so little time, and he's in such pain...

463
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:07,132
But he won't take the pills they give him.

464
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,800
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.

465
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,266
But really, why go on like this?

466
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,800
Do you want me to talk to him?

467
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:23,466
Thank you.

468
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,232
Come on.

469
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,266
Carl?

470
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,333
My name is Melinda Gordon.

471
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,933
I don't know you.

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,600
What do you want?

473
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,466
I came to talk about the lake.

474
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:00,299
What lake?

475
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:02,900
Where the bodies are.

476
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,433
Where you put them. Didn't you?

477
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,399
Part of me hoped I would die before this day.

478
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:16,000
And the other part?

479
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,900
What if they're waiting for me?

480
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Why did you do it?

481
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,900
I thought I had no choice.

482
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,533
What do you mean?

483
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,533
The big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.

484
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,433
But my great grandfather built that place from nothing.

485
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,299
And I was proud.

486
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:37,800
And I wanted a better price.

487
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,766
What happened?

488
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,299
What always happens.

489
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:45,499
They undercut me. I couldn't compete. The money ran out.

490
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:50,466
And when the furnace finally broke down,

491
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,833
I was desperate.

492
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,000
It's no excuse.

493
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,266
Sometimes I think...

494
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:02,067
The cancer is a punishment.

495
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:04,600
All this pain.

496
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:09,132
Your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.

497
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,866
I feel evil.

498
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:15,433
Carl, you made a mistake. You're not evil.

499
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:18,633
No. No. I feel evil around me.

500
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,299
Everywhere.

501
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:28,366
You're right. Carl, they're here.

502
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,299
All the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.

503
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,833
Oh, no.

504
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,967
I see them.

505
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,766
Oh, please.

506
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:43,466
They're angry because of what you did. But I can help.

507
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:44,904
Please just give me the names of all

508
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:46,466
the people that you threw into the lake.

509
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:49,033
I can talk to their families. I can help them heal.

510
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,132
To help them suffer, you mean.

511
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,067
Then they'll drop their anger, ok?

512
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:56,533
Not until he's suffered like we have.

513
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,933
You need to go into the light.

514
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
There's forgiveness there.

515
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:10,433
Carl, take your medicine.

516
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,299
I went back and looked where he told me to.

517
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:23,700
Back to the funeral home?

518
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,666
Wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.

519
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,967
Yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,

520
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,466
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.

521
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:33,166
Formaldehyde girl, that's funny.

522
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,800
Sorry. Not funny.

523
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,433
Did you get the list of names?

524
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:40,233
Yeah. I'm just trying to see

525
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,967
if their I.D.s match what we found.

526
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,633
Hey, here's Paula's dad.

527
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,733
Was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?

528
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,232
Cremation, cremation.

529
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,700
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...

530
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,166
Cremated. I'll call you back.

531
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,700
How are you?

532
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,266
I'm fine.

533
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:04,533
Um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?

534
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,766
Sure. What about him?

535
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,733
Well, first of all, I want to apologize

536
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,166
for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.

537
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:17,199
But I really...honestly, I didn't know who else to go to.

538
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:22,199
You know how you grow up imagining

539
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,033
what it'll be like to be in love?

540
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,666
You picture your boyfriend, your husband.

541
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:27,933
And not just the good times...

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,866
But the fights and the problems, too.

543
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,266
Yeah. Sure.

544
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,599
Could you ever have imagined

545
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,866
something like this happening?

546
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:37,399
A guy that you loved just wakes up one day

547
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:39,866
and then suddenly has no idea who you are?

548
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,232
No. Never.

549
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,067
Really? Not at all?

550
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:53,766
I...I don't understand.

551
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,967
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam

552
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:02,000
that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...

553
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,333
Do you think it's a little odd

554
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,900
that he's staying in your garage?

555
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:09,967
The same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?

556
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,266
And where are the plans? I haven't seen any of those.

557
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,199
What are you driving at?

558
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,833
When I first came here,

559
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,600
my idea was a quick in and out.

560
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,566
Let Sam know that he was forgiven,

561
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,333
maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.

562
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,399
But now that I've seen who he is,

563
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:31,266
this new Sam who wants kids,

564
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,766
who's ready to settle down.

565
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:38,566
I...I don't want to let him go.

566
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,600
What does that have to do with me?

567
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,700
That's what I'm trying to find out.

568
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:56,433
Shouldn't you be asking Sam?

569
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:03,533
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

570
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,466
I thought I just did.

571
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,433
Thank you.

572
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,866
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.

573
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:39,132
I apologize for coming by without calling.

574
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,800
I thought you'd want to know.

575
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,733
Carl died, a few hours ago.

576
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm so sorry.

577
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:48,199
I don't know what you said,

578
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:51,333
but after you left, he seemed to change.

579
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,466
He relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.

580
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:59,866
After a few hours later,

581
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,132
he took my hand.

582
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,733
Then his eyes opened wide,

583
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,967
like he saw something amazing.

584
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,833
And that was it.

585
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:16,333
That look in his eyes,

586
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,433
he must have just seen the face of his maker.

587
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,766
Don't you think?

588
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,700
That's a lovely notion.

589
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,433
Thank you so much, Melinda,

590
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:34,600
for giving my husband peace.

591
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,633
Melinda?

592
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,266
Melinda!

593
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,266
How did I get here?

594
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,633
Oh, no! No. Melinda!

595
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,099
Melinda!

596
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,600
Melinda!

597
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:56,766
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.

598
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,566
For you, there's nowhere but here.

599
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,900
Forgive me.

600
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,633
Please, I'm begging you.

601
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,132
I'm begging you for forgiveness.

602
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,466
Please! Please!

603
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:13,266
That's not what you'll find here.

604
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,967
Melinda!

605
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,499
Help me!

606
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,599
Tell me, how can I help you?

607
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,200
Mom, you wanted to talk about this.

608
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,833
No one is mad at you, Mom.

609
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,966
Speak for yourself.

610
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,133
When Edwin had his stroke,

611
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
he was jogging a few miles from home.

612
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,467
He had no wallet, no ID.

613
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:48,100
So the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.

614
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,833
I went.

615
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,434
But I couldn't do it.

616
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,267
I just...I couldn't look at him.

617
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:58,367
Paula was there by then, so she did it.

618
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,467
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.

619
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:04,500
Mom, I didn't mind doing it.

620
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,866
There was no shame in what happened to him.

621
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,366
Why couldn't I just look at him?

622
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,866
Marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.

623
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:16,966
Most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.

624
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:22,000
My daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.

625
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,400
He is stuck here? He can't move on?

626
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,833
That's right.

627
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,966
He and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,

628
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,400
They're earthbound,

629
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:34,133
which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.

630
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
Why not?

631
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:37,133
They don't want you to know what happened to them.

632
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,067
Out of shame.

633
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:42,667
That's why your husband tried to scare Paula away

634
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,534
- that night at the lake. - Can we help them?

635
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,933
You might.

636
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,767
But right now, they're very angry.

637
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,766
Until the right moment comes...

638
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,033
If Edwin's ghost is still here,

639
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,634
then that means he saw what I did when he died.

640
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:59,833
Please give me the chance to make it right.

641
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:21,100
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!

642
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:22,567
Sorry.

643
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:28,501
I'm sorry. The door was open.

644
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:31,000
Look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.

645
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:34,100
And, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.

646
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,367
I'm fine.

647
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:37,033
Are you sure? Because you seemed a little tense,

648
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,666
and frankly, so did Nikki.

649
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,501
No, really. I'm fine.

650
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:42,933
Ok.

651
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,467
Well, then I'll go back to the hotel.

652
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,633
Why?

653
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,867
I mean, she's been here almost a week,

654
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:54,367
so what are you going to do?

655
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:56,833
I don't know. It's weird.

656
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,967
I feel things when I'm with her.

657
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,533
Nice things.

658
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,900
Her smell is familiar.

659
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:05,200
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.

660
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:09,900
You know, it's comfortable.

661
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,234
Ok.

662
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,967
Melinda,not everybody can have what you had with your husband.

663
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,666
All right? And given my track record,

664
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:19,401
I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.

665
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,700
Of course you are.

666
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,800
Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.

667
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:26,267
And, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance,

668
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,633
you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.

669
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,566
Maybe that's a good thing.

670
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,401
Maybe I should reach out with both hands.

671
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,700
All right.

672
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,600
Don't.

673
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,600
Don't what?

674
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,401
You can do better for yourself than

675
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,933
"comfortable"

676
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,533
or "maybe getting some feelings back."

677
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,434
Hold out for more.

678
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,167
What?

679
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:01,234
What am I holding out for?

680
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,633
Everything.

681
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,434
Hold out for everything.

682
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,867
You know, that's easy for you to say.

683
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:17,967
You had everything.

684
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:43,633
Who's there?

685
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:55,833
Carl, why are you here?

686
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,501
You said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.

687
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,334
Did you look into the light?

688
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,933
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.

689
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Why not?

690
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:06,167
Because of my shame.

691
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,603
But you apologized.

692
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:10,736
I mean, you tried to make things right.

693
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,370
You can come out of the shadows now.

694
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:14,502
No, I can't. They're looking for me.

695
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,569
They want me to go with them.

696
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,836
Those spirits are angry because of what you did.

697
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:21,036
Nobody can keep you from the light.

698
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:24,103
It's not them. It's the others.

699
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,003
The others?

700
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,036
Spirits I've never seen before.

701
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:29,403
But they said they know you.

702
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:30,836
They know me?

703
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:33,703
They said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,

704
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,303
And something you cherished was lost.

705
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,136
And?

706
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:42,736
They said you believed in things that weren't right,

707
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:47,669
And trusting those things might hurt others...

708
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,602
And you.

709
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:56,102
Hello?

710
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,070
I'm here.

711
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,602
What do you want from me?

712
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,303
What did I do to offend you?

713
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,803
You did nothing.

714
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:08,270
Then why did you take my husband away?

715
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:11,803
Fate did that, not us.

716
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,969
You came to me and you said

717
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,803
That death would touch something that I loved.

718
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,569
And before I knew it, he was dead.

719
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:20,236
We just warned you to be careful.

720
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,503
Yeah. 'cause that's what you were doing was warning me

721
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:23,936
With all your lies and threats.

722
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:27,236
We don't lie or make threats.

723
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:29,969
You told Carl that he couldn't cross over.

724
00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:31,869
The light has never denied anyone.

725
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,503
The light doesn't make the choice.

726
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:35,003
We each do.

727
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,170
We? You mean you.

728
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:42,437
No, each of us for ourselves.

729
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:46,170
You wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.

730
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:48,437
Well, it's the same reason that Carl did.

731
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:53,370
When the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.

732
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:55,803
So Carl's shame kept him here.

733
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:58,170
When spirits feel unworthy,

734
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:01,769
sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.

735
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:04,402
to make ourselves worthy.

736
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:06,070
What spirits stay back to do that?

737
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,769
I haven't seen any.

738
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,736
You're meeting four of them now.

739
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:12,403
You?

740
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,303
Why do you think we're still here?

741
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,036
So when Carl said that you asked him to join you...?

742
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:25,070
Carl?

743
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:28,303
They explained it to me, and I understand now.

744
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,503
This is what I want.

745
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:30,803
Are you sure?

746
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,736
Because they said it's your choice.

747
00:37:32,803 --> 00:37:34,303
You can move on now.

748
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,403
I want to be one of them.

749
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,869
All right.

750
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:43,503
Will you help me fix the wrongs I did?

751
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:44,769
How?

752
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:47,403
By taking away their shame.

753
00:37:57,003 --> 00:37:59,769
Thank you all for coming tonight.

754
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:02,003
We'd asked for family and friends,

755
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,103
And I just never realized how many friends we have.

756
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,669
- Hey, Eli. - Hi, Sam.

757
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:10,270
I wasn't sure what to say,

758
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:15,903
So I asked my darling english major Paula for some help.

759
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:18,602
And she wrote down some thoughts for me.

760
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:22,636
Paula? Don't be shy.

761
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,403
"Tonight we send our loved ones

762
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,236
"to where we thought they'd already gone.

763
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:39,403
"It seems like a detour,

764
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,936
"an embarrassing wrong turn.

765
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:47,103
"but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.

766
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,170
"We pretended we did, and that made us feel better.

767
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:55,503
"But every path leads to the unknown.

768
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:01,736
"some paths join others, and some split off on their own.

769
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:06,203
"we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.

770
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,936
"maybe the more we insist on knowing,

771
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:15,070
"the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns.

772
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:18,936
"I know what you're thinking,

773
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:22,437
"that the unknown is scary.

774
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,602
"But that's ok.

775
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,903
"we're human.

776
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:32,769
"maybe before we feel free,

777
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:36,936
"we're supposed to feel fearful.

778
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:40,036
"Maybe it means more that way.

779
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,203
"So let's all say goodbye now.

780
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,803
"and remember, that no matter what we're feeling,

781
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,170
"there's no shame.

782
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:56,503
No shame at all."

783
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,303
Melinda.

784
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,103
Oh, hey, Sam.

785
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,136
Nikki's downstairs.

786
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:52,070
She wanted to talk to you first.

787
00:40:52,136 --> 00:40:53,470
First?

788
00:40:58,003 --> 00:40:59,836
Nikki...

789
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,503
Melinda.

790
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:08,969
Heh, I...I don't know why you've been so nice to me.

791
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:12,403
Letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...

792
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,736
Nikki...

793
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:15,669
It's not easy to say this,

794
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:18,370
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

795
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,136
And whatever you're feeling right now,

796
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:23,070
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.

797
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:26,569
Someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.

798
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:28,170
You don't have to...

799
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,669
The weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.

800
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:36,537
He's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.

801
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,669
He talks about holding out.

802
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:40,069
And that's sort of amazing,

803
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:45,203
because everything I've been holding out for,

804
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,736
He is ready to give.

805
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:52,336
And I don't know why,

806
00:41:52,336 --> 00:41:55,103
but I feel like I have to thank you for that.

807
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,936
No hard feelings, I hope.

808
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:06,702
You...you deserve every happiness.

809
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,437
Thank you.

810
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,602
Thank you.

811
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,070
Thanks for coming.

812
00:42:38,303 --> 00:42:41,903
Please, uh...

813
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:44,236
Just be happy.

814
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,003
Bye.

815
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:57,537
Bye.
