1
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:14,083
Now where would you go
if you were an accountant

2
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:17,297
who had just stolen
15 million dollars?

3
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:20,230
Mike  Fifteen million!
Where wouldn't I go?

4
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,609
Well, he's routed the money
through the Turks and Caicos.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:31,636
Well, follow the money.
Or, follow the phone bill.

6
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:35,275
Let's see...
20 calls to a number in Paris

7
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,713
from his cell phone.
Girlfriend?

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,912
Sylvie Girard,
325 Rue Montaigne.

9
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:44,569
Man, what did we do in the days
before reverse directories?

10
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:51,936
And another case solved.
Yes, and a potential payday.

11
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:56,128
My landlord has called me
three times this week.

12
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:59,253
Oh, so I take it
I'm buying dinner tonight.

13
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,472
Look at you.
You just solved a mystery, too.

14
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:06,905
Yes, look at me.
Listen, I was wondering what

15
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:09,276
your weekend is looking like?

16
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:12,321
Besides tracking down the
accountant that's blown

17
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,875
all of my client's money
on the Champs Elysee?

18
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,563
Not much, you have
a better offer?

19
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:19,718
Well, it's Dylan's birthday.
No way!

20
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:23,434
How old is he now.
Like, seven?

21
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:25,030
No, eight.
Can you believe it?

22
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,900
Wow.
Hm...

23
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:32,343
Do you think that might be
kind of weird though?

24
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,025
Actually, he asked if
I could bring Aunt Vicki

25
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,192
to the party.
I was at Molly's the other

26
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:41,979
day and I guess he overheard
me talking about you.

27
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,246
What exactly were
you talking about?

28
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't know... that
I was seeing you again,

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,051
you know.
That you were seeing me

30
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,298
or that you were 'seeing me'?

31
00:01:55,127 --> 00:02:01,824
I don't know... that
I was seeing you... around.

32
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,963
And Molly was happy.
She always did like you.

33
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:11,522
It's just I'm so close
on this accountant thing.

34
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:14,561
I think I should probably stay
in and follow it through.

35
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:16,422
Oh, absolutely!
I mean, you gotta make hay.

36
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,024
I totally get that.
But, um...

37
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,333
we're still on for dinner
though, right?

38
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,280
You're damn right we are!
Great.

39
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,429
Annie  Turkey soup at the
mission tomorrow, Francine!

40
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:39,120
Too damn salty!
Every time.

41
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:43,456
They can keep their
damn salty soup.

42
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:06,929
Who's there?

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,879
Annie?
Is that you?

44
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,997
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

45
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:42,358
- Synch: AlexandraD. -

46
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,197
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

47
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,335
Coreen  Oh, could you put
that down, please?

48
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,549
It's from a friend.
Swarovski?

49
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:59,241
I think so.
I used to sell these things.

50
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,655
Ms. Nelson should
be back really soon.

51
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,563
Can I get you a coffee?

52
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,398
Hey, I know you.

53
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:08,888
This is the panhandle queen
of Yonge and Carlton.

54
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:11,041
And you were the only
decent cop on that beat.

55
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,130
I work Yorkville now.
Less coins, more bills.

56
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,024
Good stuff.
Annie Howard.

57
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,299
Word on the street is
you went private.

58
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,001
I looked you up.
Well, I hate to break this

59
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,478
to you, but if you're going
door to door, you may have

60
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,620
picked the wrong door.
My friend Francine was

61
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,086
killed last night.
People just keep getting killed.

62
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:32,212
How do you know
they're being killed?

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,824
Some of them
just disappeared.

64
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:38,518
Last night I heard Francine
screaming, and then

65
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:40,839
she was gone, too.
How may people are we

66
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,460
talking about here?
Frankie, Tyrell and Lynda.

67
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,308
Four at least, maybe more.

68
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:49,003
Annie, we have got to
call the police.

69
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,144
You were a cop.
You know that they're not

70
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:54,520
going to listen to us!
Maybe they'll listen to you.

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,752
Vicki, I don't know which one
of us is going to be next.

72
00:04:57,752 --> 00:04:59,840
I can pay you.
A bunch of us chipped in.

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,461
I've got almost
a hundred bucks.

74
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,667
That's okay.
I'll open an account.

75
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,635
Really, this...
Do you want me to take it?

76
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:08,048
Let me.
Okay, okay, great.

77
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,713
That's great.
Coreen  I got it.

78
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,899
All right, take a big breath.

79
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,026
And we're just going to start
from the beginning, all right?

80
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,775
Dave  So, um... looks like
she was a working girl.

81
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:37,975
And you're gonna love this.
Mike  Yeah? No ID?

82
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,994
Dave  Better.
No blood.

83
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,344
Oh yeah, baby.

84
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:45,570
Looks like return of the
vampire killer on both screens.

85
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,941
Look, it can't
be the same guy.

86
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,947
All the other vics, they had
their throats ripped open.

87
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:56,122
But this..
Maybe he's getting neater.

88
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,782
Everything pointed to that
Norman Bridewell dude, right?

89
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,577
I mean, we never did
get our hands on him.

90
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,768
Crowley heard about this?

91
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:05,125
Oh yeah, she's got all
the dogs out on this one.

92
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,311
All hands on deck.

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,018
Like that'll help.

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,933
Listen, Dave,
see that guy over there?

95
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,643
Does he look like
a local to you?

96
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:23,360
Seems a little upscale
for this 'hood.

97
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,394
How about we go say hello.
Yeah.

98
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,360
Listen, make sure you get
a photo of this guy, right?

99
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:36,752
Don't even worry about it.
I've been taking pictures

100
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:37,786
for the last half hour.

101
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:40,169
Vicki  She lived here?

102
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,479
Annie  Francine didn't
like crowds.

103
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,910
Actually, she didn't
like individuals either.

104
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:47,175
Not a people person.

105
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:52,980
Did you notice anyone
new around the park lately?

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,588
Anyone on or off their meds?

107
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,698
People are in and out,
and on and off.

108
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:59,385
What about anyone who
might have had a specific

109
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,529
beef with her.

110
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,476
Not with her or
any of the others.

111
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,494
It's just someone who
likes hurting people.

112
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,246
Vicki  Where's her stuff?

113
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,258
She had some
good stuff, man.

114
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:14,372
Her sleeping bag
was almost new.

115
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,917
If something happened
to her, that's evidence.

116
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,842
Nobody killed her for it, if
that's what you're getting at.

117
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:20,763
Annie, look,
I believe you, all right?

118
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:24,548
I just need some kind of
proof that someone took her.

119
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,186
What's this?

120
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,768
Looks like drag marks.

121
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,338
Annie  That's
Francine's bag!

122
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,410
Oh... that's the kind
of evidence I mean.

123
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,221
No! Don't touch that!
We don't want your

124
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,460
fingerprints on that.

125
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,047
Looking for something?
I am surprised that you

126
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:20,779
have time to go digging
through cold cases.

127
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,507
There could be
a connection to our case.

128
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,261
What, you think someone
broke out of the retirement

129
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,400
home to kill a working girl?
There are similarities

130
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,779
with all of this
and our girl, okay?

131
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,973
It could be a copycat.
It could one of those on-going

132
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,349
ritualistic things.

133
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,501
You said Norman Bridewell
looked good for it.

134
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,366
That's why I put out
a national warrant.

135
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,621
Is he back or what?
I still think Bridewell

136
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,165
did those murders.
But this is a different guy

137
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,033
and I'm developing
some theories, okay?

138
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,945
Involving 75-year-old crimes?

139
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:47,157
Yes.
Well, I look forward to

140
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:50,288
hearing it, detective.
It should be entertaing.

141
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,860
Do you know what it's like
trying to draw with somebody

142
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,696
looking over your shoulder?
It makes you want to stop

143
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:20,115
working and discuss my case?
I have a deadline.

144
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,741
If this book isn't in to the
printers by the end of the

145
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,549
month, my editor's
going to kill me... again.

146
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,863
So much for a timeless
existence as one of the

147
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:30,906
children of the night.

148
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,747
Welcome to
the 21st century.

149
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,622
Look, Henry, these
people need our help.

150
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,433
I gave at the office.
What, the Little Prince

151
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,028
doesn't help the homeless?

152
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:44,716
I wandered Europe for
years after the Great War.

153
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,650
I know what it's
like to have nothing.

154
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,825
What do you need?
Well, I've called the

155
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,757
police in on this, but I just
think that a vampire's nose

156
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:02,155
for blood will find things
in the sewer that they

157
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,480
will miss.
Sewer?

158
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,643
Well, you didn't say
anything about a sewer.

159
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:09,281
That's because I was
saving the best for last.

160
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,888
I have to meet Annie at
the coffee shop around

161
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,613
the corner, but I will
call you later, okay?

162
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,354
Going alone?

163
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:18,803
Vicki?

164
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,297
Nice picture.
You should get a better

165
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:29,528
frame, man...
like something in a rustic

166
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,101
with a linen liner...
Yeah, you wanna put the

167
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,437
picture down, please?

168
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,278
Vicki  It's okay, Annie.
Mike's going to help us.

169
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:41,351
I picked this up in the park.
It's Francine's.

170
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,442
It's covered in blood.

171
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:45,471
It's okay.

172
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:49,035
Mike  Yeah, it's covered in
blood and you have no victim.

173
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:51,843
I have half a dozen
witnesses who heard screams.

174
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:54,134
Vicki, come on, you know
how this is going to play out.

175
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,047
Even if I get a statement, by
the time I need her in court,

176
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:00,556
she's going to be gone.
She's going to be on something.

177
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,831
She's going to off her meds.
Mike, I just handed

178
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:05,811
you a bloody bag.
Annie says there are four

179
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,580
people missing, maybe more.
We might be dealing

180
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,699
with a serial killer.

181
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:13,002
Or, this Francine woman
decided to move into the

182
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:16,607
sewer, cut herself on
the grate, or she OD'd.

183
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:21,142
Look, Vick...

184
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:25,279
Vick, I just have a really full
caseload right now, okay?

185
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,531
So give me someone
who can spare an hour.

186
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:29,743
I can't sell this!
Send out a uniform,

187
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:31,655
at least to bag
and tag the evidence.

188
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,716
Why don't you handle it?
Fine! Loan me the

189
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,332
forensics team and
I'll get right on it.

190
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,558
All right, you know, I'll
make a deal with you, okay?

191
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:43,932
I will help you with your case,
if you'll help me with mine.

192
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:45,613
You still need me for
the tough stuff, huh?

193
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,935
There's something
I want to show you.

194
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:49,805
Follow me.

195
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,625
Vicki  Five minutes.

196
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,507
This isn't Henry.
He doesn't do this.

197
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,973
Mike  Oh, really?
Fang Boy doesn't eat?

198
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:25,149
He doesn't kill.

199
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:26,784
He tell you that?

200
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:34,090
You've never actually
even asked him have you?

201
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,051
I trust him.

202
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,606
Who are you and what have
you done with Vicki Nelson?

203
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:41,819
Look, Henry is not a killer.
No?

204
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,017
And how do you know so much
about his drinking habits?

205
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,257
How many times has he
sucked your blood, Vicki?

206
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,144
You really wanna know?

207
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,297
Once.
Are you insane?

208
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,183
He was dying.

209
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,714
Any idea who he was
with two nights ago?

210
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,506
Two nights ago
he was with me.

211
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:06,824
All night?

212
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:10,743
Most of it.

213
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:13,308
Well, I hope I never
need you as an alibi.

214
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,887
Listen, I've got a body with
two puncture wounds, no blood,

215
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:20,974
and no sign of struggle.
Even if I didn't believe

216
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,087
in vampires,
I'd be thinking vampire.

217
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:25,503
So help me out here, Vick.
Is it Henry, your new partner?

218
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,703
Or are we talking about
some kind of blood sucking

219
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,638
convention in town?
Maybe it's a wannabe,

220
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:30,877
or a cult.

221
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,352
Maybe it's another demon.

222
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:35,499
Okay, fine.

223
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,353
If Henry didn't do this,
then he won't mind

224
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,593
helping me out, will he?

225
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:11,829
Stop!
You killed the woman.

226
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:14,448
Francine.
Peter  I didn't kill anyone.

227
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,641
I'm hunting.
Hunting what?

228
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,722
The Windigo.
Vicki  What the hell's

229
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:24,038
a Windigo?
Hunger, pure hunger.

230
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,812
It doesn't happen to
drink blood, does it?

231
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:30,589
It eats your flesh,
cracks your bones and

232
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,257
sucks out the marrow.
To each their own.

233
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,709
So what is it then,
some kind of animal?

234
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,710
Some say Windigo was once
a lost man in the woods.

235
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,023
A cannibal spirit came into
him and kept him alive,

236
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,527
killing other lost
souls he'd meet.

237
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,139
It killed Francine.
How do you know that?

238
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:52,981
Did you see it?
We've met before.

239
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:57,866
When I was ten, my father
took me out to shoot a deer.

240
00:14:58,537 --> 00:14:59,776
There was no deer.

241
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:03,700
There was a sound like the
wind, but not like the wind.

242
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:08,337
My father went to meet it
and that's when it took him.

243
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,365
That's when I saw
it and it saw me.

244
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,151
I grabbed a branch out of the
fire to keep it back,

245
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,299
but it never came for me.

246
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,889
Next day, I found
my father's bones.

247
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,371
Do you believe in
destiny Ms. Nelson?

248
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,401
Not a big fan.
My people say when

249
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,910
you see a Windigo,
you're marked for death.

250
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,434
No matter how far you
run, it'll find you.

251
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,269
You can't believe
it followed you here.

252
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:42,754
Maybe it just moved
here for better hunting.

253
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,432
But maybe if it would've
killed me back then,

254
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:53,608
all these other people
would still be alive.

255
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,003
Vicki  Do me a favour, Peter,

256
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,280
would you stay in
a shelter tonight?

257
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,147
I like it outside.
It's my home.

258
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:15,779
Do you believe him?

259
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:18,592
I believe he believes it.

260
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:23,568
Great. Aboriginal cannibal
spirit's infesting city ravines.

261
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,400
Maybe he's got
the right idea.

262
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,345
Maybe somebody should put
together a hunting party.

263
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,432
That's the spirit!
Actually, 'us' not being

264
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:31,112
the somebody I was referring to.

265
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:33,682
My book's still got four
pages that need inking.

266
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,150
The police can
handle this, Vicki.

267
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,884
Okay.
Yeah, Mike did say he

268
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,588
would look into it for me.
Good.

269
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:40,628
Um-hum, had to make
a little deal, though.

270
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,551
He's got a body.
Puncture marks on the neck,

271
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:46,893
no blood.
He wants to talk to

272
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:48,244
you about it.
Imagine that!

273
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,551
Henry, you're the
only vampire he knows.

274
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,719
What do you think?
That you didn't do it.

275
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,548
Henry, it's just
a conversation.

276
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,922
It's nothing to worry about.
That's what my father said

277
00:16:58,922 --> 00:16:59,671
to Anne Boleyn...

278
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,834
right before he took her head.

279
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:15,472
You have a visitor.

280
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,015
Did he say what he wants?
He said it's

281
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,048
a personal matter.

282
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,275
Detective Sergeant Celluci,
what can I do for you, Mr...?

283
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:38,528
Javier Mendoza.
I saw you the other day

284
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:41,011
at the place where they found
that poor young girl's body.

285
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:42,091
Yeah, I saw you, too.

286
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,999
Make it a habit of hanging
around crime scenes,

287
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,007
Mr. Mendoza?
I was there for the same

288
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,449
reason you were, detective.
I'm hunting for the killer.

289
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,423
Oh really?
Well, do you have any

290
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:56,426
suspects for me?

291
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,263
We both know who did this...

292
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,457
Henry Fitzroy.

293
00:18:04,926 --> 00:18:06,745
Coreen  Pretty much every
northern culture has its own

294
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:08,418
variation of the Windigo myth.

295
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:11,292
Some researchers figure it's
easier to have a supernatural

296
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,882
explanation for cannibalism
rather than admit people

297
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:16,518
actually eat each other.
The Windigo is human?

298
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:19,202
Depends of the legend.
Some cultures say they

299
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,161
possess a person, make
them crave human flesh.

300
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,974
This sounds more like
the monster version.

301
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:25,198
I'm not going to like
the monster version, am I?

302
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,704
You know what
a Sasquatch is, right?

303
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,000
Bigfoot?
I've got it, a Sasquatch.

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,786
It's like a Sasquatch,
only it's taller and

305
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:36,371
thinner and less hairy, and
Sasquatches are vegetarians.

306
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:40,230
Vegetarian?
These things eat people.

307
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:43,011
Well then, the burning
question is, how do we get it

308
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:45,739
to stop eating people?

309
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:49,662
You've been following me?
I've been tracking him.

310
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:55,033
Like you, I'm an officer
of the law - Canon law.

311
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,626
I work for the Church.

312
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,377
I deal with anomalies.

313
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,789
That's what you
think Fitzroy is?

314
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,523
An anomaly?
I think he is an abomination.

315
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:06,118
And we both know that your
law is ill equipped

316
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,423
to deal with his kind.

317
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,693
If he killed this girl,
he'll pay for it.

318
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,335
Really, detective?
I mean if you can catch him,

319
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,065
how do you intend
to prosecute him?

320
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,174
Do you think a
cell can hold him?

321
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:19,553
And even if you can imprison
him, are you prepared for

322
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:22,274
what will happen on his
first sunrise in captivity?

323
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,968
I know this is
difficult for you.

324
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:28,210
Men like us, we follow a code.

325
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:31,430
Then you know that this
badge means that I don't believe

326
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,073
in vigilantes or lynchings.

327
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:35,294
I don't kill vampires.

328
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:39,956
I have a means to neutralize
them so they won't kill again.

329
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:43,489
I offer them salvation.

330
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:48,301
Mr. Mendoza, saving souls
is a little outside of

331
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:49,304
my jurisdiction.

332
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:51,377
And that poor girl
we saw earlier,

333
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:54,321
was she outside
your jurisdiction?

334
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:56,988
I don't think
the law can help.

335
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,339
But you can.

336
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:11,101
Delphine Guillaume, age 26,
a lover of Fitzroy's.

337
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,469
These photos must be
at least 50 years old.

338
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:16,987
A little more than 60.

339
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:20,953
Fitzroy killed her,
after he seduced her.

340
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:29,424
My number's in the file.

341
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:45,490
How do we do this?

342
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,735
Do you hit me with phone
books until I confess?

343
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,988
Mike  Yeah, if you like.

344
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,425
Ever meet her?

345
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:58,730
She's not exactly my type.
Oh, and what exactly

346
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,028
is your type, Henry?
O negative?

347
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:11,110
Mike, what are you doing?
He's trying to help.

348
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,863
That a vampire bite?
It might be.

349
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,750
Might be or is?

350
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,426
I told you already,
I've never met her.

351
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,076
Any other vampires in
town I should know about?

352
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,184
We don't all belong
to the same book club.

353
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:25,643
Now, I've answered your
questions, are we done?

354
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:26,564
Not quite.

355
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:33,583
Any of these
ladies look familiar?

356
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:36,589
Vicki  What is this?

357
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:38,908
You going to try and pin every
cold case in the files on him?

358
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:41,268
No, just the ones I think
he might actually have done.

359
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,960
If I'm going to kill
somebody, I'm not going to

360
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,340
be that sloppy about it.
Really?

361
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:47,763
Well, maybe it's
an accident, huh?

362
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:52,115
You know, you start
going at it...

363
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,442
things get a little too frisky,
before you know it...

364
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:58,629
If I take the life,
I remember it.

365
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:01,944
Let's test that, shall we?
Know what, Mike?

366
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:03,920
This is enough.
He's answered your questions.

367
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,857
Delphine.
Old friend?

368
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,043
Where did you get this?

369
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,717
You first.

370
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,909
Did you kill her?

371
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,123
Yes.

372
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,894
Now unless you want to try to
charge me for something that

373
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:32,925
happened in 1944,
we're done here.

374
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:45,055
Don't worry.
Annie will watch your ride.

375
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,043
Are you ever going
to talk to me again?

376
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,781
Are you going to tell me
why you had Celluci do

377
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:54,023
your dirty work?
No, he told me he just

378
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:56,278
wanted to ask you about the
girl they found the other night.

379
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:58,439
I had no idea he was
going to ambush you.

380
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,504
Who was the woman
in the old photo?

381
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:04,756
It was a long time ago.

382
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:08,011
What about those
other women, though?

383
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,440
If you didn't know them,
why not just say so?

384
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,058
Who says I
didn't know them?

385
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:12,097
Henry  You should go back.
It's my fight.

386
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,020
What is it?
Death.

387
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:23,791
Peter.

388
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:41,500
Vicki  Oh, shoot.

389
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,172
Peter  That jacket
belongs to Francine.

390
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:55,552
Oh Peter, I'm sorry.

391
00:24:57,644 --> 00:24:58,683
Henry  LOOK OUT!

392
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,388
Vicki  PETER! NO!
Peter  HE'S MINE!

393
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:27,631
Vicki  Why did it let us go?

394
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,031
It has its food.

395
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,753
We've got to go back,
Peter's still in there.

396
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,213
No, it's too late.
It's too late.

397
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,341
God, I thought you
could take that thing!

398
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,417
So did I.

399
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,853
What's the matter?
You're not healing.

400
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,657
I lost too much blood.

401
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,462
I need to feed.

402
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:52,676
I wasn't asking.

403
00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:54,980
I'll drop you downtown.

404
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:39,968
Have you been here all night?

405
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:42,931
What, it's morning already?

406
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:45,485
I think you need
this more than I do.

407
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,300
God bless you!

408
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,554
Kate?
Hypothetical.

409
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,428
Hit me.

410
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:59,031
All right.
There's this case and

411
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:02,021
you know who done it.
I mean you just know.

412
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:03,386
But you can't
make it stick.

413
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:06,250
You've got evidence,
maybe even a confession.

414
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,504
But it's not good because
of how you obtained it.

415
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,362
Or because of
who the guy is.

416
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,913
They're connected?
Untouchable.

417
00:28:12,913 --> 00:28:17,547
But, there is someone at
another agency who can put

418
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:18,497
this guy away.

419
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,409
Only this agency doesn't
play by the same rules.

420
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,916
FBI?

421
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:24,991
RCMP?

422
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:29,000
Military?
Right,

423
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,907
hypothetical.

424
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,487
Hypothetical.

425
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,080
How bad is this?
Serial killer.

426
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:39,112
Lots, over a long time.

427
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:43,599
You hand it over.
No matter what

428
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,546
they'd do to him?

429
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,971
We both believe
in due process.

430
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:51,486
We wouldn't be having this
conversation otherwise.

431
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:55,419
The important thing is to get
the bad guy off the street.

432
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,950
No more killing.

433
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:05,554
No more killing.

434
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,418
Peter said that once
the thing sees you,

435
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,807
you're marked for death.
What does that mean?

436
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:15,062
I have a new stalker?

437
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:17,913
That's one version.
Great.

438
00:29:17,913 --> 00:29:19,465
Before you know it, the
supernatural types are

439
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:21,334
going to have to line up
to take a shot at me.

440
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:23,833
Henry, too.
You guys should stick together.

441
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,592
That's a bit
complicated right now.

442
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,168
Is there anything else on
the aboriginal connection?

443
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,646
What's Peter's heritage?

444
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:33,317
Iroquois? Mohawk? Algonquin?

445
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:35,116
You know, I never
thought to ask.

446
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,081
What difference
does that make now?

447
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,670
The Windigo has over
60 names and more than

448
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,949
twice as many stories
of how it kills and why,

449
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,563
and how to stop it.
If it is Peter's Windigo,

450
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:48,435
maybe I could narrow
down the options.

451
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:50,165
All the myths are
culturally specific.

452
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,648
Okay, best guess.
How do we kill this thing?

453
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:54,551
You could try
silver bullets.

454
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:57,938
Oh, come on, even I know
that's a werewolf thing.

455
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,358
A lot of cultures believe
silver has mystic properties.

456
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:03,515
I've got a documented case
from 1864 where the Ojibway

457
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:06,491
go hunting for a Windigo
with silver bullets.

458
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,789
They have documented cases?
How cool is that, right?

459
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,074
Well, I guess I'll be
melting down Grandma's

460
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:15,136
bracelet tonight.
Also, a lot of cultures

461
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,023
believe that Windigos' hearts
are made of ice,

462
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,691
or turn to ice, or freeze.
Some people say that's

463
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,667
a metaphor, but there are
stories about burning Windigos

464
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,922
or boiling them alive or...
Wait, that's it!

465
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,003
When Peter was little,
he hid by the fire.

466
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:30,428
When Francine was killed,
Annie was by the fire.

467
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,839
It's afraid of fire.
I mean it didn't go after

468
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,699
Peter until after
he dropped his torch.

469
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,761
That's why it
lives up north.

470
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:37,712
It can stand the heat.
Well, that's great.

471
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,542
All we need now is
a flamethrower.

472
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,674
Done!
I'll need an hour.

473
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:44,840
I made one last
year for a party.

474
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:46,967
Of course you did.

475
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:58,029
You look better.
Did you have a nice dinner?

476
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,366
The body's in the next room
if you'd like to take a look.

477
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:02,255
Yeah, I'll take
your word for it.

478
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:04,140
Listen, Henry.
We've got to go back.

479
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,290
Into the sewer to kill
an unkillable spirit.

480
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,792
Unless you have
a better idea.

481
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,573
Not going to the sewer?
This isn't your problem.

482
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,463
Henry, I have
an obligation.

483
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:18,104
One hundred dollars...
That's all it takes

484
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:19,535
to risk your life?

485
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:22,636
Actually it was
98 dollars and 56 cents.

486
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,209
Look, Henry, it killed Peter.

487
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:28,118
It's going to keep killing.
And who's going to go out

488
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,977
there and stop it, huh?
The police aren't going

489
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:32,536
to go near this.
Why does it have to be you?

490
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:35,848
There are things out there
that people can't or won't see.

491
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:39,565
Now that I've seen it, I'm
not just going to walk away.

492
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,193
You know how I surviv
500 years?

493
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,453
Mega doses of vitamin C
and complete danger avoidance?

494
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:47,569
Picking my battles.

495
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,557
Then if I were you,
I would put your coat on.

496
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:53,985
Because if Peter was right,
the Windigo seeing us means

497
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:56,488
that we are firmly on the
entr\e section of his menu.

498
00:31:56,488 --> 00:31:58,568
One doesn't win an
argument with you?

499
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:00,592
Don't even bother.

500
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:05,970
Mike  Javier.
Sorry I'm late.

501
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,494
You're here now.
Listen, I need to ask you

502
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,157
something right up front.
Anything.

503
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:13,961
How many people
has Fitzroy killed?

504
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,711
Including this latest girl?

505
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,525
He's lived nearly
500 years.

506
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,326
He feeds every night.
I mean, how many do you think?

507
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,285
You said that
he has a pattern.

508
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:30,253
Most of these creatures
are quite predictable.

509
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,799
Fitzroy prefers women.

510
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,938
He seduces them, brings
them into his world.

511
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:37,916
Once he's gains their trust,
perhaps even their love, he

512
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,040
consummates the relationship
with the only thing that is

513
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,915
real to a monster like him.

514
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,165
Their blood.

515
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:48,407
Does he ever drink from
them before he kills them?

516
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:49,261
Always.

517
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:53,307
But once he tastes a lover's
blood, they will die.

518
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,093
The only question is how soon.

519
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,980
Javier, what...
What do you need from me?

520
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,444
Why me?
I need somebody he trusts.

521
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:06,607
You think Henry trusts me?
Of course.

522
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:09,995
You know what he is,
and you're still alive.

523
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:14,310
Henry Fitzroy wouldn't let me
anywhere near him, but you...

524
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:25,235
Not my style.
The Iluminacion del sol.

525
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:29,177
It drains a vampire's power.
It allows me to deal with him.

526
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,290
Look, Javier...
I've seen what Henry can do.

527
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,443
How's this going to stop him?

528
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:45,880
Believe me, detective,
I've trusted my life to this

529
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,120
many times.
All you must do is to

530
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,848
place it on his chest.

531
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:51,833
And that's it?

532
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:56,191
You have feelings for
this Victoria Nelson.

533
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,510
And you know he's
already tasted her.

534
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,060
If you fail to do what
I ask, she will die.

535
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,451
You must know that.

536
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:20,480
Henry  If I ever had any
doubts about your plan,

537
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,031
seeing that certainly
allays them.

538
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:27,580
Vicki  Bring on the Windigo.
I'd better let you lead.

539
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,231
I don't think I can
trust my back any more.

540
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,306
Henry, don't do this.
I don't judge you.

541
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,064
How generous.
Then what does it matter

542
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:36,362
what I've done?
My life is my business.

543
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:37,920
I drink blood or I die.

544
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,724
You chose to be a vampire.

545
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:43,425
I chose to give my life
to be with the woman I loved.

546
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:47,111
I chose to experience hundreds
of years of human history.

547
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:51,661
And every time I feed,
I am choosing to live.

548
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,980
What is your choice, Vicki?

549
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,228
Javier  It's time Delphine.

550
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:16,599
Delphine  Oh! Oh! Oh! OH!

551
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,035
Thank you.

552
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:24,243
Thank you for
your confession.

553
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:27,148
You made me a promise.

554
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:30,005
You said if I confessed,
you'd set me free.

555
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,705
And I always
fulfill my promises.

556
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:37,183
In a few short hours the
sun will set you free.

557
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:39,377
AH! YOU BASTARD!

558
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:44,443
How many have you killed?
I don't kill.

559
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,383
I give them salvation!
You should be grateful!

560
00:35:48,383 --> 00:35:51,606
AH!
Thank you for giving me

561
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:55,223
the one I've been looking for,
the one who made you.

562
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:04,156
Henry Fitzroy.
I'll save him, too.

563
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:23,324
Why don't you just ask me
what you really want to know?

564
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:26,216
What is it that
I really want to know?

565
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:28,198
About the woman in
the photo, Delphine.

566
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:31,844
I'm not sure
I want to know.

567
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:34,725
She asked me to
turn her and I did.

568
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,980
Oh, okay.
But you have to understand.

569
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:41,450
I have killed people
and I will kill again.

570
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,331
It's part of who
and what I am.

571
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,659
I was raised to be a king.

572
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:48,380
I learned the art of war
when children today are

573
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,181
learning to colour.

574
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,647
I thought I had a
dysfunctional childhood.

575
00:36:54,252 --> 00:36:57,021
I killed for my country
and I killed for honour.

576
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:01,019
And when I met Christina
I became much more

577
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,106
intimate with death.

578
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,623
Couldn't you control
it or something?

579
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,323
When you turn, you don't
see people anymore.

580
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:11,864
You see prey.

581
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:16,431
I spent a long time learning
to control my impulses.

582
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:19,102
I'm not human, Vicki,

583
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:23,700
and every once in a while,

584
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:26,737
somebody's going to die.

585
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,320
Mike  Oh, hey, Coreen.

586
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:48,826
Hey, Mike.

587
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:52,419
She's already left.
Did she go to the ravine?

588
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:57,114
Is Henry with her?
Yeah, vampires...

589
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:59,105
Don't leave home without 'em.
So, you know what he is

590
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:01,217
and you're okay with that?
He's amazing.

591
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:04,160
It's like, if vampires are
out there anything's possible,

592
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,575
you know -
Sasquatches, UFO's, angels.

593
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,290
He hasn't sucked
your blood, too, has he?

594
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,654
I wish.
You guys are all insane.

595
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:15,702
Mike, if you're going
out there, take these.

596
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:19,083
What, bullets?
Silver bullets.

597
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,404
Do I look like the
Lone Ranger to you?

598
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:24,320
For the Windigo.
I've been reading more

599
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,064
about the purification
properties of silver.

600
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:29,673
It's like demon penicillin.
You know what, Coreen...?

601
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,138
This might be the only
thing that could stop it.

602
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:36,044
So, just take them, okay?
Okay.

603
00:38:37,588 --> 00:38:40,925
Oh, hey, how did you know
my gun's caliber?

604
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,939
Glock nine millimeter, nine
by nineteen casing, right?

605
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:46,332
I've seen you use it.
Sweet piece.

606
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,418
Yeah.

607
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,928
You'll going to be able
to smell him right?

608
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,098
Maybe.

609
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,476
Think 'reassuring tone'.

610
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,388
This is your plan.

611
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:10,986
You're the one who was
learning military strategy

612
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:13,209
in his diapers.
You must have some ideas.

613
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:15,627
I'm not the one who
needs to be worried, Vicki.

614
00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:17,334
It's not my blood
he'll be able to spill.

615
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,300
Good work on the
reassuring tone.

616
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,332
It's not here.

617
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,629
It's here.
It's here.

618
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:43,687
Vicki  Not working!

619
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:51,838
Henry  USE THE ELECTRICITY!
LIGHT IT UP!

620
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,089
Vicki  GET OUT OF THE WATER!
Henry  DO IT!

621
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:05,959
You okay?
Fine!

622
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:08,948
Vicki  You gotta be
kidding me!

623
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:15,052
Mike?

624
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:19,946
How did you...?

625
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:22,807
Silver bullets.

626
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:25,572
Coreen said they'd
come in handy.

627
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:28,472
But what are
you doing here?

628
00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:29,622
I have something...

629
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,615
for Henry.
What?

630
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:40,433
OH! AH...!

631
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:42,243
WHAT DID YOU DO?

632
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,991
vier  We meet
again, Henry Fitzroy.

633
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:51,697
NO!

634
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:54,740
Time to pay
for your crimes.

635
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:57,096
What did you do?

636
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:59,083
Henry has killed
too many people.

637
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,871
I can't let him
kill you, Vicki.

638
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:04,216
You let him go.
Javier  The vampire's whore.

639
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:07,184
You think I haven't seen the
devil's own marks on you?

640
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:08,648
Hey, hey, hey!
Mendoza!

641
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:11,307
Sorry, detective.
This wasn't part of

642
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:12,009
our deal.

643
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:15,107
What are you doing to him?

644
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:19,494
If you care about this
creature, then do as I say.

645
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:21,303
Give me your gun.

646
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:23,465
Lock those gates
with your handcuffs.

647
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:26,876
Mike, don't!

648
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:28,553
Now!

649
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,382
You bastard!

650
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:45,986
The key.

651
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:52,808
Thank you.

652
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:11,656
HENRY!

653
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:21,559
Vicki, I didn't know.
Don't say a word!

654
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:24,559
