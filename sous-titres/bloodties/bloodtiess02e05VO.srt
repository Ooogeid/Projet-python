00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:03,859
<i>Previously on "Blood Ties"</i>

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,146
There is another vampire out there.

3
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:08,011
And this one is killing people.

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:09,298
I need your help.

5
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:11,747
- Henry, what's going on?
- It's best if you don't know.

6
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,853
If the other vampire
believes she's with me,

7
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,900
Vicki will most certainly die.

8
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,278
He wants my territory

9
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:19,490
and that puts everyone
who's close to me in danger.

10
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:22,489
Wait a second.
You know who it is, don't you ?

11
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,288
Stay out of my way.

12
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,157
She's too powerful.

13
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:28,985
She?

14
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:30,723
The woman behind the vampire...

15
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:32,093
Christina.

16
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:35,955
So the tall man is still in Boston?

17
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:38,973
Yeah, I know Manhattan's
divided at 51st and the Park.

18
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:40,203
But who's got the Village ?

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,771
Really ?

20
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,668
No, the German's
still in Chicago.

21
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:46,715
Who claimed Detroit ?

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,595
Nobody ever claims Detroit.

23
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,106
Agustus, can we drop the pretense ?

24
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:56,580
You know I'm looking for her.

25
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,252
I need to know
where she's settled.

26
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,998
Nothing more recent than that ?

27
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:05,443
All right, I'll call you later.

28
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,506
Well, it's nice to see you're
returning someone's calls.

29
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:09,623
I'm heading out soon.

30
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,608
Okay, so another vampire
leaves a dead model on your

31
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,438
doorstep and you go
to Mike for help,

32
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:18,068
which is astounding, really.

33
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:19,726
And then you turn around and you say

34
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,933
"Leave it alone. I'll handle it myself."

35
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:25,429
And I'm left wandering the streets,
wondering what the hell is going on.

36
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:26,960
Alone...

37
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,378
at night...

38
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,974
by myself.

39
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,326
Under the circumstances,
probably not a good idea.

40
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:35,461
You know I understand
that you want to protect us,

41
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:39,003
but this not about just any other
vampire invading your territory.

42
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,496
It doesn't matter who it is.

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,182
Now will you go ?

44
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:44,107
Not 'til you stop
stonewalling me.

45
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,124
Because we both know there's only one
person who could do this to you.

46
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,251
Just admit it's Christina,
and we'll move on.

47
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,692
There's no guarantee it's her.

48
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,255
But you suspect it.

49
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:53,765
Henry, people are being murdered

50
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:56,094
so this is no time for
your 'mommy' issues.

51
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:57,380
I don't have issues.

52
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,414
Yeah, and denial's just a river in Egypt.

53
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:03,722
Hey.

54
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:06,445
Yeah.

55
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:08,729
Okay.

56
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:14,789
There's something you need to see.

57
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:22,443
Now it's a spree.

58
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,419
I told you, any more deaths and
it was going to be on you, Henry.

59
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,552
You listen up.

60
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,916
I want you to use your vampire
mojo, your Vamp-dar or

61
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,179
whatever the hell it is you call
it, and you get this Christina

62
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,872
off my streets.
Do you understand me ?

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,681
- You told him.
- He needed to know.

64
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,017
You just made a difficult
situation even worse.

65
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,116
Christina is out of control.

66
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:47,772
On the contrary. This seals it.
Christina didn't do this.

67
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,472
Oh Henry, come off it.

68
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,611
This is a masque,

69
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,526
a garish show.

70
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,832
You don't walk among humans
undetected for 600 years

71
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,861
by putting on lurid displays like this.

72
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:05,285
- Listen...
- Don't !

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,337
Don't ! I don't care.

74
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:10,488
I'm not going to let my streets turn
into a vampire war zone, all right ?

75
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,718
All right.

76
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,053
I'm leaving.

77
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,071
Apparently I'm the only one
interested in catching the real killer.

78
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:22,914
Yeah, give my best to O.J.
while you're at it.

{\a6}"The Devil you know"

84
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,069
First I need some information.

85
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,796
I know exactly what you need, treasure.

86
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:52,249
There's an out of town photographer
working with local talent.

87
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,437
One of the girls wound up dead.

88
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,786
You hear anything about that?

89
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:59,134
I hear the photographer's a dish.

90
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,055
Any idea where she might be found ?

91
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:04,149
I do runway, not print.

92
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,961
Now...

93
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,762
Go now !

94
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,302
Don't come back!

95
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,222
Show yourself.

96
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,339
My love...

97
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:09,439
Time, my love.

98
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,110
You must be sure.

99
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,426
I've never been more sure of anything.

100
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,075
The court...

101
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,371
the privilege, that life...

102
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,398
All of that is lost if we proceed.

103
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:20,863
You must understand that.

104
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:21,933
I do...

105
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,654
and I'm ready.

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,894
No...

107
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,767
You're not.

108
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,711
But we still have a little time yet.

109
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,378
Official police business,

110
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,806
now available with Szechwan.

111
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,892
You just always just seem
to forget that he's not human.

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,714
- That's not true.
- Okay...

113
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,171
This whole vampire attachment thing,

114
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,889
it just doesn't make sense to me.
I don't get it.

115
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,899
They just can't be anywhere
near each other.

116
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,859
If one of them strays into the other
one's territory, it's like...

117
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:22,315
Like mangy, rabid dogs fighting
over scraps. Yeah, that part I get.

118
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,310
If this other vampire
turns out to be Christina...

119
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:26,704
What makes that different ?

120
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,626
Well, Christina and
Henry were lovers.

121
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,396
And she's the vampire that turned him.

122
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,288
She's his ex...

123
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,047
and his vampire 'mommy'. That's sweet.

124
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,963
Okay, listen, Oedipal issues aside,
I don't know what to tell you.

125
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,319
It just... doesn't
really translate.

126
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:43,186
Well, that's the point.
That's my point exactly, okay ?

127
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:45,092
No matter how he feels about Christina,

128
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,406
whether he loves her or hates her or
both, neither. Whatever the hell it is,

129
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,012
that makes Henry unpredictable,

130
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,900
and an unpredictable Henry...

131
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,618
Is a dangerous Henry, I know.

132
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:55,732
Exactly.

133
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,003
You, mm...

134
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,191
said you had some police business ?

135
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,209
All right.

136
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,769
These photos...

137
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:08,290
were taken from the
murder scene earlier tonight.

138
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:13,772
Uniform... found this brooch
outside near one of the bodies.

139
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,340
Here's where it gets interesting.

140
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:16,841
The photographer snapped a few more

141
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,954
and caught Henry in one
of them near the table.

142
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:20,578
Look what happens next.

143
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,587
The brooch is missing.

144
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,142
Yeah, I checked the
chain of evidence myself.

145
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,061
The brooch is found,

146
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,610
it's photographed,

147
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,024
but not catalogued.

148
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:37,121
Henry stole it?

149
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:40,765
He lied to us. Christina is involved.

150
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,196
Not only is Henry unpredictable,

151
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:45,807
he is actively working against us.

152
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:32,664
When I first met
you, you lived in a palace.

153
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,575
And now you own a condo.

154
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,759
It's nice to see you.

155
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,623
This music's beautiful.

156
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:44,972
I'm so glad you have records.

157
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:48,015
This obsession with making
everything digital...

158
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:51,243
It's terrible for those of us
who can hear the gaps,

159
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:52,653
don't you think ?

160
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:54,606
You didn't come here
to listen to records.

161
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,770
And the thread count on these sheets...

162
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:59,914
You always did like
the best of everything.

163
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,383
You should go.

164
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:03,689
But I just got here.

165
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,275
Every time you show up,

166
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:06,900
you cause nothing but trouble.

167
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:09,416
But I really need your help this time.

168
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:11,989
Poor Henry.

169
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,558
You feel it, don't you ?

170
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,442
Nerves on fire...

171
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,912
blood pounding...

172
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:21,853
reason just...

173
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:23,525
a little shaky.

174
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:24,792
You can't help it.

175
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,557
You want to tear me to pieces.

176
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,120
But in a good way.

177
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:30,732
Not at all.

178
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:32,670
Liar.

179
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,012
So...

180
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:42,536
now what ?

181
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:43,583
You tell me.

182
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:44,747
Well...

183
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,522
I can crush your larynx

184
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:47,951
and you can crush mine.

185
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:49,030
Or ?

186
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,242
A truce.

187
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:52,279
Because that's worked
so well in the past ?

188
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,035
Don't be that way, Henry.

189
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:55,599
One.

190
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,618
Two.

191
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,421
Three.

192
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,816
The last time I encroached on your
territory, you almost killed me.

193
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,910
- That was a lifetime ago.
- Or two.

194
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,206
Or three.

195
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,236
You ran me over in a coach.

196
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,500
Only to let you know I was serious.

197
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,481
I was a little territorial, Henry.

198
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:15,983
It's a woman's prerogative.

199
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,217
Yet you waltz in here,

200
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,161
climb into my bed.

201
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,870
I fluffed your pillows.

202
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:24,845
I loved you.

203
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:27,989
Oh...

204
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,529
past tense.

205
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,459
- Don't push it !
- Right.

206
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,134
I admit,

207
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,519
I did stray into your territory

208
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:40,956
but for good reason.

209
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,942
Does that reason have
anything to do with dead models?

210
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,914
So fragile,

211
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,426
and so dumb.

212
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:50,196
So human.

213
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,562
You do know I didn't kill them.

214
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:54,736
So who did ?

215
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,557
His name is Alexander.

216
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,170
He's one of us.

217
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:00,424
You must have felt him lurking.

218
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:02,435
I felt something, but it was muddled.

219
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,541
Three vampires sharing
a single territory will do that.

220
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:09,787
Alexander's followed me across
the continent for over a year now,

221
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,966
Attacking whoever
I come in contact with.

222
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:13,834
He wants to expose me.

223
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:15,684
Ruin the life I've built.

224
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,068
So you led him to me.

225
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,976
He's completely irrational.

226
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,145
I didn't know where else to go.

227
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,746
But if...

228
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,106
you'd rather spend time
with your current plaything...

229
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,744
Yes, I've seen her.

230
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:33,722
I've been watching.

231
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,030
There's a police detective... Celluci.

232
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,750
He's working the model murders.

233
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,450
He's going to want to ask you
a few questions.

234
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,535
And why would I talk to
a human policeman ?

235
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:45,028
Because it'll make my life a lot easier.

236
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:46,760
And while you're in my territory,

237
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:49,080
you will play by my rules.

238
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,865
That's fair.

239
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,310
So if I help you take
care of this Alexander,

240
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,329
you'll leave.

241
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,155
Your city, your life...

242
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:03,301
All will go back to the way it was.

243
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,459
No hug?

244
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:13,064
If you hunt, stay north of St. Clair,
east of Mount Pleasant.

245
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:15,894
I'll let myself out.

246
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,001
And you believe her?

247
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:29,334
Yes, I do.

248
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:32,043
Where is the calm and
rational Henry Fitzroy I know ?

249
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:35,382
I don't have to be calm. I need to find
this Alexander and kill him.

250
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,632
What is this power she has over you ?

251
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,106
The instinct tells you to hunt,

252
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,867
to kill, to remove the threat
from your territory.

253
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,077
But just underneath that
there's a memory of love,

254
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,845
and the ache of that
love's unnatural death.

255
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:50,695
<i>I know Christina in a way that...</i>

256
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:53,446
I don't know if I can explain it.

257
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,995
<i>I think you did
a pretty good job right there.</i>

258
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,641
Henry, I gotta call you back.

259
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,259
Did they not knock in your century ?

260
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,353
I wanted to greet the competition.

261
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:11,372
<i>Sit down.</i>

262
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,653
You have a little thing in your throat ?

263
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:17,198
I'd make you some lemon
tea, but I don't like you.

264
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:19,170
You have a strong will.

265
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,742
That must be what he sees in you.

266
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:23,132
So let me get this straight.

267
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:26,249
You're a vampire
with a vampire stalker ?

268
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:29,490
Now that's a movie-of-the-week
I would watch.

269
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,021
You're funny.

270
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,043
He doesn't usually like funny.

271
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:38,221
He likes pretty.

272
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,756
I'm not afraid of you.

273
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:44,136
Why should you be ?

274
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,093
You think you know him... but you don't.

275
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,015
You think you know what he is...

276
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:50,827
You don't.

277
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:53,400
You think he cares for you.

278
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,203
That is none of your business.

279
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:56,503
He does.

280
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,381
But you can't forget...

281
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,109
you're on the outside.

282
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,016
You think you know him, but I made him.

283
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,016
And your toy ?
I'd keep that down there if I were you.

284
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,283
Gosh, this is swell.

285
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:14,829
Why don't you hang out for a while ?
The sun's coming up. I've a great view.

286
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,966
That would take the
fun out of everything.

287
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,659
- Anything ?
- Ooo.

288
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:48,200
There's a little edge
on top of your usual edge today.

289
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,618
I found Alexander.

290
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,045
Oh, he's a cutie.

291
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,313
Alexander Desmerais.

292
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,038
He is a bit of a hottie,
but it makes total sense.

293
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:57,067
I mean, he's a male model, in Montreal.

294
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:58,442
Have a look.

295
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,066
These were all taken
at night.

296
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,902
And look at his resume.
Check out his references.

297
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:05,318
'Anastasia'...

298
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,797
Christina's fashion photographer alias.

299
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,891
So they work together.
Do you think he's a vampire model ?

300
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,836
That's one way of keeping your looks.

301
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,512
All right, so she's not lying
about Alexander,

302
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,146
but she is lying about something.

303
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,794
Looks like Henry's not the
only one being all territorial.

304
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:20,924
Would you just make some calls,

305
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:24,201
See if his friends or his family knew
why photographer and subject fell out ?

306
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,338
Sure.

307
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:32,267
Mike, it's me, we've got to talk.

308
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,605
Blood's drained,

309
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,511
extensive trauma to the throat.

310
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,398
Poor thing, they made a real
mess of you, didn't they ?

311
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:42,152
Is there any way to tell
if the attacker's male or female ?

312
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,532
Well, with a blade,
they say longer, deeper

313
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,898
strokes favour a male assailant, but..

314
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:48,231
with this ?

315
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,104
There is one interesting
difference, though

316
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,148
I'm not sure it answers your question.

317
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,303
What's that ?

318
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:57,722
Well, you see a real
savagery to the wounds.

319
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,309
Artery is cut in several places.

320
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,046
But look at these marks here.

321
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:04,062
Those are hesitation marks.

322
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,326
Like he was unsure ?

323
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:07,578
I don't know that unsure
is exactly the right word.

324
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:09,484
More like incompetence.

325
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:12,537
From everything you've told me,
that doesn't sound like Christina.

326
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:15,381
It doesn't sound like
a crazed stalker either.

327
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,419
Well, thanks, Doc.

328
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,874
There's one more thing.

329
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,052
There are fewer hesitation marks on
these bodies compared to the first one.

330
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:23,621
He's getting more confident.

331
00:16:23,705 --> 00:16:25,611
Which means he's also
getting more dangerous.

332
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,569
Well, that's wonderful.

333
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,355
That's great news.

334
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,448
You as hungry as I am ?
I got to get something to eat.

335
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,214
- Oh, hey, Dave.
- How's it going ?

336
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,471
Are you kidding ?

337
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:39,488
Models and murder, it's like
chocolate and peanut butter.

338
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,873
Two favourite things all mixed together.

339
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,928
- But it's a tragedy of course.
- Yes, of course it is.

340
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,050
- You dig up anything juicy?
- Surprise, surprise,

341
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,941
models can be unstable. Who knew ?

342
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:52,039
Yeah, who knew?

343
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:55,429
A few drunk and
disorderlies, four drug busts,

344
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:59,316
domestic violence beef,
woman on man, thrown cell phone.

345
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,954
- Naturally.
- Hey, don't laugh. It hurts.

346
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:03,173
Not nearly enough.

347
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,253
Did you come across a guy
named Alexander Desmerais ?

348
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,865
- No.
- He's out of Montreal.

349
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,630
See what you can dig up on him, okay ?

350
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,076
Vicki came across some info that
says he might warrant a deeper look.

351
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,899
Uh...if you could not

352
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:19,532
solve this case before I interview
a few more models, you know...

353
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,626
Yeah, I'll see what I can do, Dave.

354
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,293
I thought you guys were
focused on Christina.

355
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,014
Yeah, she's still a person of interest.

356
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,667
You haven't even interviewed her yet.

357
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:31,147
Well, you know I hear she's kind of
difficult to get hold of during the day.

358
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,780
Vicki, don't look at
me like that, okay ?

359
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:37,435
How many actors, photographers,
high profile people like that get

360
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,021
stalked every day ?

361
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,157
And how many of them are vampires ?

362
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,072
Apparently more than you would think.

363
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,514
So you're siding with Henry on this ?

364
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:48,280
Wow ! What's next ?

365
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,407
A rain of frogs, a cloud of locusts ?

366
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:52,576
Look, I don't like having
one blood sucker in the city.

367
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,986
Do you think I'm thrilled about
having the unholy trinity ?

368
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,451
In any case,

369
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,602
that brooch left out in the open
is an obvious set-up, right ?

370
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,170
Yeah, okay.

371
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,528
This is exactly what Henry
was worried about, okay ?

372
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,922
This guy is using him to get at Christina,
so there could be some serious fallout.

373
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,649
You can't sneak up on me.

374
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,435
I wouldn't even think of it.

375
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:35,763
You miss me ?

376
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,951
How can I miss you when
you won't go away ?

377
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:40,362
I love the theatre.

378
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,484
All those people,

379
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,045
hearts beating together in the dark
waiting for the show.

380
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,857
You make it sound like a buffet.

381
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,566
It's just so...

382
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:51,021
human.

383
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,193
Opera never survived
the switch to electric.

384
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,497
Candlelight provided such...

385
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,366
Mystery, yes.

386
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,458
But if you go now,

387
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,814
you won't start any fires.

388
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:05,199
That was one time.

389
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,321
And you had me so distracted.

390
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,743
Would it kill you to smile ?

391
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,360
Poor distracted Henry.

392
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:18,927
Wanna neck ?

393
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,988
Foreplay was always your forte.

394
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,913
This century is strange.

395
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,707
They're all in such a hurry.

396
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,829
Yet they never seem
to get where they're going.

397
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,674
That's why I like the camera.

398
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,908
You can freeze a moment forever.

399
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,984
Like us.

400
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,481
Don't tell me you still believe
love conquers all.

401
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:54,636
I believe it should,

402
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:56,738
no matter what we are,
what we've done.

403
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,140
I was afraid you wouldn't help me.

404
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,764
- Not after Vienna.
- Don't remind me.

405
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:04,788
You made sure I lost my lease,

406
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,807
had me banned from the oldest
philharmonic in the world.

407
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,074
I had to get you out of town.

408
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,689
Vienna wasn't big enough
for the both of us.

409
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,735
I got chased out of the
city by the Bundesheer.

410
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:14,244
Eighty years ago. Who remembers ?

411
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,089
Why is Alexander after you ?

412
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,951
You know what the young ones are like...

413
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,763
all bravado and impulse.

414
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:23,449
He's looking to make his mark,
take out an old one.

415
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:26,072
- Why you ?
- He doesn't play by code, Henry.

416
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,225
He wants to expose me,
drag me into the light.

417
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,314
You too...

418
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:32,248
and Vicki, if he gets the chance.

419
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:34,914
Oh, Henry...

420
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,336
that's rich !

421
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,707
What ?

422
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,120
You haven't had her !

423
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,374
Why didn't I see that before ?

424
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:45,396
Henry,

425
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:46,767
don't be that way.

426
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,443
Sometimes it's good to wait.

427
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:56,009
Say 'thank you'.

428
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:57,840
- For what ?
- I found one :

429
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:58,955
a relative of Alexander's.

430
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,795
She's been living here for two months.

431
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:03,471
- What did she have to say ?
- Ms. Nelson ?

432
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,050
I'm sorry, she's a hugger.

433
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,197
Vicki, meet Nicole Desmerais,
Alexander's sister.

434
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:09,765
Ms. Nelson, you have to help me.

435
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,477
He goes missing, the police do nothing,

436
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:14,140
and now they're calling and saying
he did these horrible things.

437
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:15,749
Here have a seat, have a seat.

438
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,106
- Can you get her water ?
- Sure.

439
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,942
When was the last time
you had contact with him ?

440
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,622
Six months ago.

441
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,873
Alexander's harmless.

442
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:27,070
He's gentle and considerate.

443
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,488
Our parents are dead.

444
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:32,409
Since I was fifteen, he was
the only one there for me.

445
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,688
You have to help me find him.

446
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:35,807
Of course,

447
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:37,192
we'll see what we can do.

448
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,662
Now I need to know what he was doing,

449
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:41,061
before he disappeared.

450
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,939
He met a woman about...

451
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:44,892
nine months ago.

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,381
Said she was crazy about him. Said she
was going to help him with his career.

453
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:52,897
This is the most recent photo
I have of him.

454
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:55,423
I took it just before he disappeared.

455
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,535
He was so happy and...

456
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:59,126
This was taken six months ago ?

457
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,496
Nice sunset.

458
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:07,881
Yeah, that's what I said.

459
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,860
It doesn't matter.

460
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:11,541
How can you say that ?

461
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:13,870
Christina's already lied to you.

462
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,260
He wasn't a vampire six months ago.

463
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:18,683
He hasn't been stalking her for a year.

464
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:19,856
Why does he hate her ?

465
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,011
It's irrelevant.

466
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:25,136
All right then, why does she need you ?

467
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,431
She's a big girl.

468
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,470
You said she tried to kill you once.

469
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:29,606
More than once.

470
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:33,750
Right... but she can't
handle a little baby vamp ?

471
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:36,463
He's smart.

472
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:39,088
He doesn't go at her directly.

473
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,656
He knows he's no match for her.

474
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,900
He doesn't play by the rules.

475
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:45,102
If he's trying to expose her,

476
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:47,036
he can do that with any one of us.

477
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:48,360
He's a menace.

478
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,167
Shouldn't he be with his 'parent' now ?

479
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:54,757
I mean didn't you say they stick
together for the first year?

480
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,476
For some that comes sooner, some later.

481
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,720
Is it Christina ? Did she turn him ?

482
00:22:58,808 --> 00:22:59,841
No,

483
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:00,977
that's ridiculous.

484
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,085
How do you know that ?

485
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,226
Because you don't turn enemies,

486
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,822
only friends, lovers.

487
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:08,109
If Christina turned Alexander
six months ago,

488
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,658
 he wouldn't be stalking her,

489
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,423
he'd be completely devoted to her.

490
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,254
As devoted as you are ?

491
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:18,190
I don't think that's possible.

492
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:29,868
We heard from Christina.

493
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:32,037
She's got a midnight job
at Massey Arts Centre.

494
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,211
It's a Couture shoot,

495
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:35,515
but she could probably
spare us a few minutes.

496
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:36,914
That's very public.

497
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,059
Yeah, that's what I thought.

498
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:39,665
Is she trying to draw him out ?

499
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,148
It did cross my mind.

500
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:44,352
Mike, are we missing something here ?

501
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:47,150
First he just dumps a body
on Henry's doorstep

502
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,169
and now all of a sudden
he's posing them.

503
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,685
Does that add up ?

504
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:08,849
It's so easy for us
to go from hunter to hunted.

505
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:12,143
That is why you drink,
and resist the kill.

506
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:15,246
Giving in to bloodlust,

507
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,810
it's many a young one's undoing.

508
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:20,203
You drink what you need,

509
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:21,790
not all you can.

510
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>You took sick in the woods, saw a wolf.</i>

511
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,971
<i>Go home and sleep.</i>

512
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,237
People are so fragile.

513
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,514
Easily manipulated and easily broken.

514
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:42,242
Sometimes our power over
them can be so intoxicating.

515
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,806
- But you can't...
- You've said all this before !

516
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,285
Must you treat me like a simpleton ?

517
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,755
I'm of noble blood.

518
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:51,329
Yes...

519
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:53,000
of course.

520
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:58,259
- And soon you will leave me.
- Never.

521
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,392
Yes.

522
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,073
I'll make you.

523
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:19,591
Alexander... !

524
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:22,792
Show yourself !

525
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,798
Show yourself.

526
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

527
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,823
- Thanks for staying late.
- No problem.

528
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,168
I like it here at night.

529
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,145
During the day they don't let
me get a word in edgewise.

530
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,668
Listen, I have another
one of my crazy hunches.

531
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,106
Good, they're my favourite.

532
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:57,171
You know how you said the first body had
more hesitation marks than the others ?

533
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,074
- Yes.
- Is there anything else about it

534
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,036
that was...  different ?

535
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:02,275
Good hunch.

536
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:04,063
Meet Gabrielle,

537
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:05,584
our first victim.

538
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,572
An interesting anomaly...

539
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:13,037
there's two very small
puncture wounds here.

540
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,018
I don't know how I missed
them the first time.

541
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:17,183
Gabrielle has the same pattern
of wounds on her neck,

542
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,812
but on closer inspection,
these are how she died.

543
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,195
The blood was completely
drained, very clean,

544
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,536
very precise.

545
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,306
She didn't bleed out through the neck ?

546
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:26,771
She didn't bleed out at all.

547
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:29,280
She was drained completely,
no fuss, no muss.

548
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:32,180
So the killer was trying to make
it seem messier than it actually was.

549
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,168
As if they didn't know
what they were doing.

550
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:35,706
Yup.

551
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,467
ALEXANDER !

552
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:57,338
It was a mistake to have involved me !

553
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:00,474
<i>Chase me or save her, your choice.</i>

554
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:02,228
You'll have to
face me eventually.

555
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:05,036
<i>You can protect Christina,
or those close to you.</i>

556
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:06,770
<i>You cannot do both.</i>

557
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,779
Just watch me.

558
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:11,794
The photographer your
brother is accused of stalking

559
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,587
is having a photo shoot tonight.

560
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:17,245
The police are fairly certain
he's going to make an appearance.

561
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:18,729
- We have to go.
- No, wait.

562
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,377
I don't care what the cops say.

563
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:22,912
I know what my brother is
capable of, and what he isn't.

564
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:26,412
In six months, everything can change.

565
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:29,643
I think Alexander's gotten
mixed up in something.

566
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:31,580
Drugs ?

567
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:33,144
No.

568
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:35,266
Something worse ?

569
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:38,858
Something different.

570
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:44,466
I think there's more to this
story than anyone is telling us.

571
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,018
No matter what, he's my brother.

572
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,755
I know I can reach him.
I can talk to him. I'm sure of it.

573
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:55,605
Okay.

574
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:58,466
We'll give it a try.

575
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,847
So how long is this
interview going to take ?

576
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:15,725
Oh, this shouldn't take long.

577
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:18,306
Can you tell us what it
was like working with Alex ?

578
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:20,951
He showed up on time.
He had a good look...

579
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:22,942
boyish but dangerous.

580
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:26,238
Urban women are a sucker
for that type.

581
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:28,809
- Don't I know it.
- I see.

582
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,784
And your relationship with him...

583
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,173
before ?

584
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:35,530
He was gentle, sweet.

585
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:37,781
I had high hopes for him.

586
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,791
So when did things change ?

587
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:41,331
I was in New York.

588
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,307
I had a small showing
in a gallery in Chelsea.

589
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,714
Alexander showed up and
broke a plate glass window.

590
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,891
Which gallery was that ?

591
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,750
A collective on West 22nd.

592
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,241
P.S. I Eight You.

593
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:53,697
I'll check into that.

594
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,058
Then he broke into my suite when
I was on assignment in South Beach.

595
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:59,791
He stole some equipment,
some personal belongings.

596
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:01,297
What kind of things did he steal ?

597
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:04,527
A watch, a hairbrush and
my favourite brooch.

598
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,936
So why didn't you file
a restraing order ?

599
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,298
I mean that's usually
the first thing ladies do.

600
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,363
I don't have much faith in the police.

601
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:15,739
And before I came here, he
certainly hadn't killed anyone.

602
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:20,321
I don't know how I'm going to
get models to work for me now.

603
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:23,199
They're afraid of killer carbs
let alone stalkers, so...

604
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:24,974
are we done here ?

605
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:26,643
I won't take much longer.

606
00:29:27,948 --> 00:29:29,610
Just a few more questions.

607
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:32,653
<i>Don't you have enough ?</i>

608
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,353
<i>And you ?</i>

609
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,912
Okay, we're done.

610
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,616
Yes, thank you for your time.

611
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,341
She looked pale, but um...

612
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:52,097
damn !

613
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,801
- Okay, Nicole, I want you to wait here.
- But I want to come inside.

614
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:33,106
Listen... Hey !

615
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:35,055
I let you come with me,

616
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:36,839
but I will not let you get hurt.

617
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:39,415
All right ? I'll find your brother.
You just wait here.

618
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:52,140
<i>You're thirsty.</i>

619
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,502
<i>You need a water,</i>

620
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,985
<i>and a cookie.</i>

621
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:59,319
I need five before finals.

622
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:00,596
Stay close, dear.

623
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:03,230
Everybody, five minutes.

624
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,339
She could use a cookie.

625
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,732
For all their progress, their
notions of beauty are barbaric.

626
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:13,508
I don't like this.

627
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:16,428
It's an expensive century, Henry.

628
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:17,723
A girl's gotta work.

629
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:20,755
Alexander's strong and impulsive.
There's no reason there.

630
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,838
I already told you that.

631
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,749
- Let go.
- I don't like it when you lie.

632
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,251
I don't know what
you're talking about.

633
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:29,325
He's untrained.
He has no idea what he's doing.

634
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,480
Why would he fixate on you ?

635
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:32,831
I already told you. I don't know.

636
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,958
I chose to listen to
the echo of the feeling

637
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:37,714
and the pounding
of the blood in my head.

638
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:39,141
Henry,

639
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,634
let go.

640
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:41,812
He's already been here

641
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:43,427
and he was close.

642
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,328
How could he get so close
without you sensing him ?

643
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:49,838
Because the bond between
you two is still there.

644
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:53,575
Your body doesn't consider him a threat

645
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:56,719
because you're the one
who turned him.

646
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,067
- Henry...
- No.

647
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:01,029
Vicki was right.

648
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,579
You cast him out into the world
without showing him who he was.

649
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:06,813
No wonder he hates you.

650
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,560
It doesn't matter now.
He's seen you with me.

651
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:13,720
If he takes me out, where's
he going to go to next?

652
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,449
To your apartment,

653
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:16,782
to Vicki ?

654
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,845
You have to protect me
because you're next.

655
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,949
We've wasted enough time.

656
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:35,086
Can we get some lights please ?

657
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:37,546
Federica, darling, I need
you back here at once.

658
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:40,463
Come on, guys, let's get some lights.

659
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:43,444
Lights !

660
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:00,937
Oh god!

661
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:06,830
All right, let's get
some lights, please.

662
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:07,919
Come on, guys!

663
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,287
Turn the lights !

664
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:18,836
Turn the lights !

665
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,118
<i>Turn the lights !</i>

666
00:33:42,097 --> 00:33:43,205
Henry !

667
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:44,497
Henry ?!

668
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:53,803
It was Alexander !
He put UV bulbs in the lights.

669
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:55,918
Her hand.
It's burnt pretty bad.

670
00:33:56,027 --> 00:33:57,031
Yeah.

671
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,311
Get somewhere safe.

672
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:04,804
I'm going after Alexander.

673
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:06,006
Fine.

674
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:18,857
Alexander ?

675
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:22,631
Alexander ?

676
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:24,384
No ! Alexander !

677
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,595
Don't look at me !

678
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,604
Alexander, let her go !

679
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,583
It isn't you !

680
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,244
You were never supposed to see !

681
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,207
I can make her forget.

682
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:38,775
She doesn't have to
remember you like this.

683
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:47,389
<i>The last time you saw your brother</i>

684
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,876
<i>he said he would always be with you.</i>

685
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,373
<i>You did not see him tonight.</i>

686
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:54,553
<i>Now go !</i>

687
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,450
You try to run and I'll kill you.

688
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:01,557
Then I'll go after her.

689
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,937
- No !
- Try me.

690
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:05,427
You strayed into my territory.

691
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,446
You threatened me and my associates.

692
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,274
You brought attention
that could expose me.

693
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,889
I should kill you for
any one of those things.

694
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,504
How many have you
killed in your time ?

695
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:13,813
To count would be sentimental.

696
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:15,446
- You're a monster.
- That's true.

697
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,938
But I'm a monster who
can control his needs.

698
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:22,509
I am not ruled by my passion
or my hatred

699
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,908
or my instinct alone.

700
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:26,638
When you surrender,
you surrender your humanity

701
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:28,985
not your conscience.
Only then do you become a thing.

702
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:31,633
You act like you can just
shut it off, but you can't.

703
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:33,388
There's no way to control it.

704
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:34,393
You're wrong.

705
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:36,517
Who are you to judge me ?

706
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:39,102
I'm the monster
that's walking out of here.

707
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,755
Before you look into the abyss,
the abyss looks into you, Alexander.

708
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:45,492
I want to know why.

709
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:47,220
She said she would teach me.

710
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,553
But then, my sister...

711
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,551
I saw her neck.

712
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:56,994
The blood beneath,
I could hear it sing.

713
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,475
How could I want to... ?

714
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,522
My sister !

715
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,442
Once your turn, your connection
to everything is different.

716
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,418
Christina would follow me up and
down the streets of old Montreal.

717
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:09,939
I couldn't get away from her.

718
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:11,872
- Everywhere I went...
- She was there.

719
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,469
She poisoned me !

720
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:16,601
She made me this devil !

721
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:17,793
You didn't ask for it ?

722
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,408
What did she say to you ?

723
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:23,925
She said it would
take away my doubt.

724
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:28,629
But then everything was different.

725
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:32,712
There was no love, no hope.

726
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:36,429
There was only thirst.

727
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,401
Don't tell me...

728
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,016
that you can control it.

729
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:45,858
Don't tell me that, because
I will not be worse than you.

730
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:50,802
Christina lives still ?

731
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,060
She does.

732
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:55,867
It doesn't matter now.

733
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:59,532
I just needed someone
to know what she was.

734
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:01,021
What she did to me.

735
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:04,678
You'll do.

736
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:06,256
If you'll let me,

737
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:08,922
I can teach you to come
to peace with what you are.

738
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,758
I hate what we are !

739
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,130
And that hate is the last
part of me that's left.

740
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:21,915
There's only one thing I want from you.

741
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:27,974
Sed libera nos a malo.

742
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:30,479
Deliver us from evil.

743
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,235
Amen.

744
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:57,601
Amen.

745
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,827
Okay, yeah...

746
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:16,071
You got my bullets.

747
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:20,090
Your sunburn's all better. I get it !

748
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:21,714
Vampires are cool.

749
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:23,474
And I'm still hungry.

750
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:26,794
Too bad. The smorgasbord's closed.

751
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:30,879
Your blood is pumping twice
as fast as it was a second ago.

752
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:32,408
Careful,

753
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,737
you're becoming a tease.

754
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,875
You'd know all about
that, wouldn't you ?

755
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:42,036
You got Henry all hot and bothered
so he'd do your dirty work for you.

756
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:44,442
Why do I get the feeling
you do that a lot ?

757
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:46,896
The model outside Henry's door ?

758
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:49,851
Alexander had nothing to do with it.

759
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,524
That's an interesting theory.

760
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:52,647
It's not a theory.

761
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,023
She was drained like a pro.

762
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,633
You just messed up her
neck to make it look good.

763
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:59,603
And why would I do
a thing like that ?

764
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:01,988
Because it made Henry
easier to manipulate.

765
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:04,605
Alexander wasn't after
Henry or any of us.

766
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,108
He was after you.

767
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:09,239
And you knew Henry would be
terrified of a turf war.

768
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,996
That's the difference
between you and him.

769
00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:17,266
You think people are
just a means to an end.

770
00:39:17,546 --> 00:39:19,255
I see you've got a new toy.

771
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,654
Ooh,

772
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,982
the Iluminacion Del Sol.

773
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:24,856
You gonna use that on me ?

774
00:39:25,015 --> 00:39:27,438
Drain my powers like
that crazy old priest ?

775
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,164
Try me.

776
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:31,521
You think you're fast
enough to use that on me ?

777
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,434
That's just sad.

778
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:37,481
Does Henry know
you have this?

779
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,984
We share everything.

780
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,073
You know what you don't understand ?

781
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:43,143
No, but I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

782
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:46,521
One day you're going
to beg him to turn you,

783
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:48,812
so you can be like him, like me.

784
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,300
It won't matter what happens next.

785
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:52,934
Even if you lose him,

786
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,310
you won't be able to help yourself.

787
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,507
People are all the same.

788
00:39:57,723 --> 00:39:58,878
You're wrong !

789
00:40:02,722 --> 00:40:05,079
You broke the only code that matters.

790
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:08,192
The one that keeps order.

791
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:14,469
I left Alexander on the roof.

792
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:15,964
In an hour,

793
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:18,518
the sun will take his body

794
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,280
like you took his soul.

795
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:25,167
Once again, I've
cleaned up your mess.

796
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:30,806
If I catch you in my territory
again, I will kill you !

797
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,021
You think you're the only
one who felt the loss of us ?

798
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:39,762
To feel that again, I'd give anything.

799
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:41,673
Alexander was...

800
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:44,026
You can be 50 miles
from here by sunrise.

801
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:45,336
Get going.

802
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,853
Is she really worth it, Henry ?

803
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,308
We'll see.

804
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,061
I'm sorry.

805
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,254
It's almost sunrise.

806
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,588
I know.

807
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:10,184
I'm going.

808
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:13,956
The girl doesn't remember very much.

809
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:16,416
I assume that's thanks to you.

810
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,813
Believe me, detective,
it's better that way.

811
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:21,065
I'm not so sure.

812
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,192
These women...

813
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:26,655
their families for
the rest of their lives are

814
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:28,829
going to think that killer is
out there somewhere,

815
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,359
unpunished.

816
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:31,701
He was punished.

817
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:34,790
You killed him ?

818
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:39,696
He got off easy.

819
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:40,973
I won't judge him,

820
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:42,924
and you don't have the right.

821
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:47,199
I reserve my sympathies for the people
left behind, like that girl over there.

822
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,892
To her, her brother will
always be a stalker,

823
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:51,535
a killer.

824
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,549
She'll never know
what happened

825
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:54,808
or why.

826
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:58,263
I don't expect you to
understand about Christina.

827
00:41:58,751 --> 00:41:59,812
What ?

828
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,788
A relationship where
the line is never clear ?

829
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,933
Some days you think you'd do
anything just to get past it ?

830
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,487
And you know you never will.

831
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:08,990
I think you're right, Henry.

832
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,950
How could I possibly be
expected to understand that ?

833
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,812
Understand what ?

834
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:20,293
Mike ?

835
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:21,654
Understand what ?

836
