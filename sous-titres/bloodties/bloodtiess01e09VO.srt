1
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,129
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,226
How far you going?
- I don’t know… 10k.

3
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:14,109
Show off.

4
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,548
So how’s Henry doing?
- Fine.

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,429
That’s good.

6
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:19,936
Yeah, after he snacked on the mad monk
that almost killed him he was like

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,175
a kid again.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,769
You know, 480 years young. Spring lamb.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,281
We’re not passed this yet are we?

10
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:26,920
We’ll be fine…

11
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,558
it’s just Henry almost died that night.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,491
Yeah, well there was a lot of that going on that night.

13
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,292
I know. It just doesn’t make it any easier.

14
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:34,789
Does it hurt?

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,182
- I’m heading back.
- What?

16
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:40,483
I’m just… I’m not feeling it today.

17
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:42,738
Mike, we’ll be fine! It’s just…

18
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,939
- But I want to see you.
- Shhh.

19
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:07,730
Close your eyes.

20
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:17,560
Concentrate on your other senses.

21
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:21,309
Tell me what you feel.

22
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,916
- Your skin, it’s soft like silk.
- Mmm…

23
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:28,959
good.

24
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,000
And…what do you smell?

25
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,724
You smell like the Ocean.

26
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,873
Like you’re forever.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,260
You’re very perceptive Brendan.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,110
What’s wrong with me saying you’re beautiful?

29
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,548
‘Cause you are… ever since I saw you.

30
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:12,816
Remember?

31
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:19,349
And here we are finally…
- So my beauty moves you does it?

32
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:20,851
Yeah…

33
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:27,192
- And… would you do anything for my beauty?
- I’d do anything you want me to.

34
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,118
I swear.

35
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:56,300
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

36
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,498
He’s not the kind of kid who misses a booking.

37
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,476
When he’s not answering his phone, something’s up.

38
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:07,582
He’s early 20’s. I mean, how do you know
he’s not sleeping it off somewhere?

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,691
Brendan’s a responsible kid.
H-he’s very dedicated to his career.

40
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,672
- What about his parents? Have you talked to them?
- His mother’s dead.

41
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:18,683
Uh… father left when Brendan was in pre-school.

42
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:22,329
So you’re all he has in the whole world?

43
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:25,816
And?

44
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,454
And I loaned him six grand just before he disappeared.

45
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:32,865
I was supposed to get it back this week.

46
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:34,129
- What about drugs?
- No.

47
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:37,276
He likes clubbing, late nights,
girls, but he’s very careful.

48
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,989
That detective told me that you’d be able to help.

49
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:41,597
That detective?

50
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,396
Detective Mike Celluci?
He referred Ms. Fulton.

51
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:47,856
Ah… that detective.

52
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,983
- Thank you.
- I’ll call you.

53
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,517
You realize that Mike giving you this case
is like other guys giving you flowers.

54
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,481
Yeah, never really been much for flowers.

55
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,478
He can’t do right by you can he?

56
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,054
What?

57
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,126
I know he made a mistake

58
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:09,103
and it nearly killed Henry, and you.

59
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:13,593
But I thought the whole finding Henry,
feeding Henry thing, sort of redeemed him.

60
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,454
When did you become my mother?

61
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:17,002
Cut him a break.

62
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:18,861
I did.

63
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:20,804
Sort of.

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,395
What was the offer?

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,352
Qualified mistrust.

66
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,910
Yeah. Exactly.

67
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,649
So let me get this straight.
You do this every year?

68
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,982
Every year.

69
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:46,349
So this is her, huh?
This is Christina.

70
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,058
This year’s version.

71
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,210
What do you think about when you paint her?

72
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:56,024
Everything she gave me.
Eternal youth, strength, power.

73
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,546
And everything she took away,
everything I let her take away.

74
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,875
Come on, you were seventeen years old.

75
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,635
She knew what she was doing. You didn’t.

76
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:06,636
Maybe.

77
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,603
But she was beautiful and I loved her.

78
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:14,118
Well then she was lucky.
- Are you feeling lucky?

79
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,357
Are you gonna go to the
nightclub with me or what?

80
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,238
Last time we played sleuth I didn’t feel so good.

81
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,451
Yeah but there’s a missing kid
that could sure use our help.

82
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:30,267
And the last place he was seen happened
to be a nightclub full of hotties.

83
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:34,781
Well when you put it that way. Let me get my coat.

84
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,799
What happened to the other 480 paintings?

85
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,808
They never card me anymore
it's tragic

86
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:58,190
What's tragic is you
still care about that

87
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,185
Wow! Abouncer and a philosopher

88
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,128
- I'll card you
- I'm an old soul.

89
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,606
That count, buddy
but not for more

90
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:12,609
If they only knew

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,403
Excuse me.

92
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,334
- Model?
- You know him.

93
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,713
Educated guess.
It’s model central here

94
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:44,142
Yeah, I know. They calculated my body
mass index before they let me in. So?

95
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:48,334
- So
- Brian? Brendan? Something like that, right?

96
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,318
- Yeah
- Crushing on the boss lady.

97
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,426
Hanging around here
whenever she was in the club.

98
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:55,408
- Did she return his attentions?
- She gets lots of attention.

99
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,375
I don’t know what she
return to who.

100
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,298
- All right. Where can I find her?
- Private booth. Look for the chain curtain.

101
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,555
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.

102
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:12,869
Oh yeah, sure, Brendan.
Yeah, he brought his own backlight

103
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:16,343
- Sounds obnoxious.
- Actually, it was a nice night in.

104
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:19,300
But I could have done without
that broadcast on Fox City.

105
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,767
What’s Fox City?

106
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,060
Oh, well that’s gonna cost you

107
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,334
I happen to carry that legal tender.

108
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,630
- You busy?
- Not anymore.

109
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:34,760
- Whatever happened to beauty before age?
- Age stomped beauty’s ass.

110
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,013
Hi, sorry to interrupt.
Uh, my name’s Vicki Nelson

111
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,610
I’m a private investigator.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

112
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,682
- Please.
- It must be hard to get any work done around here

113
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,760
I’ve learned to tune out
the distractions.

114
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,178
He’s quite beautiful.

115
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,256
Yeah, no shortage of that here.

116
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,181
We cater to the young here
and youth is beauty.

117
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:10,790
It is one kind.

118
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,997
His name’s Brendan Ledford.
He was here… Tuesday night?

119
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,338
and he didn’t show up
for a booking the next day.

120
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,422
Maybe he met someone?

121
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,566
- He doesn’t miss bookings.
- Things happen

122
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:20,934
So you haven’t seen him?

123
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:24,950
I meet a lot of people. Most of them start
looking the same after a while.

124
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,603
- Do you have any problem with drugs here?
- I run a clean club.

125
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,942
Well, like you said, things happen.
You mix hormones, booze and...

126
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,868
Boys will be boys

127
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,615
Yes, they will.

128
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,813
Did Brendan ever act up
with anyone here? You?

129
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,731
As I said, I don’t remember him.

130
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:45,727
How about someone acting up with him?

131
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,827
Lots of people who’d want something
from a beautiful young man.

132
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:51,715
- You mean sexual predators?
- Yes

133
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,435
If you could tell me how to spot them
I’d stop them but uh,

134
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,811
they hide in plain sight now, don’t they?

135
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,511
My club is safe, Ms. Nelson

136
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,883
Ask around, no one’s ever
come to any harm here.

137
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,419
- Anything else?
- I think we’re done here.

138
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:13,877
Thank you.

139
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:22,498
She’s hiding something.

140
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,389
Too bad it’s not that tattoo.

141
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,931
- When did you become a prude?
- Five minutes ago.

142
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,220
Funny, that’s when the case
became interesting for me.

143
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,457
All right, so how do you know
she’s hiding something?

144
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,257
Her heart started beating faster
when she said she’d never met him.

145
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,087
Oh, you’re the best lie detector
a girl could have.

146
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,181
What about you?

147
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:41,197
Well, she got a little edgy
when you said ‘boys will be boys'

148
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,545
and she used the term
‘sexual predator’, not me.

149
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,927
- So?
- So, it shows where her mind’s at.

150
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,784
It’s interesting.

151
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:50,522
Where was your mind at
with that girl?

152
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,322
On the job of course.

153
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,788
- Mmm, find anything interesting?
- Possibly.

154
00:09:55,257 --> 00:09:57,623
- Fox City.
- Fox City. Hm

155
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:06,140
It’s frat boys and wannabes posting
pictures of their conquests.

156
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,412
- Space Invaders?
- It's my favourite video game

157
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:13,076
Ah. And what? Brendan
posted to this site?

158
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:16,921
He’s MC. Model Citizen.
We can search by poster

159
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,931
Dear Lord. Do the girls know about this?

160
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,152
Check out the comments.

161
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,823
The ever popular ‘I’m so hot’.

162
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:31,668
Here’s ‘I’d do me’. And my favorite,

163
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,858
‘I need this shot for my
college application’.

164
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,903
Whatever happened to the winsome
awkwardness of teenagers?

165
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:40,475
You know, they’re endearing shyness?

166
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,070
- Different website.
- Sure

167
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,706
Go… go… Oh, stop!

168
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,426
Bitchin' ink

169
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:53,596
You got that right.

170
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:05,438
Hi.

171
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,966
- Hi.
- Detective Mike Celluci.

172
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:12,864
I’m, uh, looking for a kid who may have
gone missing? A Brendan Ledford.

173
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:14,555
Your manager around?

174
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,030
Do you think the manager actually knows
something about what goes on around here?

175
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,226
Yeah, sounds like my chief.

176
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,496
Listen, um… you ever seen
this kid around?

177
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,029
Apparently he hung out here.

178
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,854
Well, he must be popular. A couple of
people were here last night asking about him.

179
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,436
- A woman with glasses?
- Yeah, and a young guy.

180
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:37,169
That’s, uh, Vicki Nelson.
She’s a private eye. But, uh, this

181
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:40,222
became a police matter a couple of hours ago.

182
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:41,801
You ever seen him around?

183
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:46,613
I’m afraid I’m the owner so I guess
that makes me kinda useless

184
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,950
Ah. Well, I somehow doubt that.

185
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,848
Well, I wish I could help you
but he’s not familiar.

186
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:58,417
Yeah.

187
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,390
Well… I guess a lot of people
pass through here, huh?

188
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,518
Yeah, even those you wish would stay longer.

189
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,902
So the picture of the tattoo
proves she knows him.

190
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,324
Thereby proving she’s a liar.

191
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,422
Can’t hide that note of glee, can you?

192
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,626
Don’t deny me my small pleasures Henry.

193
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:29,011
So if we’re going to lean on her to try
to get some more information, I call Brisco.

194
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:33,335
Actually, we’re counting on her not
being home. And we’re PI’s, not cops.

195
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,971
- Columbo, then?
- Also a cop.

196
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,043
- Cannon?
- You want to be Cannon?

197
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,418
Fat? Balding?

198
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:39,683
Good point.

199
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,524
Well it appears that no one’s home.
You wanna check?

200
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,081
We good to go?

201
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,882
- It’s Friday night, she should be at her club.
- If it is her, something’s wrong.

202
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:53,402
Her heartbeat’s too slow.

203
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:56,827
Well then, we proceed with plan A.

204
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:06,009
Vicki.

205
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:11,333
Show off.

206
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,202
- There.
- What?

207
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,951
- It's a statue.
- Vick

208
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,155
it's still alive

209
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,580
Let's go

210
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,719
Wait

211
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:41,715
Is it true that policemen
can’t drink on duty?

212
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,312
It is true they’re not supposed to, yeah.

213
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:47,328
- What kind of policeman are you?
- The off duty kind.

214
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,837
Mmm, that seems promising.

215
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,219
So, are we gonna stand out
here all night or are we…

216
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,473
- Is someone here?
- No, there shouldn’t be.

217
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,467
- Don’t.
- Wait here.

218
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,295
- Can you even see?
- Not much.

219
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:16,066
Look, get… get in the car.
We’ll argue about who’s driving later!

220
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:20,037
- I think it was just a noise.
- Well, let’s be sure.

221
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,016
Floor it!

222
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,061
This is the actual Brendan Ledford?

223
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:51,639
- In the actual non-flesh?
- It is

224
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,003
So, what did she do to him?
Is she a witch or something?

225
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,767
It might be a spell

226
00:14:56,768 --> 00:15:00,325
but in the turns-to-stone department
I’m thinking a basilisk or a gorgon?

227
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,688
- Great, one’s an herb, the other’s a cheese.
- Basilisk.

228
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,434
half-chicken, half-lizard.

229
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,834
One look and you’re stoned.

230
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,994
The gorgons were sisters, Greek myth.

231
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:13,834
- Also practiced turning people to stone.
- Oh wait, was one of them named Medusa?

232
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,124
- You’ve been reading.
- I read.

233
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:18,044
Firearms manuals.

234
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:23,343
If it is a gorgon we’re looking for,
all Elena has in her arsenal is being greek

235
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:27,314
- No snakes, no ugly.
- And not a lot of basilisk sightings in town

236
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,819
Ever, actually

237
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:32,546
Nevertheless, I’ll keep my eyes open
for a chicken-lizard.

238
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:36,212
- Why would you do that?
- Because we were face to face with the woman

239
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:38,066
and weren’t turned to stone.

240
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,138
Oh… you’re trying to make me
keep an open mind, aren’t you?

241
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:47,654
I know better than to do that.
Speaking of which, Mike was at the house.

242
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,462
What?

243
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:53,523
Michael Celluci, of your acquaintance,
was at the home of Elena Kanapolous,

244
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:57,843
suspected gorgon. As we were leaving,

245
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,959
I… saw… him.

246
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:07,399
Huh, It’s been 48 hours since the
missing person’s case was filed.

247
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:12,249
Homicide handles missing persons so
Mike just caught the case, that’s all.

248
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:15,914
- Shouldn’t he have been at the nightclub?
- Regardless, it’s not a conflict.

249
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:19,705
We share cases with Mike always.

250
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:24,694
Shouldn’t you be trying to, you know; figure out
a way to break this spell or whatever it is?

251
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:28,163
I mean, there is still a 22 year old boy alive in here

252
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,981
We, apparently, are
the only people who can help him.

253
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:39,198
Brendan posts phone pictures
of his conquests to a website, Fox City?

254
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,467
- Elena’s on it.
- Sure it’s him posting her?

255
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,846
She has a very distinctive tattoo.

256
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,407
Any pictures of her face?

257
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,013
Mike, it’s her. She lied about
knowing Brendan

258
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:50,407
We both know that lies
never stand alone.

259
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,701
Yeah, so you got a phone camera
picture of a tattoo.

260
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,380
- You think that’s gonna hold up in court?
- Are you defending her?

261
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,898
No, I’m just asking police 101 type
questions here

262
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:01,118
all right? You’ve got a phone camera picture
of a tattoo, point one. Am I right?

263
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:03,344
Look, we could confirm it was Brendan’s.

264
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,570
All right, you got any witnesses that
saw them together? Huh?

265
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:08,689
A-any priors? Hey, how about motive?

266
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,244
Is she upset that he, uh, didn’t tip
a waitress or something?

267
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,400
Did you even run her?

268
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:17,002
I ran her, her address and her company.
No priors, no complaints, no nothing.

269
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:20,107
- But it doesn’t mean there’s nothing to find.
- Yeah, it doesn’t sound like you found it either

270
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,352
Mike, she knows him. She saw him
the night he disappeared and...

271
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,167
she’s got a really weird attitude
about sexual assault.

272
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,349
- Weird.
- Yeah, she thinks it only happens to women.

273
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:31,520
Vicki, a lot of people think that.
It doesn’t make her guilty.

274
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,746
You’ve decided she’s innocent?

275
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:36,386
No, I’m just following the facts.
What are you doing?

276
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,926
I mean, why haven’t you informed
your client that this is a police matter now?

277
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:40,671
I sent her my bill.

278
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,612
- So why are you following it?
- This kid needs my help.

279
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:47,234
- Oh, right, because the police aren’t help enough huh?
- No, not when they don’t listen.

280
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,608
No, you know what?

281
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:53,801
How I operate as a cop and how I operate in my
personal life, you don’t get a say in that any more.

282
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:55,958
Okay?

283
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:57,729
Seriously, Vicki,

284
00:17:58,337 --> 00:17:59,845
why don’t we just end this now?

285
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,477
Okay? No harm, no foul.

286
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,637
Just come back to my office. There’s
something I need to show

287
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,099
It’s evidence

288
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,197
No, I can’t. Elena had a break-in last night.
I gotta do paperwork later.

289
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,695
Homicide cop doing a robbery?

290
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,644
- Anything missing?
- No

291
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:18,133
Nothing

292
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:20,265
Why?

293
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,645
Nothing

294
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:24,958
Yeah

295
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,338
If you say so

296
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,846
- Your boss here?
- No

297
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:47,137
I thought we had a connection you and I?

298
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:51,070
Okay, Aristotle,

299
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:53,513
you can just give her a message then.

300
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:55,761
Ask her…

301
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,055
Does her house feel empty?

302
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,370
<i>Was issuing a challenge wise?</i>

303
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,290
<i>Now she knows we’re on to her.</i>

304
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,166
<i>It makes most criminals nervous.</i>

305
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,546
<i>She didn’t seem
like the nervous type.</i>

306
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,427
Yeah...

307
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,939
Someone’s here.

308
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,619
<i>Vicki, wait. I’m nearly there…</i>

309
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:39,363
I was cleaning up and I
thought, um, well maybe I could

310
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:42,309
put these pieces back together.

311
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,326
I could do that, couldn’t I?

312
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,991
This is going to be a fun call to make.

313
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,758
Hey I found your client.

314
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,596
He’s in a million pieces in a box in my office.

315
00:20:57,978 --> 00:21:01,639
- Vicki…
- I’ll just tell her Brendan left town.

316
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,605
End of story.

317
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,620
She just wanted her money anyway.

318
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:11,308
Maybe you should figure this out tomorrow.
Right now, you could use some sleep.

319
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,449
Yeah, sleep.

320
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:18,049
That’s a sweet solution.

321
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,696
I could sleep half my life away.

322
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:25,969
I’m sorry.

323
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:31,294
Yeah, what is it about being young anyways?

324
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:35,548
Why are we always insanely attracted

325
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:36,879
to the bad boy, hm?

326
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:37,839
The bad girl.

327
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,414
I’m sure Brendan thought there was something more.

328
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:43,905
- Yeah, her looks.
- Beauty isn’t everything.

329
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:45,556
It’s a lot.

330
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:51,403
But when it goes, and it does, you
have to have a deeper connection.

331
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,396
Do you think Brendan had that with Elena?

332
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:00,308
Sometimes it only goes one way.

333
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:03,865
But you never find out until it’s too late.

334
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,025
Your story with Christina?

335
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,714
Yes.

336
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:18,318
Mike’s ‘looking into’ the break-in at Elena’s.

337
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,612
He doesn’t do that for a living.

338
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,274
- Do you think he’s interested?
- You saw her.

339
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,549
Mike is not that person, Vick.

340
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,043
None of us are that person anymore.

341
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,664
Not since we started looking into your world.

342
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,525
Well, thanks again for your help, though.

343
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,192
Helpful?

344
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:53,757
A couple of people think they saw him on Tuesday night,

345
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:55,464
but no one’s really sure.

346
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:56,632
- I’m sorry.
- Apparently,

347
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,461
though, Brendan was crushing on you.

348
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:00,704
You’re kidding.

349
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:06,270
The waitress there says that, uh, you get a little
too much of that kind of action to take notice.

350
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,827
Well I wish I’d noticed. I could have been more helpful.

351
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,244
What are you going to do now?
- I’ll conduct some more interviews,

352
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,510
do some credit checks and um…

353
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,107
...stuff.
- Stuff you can’t talk about?

354
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:21,569
Not with a civilian, no.

355
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,262
- And I’m a civilian?
- Would you rather be a suspect.

356
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,903
Depends. Are you going to interrogate me?

357
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,336
I might just have to do that.
- Well, then,

358
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:34,356
be suspicious. Uh…

359
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:38,177
Detective Celluci, have you had
a chance to speak to Dimitri?

360
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,514
Yeah, yeah we spoke earlier.

361
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,545
About that boy. Right.

362
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:45,675
I mostly remember the ones who cause trouble.

363
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:48,017
Apparently he had a crush on me.

364
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,752
Go figure.

365
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:53,113
I’m gonna set up out front.

366
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:56,489
- Hey, let me help you with that.
- I don’t need your help.

367
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,489
- I thought we were going out?
- This will just take a minute.

368
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:10,449
I admire her. We’ve worked together for a while now.

369
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:14,923
Must hurt to see all those guys chasing after her, huh?

370
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,614
If she doesn’t get hurt, it’s none of my business.

371
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,493
Oh, so if she does, it is?

372
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,125
That’s not what I mean.

373
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:28,978
A lot of good looking guys, too. That’s
pretty tough competition for you.

374
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:31,300
Looks aren’t everything.

375
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,406
Yeah, you say that, but Elena’s a very beautiful woman.

376
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,606
Why don’t you ask me questions about the kid?

377
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:40,590
Aren’t you supposed to be looking for him?

378
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:43,098
That’s what I’m doing.

379
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,742
I don’t know anything. I haven’t seen him.

380
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:51,229
And Elena can take care of herself.

381
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,794
Were there statues at the nightclub?

382
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:06,344
Not that I noticed.

383
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:07,735
Did you hear anything?

384
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:09,672
A lot of bodies, a lot of heartbeats.

385
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,085
There was that one section we didn’t get into.

386
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:13,459
The VIP section.

387
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:16,216
I have a bad feeling Brendan’s not the only one.

388
00:25:16,322 --> 00:25:18,154
We can go back and check it out if you like.

389
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,612
If there are, I want you to take pictures of them.

390
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:26,232
Okay? See if we can ID them.

391
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:29,267
- You’re not coming?
- I don’t think I’m welcome there.

392
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:32,936
Why don’t you take Coreen? Besides, there’s something I have to do.

393
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:35,661
I.D.

394
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:38,526
A compliment, thank you.

395
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,619
I.D. please, Miss.

396
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:46,948
If you wanted my name and number,
why didn’t you just ask, you big lug? Huh?

397
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,970
Strike three and you’re out. I.D.

398
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,138
Thanks.

399
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:46,873
I wish… we’d met a different way.

400
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:49,591
- Yeah? Why is that?
- Because you’re so honorable.

401
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:55,233
You’re investigating this missing kid and
maybe I’m part of the picture so you can’t…

402
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:57,616
I can’t what?

403
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:00,757
Have a glass of wine? Too late.

404
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,743
No, that’s not what I’m thinking.

405
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,054
You’re not attracted to me?

406
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:23,487
No, of course I am Elena. It’s just that, uh,

407
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,497
I’m a little out of practice with um… the whole dating thing.

408
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:30,444
Well then, let’s practice.

409
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:50,422
Is it that woman with the glasses? The private detective?

410
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:52,841
Vicki? No.

411
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:57,033
Because when I said she’d been to the club you… reacted strangely.

412
00:28:58,442 --> 00:29:01,060
She used to be a cop and uh…

413
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,610
we used to be partners. But,
uh… nothing more than that.

414
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,141
You don’t seem sure.

415
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:10,430
No, I’m sure.

416
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:18,049
Listen, maybe we should, uh, call it a night, huh?

417
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:29,687
- You don’t… find me beautiful?
- Elena I like you a lot. But, uh…

418
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:34,518
a woman, who’s not happy with the way she
looks, there’s no changing her mind so uh…

419
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:38,352
if you need me to tell you what should be obvious…

420
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,152
Oh, no, no, no. No I don’t.

421
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,452
It’s uh…

422
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:46,636
I’d like to see you again.

423
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:50,475
You will.

424
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,837
Okay. Good night.

425
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:02,610
Where did you get this software?

426
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,792
It would be better if you pretended it wasn’t here.

427
00:30:04,814 --> 00:30:06,625
Does that say FBI?

428
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,047
We have a match!

429
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:10,356
Ryan Henderson.

430
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,258
How did she get her hooks in you?

431
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:15,431
I can’t find any way to turn the statues back.

432
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:17,002
It’s nowhere in the mythology.

433
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,860
Don’t all spells end when the witch dies?

434
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,674
Spells and witches, Vicki, different strokes.

435
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,510
But I did research the Medusa myth a little deeper.

436
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:27,736
It’s actually a really horrible story.

437
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:29,743
- Obviously.
- No, for her.

438
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:33,321
Medusa is this beautiful young woman whom Poseidon covets.

439
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,946
He follows her to the temple of Athena one day and rapes her.

440
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:38,498
Very standard operating procedures in the day.

441
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:42,142
Then Athena gets mad about the desecration of her temple,

442
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,298
blames Medusa,

443
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:45,589
turns her into this hideous creature.

444
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,967
The snakes, the stone gaze, all of it.

445
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:50,738
She gets punished for being raped.

446
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:52,549
So her nightclub is the temple?

447
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:55,996
And anyone attracted to her beauty is punished.

448
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,156
Considering what happened to her the first time…

449
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,505
When I was a cop I met people who’d been through horrific abuse and violence and…

450
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:06,724
then there would be ones who would turn it around

451
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:08,469
and would use it against other people

452
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:10,818
and cry victim at the same time.

453
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,332
You know, it’s a choice

454
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,837
and it’s a bad one.

455
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:20,273
She doesn’t get to work out her issues by turning kids to stone.

456
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:22,695
Are you gonna tell Mike about this?

457
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:25,074
Mike doesn’t want to know.

458
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:28,477
Maybe you should. If he’s
getting busy with the bad lady…

459
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,205
Hey Coreen, its Mike. Is Vicki there?

460
00:32:09,322 --> 00:32:11,242
All right. Uh,

461
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,489
hey. You got a minute?

462
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:16,752
So you’re telling me that Elena is…

463
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:20,483
Turning guys to stone as she re-lives her sexual trauma and seeks revenge?

464
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,665
Yep, and there’s more.
- Oh wait, wa…

465
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:24,651
I’m still processing the first part.

466
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:27,198
A couple of our statue dudes used to post on Fox City.

467
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:30,209
Their last postings are within a week of their disappearances.

468
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,728
Hey! It’s Ryan Henderson. Remember him?

469
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:46,675
- Excuse me.
- how about him?

470
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:49,820
Hmm? Or him?

471
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,036
- Now I know why Mike thinks you’re crazy.
- Okay, let’s see…

472
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,590
Brendan Ledford.

473
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:57,147
Come on. You must remember him.

474
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,413
He was alive a couple days ago and now he’s dead.

475
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:00,929
Yeah, it’s very sad,

476
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:03,417
struck down in his youth and beauty and all that.
- Yep.

477
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,798
Like all of them.

478
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:06,572
Like you.

479
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:09,604
I know you had a rough go of it back then.

480
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,975
Doesn’t excuse you now…

481
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,278
Medusa.

482
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,510
You think you know something about me?

483
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:17,327
Oh yeah, Mike? He doesn’t think

484
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:19,335
I’m crazy, he knows I am.

485
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,912
That’s what bothers you, isn’t it?

486
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:23,300
You pretend it’s about all these young men, but, uh,

487
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:26,029
if he wasn’t sniffing around, would you be?

488
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,825
Well here’s what you don’t understand about anyone who’s worked homicide.

489
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,654
We can’t stop speaking for the dead.

490
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:45,278
The mythical Medusa was slain.

491
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,741
She died centuries ago.

492
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:53,059
Yes, and when Perseus killed her, some of her
spilled blood had the power to raise the dead,

493
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,150
so why can’t she be self-resurrecting?

494
00:33:55,226 --> 00:33:56,285
You have been reading.

495
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:58,895
Yes, I’ve been reading, and I’m wondering, why are you stalling?

496
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:02,863
Motivation counts Ms. Nelson.
Do you know why you’re doing this?

497
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:07,611
That 22 year old kid

498
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:10,753
did not deserve to be killed
because he fell in love with a pretty face.

499
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,192
You should understand that.

500
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,479
And Mike.

501
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,230
Mike might be in danger.

502
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:17,728
And I’m not okay with that.
- If I do this,

503
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:20,112
I’m doing this for you.

504
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:24,925
There’s one more thing.

505
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,286
I could hold that.

506
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:41,160
And let you do my dirty work?

507
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:43,137
That would be the easy way out wouldn’t it?

508
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:46,464
I’m doing this.
- It’s not like killing a Wendigo or

509
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,932
a Demon; she’s human in many respects.

510
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:50,711
Just what she’s showing us.

511
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,266
She’s not going to be easy to kill.

512
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:52,999
I know.

513
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,864
Then maybe this isn’t your job.
Have you ever killed a human being?

514
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:00,228
My third year on the force.

515
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:04,209
This kid has got a bead on my partner; he’s ready to pull the trigger.

516
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,545
And I tap him.

517
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:08,884
He died almost instantly.

518
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:12,830
And there’s pretty much not a day that
goes by that I don’t think about that.

519
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:14,234
I don’t have that problem.

520
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:16,118
I don’t believe you.

521
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:19,402
Sometimes I think you forget what I am.

522
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:22,347
Sometimes I try to forget.

523
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,280
I’m not going to be haunted by this.

524
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,462
This is mine.

525
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:35,491
Because I think you forget who you could be.

526
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,227
I’m worried about that woman.

527
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:47,080
And the cop.

528
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:50,495
Break the statues Dimitri, every last one of them and get rid of them.

529
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,986
What’s wrong with the statues?

530
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:53,367
They’re bloodstains…

531
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:56,136
and I’m the knife.
- No, that’s not true.

532
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:57,389
You think you know me

533
00:35:57,424 --> 00:36:00,018
because you’ve seen me change?
- I do know you.

534
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:02,850
And I’m not afraid.

535
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,894
Every one of those statues is a person, Dimitri.

536
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,661
A shallow, beautiful person that tried to hurt me.

537
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:13,377
And they’re still alive in there. You think you know me now?

538
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:16,094
Hey.

539
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,881
It’s quiet here tonight.
- That’s ‘cause we’re closed.

540
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,063
It’s nice to see you.

541
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:23,648
You too.

542
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,986
Listen, do you think there’s a chance we could, uh, find a place to talk?

543
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,747
Dimitri I’m starving. Can ya

544
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:33,401
go down the street and get me somethin’?

545
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:40,811
You know, I was uh,

546
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:44,940
wondering about something and I hope you don’t take offense.

547
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,471
Last night,

548
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:52,760
there was...something in the way...things were between us…

549
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,627
the way you talked about your looks.

550
00:36:58,076 --> 00:37:03,480
Look, I really hope that I’m-I’m not out of line here but it-it made me think

551
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,482
that maybe something happened to you in your past.

552
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:08,905
That maybe somebody had hurt you.

553
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:13,220
Because if that was the case,

554
00:37:14,283 --> 00:37:17,436
you know I think I could help you. I want to.

555
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:38,718
He said he loved me but he didn’t even know me and then when I tried to leave,

556
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:49,087
he… he grabbed me and he-he raped me.

557
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,838
- I’m sorry.
- And… and-and… and then he went and he told everyone,

558
00:37:57,557 --> 00:38:03,597
and-and they said that I deserved it because I was vain

559
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:11,203
and it was my fault.
- So you were innocent and they blamed you.

560
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:15,331
Yeah, like-like I wanted to be violated.

561
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:20,488
They destroyed me, they-they made me hideous.
- No,

562
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:22,420
You’re not.

563
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:29,836
I am. I’ve done things. You don’t know.

564
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:40,016
You can’t let these people just walk around like they own everything that they see.

565
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,181
So you take care of them.

566
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:44,345
This guy who raped you,

567
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:48,413
these people who blamed you, they still around?

568
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:50,790
Yeah, they’re always around.

569
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,816
Have you found a way to take care of them?

570
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,826
Because if you didn’t I can help with that.

571
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:55,827
No I found a way.

572
00:38:58,231 --> 00:38:59,231
Good…

573
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:02,235
good for you.

574
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:07,728
What are you looking at? Hm?

575
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:10,147
Elena I’m here for you.

576
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:14,879
You think you know. You think you understand?

577
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,280
You’re all the same!

578
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,281
Take it easy.

579
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:57,779
You had to do it.

580
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,985
Doesn’t make it any easier.

581
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:02,871
You guys okay?

582
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:04,873
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

583
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:11,557
- Hey.
- Hey.

584
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,486
I got your message.

585
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:18,571
Am I intruding?

586
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:19,572
No.

587
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:27,737
I like it out here. It’s so quiet.

588
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:29,202
Yeah.

589
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,416
Yeah, it is.

590
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,023
You know it was his manager that hired me?

591
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:42,293
She loaned him six grand and she just wanted to get it back.

592
00:41:43,741 --> 00:41:45,034
Well, I found it.

593
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,035
Oh yeah?

594
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,491
Brendan bought two tickets to Greece, one for him and one for Elena.

595
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,955
He really thought they had something.

596
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:02,398
Yeah. I guess people fall in love with the wrong person all the time, don’t they?

597
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:05,971
Yes, they do.

598
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:06,972
