1
00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:02,736
I work for the Church.

2
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:05,419
I deal with anomalies.

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:07,494
You think that's what
Fitzroy is, an anomaly?

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,554
I think he's
an abomination.

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,501
This isn't Henry.
He doesn't do this.

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,810
Fang Boy doesn't eat?
Henry is not a killer.

7
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:19,296
No? And how do you know so
much about his drinking habits?

8
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:22,288
Henry Fitzroy wouldn't
let me anywhere near him,

9
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:26,417
but you, you know what he is,
but you're still alive.

10
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:30,511
The Iluminacion del Sol,
it drains a vampire's power.

11
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:33,612
All you must do is to
place it on his chest.

12
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,111
ARGHHH...!

13
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:37,481
What did you do?

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,689
I'm sorry, detective.

15
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:53,634
Damn it!

16
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,716
You stupid son of a bitch!

17
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:07,238
- You through?
- Who was that guy, and what does he want with Henry?

18
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,886
He said that he could help
Henry to 'cure his urges'.

19
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,593
- Oh, and you bought it?
- Yes, I bought it!

20
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,971
Just like I bought every
piece of your psycho

21
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:24,449
brutal nonsense, ever since
you hooked up with him.

22
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:26,898
You know what?
Maybe, just maybe if you

23
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,428
weren't obsessed with Henry
and you just did your job...

24
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:31,600
HEY!
I AM DOING MY JOB!

25
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:36,972
And if you still wore the shield you
would be doing exactly the same thing.

26
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,760
Henry is a killer,
plain and simple.

27
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:43,113
He's my partner.
And now, because of you,

28
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:46,347
I've got to go do what I do
when my partner is in trouble.

29
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:47,636
You'll never
find him alone.

30
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,844
Oh, what? Now you want to
come help me find Henry?

31
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,017
No! No, I want Javier
Mendoza, that's who I want.

32
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:59,292
Then from this point
forward, what you know, I know.

33
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,928
If you hold out on me I swear to
God you will live to regret it.

34
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,077
Anything else?

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,037
Until I find him,
you're my chauffeur.

36
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,629
It's been a long time,
Monsignor.

37
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:03,105
You rember me.
I'm flattered.

38
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,728
Do you rember her?

39
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,139
ARHGHH...!

40
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:14,662
<i>I stood upon the
sand of the sea and I saw</i>

41
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:19,290
<i>a beast rise out of the sea,
having seven heads and</i>

42
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:25,687
<i>ten horns and upon each horn
a crown, and upon the heads,</i>

43
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,985
<i>the name of blasphemy.</i>

44
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,401
<i>And the beast, which I saw
was like a leopard,</i>

45
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:36,616
<i>his feet were as a bear
and his mouth as a lion</i>

46
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:40,101
<i>and the dragon
gave it his power.</i>

47
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:50,408
<i>And upon one of the heads I saw
that it was wounded unto death.</i>

48
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:54,095
<i>And the deadly wound healed</i>

49
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:58,584
<i>and all the world
wondered after the beast.</i>

50
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,383
What do you want?
What do you want?

51
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,861
What I've always wanted,
vampire...

52
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,408
to save your immortal soul.

53
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,026
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

54
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:21,610
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

55
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,902
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

56
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,435
Look, Coreen, just
get down here as fast

57
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,153
as you can.
I'll explain everything then.

58
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:40,076
If this guy wanted him dead, why
not just kill him in the sewer?

59
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,452
He wants to kill
him somewhere else.

60
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,017
Hey, that thing you
slammed into his chest,

61
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,339
I mean, it took him down fast.
What the hell was it?

62
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:56,011
He called it the... Iluminacion
del Sol, it looked like a sun.

63
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,070
It had eight rays of
light, I guess they were.

64
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,270
Eight? Are you sure?

65
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:04,303
Yeah, yeah.
It reminded me of a compass.

66
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,962
It had a face on it and...

67
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:09,376
I think it was made out of gold.
- Okay.

68
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,389
He said that it
wouldn't hurt him.

69
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,849
It was just going
to weaken him.

70
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,297
Okay, we'll get Coreen on
this as soon as she gets here.

71
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,118
Wait.
What are you doing?

72
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,226
- What? I'm just going to clean up.
- No, you can clean up

73
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,646
down at the station.
I need you to pull everything

74
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:26,031
you can on Javier Mendoza.
I want CPIC, Interpol,

75
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,244
Spanish police...
- Okay, Vicki, I'm on it.

76
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,705
All right.

77
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,770
Hey, listen.

78
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,489
We're going to find him.
- Yeah, we'd better.

79
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,854
Kate.

80
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,785
- Javier Mendoza?
- Yeah, made himself out as

81
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,836
a possible witness to the
prostitute killing.

82
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:57,945
But now he's
a possible suspect?

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,981
Person of interest.

84
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:01,754
So how does Vicki
factor into this?

85
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,970
- She doesn't.
- So why has she called you

86
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:05,454
three times in the
last half hour?

87
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,754
She says to turn your cell on.

88
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,689
Yeah, this is a murky one.

89
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,652
I need somebody outside of
the department to do some

90
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:15,919
legwork for me.
- You don't have to

91
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,638
explain it to me.
- Crowley?

92
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:22,524
- Warpath.
- Listen, Kate,

93
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:26,526
I need a favour.
Can you just cover for me

94
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:28,250
for twenty-four hours?
I've just got to see how

95
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,939
this plays out.
- I'll do you one better.

96
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:35,368
I'll cover for you and I will baby sit
this search while you go take a shower.

97
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:40,513
Oh, and by the way, Dave
got an ID on the dead pro.

98
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,100
Amy Davidson.
Her street name was Champagne.

99
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,667
Thanks, Kate.

100
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,293
I thought for sure the
silver bullets would kill

101
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,020
the Windigo even if
the fire didn't.

102
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:57,419
Mike did use them, didn't he?
Because I got the vibe off him

103
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,784
that he didn't buy that they
would actually kill the Windigo.

104
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,365
Henry has been kidnapped
by some kind of lunatic

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,912
with an anti-vampire weapon.
I need you to find out

106
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:06,808
everything you can on it
as fast as you can.

107
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,058
Okay, wait a minute,
back up...

108
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,991
Kidnapped? Lunatic?

109
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,693
What are you talking about?
Is Henry okay?

110
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:14,915
I don't know.
He didn't kill him right

111
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,509
away so now there's a chance
he might still be alive.

112
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:18,921
How did he even
know you were there?

113
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,225
The only people that knew you
and Henry were in the sewer

114
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,753
were me and...
Mike.

115
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:27,594
No, that's...
It's not important right now.

116
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:28,758
I never should
have said anything.

117
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,262
Now Henry's going to die and
I'm the one who killed him.

118
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:34,014
No, no he's not going
to die because we're going

119
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,478
to save him, all right?
- All right.

120
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:39,772
- This is everything I have.
- The Iluminacion del Sol.

121
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,212
It's Spanish.
I'll start there.

122
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,972
All right.
If you can't find anything out

123
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,205
right away, call Dr. Sagara.
She'll know what to do.

124
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,249
Call me when you
have something.

125
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:55,127
In the year of Our
Lord, 1742, to the years of this

126
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:58,934
judgment, says Javier Mendoza,
there comes a persistent

127
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,475
public report that
Englishman, Henry Fitzroy,

128
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:10,980
Duke of Richmond and Somerset,
born 1519, died 1536...

129
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:21,617
You are charged with
inflicting vampirism and

130
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:26,314
heresy against the faith and
common good of this village.

131
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,159
How do you know who I am?

132
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,828
I will ask the
questions in this court.

133
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:34,429
How do you plead?
- I have no one here.

134
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,932
You hold no authority
over me, priest.

135
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,533
We shall see.

136
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,351
Be careful of this one.

137
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,754
He's a spawn of the devil.

138
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,991
My faith in the
Lord will protect me.

139
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:11,805
Save your strength
vampire, you will need it.

140
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:17,298
JAVIER!
JAVIER!

141
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,812
- Don't know her.
- Take a closer look, okay?

142
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,032
Because she worked this stroll
and she's dead now.

143
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,026
Hey, honey, how you doing?

144
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,266
Do you want to party?

145
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,888
Do you mind?
I need 1200 bucks to pay for

146
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:40,341
my kid's dental work, 800
to fix my transmission and

147
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:42,760
I ain't making jack with
you two standing around here

148
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,703
harassing me.
- You think this is harassment?

149
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:47,687
No, harassment would be if
I came down here every night

150
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,384
that you were working
and scared off all your

151
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,011
potential customers.
- I could arrest you

152
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,540
for obstructing a homicide
investigation, lose your

153
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,819
paper work and let you spend
a fun filled week

154
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:58,063
in Metro West Detention.
- Oh, that is a good one.

155
00:09:58,578 --> 00:09:59,654
You know there's also the one...

156
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:00,546
All right, all right!

157
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:06,418
Yeah, I've seen her once or
twice, called herself Champagne.

158
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,821
Nice enough but not
exactly Einstein.

159
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:12,272
No protection, no safe calls and she
was stoned half the time she was working.

160
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:15,447
Did you ever see
her with this guy?

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,318
I never saw
Champagne with him.

162
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:23,204
- You had a date with him?
- What? You saw this guy?

163
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,235
- When did it happen?
- Where was this?

164
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,551
What was he driving?
- Where did he take you?

165
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,281
Okay, It was about a week
ago, he picked me up in

166
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,263
a cab, took me to an
abandoned building.

167
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,211
I thought he wanted
what everyone wants.

168
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:34,164
What else?

169
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:38,797
There was another woman in the
basement, chained to the ceiling.

170
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,964
When I told him anything
weird was going to cost

171
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,319
extra, he grabs me, starts
dragging me over to her,

172
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,687
so I introduce him to my
pocket protection.

173
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,716
Easy, easy, easy.

174
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:50,818
Why didn't you tell anyone?

175
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:54,427
She was trying to bite me.
I thought she was in on the fun.

176
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,472
Can you describe
the building?

177
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,447
- Some old church.
- Are you sure?

178
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,553
- I've been to church.
- There can't be that

179
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:02,441
many empty churches around.
- Okay.

180
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,412
You need to show
us where he took you.

181
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,348
I ain't gotta show
you nothing, Princess.

182
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:07,851
Uh! Uh!

183
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:11,481
Okay, you have two choices and
only one of them has a happy ending.

184
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,772
You do know about
happy endings, right?

185
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,267
Is this where you
come in, good cop?

186
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,618
Actually, she
is the good cop.

187
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,059
Okay.

188
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,285
$75 an hour.
- You wanna get paid?

189
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,969
I expect to get paid.
Money talks or Cassis walks.

190
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,618
If you are jerking us
around, I swear to God...

191
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:32,529
That's $200 an hour, honey.

192
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,019
Let's go.

193
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:51,327
Have you never
seen royalty before?

194
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,110
What I need is some water.

195
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,360
Water, please.

196
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:08,071
I serve only the
Monsignor, and the Lord.

197
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:19,280
Perhaps a taste of your Lord's grand
compassion will fill my empty soul.

198
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:27,163
I warn you, do not attempt
to take advantage of my charity.

199
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,868
You are too kind.

200
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,579
Now open these gates.

201
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:17,444
I was warned you were
powerful, Devil.

202
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,269
But God's love is greater.

203
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,573
The accused has
the opportunity to confess.

204
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:40,416
All right.

205
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:42,930
All right, I confess.

206
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:51,309
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

207
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,610
I should have killed you
four hundredears ago!

208
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,250
Having professed his
innocence on all charges

209
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:11,168
the accused leaves the judge
with no choice but to proceed

210
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,070
with the inquisition.

211
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,178
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

212
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:23,965
You will confess
and you will die.

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,913
The only choice left is
where you spend eternity.

214
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,083
Dr. Sagara.

215
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,626
Oh...
Coreen.

216
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,998
Fennel, Vicki Nelson's
assistant.

217
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,841
Yes, of course.
You know dear, it's rather late.

218
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,280
Could this wait until tomorrow?
- No, this is about Henry.

219
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:05,631
- What are you talking about?
- I've got to track down

220
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,642
this Iluminacion del Sol
device and I can't find

221
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:09,583
references to it in any
Spanish mythology text.

222
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,233
I've checked everything...
Galican, Historian, Catolyn

223
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,048
even Bass, so I thought
maybe it has a basis

224
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,443
in Roman mythology.
- Slow down, please slow down.

225
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,637
What does this have
to do with Henry?

226
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,805
I thought you
might be hungry.

227
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:53,547
Come on, vampire, eat.
You're getting weak.

228
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:55,842
You need your strength.

229
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:13,466
One small act of mercy
won't impress God.

230
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,975
God loves mercy.

231
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,731
For those who deserve it.

232
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,996
The evidence against
you is compelling.

233
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:45,566
Confess freely and save
your immortal soul.

234
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,319
Confess!

235
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,436
Confess.

236
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:07,141
This is the place.
We went around that way.

237
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,309
- Show us.
- The deal was to get you

238
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,443
to the church.
There's no guided tour.

239
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,603
- Pay her.
- Why? You're the one

240
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:16,265
who said you'd pay her.
- I don't have that kind of

241
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,491
money on me.
- Oh, and I do?

242
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,696
- You should.
- What are you talking about?

243
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,339
I have an idea.
Pay me now and fight

244
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,166
about this all you want
when you get home.

245
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,958
Listen, sweetheart,
we are so not a couple.

246
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:26,148
- Sure you're not.
- We're not.

247
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:31,926
All right, fine. I suppose a receipt
is completely out of the question?

248
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,308
I guess there's no point in
telling you to stay behind?

249
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,534
Right.

250
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,931
Come on, sun's almost up.

251
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:55,157
Your wounds don't heal
so quickly now.

252
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,938
Has the devil abandoned you?

253
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,684
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

254
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,563
You're nothing if not
tenacious, but you will break.

255
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:06,641
You all break.

256
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,329
<i>The witness will give their name...</i>

257
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:12,193
- Delphine.
Javier >>... the year of their

258
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:18,170
<i>birth and death.
- Delphine Guillaume, born 1918, died 1944.</i>

259
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:24,113
<i>And how did you come to be
in this state of purgatory?</i>

260
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,399
<i>I...</i>

261
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:32,605
I was murdered by a vampire.
- No!

262
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,709
<i>Who infected me
with his disease.</i>

263
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:41,871
<i>Unburden your soul,
my child, and give me his name.</i>

264
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:45,607
<i>Atone for your sins.</i>

265
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,129
<i>Henry Fitzroy.</i>

266
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,399
<i>Forgive me.</i>

267
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:59,111
<i>He will, my dear,
all in good time.</i>

268
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:03,278
I forgive you.
I forgive...

269
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:12,347
What have you done to her?
- She is at peace now.

270
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:15,334
How many others did
you kill to get to me?

271
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,606
Don't flatter yourself.
She was a monster.

272
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:21,844
She was an artist,
a teacher, innocent!

273
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,238
And you condemned her.

274
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,248
She gave up her innocence
when she surrendered

275
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,508
herself to you.
- No!

276
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,312
Through her confession
she spared herself

277
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,133
the flames of hell!
- Hell...

278
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,129
Hell couldn't
be worse than this.

279
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,551
No one escapes
the Lord's justice.

280
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,502
-There's no pulse.
- Help me.

281
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,723
It's the woman Henry turned.

282
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,866
Delphine.

283
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,787
Where's Javier Mendoza?

284
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:29,709
Feed me...
ahhhh...

285
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,446
Feed me...

286
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,528
Oh, come on, Vicki,
you're not going to do it.

287
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:36,344
We need her.

288
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,559
Uh...
More.

289
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,283
No, not till you
answer my questions.

290
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,357
Where's Javier.

291
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:54,518
- Gone.
- What does he want with Henry?

292
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,998
Henry...?
Forgive me.

293
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:04,049
Uh... Vicki!

294
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:37,423
Dr. Sagara, how long
have you known Henry?

295
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,181
We're missing
something here.

296
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:45,641
What is it?

297
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:49,509
Eight rays?
Are you sure?

298
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:50,628
Yeah.

299
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:54,599
The number eight had no
special meaning to the Aztecs.

300
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,149
It's a lucky number
in Chinese culture.

301
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,498
Eight.

302
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,125
Infinity?

303
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:10,620
Immortality.

304
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,173
It's Chinese.

305
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,995
He left in a hurry.

306
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:29,699
He had our number.

307
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,438
Wish we had his.
- Yeah...

308
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,811
Nobody should
have to die like that.

309
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,862
- She wasn't alive, remember?
- No, you know what I mean.

310
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:45,907
To leave somebody, anybody, vulnerable,
alone like that, it's just evil.

311
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,122
Hollenbeck Nurseries.

312
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,088
He doesn't really strike me like
the kind of guy who'd have a hobby.

313
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,192
Oh.
Phew...

314
00:22:57,015 --> 00:22:58,033
What is that?

315
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:00,050
I don't know.

316
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:03,157
Maybe Mohadevan can
take a look at this.

317
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,986
Yeah, we're in
the briefing room.

318
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:14,462
Okay.
Kate's on her way.

319
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,948
Rember the last
time we were here?

320
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,697
We used to break our
backs in these chairs.

321
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,604
We gave Mohadevan a four
star case to the front

322
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:24,314
of the line.
Oh, you rember that drug

323
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,241
dealer who had the bag
taped over his head?

324
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:30,134
Oh yeah, you thought it
was a premeditated hit.

325
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,905
You thought it was
a crime of passion.

326
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,918
Yeah, and she comes in
and it's erotic asphyxiation.

327
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:38,285
Mike,
Vicki.

328
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,444
They still had coffee
over at Sex Crimes.

329
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,822
Oh, best in the building.

330
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,690
The computer spat back
boopkus on your guy.

331
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,992
What, no criminal record?

332
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,855
No record at all,
not even an alias.

333
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,871
So I googled the name to see
if it had any significance.

334
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:56,852
Turns our Javier Mendoza was
a Grand Inquisitor during

335
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:58,086
the Spanish Inquisition.

336
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:01,947
He specialized in encouraging
confessions out of witches.

337
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,907
Oh.
Uh... thanks Kate.

338
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,649
I owe you one for this.
- You owe me more than that.

339
00:24:09,343 --> 00:24:11,920
And get some rest.
You look like hell.

340
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:13,868
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

341
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,780
- What?
- What?

342
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,995
The plant
is jiogulan.

343
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:25,708
It is revered by the Chinese
as an immortality herb.

344
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,175
Mm, and how about the cup?

345
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,497
A mixture of
the herb and blood.

346
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,588
- Amy Davidson's blood?
- No, she was O negative.

347
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:39,006
This is B positive. There are some
other unique properties in this mixture.

348
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,552
It will take more
tests to iSolate them.

349
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:42,606
Vampire.

350
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:45,557
You'll never read
that in my report.

351
00:24:45,592 --> 00:24:47,921
Now if you will excuse me
there are other cases that

352
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:50,251
require my attention. -
Thank you. - Thanks, Doc.

353
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,225
Immortality herb,
Spanish Inquisitor.

354
00:24:56,648 --> 00:25:00,883
What if this guy isn't a fan of Javier
Mendoza, what if he is Javier Mendoza?

355
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:04,530
If this guy is Javier
Mendoza then he's over

356
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:06,689
300 years old.
- Maybe he's a vampire?

357
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:08,813
He can't be.
We saw him in the daytime.

358
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,637
Vampire blood.
Jiogulan.

359
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,801
This guy's juicing
vampires to stay alive.

360
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:21,347
- That means Henry might not be dead yet.
- Yeah.

361
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:30,245
Hollenbeck Nurseries supplied jiaogulan
to five different Chinese herbalists.

362
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,262
On the upside is they're
all on Spedina.

363
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,843
So we're no closer than
we were twelve hours ago.

364
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,389
We have solved cases with
a whole hell of a lot less

365
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:39,382
than this. All right what
do we have?

366
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:42,856
All rightwe know
that his name is Spanish.

367
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,192
We know that he is or was
connected to the Inquisition.

368
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:48,238
His last hideout
was in a church.

369
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,678
His last hideout was in a church
within walking distance to Chinatown.

370
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:11,583
Okay...
Chinatown.

371
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:13,038
This is where we
found the vampire.

372
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,423
This is where we
picked up Cassis.

373
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,997
This is where we found
Amy Davidson's body.

374
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:21,087
That is a pretty small
comfort zone to be working in.

375
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,394
He's conducting his
own little Inquisition.

376
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,256
The guy's hooked on ritual.

377
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,347
Holy ground is a
part of that ritual.

378
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:32,252
He's hiding out
in another church.

379
00:26:38,114 --> 00:26:40,949
What Faustian bargain
did you make?

380
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:46,137
Rest assured, vampire,
there is no deal with the devil.

381
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:57,160
I prayed to the Lord
for justice and He

382
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:00,335
granted me the capture of
a wretched soul who had

383
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,475
immersed himself in the
dark arts of the east.

384
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:08,815
At first he was reluctant to
share with me his knowledge

385
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,011
of unnatural longevity.

386
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:16,958
But in time he came to find
my arguments persuasive.

387
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:57,564
Don't think you can immerse yourself
in darkness and emerge unscathed.

388
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:19,817
You're a vampire.

389
00:28:22,843 --> 00:28:24,867
Amen.

390
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:34,542
Okay, we've got
four more churches to go.

391
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,451
All right, we should
split up, cover more ground.

392
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:39,819
No, we go together, okay?
This guy's armed and insane.

393
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:43,153
- Same old Saturday night.
- No Vicki, I'm serious, okay?

394
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,962
Listen, ever since you got
those marks on you,

395
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:46,736
you've been acting like
you're somehow invincible.

396
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:48,408
Guess what?
You're not.

397
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:51,685
No, but I think they might
be saving me for something else.

398
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,584
It's not exactly
reassuring.

399
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,474
I have no choice
right now, all right?

400
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:56,699
I have to play the hand
that's been dealt.

401
00:28:56,734 --> 00:29:00,369
Vicki, you will always
have a choice, remember that.

402
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,121
We split up.
Cover more ground.

403
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,477
- And if one of us finds him?
- We call the other one.

404
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:09,022
- You'll wait for me?
- Yeah, I'll wait for you.

405
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:11,596
- Vicki...
- Mike!

406
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,464
I said I'd call.

407
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:23,096
End your suffering, my son! Smite
the beast that corrupts your soul!

408
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:26,738
- Maria, please!
- Quiet!

409
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:30,941
The Monsignor will hear you.

410
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:43,818
- I am a man.
- You are vampiro!

411
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:47,394
Evil.
You kill.

412
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:49,525
And I bleed...

413
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:52,668
and dance...

414
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,651
and plead...

415
00:29:57,942 --> 00:30:00,219
You've been sent
to test my faith.

416
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:08,657
Your faith...
is about mercy.

417
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,844
To have you in his grasp.

418
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:17,289
To let you go.

419
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,955
What devil is that foolish?

420
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:28,530
Another trick.

421
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,312
If I do not scream,

422
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:32,796
I'm being protected
by the devil.

423
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,332
If I do, it is a trick.

424
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:41,803
I have had enough of your
judgment for one day.

425
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:52,325
Take this,
and prove yourself.

426
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:08,861
In Nomine Patri,
et Fili,

427
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:13,195
et Spiritus Sancti,
Amen.

428
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:33,387
Thank you.
Thank you.

429
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:38,116
NO!

430
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:03,827
Drink!

431
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:05,947
Drink my blood
and you'll live!

432
00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:16,422
Confess your unholy nature
and pray for divine forgiveness.

433
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:18,734
You first.

434
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,485
It's not much, but
I found a legend of a Chinese

435
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,114
warlord whose only daughter
committed suicide and

436
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:26,651
returned as a Chiang Shih,
that's a Chinese vampire.

437
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:29,118
She wrought terrible
destruction across the land

438
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:31,580
but the Warlord refused to
see her die a second time.

439
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:34,008
He ordered the wisest of his
Daoist Priests to tame her

440
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:35,869
vicious ways.
The priest created

441
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:39,077
an artificial sun to control
her, but discovered...

442
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:44,682
Come on, come on.

443
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:47,965
<i>Hey, this is
Vicki, sorry I missed you.</i>

444
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,505
<i>Leave me a message and
I'll call you back.</i>

445
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,542
Vicki, it's me.
Call me.

446
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:01,781
Oh!
Ooh, bad idea.

447
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,331
Henry?

448
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:15,765
HENRY! NO!

449
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,210
Vicki.
Vicki.

450
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,025
Oh, god, what has
he done to you?

451
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:24,502
Revealed
his true nature.

452
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:26,887
Behold the beast.

453
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:31,684
Now do you see?
- No, no, no.

454
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,652
We're going to
get you out of here.

455
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:37,793
You know what
I want, vampire.

456
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,551
Confess.
Confess your sins.

457
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:42,813
What sins?
Tell me.

458
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,452
You killed her.

459
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:47,378
You killed Maria.

460
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:49,395
We both know what happened.

461
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,800
I came for her that night.

462
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:54,347
I was too late to save her.

463
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:57,070
I heard the words that
came out of her mouth.

464
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:59,477
Her first words as a newborn.

465
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:03,054
My love.

466
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,182
It was a trick!

467
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:12,640
A trap set by the
devil to ensnare me.

468
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,063
The devil had
nothing to do with it.

469
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:19,841
She only sought to
embrace you, to love you.

470
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:23,106
God's eye, she was cursed!
I saved her soul!

471
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:26,848
You could have had her for
all eternity, if not for you...

472
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,213
your fanaticism.
- I freed her!

473
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,148
- Murderer!
- Liar!

474
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:35,484
- You're a monster!
- I'll shut you up!

475
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,668
Does the smell of blood
make you happy, vampire?

476
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,818
Your main course is right here.
- No, no, no, no...

477
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:44,343
Henry.

478
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:54,533
I confess,
I confess...

479
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:02,779
- Vicki?
- Coreen, it's me.

480
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:03,830
Where is she?
- I don't know.

481
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:07,278
She hasn't called.
- We split up an hour

482
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:09,454
ago to check out churches.
She should have called

483
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:11,383
back by now.
I'm going to go

484
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,243
retrace her steps.
- Wait, Mike.

485
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:16,083
We found out something about
the device he's using on Henry.

486
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,069
<i>It's some kind of freaky
gadget that was created</i>

487
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:21,549
by a Daoist Monk to steal
a vampire's immortality.

488
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:23,565
How could you
do this to him?

489
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,525
Listen, I'm going
to get him back.

490
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:27,636
What do I need to
know about this thing?

491
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:29,227
There is a special
key that removes it.

492
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:30,568
But we have to be careful.

493
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:33,622
Turn it clockwise,
it deactivates the device.

494
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,641
Counter clockwise,
it destroys the heart.

495
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:39,653
Great, so
where is this key.

496
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:42,003
Hopefully he keeps
it close to him.

497
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:44,147
<i>Yeah, let's hope.</i>

498
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:46,208
<i>All right, I'll call you
when I find something.</i>

499
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,670
Then I turned her...

500
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,955
Took her to join me...

501
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:01,014
- Henry, don't!
- A foul beast.

502
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,329
A foul beast.

503
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:10,207
Your soul is black.

504
00:37:11,657 --> 00:37:14,244
The penance for
your sins is death.

505
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:22,879
- Let her go.
- Out of the question.

506
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:26,195
Your confession must be
given in good faith and

507
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,857
with a clear conscience.
It would be remiss of me

508
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,369
to accept a statement
made under duress.

509
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,575
After you've eaten,
we'll talk again.

510
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,775
How long is
that going to be?

511
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,603
Ten years, a hundred years?

512
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,372
How long do you
keep them like this?

513
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,850
I am not Fitzroy's cat.

514
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:10,498
When his heart truly seeks salvation,
he will find the key to his freedom.

515
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,657
And, of course, you're the
only one who can tell when

516
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:14,860
he's reached that stage.
- I'm only a vessel

517
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:17,170
of the Lord's will.
He will decide.

518
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,737
What a convenient argument.
It doesn't justify murder.

519
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:26,240
You of all people should
know that no one is innocent.

520
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:32,006
Bon appetit, Vampire.
- Henry..

521
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:43,152
Forgive me.
I can't help myself!

522
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,807
Just give me a chance to
find a way out of here before

523
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:48,128
you make any rash decisions.

524
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,487
HENRY!
HENRY, DON'T MAKE ME!

525
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,649
Don't... move.

526
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:09,023
Detective.
Hands behind your head.

527
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,802
The key.
Where is it?

528
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,356
In a safe place.

529
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,774
I won't ask you again.

530
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,066
You know my cause is just.
You won't kill me.

531
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,818
No, I won't kill you.

532
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:40,177
MIKE!

533
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,037
VICKI!

534
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:46,823
Mike, get me out of here!

535
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,155
MIKE!

536
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,129
DON'T!

537
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:57,273
SON OF A BITCH!
OHHH!

538
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,858
Henry, please!
Please, you're killing him!

539
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:02,338
You're killing him!
Please! Stop!

540
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,666
You're killing him!
Henry! You're killing him!

541
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:07,683
Please.

542
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:10,364
Oh, please...

543
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:12,479
No.

544
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:13,759
Mike.

545
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,436
- The key.
- Wha...?

546
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:17,315
Turn it...

547
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:20,864
clockwise.

548
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:30,999
Are you okay?

549
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,567
I will be.

550
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:38,335
Mike...

551
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,294
Mike, you okay?

552
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:45,375
God, that hurts.

553
00:40:46,723 --> 00:40:48,011
Are you crazy?

554
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,035
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

555
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:53,253
Well, you're welcome.

556
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,473
Good evening, Monsignor.

557
00:40:58,508 --> 00:41:00,600
It's time to repay.

558
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:13,435
Bless us, oh Lord, and
these thy gifts for which

559
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:19,165
we are about to receive, from thy
bounty, through Christ our Lord.

560
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:20,994
Amen.

561
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,821
Oh God, Mike.

562
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:29,202
I'll be fine.

563
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:34,198
Let's go.

564
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,111
It's almost dawn.

565
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:49,828
We really need to talk
about your drinking problem.

566
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:52,220
Clearly I stopped too soon.

567
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:57,138
You, uh...
you go ahead.

568
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,139
