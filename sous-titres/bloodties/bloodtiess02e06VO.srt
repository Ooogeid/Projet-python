1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
you know, for somebody used to be a cop,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
make ????

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,800
what guy who works here is a thief.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,100
understand how i catch him.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
besides, the enemy guys take things,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
i am leaving something behind.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,700
???

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,500
no.$200 of high tech security equipment is not ????

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,500
u keep an eye on, aren't u?

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,200
there's two rats, meeting.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,700
one fall down.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,000
otherwise alone.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,500
u could work days, i wouldn't need the bugs.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,900
vicki, i was wondering,

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,600
what are you going to do tomorrow night?

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,100
I was going to type up the
transcripts from the wire taps.

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,000
Why?
I have a piece in a gallery show

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,900
and I was wondering if...
A fine art show?

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,300
The show is called
'Dark Visions'.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Every piece is inspired by
the dark side of human nature.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,600
And you want me
to accompany you?

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,900
It's rare that I expose
myself to the public in this way,

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,000
 and I wanted to
share it with someone special.

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,800
yeah, of course.I'd be honoured.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm just surprised that you don't want to take
one of those, you know,

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
artsy babes you usually
like to chow down on.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
You're different.
You'll give me an honest opinion.

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,900
And I think you might have some interest in the subject
of my painting.

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, an invitation
and a mystery.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,200
How can I refuse that?

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Very well.

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,700
A real date, huh?

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,100
Did I mention there's
somebody coming up the stairs?

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,700
There's somebody
coming up the stairs.

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
You know what?

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Your sentry skills leave a little bit to be desired.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
This is Maya. Inspire.

40
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,500
where the hell are you?

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,100
After what you laid on me
last night, 

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,200
the least you could have done was show up
when you said you would.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,200
I've got a gallery full
of blank walls, 

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,900
a show opening tomorrow night and no one
to help me hang it.

45
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Only the barest optimism
on my part made me dream that for once,

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,800
you might
deign to keep a promise.

47
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,400
Honesty is obviously just
not your strong suit, is it?

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
I hope whoever you're with
understands that.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Oh, don't worry.
I won't wait up.

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,300
Why are you swinging,
friend?

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,200
You didn't have to deal
with Maya.

52
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
Hello?

53
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, don't play games.
I'm in no mood.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
blood tie s2e6

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,300
Hey!
Our little wiretap paid off.

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,000
It turns out that guy was
selling R and D to China.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,700
Which is now how far he's
gonna have to go to get a job.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Are you okay?
Yes.

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,300
There's just been a little
hiccup with the gallery opening tonight.

62
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,600
Let me guess.

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,900
You want to take someone else.

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,700
It's a little more complicated than that.

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
The gallery owner went missing.

66
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,100
Don't they usually do
that after the show flops?

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,200
His girlfriend, Maya,
asked me to help find him.

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,400
I naturally thought of you.

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Naturally.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
She's a talented artist
and a sweet girl...

71
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,700
loyal, loving...

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,600
Is this an introduction
or a sales pitch?

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,300
She's a good friend.
I hate to see her worried like this.

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,700
All right, bring the little
girlfriend down here.

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,600
I'll talk to her.
I knew you'd take it on.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,100
Maya?

77
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
You're the private eye?
Yeah, Vicki Nelson.

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Oh, nice ink.

79
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,800
You, too.
The motif's an o> ginal.

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,400
Is that a Bartani?
Uh...no...

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,100
It's, um...Astaroth.

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
I thought I knew all the body artists in town.
He must be new.

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,700
So, tell me about
your boyfriend.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Jude was supposed
to be hanging a show

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,100
but he disappeared.
No message?

86
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,600
No idea where he went?

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,700
Jude likes to stage these little tantrums
from time to time.

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,800
Ah, you mean he bails
when you fight.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Yes.

90
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,400
And he left me a nasty message yesterday afternoon
when I didn't show up to help.

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,000
Henry But he never leaves
so close to an opening.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, Jude is
colourful but he's not insane.

93
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,900
So, where
were you yesterday?

94
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
Why weren't you
helping hang the show?

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
I was out living life.

96
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,500
Opening myself up
to the universe.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
Seeking inspiration.

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,800
Okay, um...
Here's what I can do.

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500
Jude really hasn't been missing that long 

100
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,600
so the best I can do at this point is 

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,200
call a few hotels, see if he's hiding out anywhere.

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
And, uh...when I come to the gallery tonight

103
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
I'll ask his friends,see if they know anything.

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,500
Just like Jude, isn't it?

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,900
So selfish.

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,300
Thank you.

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,900
Sweet? Loving? Loyal?

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,800
She's...
I have to help open the gallery.

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,700
Coreen?

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,900
Okay.
So, um...you know,

111
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,100
get out there,
work the crowd,

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
see if anyone knows
where Jude's hiding.

113
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,900
I love this.
I love hanging out with artists.

114
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, that's good.
That makes one of us.

115
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,300
Okay, go, go, go.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Be pretentious, or whatever
it is that they do.

117
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,900
What in the...!

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
Henry...!

119
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,600
Ay, chihuahua!
That one's mine,

120
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,200
so don't get any ideas.
Ah.

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,600
Fitzroys don't come
on the market very often.

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you.

123
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
To get these you have
to be quick.

124
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,700
All the sculptors
have hollow legs.

125
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Ha, ha.
Those crazy sculptors.

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
I didn't realize
you're the inspiration.

128
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,900
How delightful.
Yeah.

129
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,400
Fitzroy really
does bridge the gap

130
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
between illustration
and fine art, doesn't he?

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.
Henry bridges a lot of gaps.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm kind of a patron
of this little gallery.

133
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,600
When it comes to scraping
the zeitgeist and wringing out the juice, 

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
no one
has a better eye than Jude.

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,100
Speaking of Jude, I would
love to congratulate him.

136
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
Actually, I don't think
we'll be seeing him tonight.

137
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,800
It's the usual fireworks,
I'm afraid, Jude and Maya.

138
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Another rough patch, huh?
Not much left to patch.

139
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,900
I hear Maya's about ready
to close the Jude show and mount something new.

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,600
Do tell.

141
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Um...
How do you like the show?

142
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,000
It's okay.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Don't get me wrong.
I'm all about the dark.

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,800
But some of this stuff,
it's just...

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
it's trying too hard.

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
You know, "Look at me.
I'm dark.

147
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm depressed.
I wanna cut my ear off."

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,700
But this piece?
This piece rocks.

149
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
I love the dichotomy,
the pastoral landscape,

150
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
the hint of violence
in the window.

151
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,700
You can't help
but be drawn to it.

152
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, that's cool.

153
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,500
Really?
Why?

154
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,700
No way!
Really?

155
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,400
This is your piece?
Yup.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So you...
you really love it?

157
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
You do?

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Thank you.
Oh!

159
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Oh, it's cold!

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,300
All right, let's see
what we've got here.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,900
It's kind of creepy how he's
all like...posed like that.

162
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,300
Are you getting ideas
for your Christmas cards?

163
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,900
You know, he might
fit on top of the tree.

164
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,600
Hold on.

165
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,100
Are we getting
lucky today, baby!

166
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
The man's got a wallet.

167
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh yeah?
Let's take a look at this.

168
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Okay.
We have a winner.

169
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,300
Jude Marstens.

170
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,700
Good evening, ladies.
It's a pleasure to see you.

171
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,600
Thanks.
Thank you.

172
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,800
What?
You're wearing a dress.

173
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes, I know.
And I'm ready for the jokes.

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,300
Come on.
Say what you have to say.

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,500
You're beautiful.

176
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,100
I think you should
just stick to the jokes.

177
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,700
So what did you find out?

178
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,100
Um...Jude's friends, they
fall into two categories.

179
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,700
Maya haters, who think
she's arrogant and bossy.

180
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,500
And the ones who think
the sun shines out of her...

181
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
'Assertive' is the
term her friends use.

182
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,500
Maya has her moments.

183
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,100
All right, so tell me.
What is it between the two of you?

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,900
We're friends.

185
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,100
We met at a show
a couple of months ago.

186
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,800
I enjoyed her vision
and her work.

187
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,700
Friends.
Oh, come on.

188
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,600
She's a little young for me,
don't you think?

189
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,900
Isn't everybody?

190
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,400
By the way, I think you owe me
a little commission over there.

191
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,500
Well, did I at least
get the gun right?

192
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
You know I prefer Barettas.

193
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,200
Well, Missy, and what
did you find out?

194
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,900
Tyrone's a Leo,
Jupiter rising.

195
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,300
He's been painting
since he was twelve.

196
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,300
This is his first show.
And he's allergic to goose down.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,700
Did you find
anything out about Jude?

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,100
Oh, right.
Tyrone said Jude's got it rough,

199
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
as Maya's high maintenance.

200
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Maya sees and
experiences the world directly.

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,700
It's part of her process
not to censor herself.

202
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
It's admirable, not odd.

203
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,500
and what did
you say your name was?

204
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,700
Ah, there's Maya right now
not censoring herself.

205
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,900
She looks awful broken up
about Jude's disappearance.

206
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
Excuse me.

207
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,600
Just friends.
Right.

208
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,700
Hey, that's the same mark
Maya has tattooed on her arm.

209
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,600
It must be a signature type
thing, it's very artsy.

210
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,600
Hm. I'm going to go grab
my camera from the coat check.

211
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,900
Was Jude Marstens
ever a painter himself?

212
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't know.
Why?

213
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
Detective Mike Celluci.

214
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,000
If he was, I think the price
of his work just went up.

215
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,700
So what can you tell me
about Jude's movements on that last day?

216
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
We didn't see
each other all day.

217
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
I assumed he got
caught up in theashow.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,300
People say that
you fought that night.

219
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,600
Yes, we fought.
Yes, we did it a lot.

220
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
We're passionate people.

221
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,000
But I didn't kill him
and I don't know who did.

222
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,100
All right.

223
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,100
I may have more questions
for you so don't go too far.

224
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,300
Is it too much to ask for
you to be a little more humane?

225
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,700
Oh, I'm sorry, only humans
get to ask for humane.

226
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
You have to help me
prove she's innocent.

227
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I will help you
find Jude Marstens' killer.

228
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,400
And that is as much
as I can promise.

229
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,300
Thanks, Doc.

230
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,200
By the way, Captain
Midnight is way out of line.

231
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,100
Keep him on a short leash, okay?

232
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Wow, that was a lot
of testosterone.

233
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
So do you have
anything juicy for me?

234
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,800
Plenty.

235
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
He drowned.

236
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,500
But they found him in a vacant lot.

237
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, I didn't say anything about water.

238
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,900
It's paint.

239
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,200
You found paint in his lungs?

240
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,000
oil paint.
His lungs are filled with it.

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
It must have been
quite unpleasant.

242
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,700
How did it get there?
Did they put a tube down his throat?

243
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,100
No, there'd be bruising around the trachea or palate.

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,800
Did they make him swallow it?

245
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,500
No sign of paint on the teeth, gums, mandible,
maxilla, or Eustachian tube.

246
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,100
The way the paint beaded
it appears to have come from within.

247
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,600
How does that even happen?

248
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,100
I don't know.
It's impossible.

249
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,800
Isn't that grand?

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Thanks for
helping me do this.

251
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,200
I don't mind.
It's a tough time.

252
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,300
You could use the help.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,100
Is there anything
you didn't tell the police?

254
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,700
I did talk to Jude earlier,

255
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,200
right here.
We fought.

256
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,000
Was it a normal fight?
No...worse.

257
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
He found out
I was having an affair.

258
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,900
He went ballistic.

259
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,100
We broke up, but I said
I'd come back and help hang the show anyway.

260
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
You will not remember
this conversation.

261
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
You'll be calm.

262
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,700
And you will believe that
everything will be all right.

263
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,000
You might as well
help me finish this wine.

264
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,700
I'm good.

265
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,900
Paint in his lungs?
No idea how it got there?

266
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,500
That's odd.

267
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,700
You're really learning to
work the understatement, Henry.

268
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
Hey, did Maya ever
dabble in witchcraft?

269
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,500
Not that I know of.

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,500
I was just wondering about
those symbols she signs her paintings with, 

271
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,200
the one she
has tattooed on her arm.

272
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,500
Merely an artistic
conceit, like that singer.

273
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,400
Or did he go back
to his real name?

274
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Come on, Henry.

275
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
We both know symbols
can channel power.

276
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,700
They can be very dangerous
in the wrong hands.

277
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,600
If she's dabbling in something
she doesn't understand...

278
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,300
I interrogated her.
She's not involved.

279
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,300
So what...that's it?
No more investigation?

280
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,000
Not of Maya.

281
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,400
Jude must have had his own enemies.
Hm.

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,200
Well, according to people
at the gallery it was Maya.

283
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,800
She was having a few,
um...indiscretions.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,900
So?

285
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,500
If she was having an affair,
she would tell you, right?

286
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,200
Did she tell you?

287
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,800
Yes.

288
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
And no.

289
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, it's obvious you're
protecting her from something.

290
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
I guess the question is, what?

291
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,100
I was emotionally committed
to Jude.

292
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,500
Translation...
'I saw other people.'

293
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
All right, I'm going to need
a list of names.

294
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,200
This is completely
irrelevant.

295
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,900
You try and hide this
kind of thing from the police,

296
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,500
it will come back
and bite you on the ass.

297
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
I guarantee it.
And they?

298
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
They will t be
as nice as I am.

299
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,900
This is nice?
Hello?

300
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,200
I want to pay for my paintings
if now's okay.

301
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,900
Perfect timing,
Angus darling.

302
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,800
It's nice to see
a friendly face.

303
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,500
I have to run a business.
Could we please talk later?

304
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,400
Well, hello again.

305
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,400
I look forward to
nailing you to my wall.

306
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,300
You're going to need
a bigger hammer.

307
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,400
You know, I don't care
what Henry says,

308
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,000
Maya's lying.
She knows something about Jude's murder.

309
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,100
You know who you should ask?
Tyrone.

310
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,100
He's known her since
she was still Enid Wyman.

311
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,600
I bet she's a full-blown witch.

312
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
I mean, everyone
that Henry is involved in,

313
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,800
they just love the black magic.

314
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,400
I do not love
the black magic.

315
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,900
Well, it loves you.

316
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,700
Listen, if he asks about me,
just play it cool, okay?

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Thank you for helping me
take my mind off my grief.

318
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,500
I want you to know
I'm here for you.

319
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,800
And maybe, well, perhaps
in the future we could...

320
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
Could we not talk about this?

321
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,500
It's just that, uh...
now that you're free...

322
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,100
You know how
it was with Jude.

323
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,400
My heart is broken right now.

324
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Oh, I doubt that, love.

325
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,500
Beneath that smoking exterior,
you're as cold as ice.

326
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,500
When I get out of the shower
I'd like for you to be gone.

327
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
You can leave a cheque
on the bar.

328
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
It's open.

329
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Hi.
I'm Vicki Nelson.

330
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,300
I think Coreen said
I was going to come by?

331
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
The investigator?
Oh, hey.

332
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,700
Hey, am I interrupting
anything?

333
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,800
No, uh...no.
You gotta cover it, you know,

334
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
or else the dust
gets in the white paint.

335
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,400
Oh sure, sure.
Uh...Coreen?

336
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
She works for you?
Yeah.

337
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,800
Yeah, she's my right hand.

338
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,300
Uh...she said you knew Enid,
uh...Maya.

339
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,500
Yeah, well, I knew Enid
better than I know Maya,

340
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
that's for sure.

341
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,900
Listen, I kind of suck at small talk so I'll just
cut to the chase.

342
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,400
I need to know if you know
whether or not Maya was stepping out on Jude.

343
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,900
Uh...yeah, Angus Stratham's been sniffing around for months.

344
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,200
I mean, why do you think
he's buying all those paintings?

345
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,900
Ahh...of course.

346
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,500
Can I um...
No!

347
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm just not comfortable
showing it yet.

348
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,800
Just a peek?
No! Leave it!

349
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,500
Seriously, it's not ready yet.
Okay.

350
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Hey, listen.

351
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,800
Um...I was thinking of getting
tickets for the Warhol show.

352
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you know how Coreen
feels about Warhol?

353
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,100
I have no idea.

354
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,000
But, here's my card.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,700
Number's at the bottom.
She answers the phone.

356
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
So you can ask her
yourself, Picasso.

357
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,500
Thanks for the info.
Thank you.

358
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll let you get back to it.

359
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,700
Did someone
move my painting?

360
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Angus?
Hello?

361
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
No gunshots,
no knife wounds.

362
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,500
Probably suffocation,
just like the last one.

363
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,700
The body's still
relatively warm.

364
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,600
Rigor mortis hasn't set in.

365
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,500
No, this guy's been dead
less than four hours.

366
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,600
No wallet this time, either.
Can't win 'em all, right?

367
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Yeah.
So what did the witness have to say?

368
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
The body appeared between 2:45 and 3:00 o'clock.

369
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
That's a pretty
narrow window.

370
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
She's sure about the time?

371
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,500
She was racing home to watch her stories.

372
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
It's 4:00 o'clock now.

373
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,700
I'd put the time of death,let's say, noon.

374
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,700
Could have been a lover's quarrel.

375
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, lipstick. I saw that.

376
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Skyrockets in flight baby, you know what I'm saying?

377
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I mean, a little nooner
never hurt anybody!

378
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Except maybe him.

379
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,500
Okay, so...

380
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,100
We've got two dead bodies
and a chair in the same empty parking lot.

381
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,700
What do you want to bet these
guys are unrelated, huh?

382
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,300
Nah, I ain't taking
that action, baby.

383
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,200
No kidding.

384
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,700
What the hell is he supposed
to be looking at, anyway?

385
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,500
All right.

386
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,500
From here to Jude Marstens'
gallery it's, what...

387
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,800
20, 30 minutes, tops?
Depending on traffic?

388
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
That's plenty of time
for the body to get here.

389
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
You know what I'm saying.
The middle of the day, though?

390
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,000
That's pretty ballsy.
Yes, it is.

391
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,300
All right, let's see
where the coroner's at.

392
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,100
Here's a nice one,
"If you brand this symbol into the forehead of your enemy, 

393
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,600
he will be dead within a week."
Nice.

394
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,900
That's a deadly talisman.

395
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah well, talismans
don't kill people.

396
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,800
People kill people.

397
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Here it is!
I knew I'd seen it before.

398
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,700
That is it.

399
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,900
Let's see..."the symbol for
protection from evil..."

400
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,900
Specifically
protection from demons.

401
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,900
Well, thank you very much,
'Corwin's Demonology'.

402
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,900
Where do you get all
this stuff, anyway?

403
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,700
Used bookstores, Internet,
yard sales...

404
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,900
So listen, if you don't
need anything else here...

405
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
You've got plans.

406
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah.
Go.

407
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,300
Get out.
Thank you.

408
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,800
It's nice that everyone else has plans.

409
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,700
Does the name Angus
Stratham mean anything to you?

410
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,800
Um...yeah.
Yeah, he's a patron of Maya's.

411
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,900
He bought three pieces
at the opening.

412
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
Hm.
Anything else?

413
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm pretty sure
they're having an affair.

414
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,800
We'll be able
to prove it soon enough.

415
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
He's dead?

416
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,700
Body found in the same vacant lot as Jude Marstens',

417
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
lungs filled with paint.

418
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,500
The last time his assistant saw
him alive 

419
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500
he was heading over to the gallery
to finalize a deal.

420
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,400
I know.
I was there.

421
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,300
Really?Well, that makes you the secy?d last person 
to see him alive,

422
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,500
Maya being the last.

423
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
She's looking more
hinky by the minute.

424
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,800
Listen to this.
Six years ago, Maya, a.k.a.

425
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,400
Enid Wyman, stabbed her
boyfriend with a palette knife.

426
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,700
She insisted that it was
just performance art.

427
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,600
Her boyfriend didn't
even press charges.

428
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Well, what about the paint
in the lungs?

429
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Oh, the way I see it,
it's her signature.

430
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,600
Just another creative
act of violence.

431
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,400
Turns people into
artistic statements.

432
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,900
She'd have to be
pretty messed up to do that.

433
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,400
Selfish to the
point of sociopathic.

434
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,900
Henry says she's innocent.
What do you think?

435
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I don't know.

436
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
At this point, I have enough
to bring her in for questioning.

437
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,200
But, um...

438
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,200
I might need your help
with this one.

439
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,200
Henry?
Yeah.

440
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,600
If he's protecting her,
who knows what he'll do.

441
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,900
Well, Vicki Nelson
vampire wrangler,at your service.

442
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,300
Who's this one?

443
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,300
One of my mother's
first boyfriends.

444
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,700
I can't even rember his name.

445
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,100
I think it was Reinhold?

446
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
No.

447
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,300
Heinrich?
Harold?

448
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,100
This picture's called
'Mother'.

449
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,200
Is that your mother?
She was beautiful.

450
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,800
You would have
liked her, Henry.

451
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,600
She was a great artist.

452
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Like mother, like daughter.

453
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm a complete clone...

454
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,400
the art, the bad
relationship choices.

455
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,500
At least, unlike Mom, none
of my boyfriends ever hit me...

456
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,600
without my consent.

457
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Where did that come from?

458
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,900
It's a dream that I've had.

459
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,900
Ever since I was an infant.

460
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,400
My mother is with this man.

461
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
They're happy and laughing.

462
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,700
And then, in the blink of
an eye, he becomes this 'thing',

463
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,100
all claws and fangs.

464
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
And he devours her.

465
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And as he's devouring her,
he looks up.

466
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,400
He sees me,
and he smiles.

467
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,300
He sounds like a monster.

468
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,200
No.
Those boyfriends came afterwards.

469
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,500
Actually, I think I loved him.

470
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,900
It's pretty screwed up, huh?

471
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Welcome to the club.

472
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,600
Her cheeks
are too flush.

473
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,100
I'm sorry for everything
you went through.

474
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,500
Why are you sorry?

475
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
It wasn't your fault.

476
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
Maya, no.

477
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,600
I thought you wanted this.
We shouldn't.

478
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,900
We can do whatever we want.

479
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,200
You don't want me.

480
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,500
You don't think of me that way.

481
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,900
No, Henry.
I, uh...

482
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,100
I can't.
I, uh...don't even think of you that way.

483
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,700
I understand.

484
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,300
Detective?
Fitzroy.

485
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,000
Ms. Wyman.
That's not my name.

486
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
You can call
yourself whatever you want.

487
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,700
I still want you to come
downtown 

488
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,800
and answer some questions about 

489
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,100
the murders
of Jude Marstens and Angus Stratham.

490
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
Angus is dead?

491
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
We can do this the easy way.

492
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
You can come with me now.
Or, I can go about getting a warrant.

493
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,000
It's your choice.

494
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
She's telling the truth.
She doesn't know.

495
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,100
I can deal with it
myself.

496
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,800
You're making
a grave mistake.

497
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,900
Remove your hand.

498
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,200
Or what?
Henry! It's just questions.

499
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
I've been on the wrong
side of his questions before.

500
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,100
Let's go.

501
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
She's innocent.
I can sense it.

502
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,700
That's not good
enough any more.

503
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
She's going to have to prove it.

504
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Fine.

505
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,300
That was wonderful.

506
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
That's not what
Franklin would have said.

507
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Who's Franklin?
Edward Franklin.

508
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,300
He was a local painter.

509
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,000
He's a bit of a muse, actually.

510
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,100
His take was that food is
necessary, but a distraction.

511
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,300
I've never heard of him.
No one has.

512
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,000
He died penniless and alone...
and unknown.

513
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,600
I got some of his stuff from
a yard sale his relatives had.

514
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Aren't muses
supposed to inspire?

515
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, he does.
He sacrificed everything,

516
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,300
his land, his family,
eventually his life, everything,

517
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,200
to pursue his dream.

518
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,200
It's all in his artist's manifesto, 

519
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,500
"True creativity
cannot exist without sacrifice."

520
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,200
I'd love to see his work.
Is that it?

521
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,800
Huh! Wait!

522
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,200
It's a really fragile piece.

523
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,200
I'd like to keep it
covered a bit longer.

524
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,900
But, um...I could show it to
you next time you come over.

525
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
There are other ways to
ensure a second date, you know.

526
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,000
Cheers.

527
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,600
Thanks.

528
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,200
There were
two bodies dumped here.

529
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,100
There has to be some evidence.

530
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,000
Henry, that is evidence.
Put it down!

531
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,600
This is no time for humour.

532
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,100
What is it with this girl?

533
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,600
What is so special?
Is she that tasty?

534
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,100
It's not like that.
I knew Maya's mother.

535
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,600
I cared for her.
I cared for Maya.

536
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,700
What, you guys were
like a little family?

537
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,100
Perhaps the closest
thing I've known to one.

538
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,900
But when I revealed my true
nature to her mother,

539
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,500
she panicked.
She thought I might hurt her,

540
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,400
hurt Maya.
Oh.

541
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,100
I could never.

542
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
That explains
the demon-off tattoos.

543
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,500
She couldn't get past
believing that I was evil.

544
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,600
She did everything she could
think of to make sure

545
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
I didn't come back into their lives.

546
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,300
And you didn't see
Maya again until now.

547
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Maya was an amazing child.

548
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,800
She had such a special energy,

549
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,100
so pure, so alive.

550
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,700
Things change.
People get broken.

551
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,000
She's the same person I knew.

552
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
She just needs a little help.

553
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,200
It wasn't your fault, Henry.

554
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Sometimes people can't be fixed.

555
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,000
There's got to be
something here.

556
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,200
Both bodies were dumped here.

557
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,200
The location has to be significant

558
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,100
Here it is, 596 Hammond.

559
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,900
It's at the end
of a dead end street

560
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,200
currently run by a development
company, Chartwood Properties.

561
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,500
They've had it for
about ten years.

562
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,100
What about before that?

563
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Okay, that's weird.

564
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,600
Hm? What's weird?

565
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,400
The property is owned
by an Edward Franklin.

566
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,400
Tyrone talked about a painter
by that name all night.

567
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,800
He said Edwa Franklin
was his muse.

568
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
That's a coincidence.

569
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,700
I don't believe
in coincidences.

570
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,600
All right,
let's try this one more time...

571
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,800
the last time you
saw Angus Stratham?

572
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,300
Do you paint, detective?
No, no I don't.

573
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,000
I just arrest people
who avoid answering questions.

574
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,800
That's what I do.

575
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,600
Well, I don't know
who killed Angus.

576
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,300
And I don't know
who killed Jude.

577
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,400
I see.

578
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,300
You have a lot of anger towards men, don't you, Maya?

579
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,100
I love men.

580
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,200
No...
you have sex with men.

581
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,100
And it doesn't take
a lot of analysis

582
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,800
to see in your paintings
that you have some issues.

583
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,200
If I want to kill someone,
I'll do it with the brush.

584
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,900
We all have our own ways
of coping, detective.

585
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
What's yours?

586
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,200
I found
Edward Franklin.

587
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,700
Want to hear his obituary?

588
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,000
And I quote, "Edward Franklin
died September 2, 1992.

589
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Survived by niece,
Rachel Franklin-Philips."

590
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,100
End quote.
That's it?

591
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
That's kind of sad.
Yeah.

592
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,500
I spoke to the niece.
She said he was weird,

593
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,400
and just got weirder
as he got older.

594
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,400
He ended up hanging himself.

595
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,100
Tyrone said he had
some kind of manifesto?

596
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,400
Mm-hum.
Yeah, she sent it over.

597
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,700
Listen to this, "Art without passion is nothing more 
than noise for the eyes.

598
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,100
If your hand does not serve art, cut it off.

599
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,500
The flesh must be subject to the idea..."
blah, blah.

600
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,800
Seventy pages
of hard-core wack job.

601
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,300
All that verbiage and he
leaves behind a blank canvas

602
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,600
as a suicide note.
It's weird.

603
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,300
I mean there's so little out
there, yet Tyrone talks about

604
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,400
Franklin like he's known him
his whole life.

605
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,500
Yeah, and he couldn't
have been more than a kid

606
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,900
when he killed himself.
What, did he have his journal or something?

607
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,300
I know he has one of Franklin's paintings.

608
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
No, that's impossible.

609
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,500
The niece said he
destroyed all of them.

610
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,800
The only thing he left
behind was a blank canvas.

611
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
Maybe he left this one
behind before he died.

612
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay, this is
going to sound weird.

613
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,100
Great!

614
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,500
Tyrone said that Franklin was obsessed, right?

615
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,900
Sacrificed himself for his art.

616
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,200
I've been thinking,

617
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,800
we're looking at two murders
where both of the victims

618
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
were snatched without anyone
seeing anything, right?

619
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,300
And then both of the bodies
turn up 

620
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,900
and they've some how got paint injected
directly into their lungs.

621
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,000
And there's no way
of telling how they did it.

622
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,800
And then to top it off, the
bodies are discovered posed

623
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,900
in a vacant lot previously owned
by our obsessed painter.

624
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,000
When you put it that way,
it does sound a bit fishy.

625
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,100
What if his sacrifice
didn't go unnoticed.

626
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,400
What if he has something
to do with this?

627
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,400
What, like his ghost?
Yeah, well maybe.

628
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I mean, all that passion,
all that obsession and madness,

629
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,800
what if it somehow
had got him stuck here?

630
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,600
You know, he transferred
it into that blank canvas.

631
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,800
That would mean
that Tyrone is...

632
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,900
No, Coreen!
He could be in danger.

633
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,300
Look, if Tyrone has
that canvas and he hasn't been harmed,

634
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,600
 you gotta
ask yourself why.

635
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,400
He's not a bad guy.

636
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm not saying
he's a bad guy.

637
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
Wouldn't you like
to find out for sure?

638
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,300
It's open.

639
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Coreen! Hi.
I thought you might like some lunch.

640
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,800
Did I catch you at a bad time?

641
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm in the
middle of a session.

642
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,100
Aw, I've broken your
concentration, haven't I?

643
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,300
That's okay.
Well, lunch is served.

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,100
Let's get some plates.
Sure.

645
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,900
Please don't be blank.

646
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,600
Did you hear
something?

647
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,900
Uh...no, nothing!
Something fell.

648
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,500
You know what?
Sometimes my enthusiasm gets the better of me.

649
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,600
I just noticed the time

650
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,500
and if I don't get back to the
office in fifteen minutes,

651
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,200
I am dead.
Uh...what about lunch?

652
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
Rain check, okay?

653
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,900
Sure.

654
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I told you
she couldn't be trusted.

655
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,100
I warned you about
succumbing to distraction.

656
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,100
I sacrificed
everything for my art.

657
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,700
What are you willing
to sacrifice?

658
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,500
Everything.

659
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,300
"I want
to take you

660
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,300
into a land, into a grand...

661
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,600
Please, come take my hand
into this land,

662
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,700
into this high...

663
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,900
I will show you the way,

664
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,000
I'll make you stay,

665
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,300
I'll eat you alive."

666
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,500
Okay, so now we know
Tyrone's definitely innocent.Right?

667
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,000
Definitely? Maybe.

668
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,100
You saw the painting.
You said it was just a bad still life.

669
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,800
It was real gas station
art gallery stuff.

670
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,000
What, are you
a qualified art critic now?

671
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,500
Or is it a rule to dump on
the whole creative community?

672
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,000
Hey, listen.I'm trying to prove 
your little girlfriend'sinnocent here, okay?

673
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,100
You know what?

674
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,600
I think Henry and I should go talk to the niece again.

675
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Okay.What do you want me to do?

676
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Just hang tight.I'll be back
in a couple hours.

677
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,200
Okay, so we're not
going to visit the niece.

678
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
Why was it so important
we get out of there?

679
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, I was looking at
Franklin's manifesto while we were talking and it hit me.

680
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,300
"The only true art
is the human portrait.

681
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,900
The face is pure
reflection of the soul."

682
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,600
Do you think the guy
who wrote this ever painted a still life?

683
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,100
I think I know why you're
keeping Coreen in the dark.

684
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,400
Her boyfriend's
hiding something.

685
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,700
You think?

686
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
Anything?
Tyrone's not here.

687
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,800
Okay.

688
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,100
Did you find anything?

689
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,200
These all seem
ralatively new.

690
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,900
I'm not sure what a haunted
canvas is supposed to look like.

691
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,300
Better safe than sorry.

692
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,100
Henry?

693
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,000
What did you find?

694
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
This was beside his phone.

695
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,100
We've got to get
back to the office.

696
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Coreen!

697
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,200
I've brought you something.
>>veyrone!

698
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,800
What are you doing here?
I hope you like it.

699
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,100
Thank you.
It's...

700
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
You have to unwrap it, silly.

701
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,600
Wow, it's...
wonderful.

702
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,300
Really.

703
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Oh, excuse me.

704
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,300
Vicki Nelson...

705
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,400
You need to learn
how to appreciate art.

706
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
NOPE!

707
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,800
What are you doing?

708
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,900
You and your friend,
you threatened him.

709
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,300
You threatened what
he's trying to do!

710
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,200
And I know it's just because
you don't understand.

711
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,600
You just have to learn
to absorb the image.

712
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,700
Let the colours wash over you.

713
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,900
Let it sink in!

714
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,600
Sorry Coreen!
It's the only way!

715
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
You are a distraction.

716
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,800
COREEN!

717
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,300
NO!

718
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,200
You don't know what you've done.

719
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
COREEN!

720
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Usually, I see
destroying art as a crime.

721
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,600
I think it's time
to make an exception.

722
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,400
"If it feels
as though the world is standing still.

723
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,400
It could be a dream
or the projection of my will.

724
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:59,800
Live like fading photographs captured and framed.

725
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:26,400
