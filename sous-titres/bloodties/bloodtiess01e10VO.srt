1
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:09,671
<i>Oooo... yes... Barry.
Oh... oh... uh-huh...</i>

2
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,687
I can honestly say
I never thought I'd be

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,452
doing anything like this.
- Shh, shh, shh.

4
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:15,547
Stop wiggling around.

5
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,804
Oh, Barry.
I hope that was good

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,710
for you, because
it's going to cost you.

7
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:35,992
- Whew!
- I think I'm going to love stake-outs.

8
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:40,530
Oh, that... stop. We don't want
the client to hear that on playback.

9
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:45,259
Men these days have no idea
how to treat a woman.

10
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,818
He could have at least
sprung for a motel room.

11
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:51,443
Um... no.
No motel - no receipt.

12
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:54,524
No receipt - no paper trail.
Which is why the wife has me

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,682
following him around.

14
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:58,789
Let's see.

15
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:08,452
<i>Oooo... yes... Barry.
Oh... oh... uh-huh...</i>

16
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,673
You know, I was once
caught in 'flagrante delicto',

17
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,760
with the girlfriend
of a Vegas mobster.

18
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:17,813
The mug popped me
twice in the gut.

19
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:20,335
I'm having a hard time
picturing you as gangster.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,099
When Bugsy caught me
bumping uglies with his twist

21
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,768
he went off the track,
clipped me on the spot.

22
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,927
Had his boys dump me in the Vegas
landfill like I was yesterday's garbage.

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,942
He figured, he figured I was
down for the long dirt nap

24
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:41,553
but by the next night,
I was back with ns skirt,

25
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:43,500
ribbed up with the perfect song.

26
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:50,703
Hey, wait a minute,
you need blood to heal.

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,738
There's lots of life in a dump,
and beggars can't be choosers.

28
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,143
Oh, wow, I hope
she was worth it.

29
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:01,905
Love is always
worth the risk.

30
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:04,629
Eternity is a long time
to live with regret.

31
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,634
Did you ever consider
writing greeting cards?

32
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,662
Dad, I already did that.

33
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,554
The muscle tone
isn't nearly supple enough.

34
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,266
What if his wife were to reach out and hold his hand?

35
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,573
All she would
feel is his death.

36
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,064
Now apologize.

37
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:32,872
Sorry.

38
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,367
Not to me.

39
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,545
Mr. Swanson, I apologize.

40
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:43,192
Now you may
activate the pump.

41
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,732
Let's give Mr. Swanson
some privacy, shall we?

45
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,979
Words can not begin
to express how terribly sorry

46
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,492
I am about this, Mrs. Swanson.

47
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,895
Rest assured this has
never happened before.

48
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,264
Diesel's funeral was
supposed to be this afternoon!

49
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,732
As soon as your
husband is retrieved...

50
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,016
Retrieved!
He's not some bone for

51
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:20,013
a dog to find, Mr. Ulyanov.
I'm going to the police.

52
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,880
No one wants
this sad final chapter of

53
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:24,361
Mr. Swanson's life to
become public knowledge.

54
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,807
Ms. Nelson, thank you
for coming so quickly.

55
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,317
Well your message
did say it was urgent.

56
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:32,535
- Yes, very urgent.
- Mrs. Swanson, this is

57
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,684
private detective I was
telling you about.

58
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,168
She will ensure that your
husband is found as quickly

59
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:39,273
as possible.
- You'll find my Diesel?

60
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:44,550
- I'll do my best.
- If you'll excuse me,

61
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:49,275
I believe Mr. Ulyanov and I have some
particulars to discuss about your case.

62
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:54,680
Thank you Ms. Nelson.
You come highly recommended.

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,595
Dr. Mohadevan assures
me I can expect results.

64
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,084
Well in the future, you
might want to make sure I'll

65
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,539
actually take the case before
you start making promises.

66
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,316
And you can
be discreet, yes?

67
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,222
This matter requires
discretion above all else.

68
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:12,506
And results.
Discretion and results.

69
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,754
Why don't you just start by telling me
what happened to the late Mr. Swanson.

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,272
He arrived two days ago.
Liver failure.

71
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:22,997
Jaundice wreaks havoc with
the skin tones, so he was

72
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,099
scheduled for an overnight.

73
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,723
When I came in this morning
to check on the status of his

74
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:29,023
embalming procedure,
he was gone.

75
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,982
Was there any
evidence of a break-in?

76
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,178
The back door
was jimmied open.

77
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,971
He must have came
and left that way.

78
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,564
Are you sure?

79
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,806
Ivan and I were in the front
office working on some paperwork.

80
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:46,900
We would have seen
go out the front.

81
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:50,310
Dr. Mohadevan also assures
me that I can afford you the

82
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:52,485
courtesy of full disclosure.

83
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:56,431
Any you haven't call
the police because... why?

84
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,754
There are aspects
of this situation that

85
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,217
the authorities wouldn't
necessarily comprehend.

86
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:14,713
This was taken by
our security camera.

87
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,301
What is he doing?

88
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:36,572
I need that disc.

89
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,092
And a very large retainer.

90
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,060
Take a look at this.

91
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,029
What are you doing?

92
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:02,314
There's something
different about you.

93
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:05,436
I don't think so.

94
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,503
Same soap.
Same shampoo.

95
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,542
Same detergent.

96
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,996
Something more primal.

97
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:21,436
I changed my
fabric softener.

98
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:24,945
You smell like death.

99
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,952
Okay, how is that
even remotely a turn-on?

100
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:32,249
Decay is a common
base-note in most perfume.

101
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:36,322
Usually derived from jasmine.
- Oh.

102
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,556
The fusion of attractive
and repulsive scents

103
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:47,015
creates a sense of urgency,
don't you think?

104
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,247
Not really.

105
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,664
Now watch, please.

106
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,879
- Who is that?
- 'Sweet' Diesel Swanson.

107
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,819
Not exactly my type.

108
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,570
He was the Heavyweight
Champion for about 10 minutes,

109
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:04,330
until the Boxing Commission
found out he'd bet on himself.

110
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:07,108
Are you investigating
his death?

111
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,884
Not exactly.

112
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,349
There!
What is that?

113
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,891
Is that some kind of voodoo?

114
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,902
It's a form
of necromancy,

115
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,284
a particularly foul magic
practiced on the dead.

116
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,119
From the looks of that
mask, I'd say Egyptian.

117
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,174
- Hm.
- What else do you have?

118
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,599
Well, the guy who broke in,
I mean, he knew the location

119
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,135
of every one of the
surveillance cameras

120
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,374
so he picked the door
closest to the prep room.

121
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,295
Never shows his face.
He left no fingerprints.

122
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,347
He knows his way
around this place.

123
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:50,171
Boris Ulyanov a necromancer?
Impossible.

124
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,000
He hired you to
find Mr. Swanson.

125
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,634
Well unfortunately, in my
business, client does not

126
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,234
always equal innocent.
- How long have you know him?

127
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,213
As long as
I've worked here.

128
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,104
He is a most
dedicated mortician.

129
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:05,266
A heinous crime has been
committed against Mr. Swanson.

130
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,272
There is nothing worse
than an Easter Weekend.

131
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:10,361
I take it you don't mean

132
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,026
the holiday with the bunnies
and the chocolate.

133
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,025
She's talking
about a resurrection.

134
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,917
There's a code word
for 'walking dead'?

135
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:20,806
Well, many
colleagues have had

136
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:25,063
experiences that would sound
'crazy' to a lay person.

137
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:29,716
When I started, I would see
things out of the corner

138
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:33,272
of my eye that I chalked
up to tricks of light.

139
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:39,586
Now I accept the supernatural
as a fact of life.

140
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,375
And apparently
a fact of death.

141
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,195
All right, thanks.

142
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,762
So if Boris Ulyanov didn't kill
him, perhaps a disgruntled employee?

143
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,966
No, disgruntled employees
take office supplies.

144
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:55,547
So where does
that leave us?

145
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:59,030
Well, why
resurrect the dead?

146
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,015
Love.

147
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:03,482
His wife.

148
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,843
Maybe he arranged
all this for himself.

149
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,880
- Is that what you think?
- No, I think it's

150
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,847
a possibility.
He found out he had liver

151
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:14,457
failure, he couldn't face it,
so he went out and found

152
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,025
someone who could resurrect him.

153
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,952
For the record,
Swanson is re-animated.

154
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:20,924
I am resurrected.

155
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:22,821
There's a difference?

156
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,802
Diesel Swanson is
still walking only because

157
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,608
of the dark magic to serve the
Necromancer who raised him.

158
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:31,316
He has no freedom of will.
He has no life.

159
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,043
I maintain my personality,
my intelligence, my wit.

160
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:37,657
Your humility.

161
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:41,584
My soul.

162
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,605
This whole walking dead thing
must be pretty weird for you.

163
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:58,528
Pays the bills.

164
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:00,831
I've seen a lot
of weird stuff.

165
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,639
I grew up here, you know.

166
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:04,720
Was that difficult for you?

167
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:08,754
No, it was a pretty
typical childhood, actually,

168
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,659
except for all
the dead bodies.

169
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:15,306
I used to hide under the
caskets during the funerals

170
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,676
and pretend to
drive the hearse.

171
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,667
This whole place was
like my play room.

172
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:25,448
I think the other kids thought
I was pretty cool, you know,

173
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,332
in a freak show kind of way.

174
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:31,959
When my Grade Seven teacher
died in a car accident,

175
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:36,108
they brought her body here
and everyone wanted to see it.

176
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:39,168
Ha, here I was
having slumber parties.

177
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:42,693
Billy, my best friend at
the time - we were

178
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:46,603
pretty young
- he dared me and I dared him back, and you know how that goes.

179
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:50,443
He pulled back the sheet
and she sat straight up.

180
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,790
- She wasn't dead?
- Oh, she was dead.

181
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,220
Yeah, head-on collision.

182
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,860
But I could swear, though,
she was looking right at me.

183
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:02,014
I thought my dad was
going to kill us.

184
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,395
How about recently, have you
noticed anything strange?

185
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,397
Dead body walking
around is pretty strange.

186
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:13,298
What about disgruntled former
employees or dissatisfied customers?

187
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,866
No, it's just my dad and I.

188
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,487
And we've never had
a dissatisfied customer...

189
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:24,255
until now.

190
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,504
Hi, I wonder if I could
ask you a few questions?

191
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,526
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get this done.

192
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,495
- You moving?
- To my sister's.

193
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,380
I have to,
no insurance.

194
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,563
Diesel tried hard but he
wasn't the best with money.

195
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,929
Do you mind if I ask you
some questions about his

196
00:12:57,964 --> 00:12:59,592
activities in the
last few months?

197
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,578
If he wasn't here,
he was at the Dome.

198
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,670
It's a sports
joint down on King.

199
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:09,603
Big screen TVs, big breasted
waitresses, big everything.

200
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,955
He took a job as a host.

201
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:15,289
Six hundred a week plus free
food and booze to sit

202
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,611
at the bar and schmooze
the paying customers.

203
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:19,989
It was embarrassing.

204
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,625
He was only 36 and he was
acting like his career was over.

205
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:29,727
Yeah, he was quite a boxer. 46
and 1, every victory a knock-out.

206
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,840
He disserved that
championship belt.

207
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,200
I heard about the bet.

208
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,291
The Commission decided
to make an example of him.

209
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,837
Fined him and lay
down a 10 year ban?

210
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,699
Must have made
him pretty angry.

211
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,270
He gave up.
I tried to tell him

212
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:49,354
that his career wasn't over,
but he couldn't get over

213
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,334
the guilt and the humiliation.

214
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,298
That's when he
started drinking.

215
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,144
What does this have to do
with someone stealing his body?

216
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,468
Nothing.

217
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:08,254
How about friends or family?
Is there anyone else who

218
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:11,261
might have taken his
death particularly hard?

219
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:14,896
He traded them all in for
bartenders in the last few months.

220
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,449
You can tell me if you're
not going to find him.

221
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:28,875
I'm not going to make you any promises
but I will do everything I can.

222
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,974
Thanks for your time.

223
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,901
No one could ever
hover as well as you.

224
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,182
Hey, you remember
Diesel Swanson?

225
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,928
Diesel, the boxer, yes.

226
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,370
Yeah, his body was stolen
from a mortuary

227
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:02,145
a couple of days ago.
- And the reason the police weren't called is...?

228
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:05,146
This is where it
gets a little tricky.

229
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:13,466
It was theft by
resurrection, reanimation.

230
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,758
He's walking around.

231
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,760
At first I thought maybe
it was somebody who had

232
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,644
something against Swanson.
And then I thought,

233
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,494
maybe had something
against the funeral home.

234
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,919
I got to thinking,
and I wondered, you know,

235
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:27,134
maybe this has happened before.
Maybe he's not the only one.

236
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,669
Well, if body-snatching
is the new joy-riding,

237
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,213
I haven't heard anything
about it.

238
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:34,931
- Could you check?
- What? Body-snatchers?

239
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,154
- Yeah, or grave-robbers.
- Look, Vicki, I find out

240
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:39,401
why people go into the ground,
not why they come out, okay?

241
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,710
Call me when he
starts eating brains.

242
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,007
- He's eating brains.
- Nice try.

243
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,377
- His body was stolen.
- Making it a case

244
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,713
for Major Crimes.
- And he's walking around.

245
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:49,134
And that is a Vegas act.

246
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:51,236
Look, Vicki, I have five
active cases here, okay?

247
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:52,837
I wish I could help
you, but I can't.

248
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:54,368
All right, if you find
anything out,

249
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,915
will you let me know?
- If I find something

250
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,427
I promise you will be
the first to know.

251
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:01,209
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

252
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,014
<i>The mask is a
representation of Anubis.</i>

253
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,986
Ah, the Egyptian
God of the Dead.

254
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,314
According to the myth,
he resurrected Osiris

255
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,369
from the dead.
My friend's a security guard

256
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,651
at the museum.
He lets me borrow reference

257
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:18,100
material from time to time.
- You stole this.

258
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,514
Borrowed - can't find
everything on the Internet.

259
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,827
Ah, now all I have to
do is find an Egyptian

260
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,268
Necromancer operating
somewhere in the city.

261
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:27,836
I love my job.

262
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,267
Thanks for this.
Good work...

263
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:33,481
Klepto.

264
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:50,577
- You could knock.
- You could call.

265
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:54,202
You didn't seem all that
interested in the case.

266
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:56,082
Because I didn't
consider the well-being of

267
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:59,818
Mr. Swanson's corporeal husk
to be an urgent priority.

268
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,461
Well, I've got to admit,
you seemed a bit flippant.

269
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,280
You're searching
for a body.

270
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,266
I have absolutely no doubt
that his soul was at peace...

271
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,519
Yeah, I'm not
so sure about that.

272
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:13,274
Egyptian Funeral Rituals and
Resurrection Mythology

273
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,246
by William Carmichael.
- Sounds exciting.

274
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,553
Well, it's 300 pages
of university grade

275
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,791
double-speak, complete
with footnotes.

276
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:23,158
He did have the courtesy
to throw in a few photos.

277
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,156
Is there anything
of value in it?

278
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:28,034
Well, let's see, the
Egyptians believed that the soul

279
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,877
was divided into seven parts.
- The Ren is your name.

280
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:34,372
The Sekhem, energy.
The Akh is best described

281
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,896
as your ghost.
Ka, life force.

282
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,911
Ba, soul.
Sheut, shadow.

283
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:41,895
And the Sekhu,
your physical remains.

284
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,450
Well, gee, you'd
pass the pop quiz.

285
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:46,322
I spent a little
bit of time in Egypt.

286
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,681
Yeah, I figured.

287
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:52,594
The important ones for us though
are Ba and Sekhu, soul and remains.

288
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:55,281
The Ba is what was summoned
back into the Sekhu during

289
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,898
the resurrection ritual,
'cause they believed that

290
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:02,221
if the soul didn't recognize its
remains it wouldn't return to it.

291
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:04,170
Hence mummification
of the corpse.

292
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,081
But what does that have
to do with Swanson?

293
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:31,277
<i>Welcome
to the Necrodrome.</i>

294
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:35,591
<i>Ready?</i>

295
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:40,995
<i>Fight!</i>

296
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:07,668
Winner!

297
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,351
- Hey.
- What's up man?

298
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:19,071
Nothing like a body dump
first thing in the morning, huh?

299
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,634
Don't be like that, brother.
I mean, this is

300
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,642
our bread and butter.
- Aw, come on.

301
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,214
Trace evidence is
completely spoiled.

302
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,763
We've got no witnesses.
There's never any way

303
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:29,278
in with these.
- Why do you always got to

304
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:30,710
look at the down side
of it, man?

305
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:33,869
I mean, here we are, you know,
out here in the fresh air,

306
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:36,020
you know,
checking some fresh anatomy.

307
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,482
It never fails to amaze me
how much you actually

308
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,201
enjoy these.
Here give me that.

309
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:44,636
That's my childhood, man.
Walking by vacant lots,

310
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:47,921
checking for, you know, any
kind of corpse I could find.

311
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,416
This is why you
joined the force?

312
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:54,358
That's why every day's like Christmas,
man, except for the dead bodies.

313
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:57,052
Yeah, and you're the
normal part of my life.

314
00:19:57,087 --> 00:20:00,027
Just great.
- Dispatch said the body's

315
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:02,865
been all beaten up.
Chest all cut apart.

316
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,669
Yup, that's a
thoracic abdominal incision.

317
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,063
This guy's had
an autopsy already.

318
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:11,293
Well, how do you know it's not some
guy trying to play amateur pathologist?

319
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,653
Carl Blundell?
The Iron Fist?

320
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,304
Local wrestler?
- Yeah?

321
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:17,921
What did they do to him?

322
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,896
The guy died of a brain
aneurysm a couple of months ago.

323
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:24,469
Yo, this dude is famous!
Oh, shoot man.

324
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:27,007
You've got to get
a picture of us, man.

325
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:27,933
You just...

326
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,506
Just playing, man.

327
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:36,741
You know, it's interesting,
Vicki's working a body snatch

328
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,636
case involving a missing boxer.

329
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:41,654
Man, that lady sure
does get some weird cases.

330
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,430
Blundell's supposed
to be six feet under.

331
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,564
What do you want to bet that Swanson
and Blundell were taken by the same guy?

332
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:51,683
Yeah, but we're Homicide
not Lost and Found.

333
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:54,123
What?
Two dead athletes in a month?

334
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:55,106
Two corpses taken?

335
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:56,733
That doesn't raise
any red flags for you?

336
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,337
Well, it don't
add up to murder.

337
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:07,918
- Hey, Doc.
- Hello.

338
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:09,968
Did you get anything on those
names I fired over to you?

339
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,452
Carl Blundell died
of a brain aneurysm.

340
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:15,854
Diesel Swanson succumbed
to liver failure.

341
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,471
So they both died
of natural causes?

342
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:20,528
Blundell, definitely
natural causes.

343
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:22,836
I can't be as
certain with Swanson.

344
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:26,321
According to Swanson's
toxicology report, his blood

345
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:28,300
contained high levels
of paracetamol.

346
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:33,130
Oh, it's an over-the-counter
pain medication.

347
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:37,846
A high level of paracetamol can
cause irreversible liver failure.

348
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,478
The attending pathologist
should have flagged it.

349
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:43,358
Are you saying that
somebody poisoned him?

350
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:45,734
Or he poisoned himself.

351
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,813
You were
supposed to call me.

352
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:51,795
Yeah, Swanson's not
the only body that's gone

353
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,924
missing this month.
- I know - Carl Blundell.

354
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,019
Mohadevan called me.
- Ah, the things you girls

355
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,505
talk about.
- Look, Mike, you need

356
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,139
to be careful.
This is not your usual

357
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:00,703
body snatching.
- Yeah, maybe not,

358
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,707
but one's a possible homicide.
Swanson may have been poisoned.

359
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:05,813
- Have any suspects?
- Maybe.

360
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:08,772
We both know the type of killer that
prefers poison as a murder weapon.

361
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,049
Naw, I don't think the
wife's good for this.

362
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:14,942
Well, thank you very much.
I'll take that under advisement.

363
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:19,850
You know, this kind of
connects our cases.

364
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:25,205
Oh, ho, ho, yeah, and you've
been so helpful up 'til now.

365
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,802
Come on, come on, come on.
What do you got?

366
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:31,121
Actually, not much.
All I know was that Swanson

367
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:34,261
was resurrected by a type
of Egyptian necromancy.

368
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:37,877
Okay, you got anything
that I can actually use?

369
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,610
I'm not sure, but I think
there's a connection between

370
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:43,071
his death and his abduction.
- Right.

371
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:46,179
Well, you know what?
I'm going to use good

372
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:48,614
old-fashioned reality and see
what the wife has to say.

373
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,031
What do you think
about that, huh?

374
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,472
- Knock yourself out.
- I think I will.

375
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,063
As I told Detective
Celluci, some of his

376
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:01,075
postmortem injuries
are suspicious.

377
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:04,579
There is something
in his throat.

378
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:06,682
You know on that
surveillance tape,

379
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:09,352
the Necromancer put something
in Swanson's mouth.

380
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:10,936
Really?

381
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,771
Perhaps this is the
evidence you seek.

382
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:28,582
Before Mr. Swanson
passed away, was he

383
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,071
on any medication?
- Not that I know of.

384
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,357
Was he taking
Aspirin or Ibuprofen?

385
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:39,674
Any kind of pain-killers?
- Alcohol.

386
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:42,671
You're asking a lot of
questions about a man whose

387
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:46,211
liver gave out.
- Well, Mrs. Swanson,

388
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:49,774
the coroner found abnormal
levels of paracetamol

389
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:53,302
in your husband's blood.
It's a headache medicine

390
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,114
or poison,
depending on the dosage.

391
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,469
You think
I poisoned by husband?

392
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:01,820
For what?
The money?

393
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:03,987
I'm not blaming anyone
of anything, it's just that

394
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,851
if Diesel were hitting you or
you found yourself not being

395
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,010
able to take it anymore...

396
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:14,252
Should I be calling a lawyer?

397
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,515
You tell me.

398
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,650
Diesel was a good man
who gave up on life.

399
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,539
Or maybe somebody
helped him along.

400
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:26,127
If anyone poisoned him,
it was those bastards

401
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:28,342
at the Dome who fed him
all that booze.

402
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,650
Why don't you go
and arrest them?

403
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,707
- Hey.
- Oh, we're not open

404
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,197
for another hour.
- Detective Celluci, Metro PD.

405
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:42,860
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

406
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,263
Ever see this guy
hanging out here?

407
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:48,667
Yeah, Diesel, yeah, yeah.
He works here.

408
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:51,134
Or he used to.
Nice guy.

409
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,745
He tipped even when
his booze was comped.

410
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,721
So you guys must
have talked a lot, huh?

411
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:59,021
If he wasn't talking to a
fan he wasn't really talking.

412
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,064
Ever see anybody that
had a beef with him?

413
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:07,819
Naw, everybody loved him and if they
didn't, they'd sit out of his way.

414
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,895
The coroner found something
suspicious during his autopsy

415
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,634
so, you know how it goes.

416
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:18,600
Well, thanks for your time.
I didn't catch you name.

417
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:19,755
William Carmichael.

418
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,364
If you can think of
anything else with Diesel,

419
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,660
I'appreciate a call.
- Sure thing.

420
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,031
Oh, one more thing.

421
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:34,170
Did you ever see a guy named Carl
Blundell, hanging around here?

422
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,576
No.
If he did, I didn't see him.

423
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:38,237
All right.
Thanks again, William.

424
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:51,106
Well, I think they might
be the same on both sides.

425
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:53,081
Yeah, that's Bennu bird.

426
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,099
- And that's Osiris.
- That's the Ba.

427
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:59,082
- What is that?
- Diesel Swanson.

428
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,440
How do you know that?

429
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:03,728
Am I the only one in the
room who read the Rosetta Stone?

430
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:08,168
You gotta be kidding me.

431
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:12,767
God, I feel old.

432
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,902
Okay, Bennu bird,
Osiris, Ba.

433
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:18,079
Diesel Swanson?

434
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:21,455
I think this is a
requisition form for a soul.

435
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,567
There would be rituals involved in
enchanting the tablet but essentially, yes.

436
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:28,558
But why does he snap
the tablet in half?

437
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:30,842
Maybe the guy who
wrote this can help.

438
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:32,890
He mentions a lost chapter
of the Book of the Dead

439
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,614
that describes
a resurrection ritual.

440
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:35,851
It involves a clay tablet.

441
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,343
He's the closest thing
we've got to an expert.

442
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:40,031
I think he may
be more than that,

443
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,772
in the same magic he
describes in his thesis

444
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:44,813
is being practiced
to raise the dead.

445
00:26:45,513 --> 00:26:48,455
I think William Carmichael
might be our Necromancer.

446
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,385
- Anybody home?
- I don't sense anyone.

447
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,884
Never a good sign.

448
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:31,638
Stay away or
I'll kill you, too.

449
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:33,940
- He can talk?
- He can do a lot more than that!

450
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,097
You can really
hear Swanson.

451
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,907
He's trapped in there.

452
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,599
I'd feel sorrier
for the man if he didn't

453
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,199
try to take my head off.
What are we looking for?

454
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,651
Anything.

455
00:28:16,218 --> 00:28:18,026
Is that really necessary?

456
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:21,346
This from a man who spent
a weekend in a Vegas dumpster?

457
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:33,896
What you found was code
for some kind of Internet site.

458
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:35,596
And here we go...

459
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:40,746
What's a Necrodrome?
- Necro. Dead.

460
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,373
Drome. Arena.

461
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:53,634
It's a snuff film.

462
00:28:54,654 --> 00:28:56,240
Technically
they're already dead.

463
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:02,668
Okay, I've seen enough.

464
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:04,029
Excuse me.

465
00:29:05,808 --> 00:29:07,931
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

466
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:11,108
Shall we?
See what's next?

467
00:29:13,578 --> 00:29:15,284
Less than 24 hours
'til the next fight.

468
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,986
Man, I hate
working to a deadline.

469
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:19,744
Who are you calling?

470
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:25,000
Hey Mike, it's me.
I've got something for you.

471
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:26,935
Motive.

472
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:31,174
<i>No! Screw your schedule!</i>

473
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:33,258
I haven't had time to
find another fighter yet!

474
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,193
Well, because I was busy stripping
the apartment of any evidence.

475
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:43,269
Because some cop was asking
questions, all right?

476
00:29:44,937 --> 00:29:46,784
No, you know what?
You find yourself someone.

477
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:47,704
I'm busy.

478
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,484
Hey!
Hey, what are you waiting for?

479
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,035
Get in there.
Come on.

480
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,950
All right, that's enough.
Where did you get this?

481
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:34,818
Coreen dug up a thesis on
Egyptian resurrection rituals.

482
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:38,066
We went to go talk to the
author and found Swanson's

483
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:41,279
corpse guarding his apartment
and then I, yeah...

484
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:44,197
- William Carmichael?
- What, you know him?

485
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:45,610
Swanson's
favourite bartender.

486
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:50,713
So wait, Blundell dies
of natural causes,

487
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:55,597
gives Carmichael the idea for Necrodrome,
and then he needs a challenger.

488
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:01,386
So Carmichael slips
Swanson a paracetamol soda.

489
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:05,545
- He had ample opportunity.
- Steals the body and sets

490
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,250
up his next little cage match.

491
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:08,920
Yeah, but take
a look at this.

492
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,896
It's a count-down timer
to the next match.

493
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:14,143
Carmichael's promising
another fight which means

494
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:16,356
he needs another fighter.
- Yeah, all right.

495
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,457
We're going to send an APB out
on Carmichael and I'll see

496
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,203
what our tech guys can
find out on this Website.

497
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:22,915
- Okay, Henry and I will...
- You're going to stay

498
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,244
out of it.
- What? I give you

499
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,811
information and you cut me off?
- What, didn't I say thank you?

500
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,719
Okay, you know what?
Finding Carmichael is your

501
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,260
case, but retrieving
Swanson's body is mine.

502
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:33,907
Knock yourself out.

503
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:40,012
Did you have
any luck with that site?

504
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,237
Tech Server's in Bulgaria.

505
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:43,666
They tried hiding it with
a re-routed IP address.

506
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:44,987
That's a bad thing.

507
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:47,841
Uploads originate
here via wireless.

508
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:50,180
And that means what?

509
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:53,112
Sourcing location.

510
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:55,452
Triangulate.

511
00:31:56,804 --> 00:31:57,732
Okay.

512
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:03,731
That's here in the city.
- Yup.

513
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:05,758
Oh, great work, Jeb.
Thank you.

514
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,751
You got it.
Go get 'em, sir.

515
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,105
Vicki!

516
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:38,529
Please tell me
you've got something.

517
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:40,640
Maybe, I can hear
something in the background

518
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:42,407
on this audio.
- Can I?

519
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,240
You're going to have to
trust me on this one,

520
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,568
unless you can hear
subsonic sounds.

521
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:48,861
- Okay, what is it?
- Train 79 Montreal.

522
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,900
Now boarding.

523
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,408
Okay, there's
a night train to Montreal

524
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,127
out of Union Station. We'll head
down there and work our way out.

525
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,473
You know this can't
have a happy ending.

526
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:08,494
When we find Swanson, we're
going to have to stop him.

527
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:10,075
Literally.

528
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:15,449
Yeah, well at least Darlene will
be able to say goodbye properly.

529
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:17,242
That should be
worth something.

530
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,540
Swanson?

531
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:50,560
Please...
Let me die.

532
00:33:56,475 --> 00:34:00,099
Looks like we
found our next challenger.

533
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:06,338
<i>Let's go!
Move it. Move it.</i>

534
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:08,072
<i>They're on in a few minutes.</i>

535
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:20,982
- That's Mike's car.
- He must be close.

536
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,961
I'm going to have to have a little
chat with him about sharesies.

537
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,428
Hm!
- Must be something.

538
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:34,054
Well, I guess
I should have dressed up.

539
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:43,632
Oh, I'm looking
forward to this.

540
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,947
I wish I could share
the same enthusiasm.

541
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:51,609
Looks like this
could be a tough party

542
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:53,502
to crash.
- Looks can be deceiving.

543
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:55,786
Ohhh...!

544
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:59,184
Okay, uh... you know
what, go to Mike's car,

545
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:00,964
give me three minutes,
then switch on the sirens

546
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,984
then head back in here.
- How do I do that?

547
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,475
It's the switch
marked 'sirens'.

548
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,322
Sirens.

549
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:18,441
<i>Connoisseurs
of the grotesque!</i>

550
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:25,299
Welcome to the Necrodrome!

551
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,774
Any time now, Henry.

552
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:40,950
NOBODY MOVE!

553
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,350
VICKI WAIT!
HE'S GOT MY...

554
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,033
gun.

555
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:50,634
Great.
You and Carmichael partners.

556
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:52,088
Nice business plan.

557
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:56,091
We were partners,
'til somebody got scared.

558
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:59,908
Billy!
Come forward.

559
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:04,647
The power to resurrect the
dead and this is how you use it?

560
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:06,256
This is how it
was meant to be used.

561
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:11,390
I'm not going to grow old
massaging dead people's hands.

562
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:14,573
I spent years watching my
father fawning over them like

563
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:16,811
they were something special.

564
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:19,749
More concerned about them
than his own family.

565
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:23,276
The dead...
are meant to serve us.

566
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:26,768
They will serve me.
- They're people.

567
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:29,843
And you're enslaving
them for some sick sport.

568
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:31,635
A fight?

569
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:37,178
Ah, it's a promotional tool
just to showcase their skills.

570
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:41,254
And when the right
people realize what

571
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,862
I've accomplished here...?
I'd be lying if I said

572
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:46,435
I hadn't thought about the
military applications.

573
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,187
Billy! Take her!

574
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:55,418
Billy, of course, William,
your friend in the prep room.

575
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:03,881
I told you to keep
your nose out of this.

576
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,557
Yeah, well, I ignored you.

577
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,660
Besides, somebody's got to
save your cute little ass.

578
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,729
Yeah, and you're doing
a wonderful job, by the way.

579
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,449
It gets better.
Don't worry.

580
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,393
All right Ivan, I'm going to give
you one last chance to surrender.

581
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:17,965
I got you prisoner.

582
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,756
I've got the
zombies and the gun.

583
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:25,998
Kill them!

584
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:40,476
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

585
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:41,625
Diesel!
Don't!

586
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,586
Arrrhhhgggh!

587
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:48,262
Safety's on.
Diesel! Stop!

588
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,070
Can't... stop!

589
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,126
You can beat this!
You're strong!

590
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:56,512
You're stronger than him!
Diesel, you're wife sent us!

591
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,151
Darlene...

592
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:02,792
- HENRY!
- NOO-O!

593
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:06,409
This is
what you want.

594
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:07,872
This is what you want.

595
00:38:07,907 --> 00:38:10,147
Henry, are you sure
this is such a good idea?

596
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:14,381
Vicki, on your left.

597
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:27,120
Diesel!
Diesel!

598
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:31,922
Give him to me!

599
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:34,641
As much as I would like
to do that, Diesel,

600
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:37,291
he's our responsibility now.
Diesel! Stop!

601
00:38:37,326 --> 00:38:39,686
Time to find out what
a head shot does to a zombie.

602
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:40,685
- He's not a zombie!
- He's not a zombie!

603
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,575
You let him
do this, it's murder!

604
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:45,186
Where's he going?

605
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,143
Oh, god!
I think I know where!

606
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:51,062
Diesel! Diesel! Stop!
- I want to see her.

607
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,654
You're in no condition.

608
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,594
No.

609
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:12,743
Tell her I..
- She knows.

610
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:15,581
And she loves you.

611
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,018
She knows you love her.

612
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,217
Maybe there is a way.

613
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:50,188
Oh, baby.

614
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,455
I'll always love you.

615
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,560
It's like he's asleep.

616
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:21,769
Proceeds from the door.

617
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,590
I'll take care of it.

618
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:52,447
It's time, my friend.

619
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:11,885
Thank you.

620
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,567
What's going
to happen to Ivan?

621
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:50,750
With any luck,
he'll go away for life

622
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:52,557
for Swanson and
Carmichael's murders.

623
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,820
Being caught in
a warehouse surrounded

624
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:56,980
by dead people shouldn't
help his case any.

625
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,596
I think I get it now.

626
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:06,058
That sweetness of death.

627
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:10,645
It's an acquired taste.

628
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:11,646
