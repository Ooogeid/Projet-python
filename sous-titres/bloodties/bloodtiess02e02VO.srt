1
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:06,621
<i>I used to love
looking at the stars.</i>

2
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:10,082
What do you see?

3
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,312
It's hard to describe.

4
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,145
Not just the points
of light others see.

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,155
For me the sky is
lit up like midday.

6
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,528
Is the whole night
like that for you?

7
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,676
It's like living your
life in Technicolor.

8
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,468
All the colours are
brilliant, intense.

9
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,083
I see points of the spectrum
people can't even imagine.

10
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:33,072
And the people, the people,

11
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,419
the people, they glow,

12
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:38,728
their breath.

13
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:44,825
Their blood pulsing below
the surface of their skin.

14
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:47,561
It's heady.

15
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,920
I wish I could
experience that.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,473
All it takes is a
simple blood transfusion.

17
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,837
I've been branded by a demon.

18
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:59,861
All I'd need is to
turn into a vampire.

19
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,884
I admit, it does
have its costs.

20
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,794
You'd lose your life.
- I might miss that.

21
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:06,021
You'd lose the day.

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,975
Also one that's hard to lose.

23
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:13,097
You lose your friends,
your family and you'd lose me,

24
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:14,762
what we have.

25
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,261
Like you lost Christina.

26
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,163
Like I lost Christina.

27
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,641
This whole vamp
territorialism thing is a bitch.

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,449
I suppose it's nature's
way of preventing us

29
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:28,255
from turning too many
friends and lovers.

30
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,785
It can't be beat?

31
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:35,365
With control, we can learn
not to kill one another.

32
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:39,626
Sometimes you wind up regretting
that course of action even more.

33
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:44,293
People call me a pessimist.

34
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:43,577
Stagione 2 Episodio 02
- "Wild Blood" -

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,217
Un grand merci à Sharkypan87
pour nous avoir transmis cette VO

36
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:50,975
www.subsfactory.it

37
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,760
Detective,
this is a list of what

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,240
Melville's family
thinks was stolen.

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,712
Get it out to the pawnshops.

40
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:58,704
Nobody rests until
this is put to bed.

41
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,471
Please, please, you don't
know what you're doing.

42
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:01,691
You're making a bit mistake.

43
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,903
Then consider
this your chance

44
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:05,293
to set the record straight.
Go on through.

45
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,239
Who is she?

46
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,882
She says her name's
Felicia Bannock.

47
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,947
Neighbours saw her come away
from Melville's house at 9:15.

48
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:16,036
The ME places time of death
around the same time.

49
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,951
That's not enough to put her
on the hook for a homicide.

50
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,451
What are the chances
of locking her down?

51
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,288
We've got work to do.

52
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,202
Nobody actually saw her come
out of Melville's house,

53
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,257
there's no physical evidence
linking her to the crime scene,

54
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:25,914
so basically we
need a confession.

55
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,762
Melville was a drinking
buddy of the Mayor's

56
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:30,452
and interest in seeing
somebody go down is white hot.

57
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,330
Yeah, well
she's involved, okay.

58
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,184
The moment we flashed
our badges, she ran.

59
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,167
Got halfway to the street
before we caught her.

60
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,539
That doesn't hook her to the
animal that killed Melville.

61
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,340
He was torn to pieces.

62
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,187
The coroner says the gashes
are consistent with a big cat.

63
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,772
A jaguar, leopard, cougar.

64
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:48,055
Come on, the guy's head

65
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,762
was ripped off
and placed on a table.

66
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,531
That's hardly something
an animal would do.

67
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,965
Well it's definitely
not something

68
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:55,703
a woman her size could do.
- She has no explanation

69
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:58,120
for what she was doing there.
- I need results.

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,468
I have got to get the press
something before morning.

71
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,455
I'm glad to see it's all
about justice being served.

72
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:05,094
If we want to keep our
heads on our shoulders,

73
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:07,305
then we have better find out
who took Melville's.

74
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,292
I know she did it.

75
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,647
And I know I can get
something out of her.

76
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:12,551
Your clock is counting down.

77
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,544
Just love the support
around here.

78
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:23,946
I hope we're right.

79
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:25,940
Oh, come on
Kate, not you too.

80
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,908
You saw her reaction, right?

81
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,552
Whoever Felicia's hooked up
with knows she's been popped.

82
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:33,375
They could already
be in the wind.

83
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,776
We just wanted to have
a conversation with her.

84
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,532
She didn't give us
much choice, did she?

85
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,421
Look, all I'm saying
is we've got to know

86
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,713
when to cut and run
with this.

87
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,952
We can always set up
a stake out and see if she

88
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:45,644
hooks up with anyone.
- Or she just disappears.

89
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,599
Listen, Kate,

90
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,517
I know she did it.

91
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,552
It's more than her reaction,

92
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,908
it's more than
the eye-witness account,

93
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:53,531
I just...

94
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,348
I've got a feeling
about her.

95
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:02,680
Hey, best case is she
talks, we close this fast.

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,891
Exactly, come on.
Let's do this.

97
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:19,638
What do you
want from me?

98
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,262
We need to ask
you a few questions

99
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,271
about what you did
earlier this evening.

100
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,424
Specifically between the
hours of nine and midnight.

101
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:27,301
I don't know.
Nothing.

102
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,061
Nothing?
That's pretty vague, Felicia.

103
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:33,226
- I was at home watching TV.
- Yeah? What was on?

104
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,678
I flip around a lot.

105
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:38,561
I was watching a police show,
The one with the forensic guys.

106
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,060
Good guess.

107
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:42,944
Yeah, that was on tonight,
wasn't it?

108
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,499
Your car was seen
driving on Post Road.

109
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,881
A woman matching your
description was seen driving it.

110
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:51,281
I went out to get some food.
I got a burger.

111
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,878
It's an awful long way
to go from your place.

112
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:56,998
You can't charge me for
driving around in my car.

113
00:06:56,998 --> 00:07:00,520
No, but killing a man is
still generally frowned upon.

114
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:02,693
I didn't kill anybody.

115
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,315
So that's why you ran when
we showed you our badges, huh?

116
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:10,588
How well did you
know Patrick Melville?

117
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:11,948
I don't know who he is.

118
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:13,947
Well you see Felicia,
we have an eye witness

119
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:18,112
who saw you driving away
from the front of his house.

120
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,019
I don't know.
I got lost once.

121
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,965
I stopped to read the map book.
Maybe it was over there.

122
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:27,555
So you went up to the
door to ask for directions.

123
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:28,505
And then what happened?

124
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:31,691
Nothing.
I never got out of my car.

125
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,293
Oh, except for when you
went to the restaurant

126
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:36,005
to get some food.

127
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,173
- Yeah, that's right.
- Right.

128
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,525
Where did you
say you ate again?

129
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,836
A burger place.

130
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:43,949
Where'd you go?
Lombardi's?

131
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,108
Yeah, that's it.

132
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,025
Too bad.
Lombardi's was closed.

133
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:53,713
I don't know,
like I said, I got lost.

134
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,166
I need a coffee,
you want one?

135
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,732
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

136
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:05,382
Look, Felicia,

137
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:11,799
maybe you didn't do this alone.

138
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,734
Hell, maybe you weren't
even part of the murder.

139
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,833
You could have just driving
the car for the guy who did it.

140
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,700
You give us his name
and we're done here.

141
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,303
Otherwise...

142
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,850
you're going to get very
familiar with a six by ten cell

143
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,628
and for a very long time.
You understand?

144
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,727
You have no idea.

145
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,696
<i>Okay Mike,
let me get this straight.</i>

146
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:52,922
You want to hire me?

147
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,923
I got something that
just came up, a homicide.

148
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:59,382
That you can't
solve, that you need...me.

149
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:00,312
Us.

150
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,202
Us, to solve.

151
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,429
- It's complicated.
- Ah, that is my line.

152
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:08,847
That's just the thing.
It's your kind of case.

153
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:11,533
Could you turn your head to
the left a bit while you talk?

154
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,400
- Does he have to do that?
- Agh!

155
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,552
You can speak to me,
detective, I can hear you.

156
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,811
And yes, I do have to
draw you Detective.

157
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:20,796
It's my profession.
I'm looking for inspiration

158
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,675
for a new monthly book
series I'm writing.

159
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,123
You see, the thing is I don't
want to be in your funny books.

160
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,621
It's not going to be funny.

161
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,435
I can assure you detective,
it will be deathly serious,

162
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:32,697
tragic even.

163
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,100
You were
saying, about your case.

164
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,598
A guy was murdered
in his home last night.

165
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,400
Torn up as though
it were by animals.

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,752
His head was ripped off
and ah, placed on a table.

167
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,770
Still less creepy
than china figurines.

168
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,629
You're not going to
make this easy are you?

169
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,007
I'm all ears.

170
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,528
She says her name
is Felicia Bannock.

171
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:58,829
I think she's in it somehow.

172
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:01,091
I looked her up in the
database, no criminal record.

173
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:02,320
Can you place
her at the scene?

174
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,512
That's where
it gets tricky.

175
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:06,246
I can't tie her
to the actual murder.

176
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,857
And I come in where?

177
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,832
Kate had just left the room,
I was pushing Felicia hard,

178
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,735
and I saw something.

179
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:20,545
Now it could have just
been a trick of the light,

180
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,878
but I saw her reflection
in the mirror,

181
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:26,292
and I could swear
her eyes were glowing.

182
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:30,566
By the time I turned back,
everything was back to normal.

183
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:34,112
And I'm telling you, it's as
Anough she was smiling at me.

184
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:36,465
Like she knew something
that I didn't

185
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:37,983
and knew that I could
never prove it.

186
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,162
You think she's... different?

187
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:44,042
I was going to go with
creepy and freakish,

188
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,738
but yeah, different
kind of sums it up.

189
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:49,249
As to what she is and
how the hell to prove it,

190
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,740
well...that's where you come in.
- Wait a minute.

191
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,378
Don't you have an entire
precinct full of detectives

192
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:57,148
with shiny badges and guns
and flashing lights and stuff?

193
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,239
I'd like you to
picture Crowley's face

194
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,874
if I brought this to her.

195
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,786
- Oh, so not pretty.
- Yeah.

196
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:11,179
But the thing is I do have other
cases and there are expenses.

197
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:16,935
You're not going to let
a little thing like other work

198
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:20,193
and money get in the way
of helping me here are you?

199
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,038
Who taught you
crazy talk like that?

200
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:25,617
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe you?

201
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:33,277
Look, Vicki, I really
need your help here.

202
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,170
Of course.

203
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:36,789
Thank you.

204
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,266
Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

205
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,067
Your Lordship.

206
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,998
Constable.

207
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:52,449
You know I like him.

208
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:54,642
I'm going to regret
having to draw him

209
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:55,924
being eaten by hellhounds.

210
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,620
Would you get your coat?
We have work to do.

211
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,007
They need bigger teeth.

212
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,279
<i>Look, Felicia,
we know you didn't do it.</i>

213
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,531
<i>You don't look
like the kind of woman</i>

214
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:11,994
<i>who would rip
a guy's head off.</i>

215
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,777
<i>The way we
see it, he told you</i>

216
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:15,436
he was just going to rob
Melville, right?

217
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:17,297
You were just driving?

218
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,864
That's no way to
treat a friend, Felicia.

219
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,874
Here you are doing him a favour
and he just leaves you

220
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,346
holding the bag,
what's that about?

221
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:24,723
There was no friend.

222
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,283
So you're telling
us you did it.

223
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:28,662
You don't listen
too well, Detective.

224
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:35,480
Tell me, Felicia,
how did you cut his head off?

225
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,652
I didn't cut
anyone's head off.

226
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:40,239
But you know how it
was done, don't you?

227
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,474
I mean a guy pulling a
simple robbery like that,

228
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:44,074
you don't rip a guy's head off.

229
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:46,374
Whoever did it must
have really hated him.

230
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,792
Maybe the guy who
was killed deserved it.

231
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:50,652
Is that is?

232
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:53,091
Did that guy deserve to be
killed for some reason?

233
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:56,057
There are people like
that, aren't there?

234
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,943
Hey, we all
feel it sometimes.

235
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:04,351
<i>Really, do you
feel it, detective?</i>

236
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:06,228
<i>Sure.</i>

237
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,221
<i>Everybody's got a dark
side that comes out.</i>

238
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,570
Hmm, suppose they do.

239
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,958
How dark does your's get?

240
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,298
How far do you let yourself go?

241
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,941
What did he
do to your friend?

242
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,635
Did he hurt him?
Cheat him?

243
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:25,233
What's with the
head on the table?

244
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:30,227
Is that a statement of some
kind or a warning to others?

245
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,677
Didn't know him.

246
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,052
I don't know why someone
would want to take someone

247
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:35,868
else's head.
It isn't right is it?

248
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,170
It's not even human.

249
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,146
All right, let's start
this from the top, shall we?

250
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,321
You should have just let
me climb through the window.

251
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:56,558
Yes, well the whole
point of break-ins

252
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:57,872
is to keep a low profile.

253
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,605
I think I know a little
bit about break-ins.

254
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:02,665
Who do you think stole the crown
jewels from the Tower of London?

255
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:05,670
Yeah, I think the crown
jewels are still there.

256
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,047
If you say so.

257
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,113
You know, for somebody who's
supposed to be a high-end

258
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,195
cat burglar, she sure
doesn't live like one.

259
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:15,832
Her taste in art leaves
much to be desired too.

260
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,544
Yes, well, we all can't have
wall to wall Van Gogh, Henry.

261
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,961
You know I kind of
like the idea

262
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,781
that Cellucci actually
needs our help.

263
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,199
It makes his smug attitude
much easier to bear.

264
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,239
Don't be petty, Henry.
It doesn't become you.

265
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,370
So you have no intention
of showing him up.

266
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,853
Well, nothing wrong with
a little healthy competion.

267
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,037
At least we know our
mystery woman has a family.

268
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,583
That's not all we know.

269
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,837
We know where that family lives.

270
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,245
Hmm...

271
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,559
Do you think this building
has storage lockers?

272
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,458
<i>Of course she's not
going to keep anything</i>

273
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,658
<i>up in the apartment.
What do you want to bet</i>

274
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:03,914
this place if full of swag.
Oh my god!

275
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:07,886
What the..?

276
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:11,797
Vicki.

277
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,094
It's me.

278
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:25,098
We found something.

279
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:33,206
Why is there almost
no records on you, Felicia?

280
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:34,799
I'm not a joiner.

281
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,714
No school records,
no health records,

282
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:39,502
hell, not even a library card.

283
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,332
I'm not a big reader either.

284
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,931
Well then what do you
do, with yourself, Felicia?

285
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,761
Tell me, what do you do?

286
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:49,216
I work, I go home,
I go to sleep.

287
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,375
That's it.

288
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,189
Your manager at
the Bay Street Grill

289
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,823
says you started
seven months ago.

290
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:56,238
Okay, you caught me.

291
00:15:56,238 --> 00:16:00,349
I sell over priced drinks
to gray haired men in suits.

292
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:02,065
Is that where you
met Patrick Melville?

293
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,449
I don't know.
I make it a point

294
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,078
not to get to know
customer's names.

295
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:07,669
I'm getting the sense
that you're not really

296
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,496
a people person.
- Oh, come on Felicia,

297
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:13,299
pretty girl like you, you must
have a lot of friends, right?

298
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,113
Hmm...
Got a boyfriend?

299
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:19,986
Are you interested detective?

300
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,678
Is that why you're
keeping me here?

301
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:24,920
Are you sweet on me?

302
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,724
Oh, I'll tell you Felicia
we'll both be a hell of a lot

303
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:31,141
sweeter with you if you just
started telling us the truth.

304
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:32,684
The only truth
you can tell someone

305
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,417
is the truth they're
willing to believe.

306
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:40,184
Oh... in that case,

307
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:48,798
you would be surprised at what
I would be willing to believe.

308
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:55,285
Right now, I believe you're not
quite as lonely as you make out.

309
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,755
You like animals, right?

310
00:16:56,755 --> 00:17:00,075
I work long hours, I don't
have time to take care of them.

311
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:01,390
Not even for a cat.

312
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,637
You would be surprised
at the size of the cats

313
00:17:05,637 --> 00:17:06,611
some people keep,

314
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,487
right in their own basement.

315
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,533
I wouldn't know.

316
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:26,653
<i>There we go.</i>

317
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:29,688
Bannock Farms,
Rural Route 5, Milton.

318
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,857
I'll head up there in the
morning and pay them a visit.

319
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:33,243
I don't know what
you'd learn from them.

320
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:34,913
I doubt she would have
consulted her people

321
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,447
before taking up
a life of crime.

322
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,161
Well, from what
I can tell here,

323
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:40,345
her 'people' are just
as hinky as she is.

324
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:43,279
I mean, outside of their
driver's licenses,

325
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,221
they don't have school records,
medical records, immunizations.

326
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:49,390
They've been totally off the
grid for their entire lives.

327
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,184
Neither do I, that
doesn't make me a killer.

328
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,538
Ha. Bad example.

329
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:56,321
Yeah, anyway's, I'm
going to head up there.

330
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,540
Sometimes the mystery
can be solved

331
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,838
by looking in
the back of the book.

332
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,111
Okay this is good.

333
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,157
Just pull around and
wait for me, okay?

334
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:14,668
Hi, can I talk to you?

335
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,063
Someone's here.

336
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,188
Hello, Mr. Bannock?

337
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,199
What do you want?

338
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,792
My name is Vicki Nelson.
I'm a private investigator.

339
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,840
I've got nothing
to say to any investigator.

340
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,624
You don't even know
why I'm here yet.

341
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:32,788
It's about your
daughter, Felicia.

342
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,096
My daughter's gone.

343
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:36,984
Your daughter has been
brought in for questioning

344
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:38,293
on suspicion of murder.

345
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:41,347
I have no idea
what she's up to.

346
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:44,866
I lost my son a year ago,
my daughter a month later.

347
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,450
Alright, well does your
son still say in contact

348
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,319
with your daughter?

349
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,058
My son is dead.

350
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,489
I'm very sorry.

351
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:56,314
Look please, you must know
something about her life

352
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,528
in the city, her friends,
her acquaintances.

353
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:01,093
I know nothing and
I don't want to know.

354
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,070
I warned her about leaving.

355
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,490
I warned her about the kind of
people she'd meet in the city.

356
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,464
Well, there are all kinds
of people in the city.

357
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:13,190
It's just there's not too
many that tear people apart.

358
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,718
They're not like us.

359
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,429
They're violent and corrupt.

360
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,204
I don't know whether or
not to be insulted by that.

361
00:19:21,204 --> 00:19:22,885
It's time for you to go.

362
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:24,639
Hey Mr. Bannock, your
daughter know anything

363
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,943
about wild animals?

364
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:32,891
Why do you ask that?

365
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,824
Well, because the person
Felicia's suspected of killing

366
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,491
was savaged by a wild animal.

367
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,913
Some kind of cat or something.

368
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,405
She knows animals.

369
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,537
Cows and horses.

370
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:47,687
Dogs and cats.

371
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:52,526
Right, well then Felicia
or someone she knows

372
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,303
must have kept a cat.

373
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,804
- She didn't hurt anybody! She wouldn't!
- Melissa!

374
00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:59,325
Enough.

375
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:10,784
She didn't understand
the virtue of discipline.

376
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,564
It's what I've tried
to teach these children.

377
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:18,505
It's all that separates
us from the animals.

378
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,263
Mr. Bannock,
if you know anything

379
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,617
that might help your
daughter, you should tell me.

380
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:24,152
There's nothing to tell.

381
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:28,104
Felicia had a choice
between good and evil.

382
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,561
She went toward
the darkness.

383
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,448
Not she's paying
the price for it.

384
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,806
Wow!

385
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:48,447
Miss Nelson, I want
you off my property.

386
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,287
<i>So now
all we need to do</i>

387
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,467
is find a reason why this
Felicia would kill a man.

388
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,537
Well it wasn't
a classic animal kill.

389
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:10,189
I mean, they take out the
throat; they bleed out the prey.

390
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,672
They don't decapitate them.

391
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,474
Well it wasn't done
out of instinct then.

392
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:15,339
It was done out of hate.

393
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,772
Which raises
the other question.

394
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:19,240
What about the eyes?

395
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,901
I mean, what do they say?
Demon?

396
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,928
It certainly doesn't
say cocktail waitress.

397
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,936
I've had my
experience with those.

398
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:27,887
But I have been reading
up on lycanthropy.

399
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:29,147
Werewolves?

400
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,958
Well, maybe not a wolf.

401
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,922
Shape shifters have been
linked to every animal

402
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:35,829
from bears to goats to
the South American Encantado.

403
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:37,751
It's a were-dolpin.

404
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm pretty sure
it wasn't a dolphin.

405
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,172
You know what?

406
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,293
The shape shifter
idea's not all bad.

407
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,649
- Oh, it's good.
- Why?

408
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:51,998
I've been stuck on my
villain for my new series.

409
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:54,835
Cellucci being shredded
by were-thingys,

410
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,155
now that, that gives me
new inspiration.

411
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,462
- Henry, stay with the program.
- Okay.

412
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,823
So let's say Felicia
is a shape shifter.

413
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,398
That would explain the ripped
up walls in her storage locker.

414
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:06,652
It would definitely explain why
there was a latch on the inside.

415
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:09,067
And you know what?
I think the father knew.

416
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:11,969
I mean, that's why he tried
to keep her at the farm.

417
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,335
When I brought up that the
murder had been committed

418
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:17,419
by some kind of cat,
he got all twitchy.

419
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,917
Even if he did,
I doubt he'd admit it,

420
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,007
even if it would clear
his daughter for murder.

421
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,208
Lycanthropy.

422
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:27,866
Mike's going to love this one.

423
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:29,260
This is
going nowhere.

424
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,608
- She'll break.
- I've been watching

425
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:33,305
for the last four hours.
She's ice cube cool.

426
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,687
Are we talking about
the same interrogation?

427
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,178
I'm under her skin.
You can see that.

428
00:22:36,178 --> 00:22:38,848
She hasn't said one
thing to implicate herself.

429
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:40,690
This is a non-starter.

430
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:42,685
So what are you saying?
That we let her go?

431
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:45,147
I saying you've had her
for the last 24 hours

432
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:46,701
and you still haven't
made your case.

433
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,249
The press are into this now,
I'm solidly in the cross hairs

434
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,174
and I need to find
Melville's killer now.

435
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:54,671
Okay, with all due
respect, we have the killer.

436
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,708
You have until the morning
and then you move on.

437
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,772
- Maybe she's right.
- Kate, you've seen her.

438
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:10,551
She's playing with us.
Am I wrong here?

439
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,466
She's angry.
If I was innocent and dragged in

440
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:16,345
for grilling, I might be too.
- I can't...

441
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,526
Mike, you're becoming obsessed.

442
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:21,852
You call it obsession,
I call it focus.

443
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,097
Besides, there's
more to it than that.

444
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:25,466
What?

445
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,816
We're supposed to be
working this together.

446
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:32,488
- We are, Kate, we are.
- Like hell we are.

447
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:35,017
You're doing what you
always do these days.

448
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:37,665
Cut me and the rest of the squad
out while you play mystery man.

449
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,665
Kate, you
wouldn't understand,

450
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:43,408
all right, you just
wouldn't understand.

451
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,298
I don't know if you're
insulting my intelligence

452
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,677
or my loyalty.
Either way,

453
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,201
thanks for the
vote of confidence.

454
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,693
Kate! Kate!

455
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,689
You always did have
a way with the ladies.

456
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,977
I've never had
any illusions.

457
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:03,093
Look where it got
me with you.

458
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,352
So, what have you found?

459
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,641
Well, I've been busy.

460
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:09,986
Yeah, did you find the cat?

461
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:13,402
Ah yeah, I think she
may be the cat.

462
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:15,707
Some kind of were-thingy.

463
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,337
A were-thingy?

464
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:22,668
I was trying not to get
all technical with you.

465
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,693
Listen, I found her family.
She has a father and sister

466
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:28,370
who live on a farm
north of the city.

467
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,800
She also had a brother,
died a year ago.

468
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,157
You think they're
involved in this?

469
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:33,362
In the murder, no.

470
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:35,794
They said she left the
farm about a year ago,

471
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:38,224
which I believe, but
I'm telling you with the father,

472
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,068
my alarm bells just went off.

473
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:42,027
I mean, he was
definitely controlling,

474
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:45,451
so much so that it
almost had a like a cult vibe.

475
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,500
So you think he
might be part of it?

476
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,735
I think he knows what she is.

477
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:52,772
He made references to her
being evil, a black sheep.

478
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:54,436
I think he was trying
to keep her under wraps

479
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:55,922
and she wouldn't
have any of it.

480
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:02,825
If she walks and she
is what you say she is,

481
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,754
who knows who she's
going to kill next.

482
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:08,128
I don't know.

483
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:11,577
I just keep thinking,
there's got to be a connection

484
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:12,662
between her and Melville.

485
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,238
Well it's nothing that
we've been able to discover.

486
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,217
He's old money;
she's a waitress.

487
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:19,646
We can't find anybody that
can place them together.

488
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:20,708
Will you let me
look into it?

489
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:24,023
Yeah, okay, thanks.
I figure I've got one more shot

490
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,991
with her before she
lawyers up and walks.

491
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,970
With what you've given me
here maybe I'll be able

492
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,244
to turn up the heat
a little bit.

493
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:32,387
- Well, good luck.
- Yeah, all right,

494
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:33,958
keep me in the loop.
- I will.

495
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:43,765
Vicki!

496
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:47,485
I take it Mike's got you
involved in this case?

497
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:50,201
Involved, wow, that
sounds so official.

498
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:52,525
We were just bouncing
ideas off each other.

499
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:55,427
He's hiding information from
his partners and sharing it

500
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:57,528
with people who spend half
their time off chasing...

501
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:00,836
Chasing?
Go ahead Kate.

502
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,666
Look, I know what
everyone says about me.

503
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,723
He's starting to believe
in the supernatural stuff.

504
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:08,820
He's starting to let
it colour his work.

505
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,259
You gave up your career but now
he's starting to screw up his.

506
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:17,211
If you cared anything about
him, you'd leave him alone.

507
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:22,123
Well, if you knew him,
at all, I mean, like I know him,

508
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,840
you would try trusting
his instincts.

509
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:03,237
<i>911 operator,
what is your emergency?</i>

510
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:10,645
I've got a problem, Felicia.

511
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:13,232
You asking for my sympathy?

512
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,668
I should say 'we'
have a problem

513
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:16,482
and it's going to take
both of us to fix it.

514
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:23,169
This has stopped being a game.

515
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,978
I've got some very heavy
hitters breathing down my neck.

516
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,817
And up to this point I have been
trying to come up with excuses

517
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,423
as to how you're
involved in this.

518
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:37,449
But from this point forward,
I'm going to have to hang

519
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,855
this whole crime
on your shoulders.

520
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,937
Hmm, you see,
I think if could do that,

521
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,999
you wouldn't be
wasting our time here.

522
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,224
You have nothing.

523
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:52,387
You're right.

524
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:54,585
You're absolutely right.

525
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:59,440
You know with you there
are no answers, right,

526
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,206
just questions.

527
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:05,331
You move to the city
a few months back,

528
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:08,109
you live like a monk,
you don't talk to anybody

529
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:11,196
except casual conversations
with your colleagues at work.

530
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:13,572
I'm happy keeping to myself.

531
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,277
Is that what your
father taught you?

532
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,268
Is your father a good man?
- Leave my father out of this.

533
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:22,744
Because I've gotta think that
your father would be very upset

534
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,615
to learn that you're hooked
up in this somehow.

535
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,662
I think he would be very
disappointed in you.

536
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:28,298
He has no other
way of operating.

537
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:31,121
My family affairs are
none of your business.

538
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:34,229
Yeah, all the same,

539
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:37,995
the more I think about
your father, the more

540
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:40,369
I think he's got to know
what's going on with you.

541
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:44,270
Maybe he's got himself
involved some how.

542
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,778
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

543
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:49,525
He can't even bring himself to
hate the people that hurt him.

544
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:50,720
But you're not
like that are you?

545
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,595
You're not like that at all.

546
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:54,299
I mean you would do
the right thing

547
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,724
if somebody did something
to you, am I right?

548
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:57,926
Depends on what they did.

549
00:28:57,926 --> 00:29:00,290
And it depends on what you
think the right thing is.

550
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,860
That is the
question isn't it?

551
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:08,716
Still I would just love
to go up to the farm

552
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:10,181
and have a chat
with your father.

553
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:12,270
Talk about cats;

554
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,264
see if he's seen any up
there around the farm.

555
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:18,331
Leave them out of it.
They're not involved.

556
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:19,572
Involved in what?

557
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:25,084
Felicia, the best way to keep
your family out of this

558
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:28,189
is to tell me the real story
and you got to do it right now.

559
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:29,968
You said I could
call for a lawyer.

560
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:30,782
I want one.

561
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,160
- Don't...
- Get me a lawyer now!

562
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:39,942
That's a mistake.

563
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:47,892
That's a mistake.

564
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,595
A call just came in from
a woman who reported seeing

565
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,834
a jaguar stalking her
outside her car.

566
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,039
You think it's the same one?

567
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:09,848
It's not like
there's a lot of them

568
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:11,126
wandering around
these parts.

569
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,846
I figure Felicia or
whoever killed Melville,

570
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,959
left the door open
when they left.

571
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:19,731
Crowley's already saying
the case is solved.

572
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:21,069
What?
What do you mean?

573
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,565
She's saying it's an animal
control issue, not a homicide.

574
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:28,086
Look, a jaguar did not
kill Patrick Melville.

575
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,364
Mike, you have to get
your head around this.

576
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:34,132
Felicia might not
have done it.

577
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,160
We may be barking
up the wrong tree

578
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,413
with this were-cat thing.

579
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:50,363
A woman just called in
a sighting of a jaguar.

580
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:52,497
Listen,
even if she's not the cat,

581
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,731
that doesn't mean that she's
not somehow controlling it.

582
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,932
Felicia just
asked for a lawyer.

583
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,570
If I don't come up with
something real quick,

584
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,186
she's going to be out of here
in a couple of hours.

585
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,272
Okay, just stall her.

586
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:03,779
We're on our way to
Melville's right now.

587
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,891
If I find anything,
I will call you, okay?

588
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:07,508
<i>- All right.
- Bye.</i>

589
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,954
What are we
looking for?

590
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,331
Anything that will
connect Melville to Felicia,

591
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:23,092
photos, contact information.

592
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:30,681
Henry, look at this.

593
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:34,190
This guy's got an entire library
devoted to shape shifters,

594
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,926
skin walkers and lycanthropy.

595
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:38,754
So he had an interest.

596
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:40,360
Are you suggesting
there's a connection?

597
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,300
That he had a were-cat fetish?

598
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,286
Not quite,

599
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,063
but I'm wondering
about you now.

600
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,494
Wow...

601
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,928
Oh my god, there's more?

602
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:12,562
Wolf, Tanzania.

603
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,290
Gazelle, Montana?

604
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:23,050
Wild boar of Greenland,
that doesn't make any sense.

605
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:30,498
Jaguar, Ontario.

606
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:36,487
I think I just realized what
happened to Felicia's brother.

607
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,664
You think her brother
was a shape shifter too.

608
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,434
You think they were
all shape shifters.

609
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:46,028
All human
and Melville knew it.

610
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:47,170
He found the ultimate thrill;

611
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,254
hunting humans and
getting away with it.

612
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:51,264
I need confirmation.
Felicia's father is hiding

613
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:53,696
something in that barn.
We need to find out what.

614
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:58,234
Ouch.

615
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,397
I can't believe
my client has been sitting here

616
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,591
for over 24 hours
without being charged.

617
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:05,334
That, in and of itself,
is worth taking action over.

618
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,023
She was offered
representation.

619
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:08,178
She declined.

620
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:10,401
Felicia Bannock did not
realize how easily

621
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:12,885
an innocent person
can be railroaded

622
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:14,924
by interested parties
looking to secure a conviction.

623
00:33:14,924 --> 00:33:16,971
There was no
witch-hunt going on here.

624
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:19,637
You're client was
identified in the area

625
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,395
and tried to run
when we talked to her.

626
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:23,931
People are
frightened of police.

627
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:26,808
Cops like you give
them good reason.

628
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:29,795
She has information
vital to a homicide.

629
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:30,862
My client says otherwise.

630
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:33,117
She is not walking
from this Mr. Pressman.

631
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,814
That's exactly what
she's going to do.

632
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:38,925
And with a formal apology,
now how sweetly

633
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,460
that apology is delivered
will help determine

634
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,698
how much we'll go for
in damages.

635
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,477
We'll start
the paper work.

636
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:46,324
Maybe you can join me
at my desk outside.

637
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,049
I'd love too.

638
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:50,581
I'm just going to
be right outside.

639
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,243
This isn't over,
Felicia.

640
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:02,766
It's not nearly over.

641
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,130
Oh yes it is.

642
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,831
Great!
Total darkness;

643
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:27,672
just the thing for a girl
with night blindness.

644
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:32,576
We're not alone.

645
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:38,481
Oh, that so
does not sound good.

646
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:18,690
Stop, Alyssa.
You don't want to do this.

647
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,216
Henry.

648
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:35,310
<i>What are
you doing here?</i>

649
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:39,349
It was you last
night, wasn't it?

650
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,033
Trying to take the
focus off your sister.

651
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,757
I shouldn't be
talking to you.

652
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:46,406
If you care about what
happens to her, you should.

653
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,976
We were at
Melville's house.

654
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:51,203
We know why your
sister went there.

655
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:52,613
Yeah, Melville
killed your brother.

656
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:54,125
He studied us.

657
00:35:55,428 --> 00:35:58,213
He knew what we were and
he killed him anyway.

658
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:00,456
You knew?
Your father too?

659
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:03,222
My father believes
that we should stay hidden;

660
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,723
that we can't take action

661
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,465
against those people
who hurt us.

662
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,453
Revenge is never
a wise course.

663
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:11,606
Melville was
a powerful man.

664
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,859
But where would my
brother get justice?

665
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:16,624
Where would the other
people Melville killed?

666
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:18,831
Felicia couldn't close
her eyes anymore.

667
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,340
But how did she know
it was Melville?

668
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,740
She was there that night.

669
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:27,136
Robert and Felicia
had chased a deer

670
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:28,329
in to the trees
by the lake.

671
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,052
Melville knew
where we hunted.

672
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:32,676
He was already there,
set up with his rifle.

673
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:37,948
He shot Robert
in the belly.

674
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:40,209
He didn't want
to take a head shot

675
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,064
and put him
out of his misery.

676
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:46,693
That would have
destroyed his trophy.

677
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,184
I am so sorry.

678
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:54,112
My father said that we
should forget Melville,

679
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,510
but Felicia couldn't.

680
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,782
How did she find him?

681
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,083
It took a while,

682
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:02,704
but believe it or not,
my people are good hunters.

683
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:05,134
Your 'people'?

684
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,272
We've lived
among you forever.

685
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:10,218
It used to be that we could
own our land and hunt freely.

686
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:13,963
Now there's less to hunt
and my brother proved

687
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:15,275
that we can become the prey.

688
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:18,700
Do you know what it's like to
have to hide your true nature?

689
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,931
Intimately.

690
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,612
We have to talk
to your father.

691
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:25,468
He won't
listen to you.

692
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:27,156
The only thing that is
important to him is staying

693
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:28,406
out of the world's
line of sight.

694
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:30,350
The cop who arrested
your sister is my friend.

695
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,577
He'll understand
about Melville.

696
00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:34,225
My sister is not a killer.

697
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:36,723
What she did
wouldn't change her.

698
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,491
But your father wouldn't
believe that, would he?

699
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:42,696
He would do anything
to keep our secret.

700
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:43,826
He's going to kill her.

701
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:49,293
Mike, it's me.
Look, I'm at the farm.

702
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,762
We just found out that
all of Felicia's family

703
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:55,040
are skin walkers.
Melville killed their brother.

704
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,424
Look, I need you to keep
Felicia at the station

705
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:59,412
for at least an hour okay,
just keep her there.

706
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:00,658
I will explain
everything later.

707
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,111
The father is on his way.

708
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:03,308
I think he's going
to try something.

709
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:06,078
Henry, we have to go.

710
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:16,214
- We'll be in touch, detective. 
- Oh, I can't wait.

711
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:19,986
Listen, I know what you
are and I don't care

712
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:21,419
what the hell you change
yourself in to.

713
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:22,752
I'm going to find out
what happened that night.

714
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:23,718
All right, that's enough, huh?

715
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,886
You think you know
what I am, but you don't.

716
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:28,475
You don't know who the sinner
was or who was sinned against.

717
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,484
I know that a man was killed

718
00:38:29,484 --> 00:38:30,879
and I'm going to find
out who did it.

719
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:33,967
You do that, detective, but
you should ask yourself first,

720
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:35,571
who's hunting who?

721
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,999
You've already abused my
client enough, detective,

722
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,748
don't make it any
worse on yourself.

723
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:42,203
Let's go.
Let's go!

724
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:53,093
Mike, we had to let her go.
We didn't have a case.

725
00:38:53,593 --> 00:38:55,569
If she did it,
we'll find a way to prove it.

726
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:57,278
Yeah, maybe.

727
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,613
<i>Mike, it's me.
We just found out...</i>

728
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:05,133
- Mike.
<i>... all of Felicia's</i>

729
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:07,284
<i>family are skin walkers.
Look, I need you to keep</i>

730
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,370
<i>Felicia at the station
for at least an hour okay,</i>

731
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,648
<i>just keep her there.
I will explain</i>

732
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,714
<i>everything later.
The father is on his way.</i>

733
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:14,113
<i>I think he's going
to try something.</i>

734
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:16,985
Where you going Mike?

735
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,110
Trying to stop somebody
from getting hurt.

736
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,641
We can't work like this.

737
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,141
When are you going
to let me in?

738
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:24,672
Kate, I will tell you
as soon as I can, all right?

739
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:26,815
You're going to
have to trust me.

740
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:29,441
I'll call you, okay.

741
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:04,643
Is this what you want,
Felicia?

742
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:07,481
You want to kill me?

743
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,655
You want me to kill you?

744
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:14,524
I just found out what Melville
did to your brother.

745
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,362
Get out of the way,
detective.

746
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:19,607
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her father.

747
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:20,977
Put the gun down.

748
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:25,037
I have a responsibility.
She killed a man.

749
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:26,807
And we both know
what that man did.

750
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,790
No one else has
to die this evening.

751
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:32,869
We can't
hide forever.

752
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:37,533
Melville knew what we were.
He would have told someone.

753
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:40,404
And how long before they would
have come to get all of us?

754
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:43,235
You gave in
to your base nature.

755
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,283
The evil within you.

756
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:49,200
It wasn't evil,
it's what we are.

757
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:52,091
He killed Robert.

758
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:55,009
Two sins don't make it right.

759
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,330
Neither would
killing your daughter.

760
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:00,512
Daddy.

761
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,936
Daddy, I did
what we had to do.

762
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:04,328
You know that.

763
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:07,499
I did what you didn't
have the strength to do.

764
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,987
What could I have done.

765
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:17,014
Who would have seen
justice done for my son?

766
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:19,003
Maybe three people
in the whole world.

767
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,499
And they are here in this
parking lot right now.

768
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,764
We're done.

769
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:36,036
Go on.
Take your daughter home.

770
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,706
Daddy.
Ohh...

771
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:44,367
Come on.

772
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,684
Go on.

773
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:56,149
Nice work.

774
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:58,839
See, you didn't need
our help after all.

775
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:00,920
You showed great
tolerance, detective.

776
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,957
Yeah, it was almost
sensitive.

777
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:03,752
Almost...

778
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:08,009
I'm now chasing
were-cats...

779
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:12,323
How did this happen,
Vicki? What am I doing?

780
00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:13,999
We're not quite sure.

781
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,731
But if you're still
working Animal Control,

782
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,965
I think a skunk got lose
in my underground garage.

783
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:20,812
Yup.

784
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:23,961
I hate him.
