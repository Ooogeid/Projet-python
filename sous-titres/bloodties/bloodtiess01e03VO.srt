1
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:18,555
I don't know whether
to drink this or use it

2
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:20,640
to take the rust off
my patio furniture.

3
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:21,720
It's tafia.

4
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,373
It's rum, anisette, molasses,

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,895
some African herbs
and a little tree frog.

6
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,734
It's a traditional drink
back home in New Orleans.

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,158
Oh, well, I'm not much
for tradition or tree frog.

8
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:37,302
Don't let this go to waste, big guy.

9
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,440
Listen, Angelique,
if you want to find your brother,

10
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,866
I would suggest starting with the cops.

11
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,233
At least that way you're not burning
through your savings.

12
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,199
No, no, I can't go to the police.

13
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:46,947
After the floods back home

14
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,415
everything was turned
upside down

15
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,057
and Royal lost his way.

16
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:53,408
Fell in with some men.

17
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:55,748
I think it was drugs.

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,554
He wasn't quite himself.

19
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:59,820
Well, listen, if I do get into this,

20
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,308
you have to be prepared for what
I might find out about him.

21
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,319
I understand.

22
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:07,254
All right.
My time is 500 a day, plus expenses.

23
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:10,708
I'll need a list of anyone
he might know in town,

24
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,315
your contact information,
and a recent photo of him.

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,943
My contact is in here and enough
for about a week of your time

26
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:20,371
and that's Royal.

27
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,114
He's a very beautiful boy.

28
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:24,475
He's my mother's pride and joy.

29
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:27,391
Don't worry, if he's in town,
I will find him.

30
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:31,430
The man who drew my brother into this,
his name is Henri Gregoire

31
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:33,260
and he's a very dangerous man.

32
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:35,776
Ah, I meet a lot of that type
in this line of work.

33
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,412
Run! Get out of here!

34
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,447
What? Hey, Angelique, wait!

35
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:51,572
Angelique! What the hell's going on?

36
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:52,733
Who was that?

37
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,015
Angelique! Run!

38
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,599
Run!

39
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,882
Somebody tell me there's a cement
mixer running and that

40
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,448
grinding is not my head.

41
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,888
No, that would be your head.

42
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,339
So, who is this guy?

43
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,444
Jean-Marc. I don't know his last name.

44
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,774
He was a friend of my client's.

45
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,907
I'm telling you, neither one of us could
slow down the guy that came after us

46
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,985
And who is this client and why
does somebody want them dead?

47
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,691
Her name's Angelique Jarou.

48
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,075
Do you have a contact for her?

49
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,333
Um... yeah, she gave me this number.
I haven't had any luck though.

50
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,362
She's looking for her brother, Royal.

51
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:14,049
He's gotten mixed up
with someone named Henri Gregoire.

52
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,310
Okay, I'll call it in and see
what I can find on him.

53
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:17,347
All right, thanks, Dave.

54
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,400
Okay, what else?

55
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,019
What do you mean, what else?

56
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:24,232
Since when does an unarmed
guy just walk away from you?

57
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,712
Well, this is where
it gets complicated.

58
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,330
Complicated.

59
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,578
Look, I was right up in this guy's face,
came wailing on him, there's nothing.

60
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,711
I mean he was making gargly noises,
but he's not breathing.

61
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:40,455
So...what?

62
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,482
You're saying that this guy isn't alive?
That kind of thing?

63
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:48,136
I guess I am. I mean
I don't really think the guy was alive.

64
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,036
- Vicki, don't do this.
- Don't do what?

65
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,074
Don't turn into a whack job, okay?

66
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:55,631
Sometimes the only way
I can get through my day

67
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,915
is knowing that there are
normal people out there, okay?

68
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,590
And until recely I considered you
one of them. You know what I'm saying.

69
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm telling you,
this guy was unstoppable.

70
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:04,358
Okay, it could be PCP,

71
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,299
- crystal meth, who knows?
- I saw him!

72
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,909
Vicki, it's pitch black!
You're half blind!

73
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,451
I said that last part our loud,
didn't I?

74
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,465
Look, I just...I

75
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:21,253
I don't want to hear that you're back
out there chasing vampires, okay?

76
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:22,367
It wasn't a vampire,

77
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,929
all right?
I don't know what it was.

78
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:26,993
Is Henry Fitzroy involved
in this somehow?

79
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:28,400
Henry has nothing to do with this.

80
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,791
Cause I tell you,
ever since you met him,

81
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,541
he's been putting
these crazy ideas in your head.

82
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,575
Since you've known me,

83
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,355
when has anyone put anything
in my head I didn't want there?

84
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,772
Okay, you say you're good.
You're good. I believe you.

85
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:40,792
You know what, Mike?

86
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,436
You know what I hate
more than the pity?

87
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,811
Is this macho over-protective crap.

88
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:46,741
I can take care of myself.

89
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,984
Garbage can, twelve o'clock.

90
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,120
I knew you wouldn't be able
to stay away.

91
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:25,998
You're one of those guys
who's just riddled

92
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:27,444
with nagging self-doubt, aren't you?

93
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:28,993
I have a fair opinion of myself.

94
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:31,527
And hundreds of years
of positive reinforcement.

95
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,046
Henry, I need your help.

96
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,426
Something happened to me tonight
and you may be the only person

97
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,863
who'd believe me.

98
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:44,095
It was...

99
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,112
supernatural.

100
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,329
And I should get involved because...?

101
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,627
Listen, you're the one
that dragged me into this world

102
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:52,973
of vampires, monsters and demons.

103
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,823
I don't have anyone else to go to.

104
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:02,078
Well, never let it be said that
Henry Fitzroy shirked a responsibility.

105
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,136
What happened?

106
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:09,077
I got attacked tonight by this guy or...

107
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,719
he used to be a guy.

108
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,264
Used to be?

109
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,844
Where do I start?
Gray skin, no pupils,

110
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,480
not breathing.

111
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,567
I was meeting with this client of mine,
from New Orleans,

112
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:25,250
she's looking for her lost brother.

113
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:28,822
This thing attacked us. It...

114
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,687
It killed her friend.

115
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,080
And it's still out there
looking for her.

116
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,411
The man who attacked you

117
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:38,313
His eyes were glazed over? He looked
like he wasn't in control of his body?

118
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:41,119
- I see you've met.
- He was a zombie.

119
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:42,960
A zombie.

120
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,319
As in eating brains in
the shopping mall zombie.

121
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,630
No, zombie like voodoo.

122
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:52,846
Dead bodies resurrected to carry out
the will of a powerful bokor.

123
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,500
You need to stay away from this, Vicki.

124
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,741
You're the second man
to say that to me tonight,

125
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,459
I wasn't crazy about it the first time.

126
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,819
What is the big deal? A big scary
vampire frightened of a little zombie?

127
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,032
You enjoy a familiarity with me

128
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,180
that very few people
in this world have known.

129
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,237
I am not to be taken lightly.

130
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:15,243
Do not forget who and what I am.

131
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,441
Yeah, that's unlikely.

132
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,192
Now, I will help you
if only to keep you alive.

133
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,889
The trick will be to locate
whoever created  the zombie

134
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,156
and break the connection.

135
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:32,837
And I promise you,

136
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,769
that will be a lot more difficult
than it sounds.

137
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:42,644
I don't usually show
my work before it's completed.

138
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:43,934
Call me superstious.

139
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,019
That seems to be
the name of the game lately.

140
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:48,998
It's beautiful.

141
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,496
What's it about?

142
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,420
Passion...

143
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:56,524
politics... Good and evil.

144
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,289
technology and magic... and a woman
in search of her own destiny.

145
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,609
Please.

146
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,140
Will you let me read it when it's done?

147
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:10,667
Well, maybe you can help me
come up with an ending.

148
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:14,257
Woman like Angelique can't hide.

149
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:15,860
How you hide a wildfire?

150
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:17,256
How you hide a mountain?

151
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:20,041
Our people are on the streets.
The girl can count her time in hours.

152
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,245
You know who she is!

153
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:23,362
You talk like a fool!

154
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,376
Her protection's gone.

155
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:27,663
Girl like that always has protection.

156
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:29,798
You think you chasin the lamb?

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,191
That's when you get gored.

158
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:35,522
You want to find her?

159
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:37,492
Wake up?

160
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,325
You tell them boys to look stronger.

161
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,671
Cause if they don't find her...

162
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:46,753
my babies's gonna find them.

163
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:53,767
I think one of them babies
just found you.

164
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,159
You tell the boys, Ti-Jon.

165
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,200
Find the girl...

166
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,754
or the babies find them!

167
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,830
You asked for vood
in 100 words or less?

168
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,047
I've got a ton of stuff on curses,

169
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,067
sympathetic magic,
voodoo dolls, zombies.

170
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,996
Is there anything on how to stop them?

171
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:33,885
I'm still reading but it looks like
they're pretty unstoppable.

172
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,439
Yeah, I was kind of getting that.

173
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,875
Why isn't it like the movies where
you just have to bash their brains in.

174
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:41,467
Don't trust the movies.
Look what they did to vampires.

175
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,572
Oh, yeah, right.

176
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:44,461
I've got something else, too.

177
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,811
I was looking at the pictures you took
of the guy who got killed in the alley.

178
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,970
Something was bugging me
about his tattoos and then it hit me.

179
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,582
They were in a book.

180
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:54,846
- What are they, gang related?
- They're veve.

181
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,772
Voodoo symbols marking
allegiance to certain gods.

182
00:09:58,012 --> 00:09:59,643
Kind of like access codes.

183
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:01,250
They're for power and protection.

184
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,970
Well, it looks like
they didn't give him much of either.

185
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,493
This is not something we want
to involve ourselves in, Vicki.

186
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,578
You know what? I got a client out there
with killer zombies on her ass.

187
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,021
I'm not going to bail on her.

188
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:15,478
You coming?

189
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:35,516
Hi.

190
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,029
What do you drink?

191
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:40,490
I'll have a beer, and him?
You don't want to know.

192
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:41,979
You don't want to know.

193
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,794
You remember me from earlier, right?

194
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:46,198
Maybe. A lot of people come in here.

195
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,826
Yeah, but a lot of people don't come
and talk to Angelique.

196
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,594
Can't say I rember
her, either.

197
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,491
You sure treated her
like she was someone special.

198
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,946
I treat all customers that way.

199
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,130
That's how we do business.

200
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:59,179
Then it must not matter to you that
the man she was with is dead,

201
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,670
or that she was almost killed.

202
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,251
Ah, now that got your attention,
didn't it?

203
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:06,536
I'd like to give this a shot.

204
00:11:06,962 --> 00:11:08,181
I've got this under control.

205
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,462
Trust me, I can make him talk.

206
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:11,807
Knock yourself out.

207
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,328
Where is she?

208
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,490
You know what? That's an excellent try,

209
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,435
but you might want
to ramp it back a notch.

210
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:33,054
Everybody, sorry. No harm, no foul,
just a little misunderstanding.

211
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:36,825
You know what?
You see that girl,

212
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,098
you give me a call.

213
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,265
How many times do I have to tell you?

214
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,294
Don't bite the bartender.

215
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:46,062
I was only playing.

216
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,038
Trust me, he would have talked.

217
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,998
Yeah, but we would have been busy
getting our asses kicked to hear him.

218
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,152
'Our' asses?

219
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:01,491
Trust me.
My way is a whole lot neater.

220
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,661
And what exactly is your way?

221
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,826
Um...we wait for him
to lead us right to her.

222
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:07,549
Arret!

223
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,115
Please.

224
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:14,288
Henry

225
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:15,461
No more killing.

226
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,748
I didn't expect to see you again.

227
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,032
I was sure you'd been scared off
by what you'd seen already.

228
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,343
I suppose

229
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:31,765
at least I should tell you
the truth, huh?

230
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:32,987
That would be a start.

231
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,061
Voodoo has been
in our home for generations.

232
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,251
Our mother was a mambo
our father a houngan, a...

233
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:40,917
a priest and priestess.

234
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,761
Royal and I were supposed
o follow in their footsteps.

235
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:46,036
Tough to get kids into
the family business these days.

236
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,324
We saw things that no child
should have to see.

237
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,382
Angels and gods

238
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:53,094
possessing their followers.

239
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:55,135
Possessing our parents.

240
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,192
We saw what it did to them.

241
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,326
It sucked their life away.

242
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:02,385
They died when we were
still small children.

243
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:03,889
How did they die?

244
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,345
They were murdered by
a follower of the secta rouge,

245
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,581
the dark side of our religion.

246
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:13,112
My brother and I, we came home
from school one day and found them

247
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,084
nailed to the wall,

248
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,874
gutted as a sacrifice.

249
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:21,892
Royal and I, we ran away,

250
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,597
determined to keep ourselves
apart from that world.

251
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,268
And then he disappeared.

252
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,523
I dreamt him in a vision.

253
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,983
He was in a dark place,
crawling with snakes and spiders.

254
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,237
And when he opened
his mouth to call for me,

255
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,557
it was a window to hell.

256
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,999
And now, my religion...

257
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:47,706
might be the only protection
I have that I can rely on.

258
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,187
Not the only thing.

259
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:50,938
We'll protect you.

260
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:53,032
And we'll help you find your brother.

261
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,712
Vicki, a word, please.

262
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,359
You don't know what you're promising.

263
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,879
Keeping that girl alive is one thing,
but going up against a powerful Voudoun

264
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,777
- is suicide.
- She needs our help.

265
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,086
- She almost got you killed.
- That's not her fault.

266
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,870
- You going to keep doing this?
- What?

267
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,967
Coming up with an answer
for everything I say.

268
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,607
Only if you keep saying things.

269
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,003
This is a world
you know nothing about.

270
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,806
Then tell me.

271
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,110
I want you to come with us.

272
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:25,244
I think you'd be safer
at my office than here, okay?

273
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:26,653
Thank you Vicki.

274
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,559
Thank me once we find your brother.

275
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:50,206
Okay, I have been reading up
on this stuff for like, hours now

276
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,783
and I never expected
to talk to a real life mambo.

277
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,553
So now that you're here,
you've got to tell me

278
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,808
how to do some of this stuff...

279
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,429
Curses, soul traveling

280
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,250
attracting money.

281
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,325
The spirits are not to be toyed with,

282
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:02,860
and nothing comes for free.

283
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,226
The gifts you ask carry a heavy price.

284
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,455
Why do people always say that?

285
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,854
Because some of them have paid,

286
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,620
and some of them are still paying.

287
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:14,719
All right, we've got some things to do.
Do you mind staying here with Angelique?

288
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,700
Absolutely, we should have
a million things to talk about.

289
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,551
- Hey.
- Hey, Vick. Surprise, surprise.

290
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:26,607
I see you brought
your cartoonist friend.

291
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,212
Detective C elluci.

292
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,203
And what I create are graphic novels.

293
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,757
Yeah, if I were a cartoonist,
I'd call them that, too.

294
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,980
Did you find anything
on that name I gave you?

295
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:40,871
There is no Henri Gregoire
in vi-cap or vi-class databases,

296
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:44,327
nothing in DMV,
property registry or tax filings.

297
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,937
I have a feeling that your friend
doesn't exactly take out an ad

298
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:47,961
when he comes to town.

299
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:50,379
Perhaps it might take some real
detective work.

300
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,953
Oh, is that where you come in, sport?

301
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,962
- Someone will have to.
- I see.

302
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,121
Yeah, you know what?
I have a client out there

303
00:16:57,122 --> 00:17:00,117
being chased by a killer zombie,
so maybe we could just focus on that

304
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,714
for, I don't know, a minute!

305
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:03,832
Of course.

306
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:28,402
It's open. Would you say
that's a good thing or a bad thing?

307
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,745
I'd say very bad.

308
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,061
Hello.

309
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,014
Hello?

310
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:42,277
Oh, jeez.

311
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:44,729
He's dead.

312
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:48,027
And whatever he knew about those guys
we're looking for, it's gone.

313
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,898
And whoever killed him isn't.

314
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:53,980
Is anyone there?

315
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:31,108
Let's go!

316
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:37,729
Say it.

317
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,672
I didn't take this seriously enough.

318
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,090
It almost staked you.

319
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,632
You're in a new world.

320
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,388
It's hard to comprehend
the dangers unless

321
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,624
you've seen them
with your own eyes.

322
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,141
That thing's unstoppable.

323
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,488
It's just a puppet.

324
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,887
It's the person who created it
we have to stop.

325
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,999
Yeah, well I hope he responds
better to a beating.

326
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,330
Do you really have a death wish?

327
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:56,774
Okay, this is not
about you hating magic.

328
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,267
Are you going to tell me, or what?

329
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,712
Come on, I'm all ears.

330
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,244
In the '20s I visited Haiti

331
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,803
with a woman I met in Paris,

332
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:12,254
with a woman
I met in Paris,

333
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:18,073
She was...

334
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,946
keen to experience
the world and everything in it.

335
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:23,744
She'd heard of a...

336
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,805
a voodoo ceremony
taking place and insisted we go.

337
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:29,589
I was so full of my own power
I was sure we'd be safe.

338
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,882
When we got there
it was like the crowd was electrified.

339
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:37,924
People dancing,

340
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:39,615
drinking,

341
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:41,835
calling to the spirits,

342
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,744
asking them to take over
their bodies and live through them.

343
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:50,951
I got so wound up in it,
I didn't even notice she was gone.

344
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:53,458
What happened?

345
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,859
I finally found her
at the head of the crowd,

346
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,517
lying on an altar,

347
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,273
her clothes ripped and bloodied.

348
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,437
There was a priest
standing over her with a knife.

349
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,711
I tried to get to her through the crowd

350
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:13,528
but I couldn't get to her
before he completed the sacrifice.

351
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,732
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:20,225
There were two zombies holding me

353
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:21,755
like the thing we saw tonight.

354
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:26,961
The priest said that he knew what I was.

355
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:30,320
He said that we'd greet the dawn
together, him, me and Sandrine.

356
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:32,142
I thought you said he killed her.

357
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:33,606
He did.

358
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,570
And then he made me watch
as he brought her back.

359
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:42,523
It took the rest of the night.
And when she finally arose,

360
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,608
it wasn't Sandrine that stood before me,

361
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,747
it was one of them.

362
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,263
No, she wanted to go

363
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:52,564
You couldn't have known.

364
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:53,775
Now I do.

365
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:58,171
And I'm not let that happen to you.

366
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:12,600
Just in time Vick, I almost
gave up on our dinner date.

367
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,891
Yeah, that's the thing, Mike.
I think I'm going to have to cancel.

368
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:16,365
This case is getting really hairy.

369
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,330
Sorry.

370
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:21,475
Did you find anything out on Gregoire?

371
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,118
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,239
Turns out this guy runs
a hoodoo voodoo freak show.

373
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,761
Calls himself Papa Samedi

374
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,860
That would be the guy.

375
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:33,089
Yeah, he's got a place in
the old McMillan building on King West.

376
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,169
He offers healings, love filters,

377
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,821
curses, to the people
that can find him at least.

378
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:38,787
I'll tell you, this is not an easy guy
to do a work-up on.

379
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:40,544
Not many people willing
to talk about him.

380
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:41,587
I think I know why.

381
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:43,804
All right, your turn.
You tell me

382
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:46,290
how do I connect that guy
to the body I've got in the morgue?

383
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,682
And don't tell me this is
where it gets complicated.

384
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:51,739
Okay, if I told you that

385
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,612
Samedi created a zombie

386
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:56,100
that killed my client's friend,
would you believe me?

387
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,556
Not in a million years, no.

388
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:58,960
Well, that being said,

389
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,755
it's complicated.

390
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,172
Vicki, why do you keep
shutting me out of these things?

391
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,012
What is going on?

392
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,326
You're the one banging your
head against an open door.

393
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,840
Your friend, Henry, does
he believe in all this crap?

394
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,741
Believe it or not, he wants me off
this case even more than you do.

395
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,352
He has no problem supporting
your trip to fantasyland, does he?

396
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:15,985
In fact, he's driving the bus, isn't he?

397
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,959
Mike, this is not about Henry.

398
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:23,780
I know you think I'm going nuts.
Maybe I am.

399
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:26,298
But I still feel like
I'm thinking straight.

400
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,350
It's like the more I lose my vision,

401
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,341
the more clearly I'm seeing the world,

402
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:34,641
and there is a whole other side
to it that I was completely missing.

403
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:39,496
It's scary and it's exciting
and it's real,

404
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,204
and I know you don't believe me.

405
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:43,932
A month ago I wouldn't have either.

406
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,501
I'm just asking you to sit tight.

407
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:50,806
Okay? I will share whatever
I find out with you

408
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:52,337
and you can take it or leave it.

409
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:54,422
It's the best I can do.

410
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:05,916
Hey, Dave,

411
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,277
I need you to do me a favor, okay?

412
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,333
Run a records check on
this Henry Fitzroy.

413
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:12,920
He's some kind of comic book writer.

414
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,808
You think he's got something
to do with the homicide?

415
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,974
Well, even if he isn't,
Vicki's bringing him into it,

416
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,021
so let's do it.

417
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,160
So, this is about the case
or about Vicki?

418
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:23,751
- Why? What are you getting at?
- Nothing,

419
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,343
I'm certainly not suggesting
that you're...

420
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:28,688
asking me to run a guy just because
he's getting on your woman.

421
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:30,284
Do you think that's what this is about?

422
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,675
No, no, I mean...

423
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,815
mean just because she canceled
her dinner date with you to

424
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:36,005
spend quality time running around--

425
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:37,911
They're not running around,
Dave, it's a case.

426
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,301
It's as simple as that, okay?

427
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,243
You know, that's what
I told one of my wives,

428
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:43,310
not sure if it was number two
or number three.

429
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,543
Yeah, well, thank you for that, Dave,
because if something was,

430
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,421
you know, on my mind, it would put
my mind completely at ease thanks a lot.

431
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:50,300
Oh, hey, I'm here for you, brother.

432
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:52,413
- Yeah, I can see that!
- You know what I'm saying?

433
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,781
Mike said that
Papa Samedi is working out

434
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:06,847
of the McMillan building on King West.

435
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:08,406
Did they find Royal?
Is he with them?

436
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,537
Oh, they don't know.
But until we have concrete

437
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,827
proof of a link between him
and Jean-Marc's death,

438
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:13,993
we're on our own.

439
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,255
It's kind of romantic, isn't it?

440
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:18,191
Nobody believing us,

441
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,839
plumbing the deep horizons
of experience,

442
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,243
having to search out
the truth all on our own.

443
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,736
Well, me accurately,

444
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:28,817
you'll be here, searching out
dinner for you and Angelique.

445
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:32,859
- I should be with you.
- What? No, no, no.

446
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,089
If this guy's looking for you,
I'm not going to lead you to him.

447
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:38,004
You're safer here.

448
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,856
Henry and I will be fine.

449
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:42,278
It's for your protection, huh.

450
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:44,428
Hopefully you won't need it.

451
00:24:46,062 --> 00:24:47,069
Thanks.

452
00:24:48,993 --> 00:24:50,008
Angelique,

453
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:53,341
I think I still need a little help
with my love juju.

454
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:54,413
<i>Comment?'</i>

455
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:56,564
Say I was trying to attract a man,

456
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,310
much older than myself,

457
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,775
but who doesn't look it.

458
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:01,691
Who's incredibly attractive,

459
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:03,326
a real night owl.

460
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,611
Would I be better off
using aloes or acacia?

461
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:09,777
Maybe I should just use both.

462
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:13,386
Actually,

463
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,982
maybe we should start again
from scratch.

464
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:19,479
Okay.

465
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:44,462
<i>You come to kill me, Nightwalker...</i>

466
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:47,326
<i>You've got be way more quiet.</i>

467
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,969
<i>I hear you thinking.</i>

468
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:50,166
We're not here to kill you.

469
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,945
<i>You're too late for dinner,
too early for breakfast.</i>

470
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:55,197
<i>What you here for then?</i>

471
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,960
You tried to kill my client, Angelique.

472
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:58,275
We want her brother back.

473
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:01,674
<i>You working for the zombie queen?</i>

474
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,727
<i>Man, you're already sewed up
tight in the devil's pocket.</i>

475
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,887
Enough games! Show yourself!

476
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,367
You don't even know, do you?

477
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,795
That woman been hunting me a long time.

478
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,104
- You took her brother.
- Somebody had to.

479
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:20,057
The two of them was
the family from hell.

480
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:22,659
Some serve <i>avec deux mains</i>,

481
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,781
serve with two hands.

482
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,706
Them two only served the dark.

483
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,533
They bring a lot of people
to hell with them.

484
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,459
That's why I take the brother...

485
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:35,074
Bring him here after the floods
wash open my hiding place.

486
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,792
So you killed him, too.

487
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,651
I helped him along the path.

488
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:46,693
His bones are hidden
in the cemetery but his soul,

489
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:49,644
it stays with me.

490
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:54,207
Without him, the crone's not so strong.

491
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:56,451
Crone? She's what, twenty-five?

492
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,723
Looks are deceiving, girl.

493
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:05,352
You know how Angelique
and her brother keep looking so young

494
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,647
is a long chain of dead children give up

495
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:10,567
their lives for her to look so good.

496
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:14,448
A lot of those young spirits
were children of my flock.

497
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,676
You're saying she killed
children to stay alive.

498
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:21,731
Angelique cut their innocent
hearts out and fed on them

499
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:23,330
while they were still beating.

500
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,981
When the floodwaters
washed their bodies up

501
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,635
they called out to me.

502
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,660
Them children not gonna rest
until that witch is dead.

503
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:36,810
Why should we believe you?

504
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,668
You've got no choice, <i>mon ami</i>.

505
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:42,555
The moon and stars
feel right tomorrow night

506
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,846
for burying cemetery
to give up his dead.

507
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:50,706
Angelique want to bring that
black soul brother back to earth.

508
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:53,178
If she gets him back,

509
00:27:54,202 --> 00:27:57,329
children start dying in this place, too.

510
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:00,683
Disappearing.

511
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:10,270
Maybe we should wait for Vicki,

512
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:12,082
order some food like she said.

513
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:17,275
I don't really need a love juju,

514
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:20,503
- there's always online dating.
- Shut up!

515
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,880
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

516
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:47,809
Why, you think
I care about you believing?

517
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,321
You're not strong enough to stop me,

518
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,295
and I'm plenty strong
to push you down.

519
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:06,865
I underestimate that old girl.

520
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,738
I think she sent you here to talk,

521
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:13,664
but she sent you in wearing a bandeau.

522
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,002
What?

523
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,429
Oh, jeez...!

524
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:22,174
You walk in bold as brass
to eat my soul.

525
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,395
You have to tell us
where Royal is buried.

526
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,292
Okay? What cemetery?

527
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:36,245
The amulet!

528
00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:39,476
Don't let her have it!

529
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,096
She played us.

530
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,018
And we delivered her right
to Papa Samedi and the amulet.

531
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:54,070
Oh God, she's got Coreen.

532
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:03,676
Oh, Coreen! Thank god you're okay.

533
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:07,218
- Henry! Her mouth!
- Coreen!

534
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:10,467
You were a big help,
Miss Vicki Nelson.

535
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:14,175
I knew you and your undead friend
would get me everything I needed.

536
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:16,440
You've given me a gift,

537
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,337
and now I give you one.

538
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,845
You know what? I think we're both
a little old to play with dolls.

539
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,470
I squeeze too hard...
Who knows what will happen?

540
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:27,053
You and this doll have a lot in common.

541
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,757
The hair came right from your brush.

542
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:31,603
And you see this?

543
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,453
She's a grave bug.

544
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:35,782
My bug is very hungry.

545
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,143
And she gets hungrier.

546
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:38,899
I tell her to eat...

547
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,622
Vicki dies.

548
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,501
- What do you want?
- I want the amulet.

549
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:46,989
I want my brother's soul.

550
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:48,666
You know we can't give you that.

551
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:49,874
I can wait one more night.

552
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:52,748
Can you?

553
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:05,596
Vicki?

554
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:07,483
Vicki?

555
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:14,558
She took my mouth away.

556
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:17,365
Oh, I'd love to learn
that trick sometime.

557
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:21,422
Do you have to wise crack
even when you're dying?

558
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,118
I'm not dying. Yet.

559
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,447
Henry, do something.
She needs help.

560
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:29,700
We can't exactly take her to a hospital
and ask for a voodoo curse specialist.

561
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:31,885
The only thing we can do
is get the doll back,

562
00:31:31,894 --> 00:31:34,270
before she makes her next move.
Now, it's almost daylight,

563
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:36,425
and I've got to go.

564
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:38,605
You can't just leave her like this.

565
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:40,624
Coreen, you have to be strong.

566
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:43,178
Keep her comfortable
until I get back, okay?

567
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:45,103
Comfortable?

568
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:52,345
I screwed up trusting her, huh?

569
00:31:53,826 --> 00:31:55,038
I should have listened to you.

570
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,160
You only do it one way.

571
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:03,272
I have to stop her, Henry.

572
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:07,835
I just keep thinking about the parents.

573
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,098
You know?

574
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:14,015
Finding their kids bodies and realizing

575
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,602
how they suffered and died.

576
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:20,409
If she gets her brother back,

577
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,540
how many more families are
Royal and Angelique gonna destroy?

578
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,234
Do what you can,

579
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:29,668
to find the cemetery
Royal is hidden in.

580
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:31,931
Wait for me until I get back, okay?

581
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:33,912
Yeah, I'll think about it.

582
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:39,580
Keep her here.

583
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,059
Sit on her if you have to.

584
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:48,183
I need you to do something for me, okay?

585
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,343
Papa Samedi said that,

586
00:32:50,606 --> 00:32:52,362
he sent the brother's remains up here

587
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:54,531
after Katrina hit New Orleans,

588
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:58,743
so I need you to check
all the cemeteries in the downtown core.

589
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:00,826
I need the name of anyone...

590
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,694
who was...

591
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:05,361
shipped up here after the hurricane,

592
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,253
probably interred without a ceremony.

593
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,217
Right.

594
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,095
Are you sure you're okay?

595
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,329
Yeah, I'll be fine. Just go, okay?

596
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,932
Vicki, I got something.

597
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,876
Oh, say it's a quick death.

598
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,063
I called every cemetery in town.

599
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:50,427
At first I thought it was going
to be a total bust.

600
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,175
But then the guy at Mount Pleasant

601
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,188
said someone came in,
bought a crypt there eleven months ago.

602
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,540
The guy who bought it,

603
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:59,010
paid cash and gave the name, Damballah.

604
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:01,258
That's the sky serpent spirit in voodoo.

605
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,486
Remind me never to make fun
of your supernatural obsessions again.

606
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:12,096
Vicki Nelson investigations.

607
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,515
It's Mike.

608
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:20,957
- Hi, Mike.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

609
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,524
In the office, why?

610
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:26,200
I've got two more bodies racked up
connected to your case.

611
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,166
A guy from the bar where you met
your client and Gregoire,

612
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,775
the guy whose address I gave you.

613
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,876
Don't look at me, I didn't kill 'em.

614
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:34,481
Yeah, but you know
something about who did.

615
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:36,674
Well, to tell you the truth,

616
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:38,082
it was my client.

617
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,409
What, that young, innocent thing
looking for her brother?

618
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,476
Yeah, try voodoo witch trying
to resurrect her dead brother

619
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:46,358
<i>so they can go on a killing spree
at your local elementary school.</i>

620
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:50,699
Are you still there?

621
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:52,389
Yeah, I'm here
and I don't know why, Vicki.

622
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,619
- Listen, I need to see you.
- <i>Yeah, I can't right now,</i>

623
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,558
I'm kind of battling
a bit of a stomach bug.

624
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,109
- I'll call you later, though.
- <i>No, not later.</i>

625
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,397
Vicki, I need to talk..

626
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,810
We did that search on
that Fitzroy guy you asked for.

627
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,830
Guy leaves less footprints
than a cat on concrete.

628
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:14,919
Squeaky-clean driving record,

629
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,173
perfect credit rating,

630
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:18,820
no previous address
or employment record.

631
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:20,439
It's like the guy just started one day.

632
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,961
Why does this not surprise me?

633
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,001
Should we roust him a bit?
See what he's got to say for himself?

634
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:27,605
No, no, put a pin in it for now, okay?

635
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,370
All right. Thanks.

636
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:32,216
Where are you going?

637
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,075
I can't wait for Henry.

638
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,179
I gotta find Royal's body
before Angelique does.

639
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:42,598
Don't do this, Vicki.

640
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,961
Vicki Nelson investigations.

641
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:28,322
Coreen, it's me. How is she?

642
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:31,533
Henry, she didn't listen.
<i>She took off, out to the cemetery.</i>

643
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:33,487
The lamb to the slaughter.
<i>Which cemetery?</i>

644
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:34,970
Mount Pleasant.

645
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:37,019
Okay, I'm on my way.

646
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:39,156
If she calls, tell her to wait for me.

647
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,418
Hey, one more thing.

648
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,366
One of my books says something
about zombies. You can use salt.

649
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,231
I don't want to season them,
Coreen, I'd like to kill them.

650
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,950
<i>The book says that if they taste salt,</i>

651
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:50,006
<i>it's supposed to remind
them of their mortality.</i>

652
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:51,771
- <i>They'll return to the grave.</i>
- Coreen,

653
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:53,430
you can't believe
everything you read.

654
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:55,725
Now if Vicki calls,
tell her to wait for me, okay?

655
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,363
All right.

656
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:58,658
Bye.

657
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:07,736
Salt! Salt!

658
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,404
I was wondering
when you would get here.

659
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,935
How did you find this? I thought
you didn't know where Royal was.

660
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:08,372
I knew where the body was.
I just needed someone to breech

661
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,199
Samedi's defenses
so I could get to him.

662
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:16,023
You still don't have the amulet!

663
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,074
It's coming.

664
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:20,107
We both know that.

665
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,611
Bring him to me.

666
00:38:47,852 --> 00:38:48,931
I don't think so!

667
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,687
Let her go or I destroy this!

668
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:08,520
Hello, my Royal.
Hello, my brother.

669
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,900
I'm gonna bring you
back real soon now,

670
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:13,723
and as for you,

671
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,577
you get to see this foolish
girl help bring him back.

672
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:22,785
- Vicki!
- See my sacrifice.

673
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:25,612
See this woman's life who I trade!

674
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,574
Come to me now!

675
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,355
This...

676
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:33,191
...is for your worms.

677
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:37,820
My brother for the light.

678
00:39:41,355 --> 00:39:42,406
You missed.

679
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:44,125
But I won't.

680
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:46,538
Who says I missed?

681
00:40:04,462 --> 00:40:05,494
Come on! Let's go!

682
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:06,894
Come on!

683
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:16,881
You okay?

684
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,007
Destroying the soul amulet

685
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,934
uined the ceremony
and angered the god.

686
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:25,915
Yeah? Well remind me not to do that.

687
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,127
Would it do any good?

688
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,955
No, but you could just keep trying.

689
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:33,823
You might want it as a souvenir.

690
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:38,060
You know, I stopped playing
with dolls a long time ago, but...

691
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:39,919
as for voodoo...

692
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:43,910
Hey, I think we've had enough
of that in our lifetime,

693
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,071
maybe two.

694
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:55,982
Thank you, Henry.

695
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:58,851
And, um...

696
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:01,245
take care of that.

697
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,030
What took you so long?

698
00:41:25,727 --> 00:41:26,964
How did you know it was me?

699
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:29,464
Well, it's like the guy
in the comic books,

700
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:32,093
the more you lose your sight,
the sharper your other senses get.

701
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:37,222
Well, that or I would have been
here an hour ago if I was you.

702
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:40,259
Want to hear what I found
in Mount Pleasant Cemetery?

703
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:41,647
Oh, I'm all ears

704
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:45,093
Two old corpses in an open casket,
one in fresh clothes.

705
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:47,262
The other the body
of your client's friend

706
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:49,966
who magically jumped out of
the city morgue on his own.

707
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:53,867
Well, at least he was walking
in the right direction.

708
00:41:55,755 --> 00:41:56,938
You were there, weren't you?

709
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:00,046
You don't want to know that, Mike,

710
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:01,914
even if you think you do.

711
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,482
Vicki, Vicki.

712
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,369
Come on, what's next, huh?

713
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,579
Goblins in the subway,
Bigfoot in the shopping mall,

714
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,682
that kind of thing?

715
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,792
What's next is lunch.

716
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:19,676
Come on, I'm buying, big guy.

717
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:31,553
