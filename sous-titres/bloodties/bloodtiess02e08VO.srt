1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
?????

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,300
????

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,900
???

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
????

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
????

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,200
So, unless you want to tell me
where you put the head,

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,800
I don't know what else
there is to say.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,900
I never killed that girl.
>> Right.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,000
Then confessing probably
wasn't a good idea.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
There's more to it.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,100
Look, if you want to appeal
your case you should call your lawyer.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,800
I think you're the only one
who might be able to handle this now.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm not a cop any more.
>> I know.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
I saw your ad in the newspaper.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
"No case too strange."

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,300
It's funny how things
fall into place.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
I'll be a minute.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,700
'funny' is not exactly
the word I'd use.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm psychic.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
I'm lactose intolerant.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,400
Listen, I confessed because
I wasn't able to tell the difference between

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
my own
thoughts and my visions.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
I saw her get killed,
but I wasn't there.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
It wasn't me.
I know that now.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
How can you be so sure?

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,600
The voice in my head,

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
it stopped when I went to jail.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,300
A few days ago it came back.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
But this time
I know it's not mine.

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,500
Inner voices have
never been my specialty.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Listen, you don't understand!

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
The killer is going
to strike again!

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,100
He's already picked
his next victim!

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:xxy¡¢lanmao¡¢QQ
Sync:FRM@mywsz</font>

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
blood ties 208

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,500
You don't understand!

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,100
The killer is going
to strike again!

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,900
He's already picked
his next victim.

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,200
Who is she?

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
I don't know.

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,100
She'll be pretty.
She'll be young.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
It hasn't happened yet.

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't see it,
I can only feel...

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,000
Boy, Perkins knew
who to pick, didn't he?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
He's talking
about a murder, Mike.

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Are you going to ignore that?
>> No. No.

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,100
It's the psychic ramblings
of a convicted killer that I'm going to ignore.

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,200
Whoever he is,

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
he says there's going
to be another murder.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,300
Actually that one falls
under 'homicides that haven't happened yet'.

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,900
The Pre-Crime Division is down the hall if you're interested.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,300
You know, he was saying
that the place was familiar.

54
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
That you're going
to recognize it.

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,800
Maybe it's something
from the first case...

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Ha! Vicki!

57
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,000
For all we know he could be
orchestrating this whole thing from the inside

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,300
 to make himself look innocent.

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,000
You know, working with someone
on the outside to create some kind of copycat killer situation.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,100
Look, I still
have all my notes.

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,600
You can pull the files.
I mean we know this thing by heart.

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,200
Vicki, no.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,200
We're not going to start opening up every case we've ever solved trying
to pin it on the boogeyman.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,900
The boogeyman?
This isn't his MO.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,300
Listen, I seem to know
a certain homicide detective

66
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,900
who's had several run-ins
with the boogeyman lately.

67
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,100
All right.
I accept it when it's the truth.

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,200
You're starting to make it your
default explanation for every case that comes your way.

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Big difference.

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,400
No, no, no, no.
Look, Sherlock Holmes,

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
"When you eliminate all other
possibilities, whatever remains,

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
however improbable,
is probably the answer."

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
Okay, how about
Occam's Razor,

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,200
"The simplest solution
tends to be the right one."

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,900
It's a copycat killer.

76
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,100
Whether this is
a copycat killer,

77
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
or he's orchestrating
it from prison,

78
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,700
or he's psychic,
if another girl dies,

79
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,000
they'll come crying to me.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,100
The suspect...
pulled a sob...from his ulcer?

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,200
What?

82
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,700
A gun, he pulled
a gun from his jacket.

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,500
How is it you can perform arcane
rituals and dead languages

84
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
and you can't
read my handwriting?

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,300
Well, the lost language
of Beothuk has nothing on your penmanship.

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Still no answer.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,200
Well, he's
probably at work.

88
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, either that or he's
making a run for the border.

89
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,500
Vicki, we have an empty
black van and a license plate.

90
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,700
No, we have a very roomy
black van parked 200 meters from a body dump.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,100
I mean, he's got
to know something.

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
I mean, he could
even be our guy.

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Another one of your
hunches, huh?

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,900
Yeah.

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,100
Why don't we just swing by his
house, have a look around?

96
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,100
I mean, if he took her head,
maybe he's got it there as some kind of trophy.

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,900
???based on what we've got.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Where's your
sense of adventure?

99
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,300
You know, it's funny you
mention that word because

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,900
I've been getting all the
adventure I can handle lately.

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Really?
>> Oh, yeah.

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you want me to
back off this weekend?

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Oh, no...
Charles >> Detective Celluci?

104
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,300
Detective Nelson?
>> Yeah, what can we do for you?

105
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,500
My name's Charles Perkins.
Uh...you left me a few messages.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah, your vehicle was seen
near the scene of a crime.

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
It was?
>> Um-hum, Tuesday afternoon,

108
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Rosedale Valley Road.
You were parked there, how come?

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,700
I was there.

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
Answer the question,
Mr. Perkins.

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,100
What were you doing?

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
That girl,

113
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
she was decapitated...

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,900
Everyone knows that.

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
 ...with a sickle.

116
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm the one you're looking for.

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,900
I killed that girl.

118
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,600
Have you had
any dizzy spells lately?

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Dizzy?
No.

120
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,400
What about
migraines or vertigo?

121
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
No, and no.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,300
What about you?
Any weird dreams,

123
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,400
hallucinations, a pervasive
sense of dread?

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,500
nothing more than usual.

125
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
What about your marks.
Have they fired up at all?

126
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
You know what?
I think you guys have a lot to catch up on.

127
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, no, no burning marks.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Oh, um...but a couple days ago
my head did spin around,

129
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,600
I spoke in tongues
and I puked up something that looked like pea soup.

130
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,900
There's nothing wrong!

131
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,600
But you'll tell me
if there is?

132
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,900
Everything's fine, Henry.
Everything's going to be okay.

133
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,500
You can't say that.
The ritual you performed was...

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,400
it was dangerous.

135
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,100
Henry, I don't know what you
want me to tell you, all right?

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,700
I checked but Hallmark doesn't
make a "sorry I stabbed you in the gut, 

137
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,200
drank your vampire
blood and performed a black magic ritual" card.

138
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Hey, but I appreciate
your concern.

139
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,300
Trust me, my concern
is purely selfish.

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Ha, right.

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,100
All right, well, if you have to
be here and do the demon watch thing, 

142
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
then could you
at least make yourself useful?

143
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,900
Four years ago Charles Perkins
confessed to a murder,

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,800
and this morning he tried
to take it back.

145
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,300
He says that he confused his
psychic visions with reality

146
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,200
and convinced himself that
he committed the murder.

147
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,900
Convenient.
>> Um-hum.

148
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah, well, he claims that the
real killer's going to strike again,

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,100
 and that he knows where
the body's going to be found,

150
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,300
and that the place looks
familiar but he can't quite put a finger on it.

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,100
There's several
references in his testimony about dreams of a wooded area
near the bridle path.

152
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,300
Are you coming with me?

153
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,800
The victim was
found unclothed with no ID.

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,500
I want to make sure that the
back woods are completely cordoned off.

155
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,300
I don't want the press
sneaking in on me, okay?

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,100
Just, uh...
Just give me a minute.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
We gotta stop
meeting like this.

158
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,800
I don't believe you're here.
>> Want to touch me?

159
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,000
See what I just did there?
'Cause, you know,you don't believe...but you...

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
>> Yeah, I got it.
Yeah.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,100
So, is it exactly
like I said?

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,800
This is a closed crime scene.

163
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,000
Nobody's getting through.

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Okay.
I just want to know if there's a decapitated girl down there.

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
That's all I'm asking.

166
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,800
You know what's sad, Vick?

167
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
the ending of 'Old Yeller'?

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,400
Sadder.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
No, there's nothing sadder
than the ending of 'Old Yeller'.

170
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
That you think you can
always just stroll in and get whatever it is you want.

171
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,800
Well, you know what?
Not this time.

172
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,300
There are enough differences
for me to believe that the copycat theory is valid.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Stay on your side
of the police tape.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,400
It's a girl.

175
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,900
Is she, uh...
>> Very.

176
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
Whoever did it took a souvenir.

177
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Thank you for sparing me
another Anne Boleyn reference.

178
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Thank you.

179
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,000
Since the news of the murder

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I've been inundated with calls from anxious parents 

181
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
of every
runaway and missing kid in the city.

182
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,300
Do you have any idea?

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,500
There's no head for dental
records and her fingerprints aren't in the system.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's going to be tough.

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,500
Another Jane Doe.
>> I'm afraid so.

186
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Do you think this
could be the same killer?

187
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,900
I'm still tryin
to sort that out.

188
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,700
Other than a series
of hesitation marks on the first body,

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,300
the similarities are striking.

190
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,400
Similarities, you say.

191
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,000
Striking, you say, as though
committed by the same killer.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
You know, it's not
a nail in the coffin.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
There are two murders,
virtually identical.

194
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,200
Vicki, it was
a high profile case! Okay?

195
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,800
Everybody knows that
the crime scene photos made their way onto the 'Net, okay?

196
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,500
This is a copycat,plain and simple.

197
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,800
Sure, or a killer who's had four years to hone his skills.

198
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh, would you just...!

199
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 That's it!
Stop!

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,300
If you two have something
to work out I'd prefer it if you went elsewhere.

201
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,400
I saw her
walking down the street and I pulled up beside her.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,500
We talked for a minute and...
then I asked her 

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,700
if she wanted to come to my
house to talk some more.

204
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,600
She said no.

205
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
So I took her.

206
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,700
Had you ever
seen her before?

207
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,000
I need you to answer
out loud, please.

208
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,800
No.
No, I'd never seen her.

209
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,900
What did you do
after you took her?

210
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Drove to the park.

211
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,000
We sat in the back of a van
for a little while,

212
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,400
and then something told me
to slit her throat.

213
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Something?

214
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,800
Someone.

215
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,900
What, like, uh...
a voice in your head?

216
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Yes.
It's exactly.

217
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,400
We need to take
a little break.We'll be right back.

218
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
He's
confessing willingly.

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,800
Why are you leading him
to an insanity defense?

220
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
What?
I'm not leading him anywhere.

221
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,200
He's just a little sketchy
on some of the details.

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,500
Plus, there's no physical
evidence.

223
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
There's no blood in the van.

224
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,400
Yeah, but it's normal to have some inconsistencies.

225
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,500
We do have him dead to rights on some of the key issues.

226
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,200
I mean, his car was at the scene.

227
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,300
He knows the type of seapon that was used.

228
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
 Okay, what if his memories are false?

229
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay, people do that all the time for notoriety, 

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
for fame,
for repressed guilt, whatever.

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> True enough.
>> Right?

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Right.
>> See, this is what makes us a good team.

233
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Am I wrong here?

234
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
No, you're not wrong.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay, we should head back
in there and sort this out.

236
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,500
>> All right.
>> All right.

237
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,000
I thought you
said he confessed willful.

238
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,800
He did.

239
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,500
I mean there were some
inconsistencies with his story,

240
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
but the D.A. felt
we had enough for a case.

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,600
Which you supported.

242
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
He wasn't insane, if that's
what you're getting at.

243
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Once again working with the
famed Vicki Nelson hunch theory.

244
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,700
 Right, so you think
he was guilty and that this is a copycat killer.

245
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,900
I think we need to find out.

246
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,300
There's an idea.

247
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,900
Yeah, thank you.
Thanks for your time.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,400
The warden says Perkins has only had one visitor in the
four years he's been in prison.

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,300
Mom?
>> No, brother, three years ago.

250
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Not a single soul
in three years?

251
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,000
No phone calls,
no emails, nothing.

252
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,500
I don't buy it.
I mean no one goes to prison and gets left alone.

253
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,800
Maybe an ex-cell mate helping him on the outside?

254
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,300
Setting up the copycat?

255
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,500
No, he's never had any
friends, keeps completely to himself.

256
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,200
The guy's practically a leper.

257
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, I'd be impressed
if Charles and his brother

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,400
waited this long
to carry out the copycat.

259
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,800
Nothing throws off
suspicion more than patience.

260
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,700
What do you say we go have
a talk with the brother?

261
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,000
She was decapitated
wasn't she?

262
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,000
You have no idea
what it's like to be cursed with something like this.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,800
The police aren't
buying your story, Charles.

264
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,500
They think you're working
with a copycat killer.

265
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,700
But you told them
they're wrong.

266
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,800
My only interest is in
finding and stopping whoever is committing these murders.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
A closed hospital
with a janitorial staff.

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Hm, government
bureaucracy at its finest.

269
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,100
Well, it does
look clean.

270
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,800
Hm, you're telling me.

271
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,100
This must be the best
janitorial job around.

272
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes, well, it keeps me busy.

273
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Kelly Perkins,
do you remember me?

274
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Oh, I thought
you looked familiar.

275
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,200
Detective Celluci, am I right?
>> That's right.

276
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,300
But I see you have
a new partner.

277
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,500
Detective Lam.

278
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

279
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,000
By all means.

280
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
Where were you
on Thursday night?

281
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,100
Thursday...
Thursday's my book club.

282
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Yeah, we were discussing
Finnegan's Wake.

283
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,500
I hated it.

284
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
It's so random, chaotic.

285
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,300
Well, not everything needs to make sense now,does it?
>> No.

286
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,600
Is everything okay?

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,800
There's been another murder.

288
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,500
It looks a lot
like Charles' work.

289
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,700
We think it's the work
of a copycat killer.

290
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,300
I mean Charles might be working
with somebody on the outside to make him look innocent.

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, that's possible,
but I can't think of anyone who would dosuch a horrible thing.

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
But you visited
him in prison.

293
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,200
Just once.
It's amazing how far apart two brothers can grow.

294
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,900
What was Charles like
as a kid?

295
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,600
well, he was always
the rational one, I suppose.

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,700
He could always find the
balance in every situation.

297
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,800
You know, except with mother.

298
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,800
Ah, she's a doctor, right?

299
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,700
Psychiatrist.

300
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,700
You know what they say,
shoemaker's children often go barefoot.

301
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,800
Everything we did was
over-intellectualized and analyzed to death.

302
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,200
But as far as I'm concerned,
the past is the past.

303
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,600
Charles never agreed.

304
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you still talk
with your mother?

305
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Well, I don't hold
anything against her,

306
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,500
but I certainly don't go
out of my way to see her.

307
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,800
You think your mother would
talk to us about Charles?

308
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
You know, you'd
have to talk to her.

309
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,200
I might do that.
Thanks for your time.

310
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,400
I told you,
I never killed that girl.

311
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
You believe me.

312
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Why did you call me, anyway?

313
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,500
Because you were the only one
who didn't think I was crazy.

314
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
That's not good enough,
Charles.

315
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
I need more to go on.

316
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,800
I told you I don't...

317
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,900
Charles?
Guard! Guard!

318
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,500
Charles...?

319
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,500
Celluci...
he's on the right track.

320
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Celluci is on the right track."

321
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,800
What the hell does that mean?

322
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
Maybe Detective Celluci
is going to identify the killer.

323
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Yeah, or maybe there is
a copycat killer.

324
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,000
Would that be so horrible,
if Detective Celluci was right?

325
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,300
Okay, you know what?
I get it.

326
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,100
You're mad at me.
>> I wouldn't say 'mad',

327
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
'appalled', 'offended',
'indignant'...

328
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Could you at least
feign interest then?

329
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Henry, please, focus.

330
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,300
I am focused.

331
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Everything else is just noise.

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,600
You know what?

333
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,100
I like noise.

334
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,000
And I'm more interested in results.

335
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,600
We need to find out what Detective Celluci has learned.

336
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Well, that might be difficult.

337
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
He's not exactly talking to me lately.

338
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
Why don't I try?

339
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,000
yes, if he is cutting me out,he's not going to talk to you.

340
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,100
Don't be so sure about that.

341
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,800
Yeah, yeah, 'cause the two of
you have always been so tight.

342
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
We seem to have more in
common with each passing day.

343
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,100
Yeah, that's
just great, Henry.

344
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Rebecca Perkins,
Doctor of Psychiatry.

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,200
She worked on several high
profile cases for the department back in the eighties.

346
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, and she's got a record.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,900
She used to pilfer supplies
from the medicine chest.

348
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
Physician, heal thyself.

349
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,100
How long was she in jail for?

350
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,700
Aw, she was out before the
ink dried on her fingerprints.

351
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,600
Pled out to probation
and loss of license.

352
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,400
You know, god forbid somebody
in this country should actually serve time for their crimes.

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,700
It would be a black eye for
any prosecutor who won a case using her as an expert witness.

354
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,600
Where is she now?

355
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,600
Forest Hill Village.

356
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,500
Runs a small alternative counseling clinic
out of her house.

357
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,600
How is that possible?

358
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,200
Well, you don't need a license to tell somebody
why daddy doesn't love them any more.

359
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,300
Well, I hope her morning is clear.

360
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,000
I suggest we pay her a visit tomorrow.

361
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Meet here or pick me up?

362
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, I'll grab you.
>> Oh, promises, promises.

363
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,500
Good night.
>> Good night, Kate.

364
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,900
How long have you been
lurking in the shadows?

365
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Long enough to see the
Celluci magic in action.

366
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Is there a point
to this visit?

367
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,900
Well, I come bearing gifts,
Charles Perkins.

368
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,800
No, thanks.
I already have one.

369
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,300
Vicki saw him today
in the prison.

370
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Perkins says you're
on the right track.

371
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,700
All right, correct me if I'm
wrong, 

372
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,800
but if somebody who's not psychic predicts the future
that's generally called a guess.

373
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,300
Am I right?
>> What is it,

374
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
this track that you're on?

375
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, you're unbelievable.

376
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,500
I'm not going to tell you that.
That's privileged information.

377
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,900
Stop!

378
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,100
Detective Celluci,
I asked you a question.

379
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,600
Hello?

380
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,300
Mrs. Perkins?
There's nobody here.

381
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,100
Huh, lights are out.

382
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,300
Curious.

383
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,800
Oh...you should not
have vamped Mike for this information.

384
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,700
Then I guess you don't want to know what Mike
said about you.

385
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
What did he say about me?

386
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,600
Detective Celluci
will only remember my visit as a vague dream.

387
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
Well, that doesn't make it right.

388
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,500
You expect me to believe you'd rather not
have the advantage.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There's Kelly age 10,
Charles 8, Sydney 6.

390
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,900
Who's Sydney?
>> He's the youngest brother.

391
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
There's Charles at 15,
Kelly at 17...

392
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,700
Sydney at 13?

393
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,400
Sydney's a big boy.

394
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,500
Yeah, no kidding.

395
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,600
somebodtheir Wheaties.

396
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,600
Well, hello Dr. Freud.

397
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,600
You know, Rebecca Perkins
lost her license years ago.

398
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,300
She's clearly been practicing
on a more grass roots level.

399
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
Sydney Perkins?

400
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,700
"Subject Sydney is developing
a resistance to the cocaine and ketamine mixture."

401
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,500
"Subject Kelly's isolation coupled with progesterone has resulted in..."
 Progesterone!

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,200
That's a chemical castrator
used on sex offenders.

403
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,600
"Subject Charles is showing
moderate improvement

404
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,400
after switching him to a
pindolol-based anti-depressant."

405
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,200
What is she doing here?

406
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,900
She's torturing
her own children.

407
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,200
I thought you said
no one was here?

408
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
Nobody with a heartbeat.

409
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Mrs. Perkins?

410
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,300
Definitely dead.

411
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,200
Up until the moment you
called I've been trying to figure out

412
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,300
how I could have
a dream about Henry Fitzroy

413
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,500
that didn't involve
a mallet and a stake.

414
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,000
Would you care to have a seat
and we can discuss your dream.

415
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,400
He used one of his mind
tricks on me to get this address, didn't he?

416
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,200
You'd have to ask Henry about that.

417
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,600
He's your vampire.

418
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,900
No, no, no, no.
He is not my vampire.

419
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,200
And besides, I honestly
don't know what he did.

420
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
But you could have guessed.

421
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,400
Look, Mike, remember Sydney
Perkins, the special needs son?

422
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,300
I think he's involved
in the murders.

423
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,000
So can we argue about what
Henry did or didn't do

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,900
after you put an APB out
on Sydney?

425
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,400
There's not going
to be an after.

426
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,900
Officer!
>> Mike!

427
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
Would you escort this woman
off my crime scene.

428
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,200
If she gives you any grief
just arrest her.

429
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,500
Are you kidding me?

430
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
That was awesome.

431
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,800
You and Mike should fight
more often because I love the undercover work.

432
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,500
Did you find anything out 
about that body at Rebecca Perkins house?

433
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
You mean bodies?

434
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,900
The body was Rebecca's.

435
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,000
The head belonged
to someone else.

436
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,000
Dr. Mohadevan has ID'd
her as Allison Cohen.

437
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
She's definitely
the first victim.

438
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,900
DNA match.

439
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,000
That should give the parents some kind of closure.

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,300
Right, but can we find any link between her
and the Perkins boys?

441
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,200
Four years ago Allison
Cohen lived on Carlton.

442
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,700
Weren't the brothers still
living with mommy dearest?

443
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,300
Yeah...maybe the connection
goes back farther than that.

444
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,000
Do you have her
parents' address?

445
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,000
You know, if she's still
on the missing persons list

446
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
then maybe the family still
lives at the same address.

447
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,000
769 Dunvegan Road.

448
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
Right.Well, the Perkins
lived on Heath.

449
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,200
Same area.

450
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,200
So maybe they went to the same school.

451
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Allison Cohen was registered at Sir Wilfred Laurier
Elementary School.

452
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
So was Sydney.

453
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,200
Look at those grades.
He wasn't the smartest one in the family, was he?

454
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
He wasn't supposed to be.

455
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,000
What do you mean?

456
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,000
These are the good
doctor's journals.

457
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,400
Four years ago she came off
like an over-protective mother.

458
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,300
She was actually trying
to protect the integrity of her experiments.

459
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,700
Her experiments?

460
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,600
Yeah, she was trying
to isolate the three sections of the personality...

461
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,300
the ego,
the super-ego and the id.

462
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,300
She was using her
own kids as lab rats.

463
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,100
But why?

464
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,800
She wanted to find a way to control childhood aggression.

465
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,900
Thought if she could isolate the id, she could
stunt its development.

466
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,000
So that means
she created our killer?

467
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,600
Yeah, and that means that
Charles Perkins is innocent.

468
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I can sense you're angry.

469
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Something's happened,
something about the case.

470
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Perceptive...
hardly psychic.

471
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,000
What do you know about Freud's
structural theory of the psyche?

472
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,300
What does that have
to do with anything?

473
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,800
Just go with me here
for a minute.

474
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,600
You see, Freud believed that
the psyche was divided into three sections.

475
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,200
the ego, 

476
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,700
super ego 

477
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,300
and id.

478
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,600
so?

479
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,000
i know about????

480
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
you ???

481
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,300
?????

482
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,900
????

483
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,400
???

484
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,700
????

485
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,200
That's because you can
hear him screaming at night.

486
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,500
I think your mother's experiment
did something to you and your bothers.

487
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,800
I think she accidentally created a psychic link between you,
Sydney and Kelly.

488
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,000
Look, we may be screwed up
but we're not killers.

489
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,400
That random victim
four years ago, Allison Cohen?

490
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,600
She went to school with Sydney.

491
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,700
I think Sydney killed her
and you watched the whole thing through his eyes.

492
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,800
You're wrong.

493
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,500
Your mother reduced Sydney's
brain to pure appetites and urges.

494
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Allison went to school with him.

495
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,700
Maybe he saw her...
>> NO!

496
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Sydney is going to keep
killing unless you help me stop him.

497
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,500
I won't trade my freedom for my brother's.

498
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,400
Then you're as guilty
as he is.

499
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,900
There must be a common
thread among Sydney's victims.

500
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,000
If we can find that,
we can find Sydney.

501
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,700
But if he turned
into some kind of 'id' monster

502
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,000
there won't be any pattern.

503
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,500
 Killing the mother?
I can understand.

504
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,800
I mean after everything
she did I'd almost condone it.

505
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,500
How can you think about
this stuff all the time?

506
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Practice.

507
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,400
You know, go home.
Get some sleep.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,600
Then at least one of us
will be coherent tomorrow.

509
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
Why does
motivation matter?

510
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
They're already dead.

511
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,400
You know what?
Your Batman routine's getting a little tired.

512
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,300
We need to know why Sydney killed 

513
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,800
because then maybe we
have a chance of figuring out who his next target is.

514
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
If Charles Perkins is one-third of a whole person

515
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,400
and another third committed the murder, then he's guilty.

516
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,700
Case closed.

517
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,400
Jeez you know,
I wish it were that simple.

518
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
But we have procedure
for a reason.

519
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,300
This coming from the woman
who stole my blood for a magic ritual.

520
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,400
 Finally.

521
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,100
Okay, you want to talk
about this?

522
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,000
Great.
I was trying to save your life.

523
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,800
I'd rather be dead than see
you seduced by dark magic.

524
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,800
Oh, I get it.

525
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,200
You're tryg to protect me
from myself.

526
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,900
No.

527
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,500
You're the only one
who can do that.

528
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,900
I vowed to protect
you from evil.

529
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,200
I can't protect
you from yourself.

530
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,700
Good night, Coreen.

531
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,000
I stayed.

532
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,200
I thought you might
want to talk.

533
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Thanks...thanks.

534
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Do you know what? we????

535
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,400
???

536
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,500
????

537
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,700
???

538
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
???

539
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,500
???

540
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,100
??

541
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,400
???

542
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
?????

543
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,300
you did well

544
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,200
I think it's missing
something...a motive.

545
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,500
You still haven't told us
why you killed her, Charles.

546
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,700
>> Just 'cause.
Vicki >> "Just 'cause"?

547
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,400
You can't even look me
in the eye and you expect me

548
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,500
to believe you had the balls
to do that?

549
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,800
I think he's making it up.
>> Who killed her, Charles?

550
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,900
>> I did.
>> Why?

551
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,400
BECAUSE I WANTED TO!

552
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
She created awful urges in me,

553
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,000
and it had to stop.

554
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,900
Looks like he has
some issues.

555
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,700
I think these boys
have a lot of issues.

556
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Here's one talking
about his urges, right?

557
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,200
And then here's another
judging him for it.

558
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,300
Sydney Perkins didn't act alone.

559
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,700
All right, if he does
make contact with you,

560
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,800
I want to make sure
you call me right away...

561
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,600
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

562
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,500
No! No!
I don't want to hear it!Not today!

563
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,400
Mike, I got to talk to you about Sydney Perkins.
>> No!

564
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,800
>> You have news
about my brother?

565
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,100
>> Kelly?
>> Ms. Nelson.

566
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,700
It's been a long time.

567
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,500
Sure has.
Hey, I'm kicking you out, remember?

568
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,600
What is he doing here?

569
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,900
We hit pay dirt
at the shrink's house.

570
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,500
We got the murder weapon.
We got finger prints.

571
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,900
Now all we have to do
is find Sydney.

572
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,200
No, Sydney's not the killer.

573
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,400
Look, he sort of is the killer but so is Kelly.

574
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,900
The two of them are involved.

575
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,400
They've been in contact.

576
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,100
What, with his own physic powers?

577
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,100
It's more complicated than that.
>> Oh, of course it is.

578
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,700
Mike, their psycho-shrink
mother did experiments on them.

579
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,100
So what is it?
It's mad science now?

580
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,100
No, we're talking somehow
these guys have ended up

581
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,800
with some symbiotic
physic link, all right?

582
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,200
Kelly is involved.

583
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,700
I have vetted his alibi.

584
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,900
He's in the clear, okay?
Drop it.

585
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Do you realize
you're trespassing?

586
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Stay back, Kelly.
>> Kelly?

587
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,400
i'm sydeny

588
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,800
Now let's kill her.
Hm? Not yet?

589
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
We need to find out
what she knows first.

590
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,000
He's a little rude.

591
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,600
Well, you could always make
it up to me by letting me go.

592
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,100
Oh no.
You see, that's not going to be possible.

593
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,100
So, uh...how'd you kill that
big old brother of yours, huh?

594
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Clearly not brute strength.

595
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,300
Oh-ho, look at you,
trying to goad me into making a mistake.

596
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,600
Nice try.

597
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,500
I have no ego to bruise, yet.

598
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,300
See, Sydney's not dead,
he's in here with me now.

599
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,400
OW!
GET ON WITH IT!

600
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,000
Don't interrupt me.

601
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,700
See, we can't be three.

602
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,100
We can't be two.

603
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
We need to be one.

604
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,800
Integration is the only way.

605
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
That's why you started
killing again then, right?

606
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,300
So you could cast doubt
on your brothers conviction.

607
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,800
Get him released so you
could reintegrate him.

608
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,600
Exactly.

609
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,800
Guess you didn't count
on being caught?

610
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,500
Now who says you caught us?

611
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,100
DO SOMETHING, SYDNEY!

612
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,700
He confessed.

613
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,100
That's good work.

614
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,100
What was that about keeping
things out of the work place?

615
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,800
See, that's why we need
to take this paper work home,

616
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
finish it there.
>> Yeah.

617
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,900
Does that mean I have
to close a case every time I nt to, uhm...

618
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,900
No.

619
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,500
But you've got to admit,
it doesn't hurt.

620
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,700
Still, there's, um...

621
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,700
There's something
about this case, you know?

622
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
it's okay.

623
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,300
My hunch paid off,
we got the right guy.

624
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,600
Nah...you see, you smile now
but four years from now

625
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,900
the killer's going to have
you dead to rights.

626
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,600
You're going to be all alone
in that asylum.

627
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,100
This is it.

628
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Your hunches are finally
going to get you killed.

629
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,900
No, my hunches
are what keep me alive.

630
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You never would listen.

631
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,700
You always had to do it
your own way.

632
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,200
'cause you were always there
to pull me back.

633
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,900
I'm not here now.

634
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,800
Not feeling well?

635
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,400
Someone took a round
out of me.

636
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
Poor baby.

637
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,000
Vicki Nelson came to see me.

638
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,800
Told me quite a story about you.

639
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,500
Can't make you believe
anything you don't want.

640
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,700
You're not psychic Charles.

641
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,400
Using the copycat killer
as an excuse to get out of prison 

642
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,700
or using Vicki
to obfuscate the investigate,

643
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,100
I mean, come on, admit it.

644
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,800
I won't lie to make you happy.

645
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,800
People are dead and all you care about
is yourself.

646
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,100
I'm in prison because
of a murder someone else...

647
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,900
someone else committed,
because I thought I was guilty.

648
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,800
Sydney's going to kill again.

649
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
I can feel it.
>> Really?

650
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
And when would that be?
>> Very soon.

651
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Kelly's with him, so is...

652
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,600
So is who?
>> Ms. Nelson.

653
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,300
>> Vicki?
>> Can you...

654
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Can you afford
not to believe me?

655
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,400
Detective Celluci?

656
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,700
Vicki may be in danger.

657
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,600
I'd be more surprised
if she wasn't.

658
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm an hour and a half
outside of the city,

659
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,700
are you going to help or not?

660
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,000
Where is she?

661
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,100
Try the Riverview
Institute for Children.

662
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,600
450 Carswell.

663
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,100
Kelly Perkins is the
resident caretaker.

664
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,500
I never realized until now,
Detective, but we have something in common.

665
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,000
She drives us both insane.

666
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,700
Consistently.

667
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,300
One more thing, Fitzroy.

668
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,700
Don't ever try to get
in my head again.

669
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,300
Trust me, Detective, that's
the last place I'd want to be.

670
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,200
You better get
on your psychic friend hot-line and buy her some time!

671
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,400
He's shutting me out.

672
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Oh, for...

673
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,800
You're linked
to your brothers, right?

674
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,100
So what you feel,
they feel, right?

675
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,900
And vice versa?

676
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,500
STAY OUT OF THIS, CHARLES!

677
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,200
Harder.
HARDER!

678
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,300
SYDNEY!
KILL HER!

679
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,500
VICKI!

680
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
See, I told you
I could do this myself.

681
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,700
We need to get you
out of here.

682
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,400
Yeah.Hey, I am really sorry about the whole
drinking-your-blood,

683
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,100
dark magic,
ritual thing, really.

684
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,400
Apology accepted.
>> I can't keep doing this.

685
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Neither can I.

686
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,000
Where are my glasses?

687
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm sure you have
another pair.

688
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,700
They're both dead.

689
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,800
Kelly poisoned Sydney
a couple days ago.

690
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,000
The way he committed the murder
it caused a psychotic break resulting in a split personality.

691
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,700
Kelly and Sydney became one.

692
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,200
In a manner of speaking, yes.

693
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,400
What happens now?

694
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,500
Evidence at the institute
will exonerate you in Allison Cohen's murder.

695
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,700
You'll be released.

696
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,900
So I'm free?

697
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,900
Not right away, but soon.

698
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,300
Thank you, Ms. Nelson.

699
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,900
Hey, Charles,
I just have one question.

700
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,600
If Kelly felt the beating
Celluci gave you,

701
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
how come you didn't know
when Sydney was dead?

702
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,700
Because Sydney didn't die.

703
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,700
He intergraded with Kelly.

704
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Good bye, Detective.

705
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,900
Catch you later, boys.

705
00:42:12,000 --> 00:43:11,900
