1
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,511
Beware assistants
bearing unrequested coffee.

2
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:20,567
I try to do something nice and you
assume it's because I want something.

3
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,323
I need a small advance.
Is that a new outfit?

4
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,495
A couple of hundred
against next month's salary.

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,632
Then I would suggest
you return that outfit.

6
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,933
Come on Vicki,
just this month.

7
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:34,100
I swear I won't ask again.
Nope, can't do it.

8
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,006
But it's an advance
against my salary.

9
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,878
Yes, for work you
haven't done yet.

10
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,156
Could you plea bring
me the Harvey file?

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,759
Are you going to give
me the advance or not?

12
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:43,771
Not.

13
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,263
Can I have a raise?

14
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:54,027
Rachel I'm ready
to be a mother,

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,186
to open my spirit
and my body to new life.

16
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,883
Good, good.

17
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:05,548
Now maintain your
visualization, Rachel.

18
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,431
I'm ready to be a mother,

19
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,642
to open my body
and my spirit to new life.

20
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,436
I'm ready to be a mother,

21
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:23,321
to open my spirit
and my body to new life.

22
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,252
I'm ready to be a mother,

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,514
to open my spirit
and my body to new life.

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,400
I'm ready to be a mother.

25
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,346
I'm ready to open my spirit
and my body to new life.

26
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,680
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

27
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:50,786
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

28
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,142
- Sottotitolo non tradotto -

29
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:55,524
Dr. Hobman told us
to talk to the fetus.

30
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,872
Said it was good for
prenatal development.

31
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:02,007
After a few weeks, Marlisse
stopped talking to the baby

32
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:04,828
and started talking with it.
What were they talking about?

33
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,249
Begging him to be a good boy.

34
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,635
Asking him not to hurt anybody.

35
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,480
And then she started
hearing things.

36
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,400
It was really quite creepy.

37
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,527
Have you talked
to your doctor about this?

38
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,863
>>es, that's when he asked
Marlisse to check into

39
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,129
the clinic full time.
That was almost a month ago.

40
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:24,439
Now, when I try to visit or
even to call her, she refuses.

41
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:28,629
Apparently, my 'negativity aura' is
making her 'anxious and high-strung'.

42
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,327
I think there's something
wrong with my baby

43
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,122
and nobody will
tell me anything.

44
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:36,040
But she is at the clinic
of her own free will,

45
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,042
is she not?
Now you sound

46
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:39,003
like the police.
Don't you see?

47
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,914
It's a cult.
They repeat mantras.

48
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,790
They follow him around
like puppies.

49
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:44,931
He's some sort
of guru to them.

50
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:48,009
It sounds like you need
a deprogrammer, not a PI.

51
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,065
You're not the first
PI that I've seet

52
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:54,566
but you are the first one
who hasn't laughed at me.

53
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,356
Miss Nelson, I want my wife
back, and I want to know

54
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,358
that our baby is going
to be all right.

55
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,649
They won't even let me talk to
my wife, don't you understand?

56
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,310
I'll see what I can do.

57
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:19,165
Here's your change.
$5,00, $5.25, $5.35, $5.45...

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,360
Coreen? Just trying to earn my salary.

59
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,647
This poor woman,
she's been through the mill.

60
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:29,718
She's had everything - in vitro
fertilization, artificial

61
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:32,809
insemination, donor eggs,
hormone treatments.

62
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,865
I can't imagine wanting
a baby that badly.

63
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,442
I'd do it, wouldn't you?

64
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:40,052
>>I don't think the world
is ready for a mini-me.

65
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,612
Besides, artificial
insemination is no way

66
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:45,344
to make a baby.
- How long have you been standing there?

67
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:48,979
Okay, you want to earn
your salary, I need you

68
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,836
to do some sleuthing for me.
- What's the case?

69
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,239
Vicki's got a client whose
pregnant wife is being held

70
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,317
captive by a mysterious
baby-making cult.

71
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,549
If this is a cult,
we need to move quickly.

72
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,747
So there is a couple
I want you to interview,

73
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,166
the Deskins.
They had treatment at tke

74
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,814
clinic and have a testimonial
up on the doctor's Website.

75
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,842
So I want you to meet
with them as soon as you can

76
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:08,536
and get back to me.
- Where are you going?

77
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,253
- Husband hunting.
- Husband material.

78
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:14,966
You're sweet, but you're
just not a morning person.

79
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,235
No, I'm not.

80
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,977
Vicki Mike, I want you
to be my baby daddy.

81
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:37,516
- I'm good.
- I'm... flattered?

82
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:40,267
Come on, I want
to show you something.

83
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,887
You've tried everything
to have a baby, but your

84
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:46,592
hopes have not been realized.
Don't give up!

85
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:50,929
At the Hobman Clinic, we can
make your dreams come true.

86
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:54,211
Well, we can't arrest him
for being irritating, yet.

87
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,320
Wait, it gets better.

88
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:59,283
Traditional therapies
offer traditional results.

89
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,698
We combine cutting edge
technology with

90
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,220
a holistic approach.
As a result, our success rate

91
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:08,708
is double that of any other
clinic, verifiable results

92
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,897
that mean your search
could be over.

93
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,938
So the thing is, if I want
to get myself an invite

94
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:19,230
to Hobman's country estate,
I need to look depressed,

95
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,274
and hopeless.
You know, exhausted.

96
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,248
- Don't forget desperate.
- Um-hum.

97
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,032
And have my supportive
husband right there by my side.

98
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,105
As long as you stop
doing that, yeah.

99
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,663
Okay, Ricky,
whatever you say.

100
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:31,477
- Who's Ricky?
- You're Ricky, I'm Lucy.

101
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:33,042
I'm so not going
to be Ricky.

102
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:38,903
I knew a Ricky... once.
- Okay, how about Ike and Tina?

103
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,523
Greg and Marsha?
Moose and Squirrel?

104
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,392
Hey, how about
Mike and Vicki?

105
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,191
You're such a party pooper.

106
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,274
All right, sweetie,
I've got to go.

107
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,693
Those records aren't
going to forge themselves.

108
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,731
No, they're not.

109
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,506
Vicki How many years
have we been married?

110
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,100
Mike Five.
You can stop quizzing me now.

111
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,182
Trying since our wedding
night to have a baby.

112
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:07,497
Two miscarriages, three
different fertility doctors.

113
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,629
Two naturopaths,
an acupuncturist,

114
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,691
even a psychic healer.
It's all there

115
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:14,464
in my medical records.
- I know it's hard for Mike

116
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,335
to understand.
He wants to adopt.

117
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:21,333
I just hate seeing Vicki
get her hopes up

118
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:25,151
only to have them dashed
again and again.

119
00:06:25,878 --> 00:06:28,175
It's put a huge strain
on our relationship.

120
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,473
- I wouldn't say huge.
- It feels like we argue

121
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,141
all the time.
- Not all the time.

122
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:34,334
You see?

123
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,648
I know how difficult
this can be for you both.

124
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:42,373
And I believe this
treatment can work for you.

125
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,270
But it's not right
for everyone.

126
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:51,345
You would have to spend
at least a month here

127
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,607
and that can be very
difficult for your partner.

128
00:06:54,642 --> 00:07:02,680
Well, doctor, nothing is
worse than seeing Vicki suffer.

129
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,017
I just want to give her
everything and I can't

130
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,607
give her the one thing
that she wants most.

131
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:10,810
I can.

132
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:12,965
Let's have a baby.

133
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:24,125
Dr. Hobman Here you go.
I'll see you soon.

134
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,588
- Okay.
- Okay.

135
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:29,921
Doctor.

136
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,340
Where did you get those records?

137
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,049
Got to love the Internet!

138
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,305
- Mike?
- Hey, yeah, that's me.

139
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,198
Yes?
- Got a little chore

140
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,056
for you as well.
What...?

141
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:49,252
Oh, he needs your swimmers.

142
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:54,714
Right.
Um... so, like, here, now?

143
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:57,158
No, we have a room for you
right down the hallway.

144
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:59,208
And, Vicki, I'm going to be
taking you over to the dorm,

145
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,224
so if you would like to say
good-bye to your husband.

146
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,575
Okay.

147
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:05,568
A little privacy.

148
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:10,725
Ahem, well.
- Well.

149
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,736
Honey...

150
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,216
- Um...
- Uh-hum.

151
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,150
This feels weird.

152
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:21,540
- He took us way too easily.
- Yeah.

153
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:23,895
- Can you do me a favour?
- Um-hum...

154
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,605
besides filling that cup?

155
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:28,786
I need you to run
the doctor again.

156
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,219
I don't know,
maybe I missed something?

157
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:32,051
Yup.
Okay.

158
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,687
Um... we can stop kissing now.

159
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,959
Are you sure?

160
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,498
Uh... it'll be over
before you know it.

161
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:50,987
What?

162
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:52,958
Your time here,
the separation.

163
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:57,528
- Right, right.
- Right.

164
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:01,203
Um... well...
bye, honey.

165
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,068
Bye.

166
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,091
- Mr. Wheeler.
- Yes, yes.

167
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:14,345
Right this way.

168
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:23,226
- I don't buy blood.
- But it's good blood.

169
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:26,883
Great blood, actually.
Plenty of anti-oxidants,

170
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:30,044
rich in iron and 22 other
essential vitamins.

171
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,009
- No.
- I deliver.

172
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:34,890
What is it?

173
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,025
Miss Fennel?

174
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,275
Mr. Deskin, thank
you for meeting with us.

175
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,489
Hi, come on in.

176
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:49,512
I'm a little surprised our
testimonial is still on the Website.

177
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,448
We did the treatment
so long ago.

178
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:54,606
- But you were pleased?
- Of course.

179
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:59,447
We... I wouldn't have had
Travis without Dr. Hobman.

180
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:02,616
He's very sweet.

181
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:06,078
Yeah, great little guy.
He's my life.

182
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,403
Where's Mrs. Deskin?

183
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:10,203
Gail passed away
a couple of years ago.

184
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:13,499
Now, it's just us men.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

185
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:15,730
How did she die?

186
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,729
No, no, it's fine.
It was an accident.

187
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:24,149
One of those stupid ones
you always hear used

188
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:27,237
as a statistic, you know,
'more people die falling off

189
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:30,560
a ladder than they do in a crashing airplane'.
- She fell off a ladder?

190
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:34,508
Could you tell us
about your experience

191
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,471
at the Hobman Center?
It was simple.

192
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,671
I mean my part
was pretty simple.

193
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:42,264
You fill a cup,
come back in a month.

194
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,267
Gail had the worst of it.

195
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:46,637
Cooped up in that
place for so long.

196
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,976
We hear they
isolated the women.

197
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,446
They keep them together
for most of the time.

198
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,213
I think they separate
them near the end.

199
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:57,936
Something about keeping the
mothers calm and relaxed.

200
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,083
But no husbands?
If you don't mind me being

201
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:05,062
so direct, our client felt
it was a little cult-ish.

202
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,868
It's just Hobman's process.

203
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:08,605
He calls it total body.

204
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,766
Complete focus on
the mother and baby.

205
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:17,712
You know, it feels kind of strange
when you're going through it.

206
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,581
But you can't argue
with the results.

207
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:26,829
Travis, did Tom's dad
walk you home?

208
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:39,707
I think he hit puberty early.

209
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,680
What is your problem?
You couldn't get out

210
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:53,325
of there fast enough.
- There was blood on the boy, and the blood wasn't his.

211
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,603
So, your bags
are in your room.

212
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:10,588
Just relax tonight, and we'll
get started in the morning.

213
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,441
Great.
Thanks.

214
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,207
Welcome.
Rachel Teertstra.

215
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:19,228
Hi, I'm Vicki Wheeler.
Nice to meet you.

216
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,015
The first few
days are tough.

217
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,559
You're ready to rip someone's
throat out for a latte.

218
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,735
But once you settle in,
it's pretty great.

219
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,828
Great.

220
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,861
We've got organic food
and lots of rest,

221
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,050
and herbal treatments,
hydrotherapy

222
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,652
and an attitude adjustment.
It's like a spa.

223
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,510
Oh, and isn't Dr. Hobman
the greatest?

224
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:39,283
He's amazing.

225
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,954
I mean he's so compassionate.
- Yes.

226
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:45,908
I really feel like this
time, it's going to work.

227
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:51,381
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So is this everyone?

228
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,928
Oh, the Alpha Mommies, all high
risk, they're in another wing.

229
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:57,884
More alone time for
bonding with baby.

230
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:00,719
No visitors?

231
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:05,271
Oh we can visit sometimes, but
only if we bring loving energy.

232
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,644
Well, that is all I have.

233
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,286
Yes, it's lovely here.

234
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,427
The other women
are really welcoming.

235
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,533
Coreen Oh my God,
is it horrible?

236
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,457
I feel like we're going to break into a round

237
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:21,169
of Kumbaya any minute.
- Hang in there.

238
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,885
So listen, we went to visit
Mr. Deskin last night.

239
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,152
He was fine,
but the kid was not.

240
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:30,487
- You don't say.
- Creepy eyes all twitchy

241
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:33,788
and weird and Henry
smelled blood on him.

242
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,063
- What kind of blood?
- Dead pets.

243
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,822
There's all kinds of animals
missing from the neighbourhood.

244
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,659
Oh, my gosh!
You're kidding!

245
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,462
No, there really
are dead pets.

246
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:47,404
Oh right, this cheerful double speak is hard to decipher sometimes.

247
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:49,965
Yeah, you should
try it from my side.

248
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,747
Hey, you know what?
Could you do a favour for me?

249
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:56,220
Try and track down some of the other
families that came through the clinic.

250
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,676
See if there's anything
odd about the kids.

251
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,098
Bring Henry.
See if he notices anything.

252
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,878
Okay?
Because I want to know what

253
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:05,746
to expect, you know, with
the results and everything.

254
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:08,839
Because I'm telling you, I'm
willing to do anything for this baby.

255
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,621
Vicki, it's time
for your physical.

256
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,891
Okay.
All right, well, I've got to go.

257
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:16,811
Thanks for calling.
- You're freaking me out!

258
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,352
Me too!
Bye!

259
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:21,389
All right.

260
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:25,120
Mike I understand you had
a practice with Dr. Hobman?

261
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,287
Richard is a fine doctor.
Dedicated.

262
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:28,330
Always studying.

263
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:32,170
But when he took time off
to study new IVF techniques

264
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,268
in Austria about ten,
eleven years ago,

265
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,331
his practice changed... a lot.
- How so?

266
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,797
He turned into a true believer.

267
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,728
All that heal yourself with
the power of the mind nonsense.

268
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:46,601
Does that translate into 'get
pregnant with the power of your mind'?

269
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:49,012
His success rate
is pretty good,

270
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:50,711
about double the
average, actually.

271
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:52,722
So chalk one up
to airy-fairy?

272
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,835
Any physician knows the mind
can definitely affect health.

273
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,913
In that respect the holistic
practice seems reasonable.

274
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:02,016
But holistic can be
a euphemism for 'untested'.

275
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:04,539
There could be health concerns for these children

276
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:06,225
down the line.
- And what about the mothers?

277
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,280
They're the real guinea pigs.

278
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,652
- What is that?
- Many of these herbs

279
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,330
have been used for centuries
in the treatment of infertility,

280
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,116
black cohosh,
red clover blossom.

281
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:23,272
dong quai, chastetree berry.

282
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,525
It's all part of Dr. Hobman's
patented treatment.

283
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:30,464
I haven't seen
Dr. Hobman around much.

284
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,429
Well, he's usually
pretty busy in the lab,

285
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,437
cooking up baby cocktails.
But this is all based

286
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,983
on his research, and you
can't argue with the result.

287
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:40,998
All right.
Have any of the other mothers

288
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,380
ever have problems
with their babies?

289
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:45,472
All you new moms,
you're always so nervous.

290
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:48,086
Relax.
That increases the uterine

291
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,247
lining, and moistens
the mucous membrane.

292
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,085
Mm.

293
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,563
Well, bottoms up.

294
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:57,772
So this is it?
This is the treatment?

295
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,869
Well, this is part
of the preparation.

296
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:03,608
Everyone gets this, and
lots of rest and relaxation.

297
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:07,548
But the actual fertilization procedure,
well, that depends on the individual.

298
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,202
And Dr. Hobman
makes that assessment.

299
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,236
That's right.
Keep drinking.

300
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,805
Chunky.

301
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,338
Any day now Marlisse.
Looking good.

302
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:27,814
Thank you.

303
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,672
Mind if I visit?

304
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,206
Come in.

305
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,705
Of course.

306
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,382
Vicki Wheeler.
Marlisse Lafoy.

307
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,557
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

308
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:44,244
Don't forget your drink,
Marlisse.

309
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,954
- Wow!
- I know.

310
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:52,118
Thirty-six weeks, almost to full term,
and I've never felt better in my life.

311
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:55,163
Is that one of Dr. Hobman's
disgusting shakes?

312
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:57,931
Trust me, you get used to
them, except for the nightmares.

313
00:16:58,174 --> 00:16:59,750
Maybe if they give you
nightmares, you shouldn't

314
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,327
be drinking them.
- Well, they're not really

315
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:04,605
nightmares.
More like weird dreams.

316
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,539
And Dr. Hobman says it's
a standard side effect.

317
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,329
Anyway you tell me everything
about the outside world...

318
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,686
world events, local news,
celebrity scandals.

319
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,850
Start with the
celebrity scandals.

320
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:18,020
Is it really
that bad in here?

321
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,074
Resting and relaxation
is part of the program,

322
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,049
but how many sudokus
can I do in a day?

323
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,739
What about your husband?

324
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:29,157
Mitch has issues
with the pregnancy.

325
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,989
I worked far to hard for this
to let his negative energy

326
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,431
interfere with
my positive aura.

327
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:38,028
He doesn't understand how
important this is to us.

328
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:40,163
What's your story?

329
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:41,560
What?

330
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:46,498
Oh! Oh, um...

331
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:53,170
Everybody said "Oh, wait, - you know -
enjoy your youth, have the baby later!".

332
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,977
No one mentioned to me
that the longer I waited

333
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:59,564
my chances of conceiving
were reduced exponentially.

334
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,116
Woke up one day, realizing
it might be getting too late.

335
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:04,789
Now I'll just take
all the help I can get.

336
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,449
I mean this is why
I wanted to talk to you.

337
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:10,039
Don't get me wrong,
I'm delighted to be here,

338
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:12,577
but no one seems to be able
to tell me what the treatment

339
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:15,200
is, and I wonder, is the baby
going to be healthy?

340
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:16,419
Here.

341
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:17,947
Feel that?

342
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,416
That's healthy.

343
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:30,954
Uh, oh.

344
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:41,099
- Marlisse...
- Ummm...?

345
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:43,839
Does Dr. Hobman think
everything's okay with the baby?

346
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:47,478
Absolutely, he says
we couldn't be healthier.

347
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:49,719
Yeah, then
why are you here?

348
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,717
Safety first, and this
is where I got pregnant.

349
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:56,834
It feels like a second home.
- Speaking of which,

350
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,487
how exactly did you
get pregnant?

351
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:02,395
Well if you don't know that, Vicki,
your problem might not be infertility.

352
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:04,626
Yeah, I think I've got
that part figured out.

353
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,163
I'm talking about
the treatment.

354
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:10,239
I was not optimistic
because I'd had half a dozen

355
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:15,627
IVF sessions, before, but there's
something magic about this place.

356
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,797
Listen, Marlisse.
My name is Vicki Nelson.

357
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:21,210
I'm a private detective.
Your husband Mitch hired me

358
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,229
to check in on you.
- Mitch hired you?

359
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,916
Yes, he's very worried
about you and the baby.

360
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,163
Aw, that's sweet.

361
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:32,433
But he's got to relax.

362
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,831
I kind of think relaxing
might be the problem.

363
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,053
Visiting hours
are over.

364
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,252
Marlisse, I'm sure
you're going to be fine.

365
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,932
Yeah, but be careful, all right?
- Okay.

366
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,092
Time to go.

367
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,145
Marlisse is such
a great role model.

368
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,770
What an inspiration.

369
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,124
You're very eager,
aren't you?

370
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,695
- Yes.
- Good to know.

371
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,366
I'm sorry to bother you.
Is this the Beth

372
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,285
and Steven Young who went
to the Hobman clinic?

373
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:20,106
Hello?

374
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:50,450
Hey!

375
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:24,966
I'm pregnant!

376
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,307
Dr. Hobman did my serum test.

377
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,264
My H-C-G has doubled.

378
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,261
- Great!
- That means I'm pregnant.

379
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:35,866
Oh! Oh, hey!
Congratulations!

380
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:37,902
You're next, I can tell.

381
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:40,801
Jonah likes you.
I think he likes everyone.

382
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,327
No, Vicki,
you don't understand.

383
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:45,367
Jonah's a lucky charm. He has an
instinct for who gets pregnant.

384
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:56,917
I don't understand.
What's so urgent that it

385
00:21:56,952 --> 00:21:58,889
couldn't wait 'til the morning?
- Where is your son?

386
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,182
He's upstairs.
Homework.

387
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,607
Coreen Mr. Deskin, have you
ever talked to the other parents

388
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:06,580
that have used the clinic?

389
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:10,162
Has there been any suggestion of
similarities between children born there?

390
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:13,148
Mr. Deskin You hear stories,
you know?

391
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,158
Excuse me.

392
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:23,687
Stories?

393
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:28,285
About fertility clinics and
babies that aren't really yours.

394
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,682
You try to put it
out of your mind.

395
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,683
Tell yourself it couldn't
happen to you.

396
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:42,180
About a year after Travis was
born we got this from one

397
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:45,368
of the families at the clinic
around the same time.

398
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:03,760
Its face was pressed up
right against Marlisse's skin.

399
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,800
Babies don't do that.

400
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:07,875
At least I really
hope they don't.

401
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,247
Marlisse's husband was right.
Hobman is doing something

402
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,858
to these women,
to their babies.

403
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,033
All right.
Well, I checked the doctor out.

404
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:16,496
He's had no complaints,
He's got no lawsuits.

405
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:19,170
He's completely clean.
Apparently this clinic

406
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:21,775
has twice the success rate
as other clinics.

407
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,489
Okay, that's suspicious right
there, especially with these women.

408
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:26,780
Most of them have undergone
a barrage of treatments

409
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:28,374
at other clinics
that have all failed.

410
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,792
Why is this one working?

411
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,750
Hey, sweetie, could you
wash this for me?

412
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,910
You want me
to wash your trash?

413
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:42,190
Hobman is making us all
drink these herbal remedies.

414
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:45,210
Mine's mixed in with the soil
and in the cup is something

415
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,764
he's giving
the expectant mothers.

416
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,837
Could you just get Mohadevan
to analyze it and tell me

417
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,496
what the hell is in it.
- Wait a second.

418
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,953
Have you been drinking these?
- I've had to chug a couple.

419
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:55,600
Vicki, maybe it's time
to get out.

420
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:57,271
I can't Mike.

421
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:00,214
He is preying on these women,

422
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,859
on their partners
and on their futures.

423
00:24:03,338 --> 00:24:06,122
I'm not going anywhere until
I find out what's going on here.

424
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:10,360
All right. Okay, I'll have
Mohadevan look into this ASAP.

425
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,439
- Miss you, sweetie.
- Miss you tons.

426
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,769
Okay?
- Yeah.

427
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,521
Love you.
- Okay.

428
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:33,234
Mr. Daskin Even as a baby,
there was something

429
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:34,808
in the way his eyes
would follow me.

430
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:36,347
The feeling never went away.

431
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:40,281
After his mother's...
accident,

432
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:43,586
he got cold,
so cold.

433
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,205
Not quite human?

434
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:51,897
How can I even think that?
But I do.

435
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:23,939
Gabriel!

436
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,788
Gabriel!

437
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,990
Where are you?

438
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,385
Gabriel!

439
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,093
I've got some food.
- I changed my mind.

440
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,831
I want to go home.

441
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:50,872
C'mon, we're supposed
to be adventurers.

442
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:53,072
I don't want to.
I wanna go home.

443
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,664
Okay, you can only go home
if you do as I say.

444
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:01,868
First thing is, you've got
to put on this blindfold.

445
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,507
Okay, now you've got to wait a
minute, and then we're going to go.

446
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:19,040
I'm scared.
Travis!

447
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,568
It's okay.

448
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:25,931
Just a minute.

449
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,480
Stop!

450
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,460
Quiet. You played with Travis
but he wasn't very nice.

451
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:36,374
You'll never play
with him again.

452
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:38,149
Now.

453
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:40,774
Go...
home.

454
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:48,121
You will not harm this boy.

455
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,968
He wants me to.

456
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,829
He tells me to.

457
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:54,592
Who?

458
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:56,532
Who tells you?

459
00:26:57,496 --> 00:27:00,614
You will not harm
another human being.

460
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,733
I will not harm
another human being.

461
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:09,206
You will not harm
people or animals.

462
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:12,519
I won't harm them.

463
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:29,973
Henry, I think Travis may
have killed his mother.

464
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:32,197
He was about to add
to his accomplishments.

465
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:34,770
- Oh, my god!
- He's under control...

466
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:38,054
for now, but I don't know
how long it will last.

467
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,396
He's not completely
human, Coreen.

468
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,990
There's a blackness there,
pure evil,

469
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:44,958
and something else
is controlling it.

470
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:46,552
He's only ten.

471
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:49,937
But the darkness
in him is ancient.

472
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,195
I'm ready to be a mother.

473
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:55,999
Ready to open my spirit
and my body to new life.

474
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm ready to be a mother.

475
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,644
I'm ready to open my spirit
and my body to new life.

476
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:04,595
I'm ready to be a mother.

477
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:06,458
Hi.

478
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,363
I'm ready to be a mother.

479
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,889
I'm ready to be a mother.

480
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:15,407
Dr. Hobman What are you
doing here?

481
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,517
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I couldn't sleep.

482
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:22,143
Dr. Hobman Each patient's
treatment is private

483
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,376
and confidential.
- I'm sorry, it's just...

484
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,728
if I'm going to do this
to myself, I want to know

485
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:28,161
what's what.
- Well, then ask.

486
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,267
Don't go around spying on other
women and their procedures.

487
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:33,241
A bath is a procedure?

488
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:36,339
It's the three 'R's', rest,
relaxation, and rejuvenation.

489
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:39,403
It's all part of the plan and
it only works if you let it.

490
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,645
Well, it is my money,
Dr. Hobman.

491
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,371
And you're free
to have it back.

492
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:46,258
This isn't a prison,
Mrs. Wheeler.

493
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:47,749
You're free to
leave at any time.

494
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:53,000
In fact, I think
that might be best.

495
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,155
- What?
- You're resisting

496
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,861
the program.
You refuse to follow

497
00:28:56,896 --> 00:29:00,220
the simplest rules.
We can't facilitate your dream

498
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,544
if you don't let us.
- Please, I want this baby.

499
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,526
Look, I really do.
Please don't make me leave.

500
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:10,988
Vicki, I understand this
is a trying time for you.

501
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:14,436
Clearly you're a take-charge woman
who's used to charting her own course.

502
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:17,379
But in this case, if you
want to achieve your

503
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:20,510
heart's desire, if you want
to beat your own biology,

504
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:24,165
you have to let someone else
steer this particular ship.

505
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,456
You have to trust us.

506
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:27,753
All right.

507
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,765
- Good night.
- Good night.

508
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,146
Coreen The changeling.

509
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:55,863
Henry The Deskin boy?

510
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:58,560
Elves, dwarves, trolls
and even fairies have

511
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,961
all been known to secretly
trade their own twisted,

512
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:03,327
unwanted offspring for a more
desirable human child.

513
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,898
These legendary creatures
want the human infant

514
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:08,026
for various reasons,
companionship, servitude,

515
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:10,103
spite and in some cases,
consumption?

516
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:12,110
Does Vicki ever talk
about having kids?

517
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,603
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know, just curious.

518
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,371
I don't know.
She hasn't said anything.

519
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,396
But then again older women
are always talking

520
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:20,387
about how their biological
clocks are ticking.

521
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,660
- Older women?
- You know what I mean.

522
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,996
What about you?
Can vampires even have kids?

523
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:28,915
When you turn someone they
can feel like your child.

524
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:32,029
But there's that vampire
territorial instinct.

525
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,919
It's not long before
you want to kill them.

526
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:37,782
Oh, so like other real kids
and their parents.

527
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:40,611
Pretty much.
But I feel as though I miss it.

528
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,979
The good elves, blah, blah,
blah, blah... the evil,

529
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:52,446
dark elves find solace in the dark
spaces and delight in the torment of man.

530
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:53,867
The dark elves.

531
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:58,961
A Swartalfen is an evil
elf from proto-Germanic myth

532
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,143
who impregnates women
with his demon seed.

533
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:04,268
As the children of these
Dark Elves grow older,

534
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:06,773
they begin to spread death and
destruction wherever they go.

535
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:09,709
They are the Alfenkindren.

536
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,858
That boy tonight.

537
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:16,001
And Vicki's in their den.

538
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:44,132
Vicki Nine months ago...

539
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,182
yesterday.

540
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,708
Hydrotherapy.

541
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,389
Hydrotherapy...

542
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:59,901
Hydrotherapy...
yes, yes, yes.

543
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:01,196
Jonah.

544
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,418
You are not my type.

545
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:21,909
Come on, come on, come on...

546
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:34,185
Mlke Doc, you're killing me. It's way
too early in the morning for statistics.

547
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,206
Mohadevan Those are the test
results from your samples.

548
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:38,624
Yeah, you care to translate?

549
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:42,954
Well, the soil sample
produced a concoction of herbs,

550
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:46,899
cohosh, red clover blossom,
dong quay, chastetree berry.

551
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,667
Care to guess what
they have in common?

552
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,543
They all taste disgusting?

553
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:52,842
And are all believed
to facilitate conception.

554
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:55,143
Really.
How about the other sample?

555
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:58,446
Well, neither sample would
harm someone, but the second

556
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:01,714
one could make someone quite
happy, sleepy, and compliant.

557
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,588
You're saying
it's a compliancy cocktail?

558
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:04,488
Precisely.

559
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:17,213
Yeah, this is Mike Wheeler. I'd
like to talk with my wife, Vicki.

560
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,686
Marlisse, hi!

561
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:26,210
- Hi!
- How're you doing?

562
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,992
- What are you doing?
- Okay, listen to me.

563
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,290
You have to stop
drinking that stuff.

564
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:32,676
It's dangerous for the baby.
- What are you talking about?

565
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,540
Dr. Hobman would never
do anything to risk

566
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:36,370
the health of a baby.
- My friend is a doctor

567
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:37,994
and she says that
that mixture of herbs

568
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,045
is dangerous for you
and the baby.

569
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,238
- The baby.
- Yes, all right?

570
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,742
Listen to me.
Just do what I say, okay?

571
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:48,211
Promise me you
won't drink anymore.

572
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:51,785
I promise.

573
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,236
All right, I'll be back.

574
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,744
- Oh hi, Kate.
- Fax from Vicki.

575
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,884
- Oh, perfect.
- "Miss you, baby.

576
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,092
Don't forget to check
out the foreman's crew... "

577
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:04,083
Thank you.
"... before we commit

578
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:05,777
...to the renos...
- Thank you.

579
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:07,401
...XO, Vicki. "
Is there something

580
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:09,552
you're not telling me?
- It would take days.

581
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,813
"Foreman's crew. "

582
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:23,499
Ow, hey!

583
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,280
Enough of that baby.

584
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,472
OH!

585
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,585
How did you meet Dr. Hobman?

586
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,074
What do you
know about my baby?

587
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,713
- What happened?
- I did what you said.

588
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:40,990
I stopped drinking that green
goop this morning and I saw

589
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,104
something that wasn't right.

590
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,523
You saw it the other day.

591
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:45,920
Okay, tell me about
the hydrotherapy.

592
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,485
You go into a tub.

593
00:34:49,063 --> 00:34:50,990
It's like a sensory
deprivation tank.

594
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,122
You repeat a mantra.

595
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,938
It's just a guided relaxation.

596
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:57,968
Now you see, everyone
who's gotten pregnant here

597
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:00,025
has one thing in common.
Hydrotherapy.

598
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,479
It doesn't make any sense.
It's just a bath.

599
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:05,212
Something happens in that
bath, okay, and I have reason

600
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:07,911
to believe that you and your
baby are at risk, all right?

601
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:09,178
Just let me get
you out of here.

602
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,388
All you need to do is say yes.

603
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,802
- Yes.
- Okay, we're going

604
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:15,126
to tell them we're going
to get some air.

605
00:35:17,402 --> 00:35:19,748
No one goes outside,
Vicki, rules are rules.

606
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:21,424
We're just going
to get some air.

607
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,056
What are you doing
to these women?

608
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,702
I'm helping them.
Just like I'll be helping you

609
00:35:29,737 --> 00:35:32,925
later tonight.
Don't make a fuss, Vicki.

610
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,638
You'll upset the
pregnant ladies...

611
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:38,101
and me.
UH!

612
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:57,184
You found him?
That's great!

613
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:58,760
Um... when was that?

614
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:02,903
1942 to 1960?

615
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,770
What was he doing back then?

616
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:10,418
A GP?
You've got to be kidding me.

617
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,522
Listen, do you have a photo
of him from back then?

618
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,218
Yeah.
- You and the ladies

619
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:19,926
toda.
- Uh... just a minute.

620
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,620
A friend of yours
got stopped at the door.

621
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,070
Pushed the metal detector
into the red zone.

622
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:27,840
We thought we were under siege
but she seems to be

623
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,653
some kind of attack gardener.

624
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,974
Mike Can you fax me
that photo right away?

625
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:42,594
Okay, what's in the bag?

626
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:46,404
Henry and I think it's a Swartalfen,
an evil elf from the Norse myth.

627
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,087
I thought elves were
supposed to be good.

628
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:53,573
Light elves are. But the Swartalfen,
a dark elf, is pure evil, grotesque.

629
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:56,466
They used to switch
their babies for ours.

630
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,798
The changelings are supposed
to grow up and kill their

631
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,166
parents, but most people
notice the difference.

632
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,286
- Yeah.
- They're breeding with us

633
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,501
to spread death and despair.
Their spawn, the Alfenkindren

634
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,287
are sociopaths,
fledgling serial killers.

635
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:11,610
Okay, wonderful news.
I guess that lets a lot

636
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,703
of distraught parents
off the hook.

637
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:15,677
Henry caught one about
to kill another child.

638
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:18,507
He's only ten years old,
and he's already a killer.

639
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,867
And what's all this?

640
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:22,697
According to legend,
the Swartalfen worked

641
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:25,070
the forges for the gods.
They have a pathological

642
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:27,811
hatred for iron.
I'hoping this will kill it.

643
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:29,981
What?
You're hoping?

644
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,696
The only other information
I found on killing evil elves

645
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:34,336
involves rolling
a twenty-sided dice.

646
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,987
We've got to stop that
doctor before it's too late.

647
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:39,374
Well, it's not the doctor.

648
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:46,735
It's him.

649
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:49,079
I'll call Henry.

650
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,548
Oh!

651
00:37:57,731 --> 00:37:59,258
- Miss me?
- Oh...

652
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:01,302
More than you know.
- We've got to go.

653
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:03,304
Mike's outside.
It's too dangerous for you here.

654
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:04,293
Tell me about it.

655
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:07,290
Hide!
Okay, wait for my signal.

656
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:12,185
Marlisse has
gone into labour.

657
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,370
Our encounter will
have to wait awhile.

658
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,036
- Go to hell!
- You're upset now.

659
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:20,656
Once you feel that new life growing
inside you you'll change your mind.

660
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:25,887
Oh!

661
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,762
Was any of that a signal?
Because if it was,

662
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:29,605
I completely missed it.
- No, you did fine.

663
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,904
- That's Jonah?
- The nurse.

664
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,891
He gives t women
a therapeutic bath,

665
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:35,285
and they come out pregnant.
- With his evil spawn.

666
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,311
He's a Swartalfen.
- He's a what?

667
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:40,065
Just get to the good part.
- Anything that's iron

668
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,797
should kill it.
I'm supposed to get you

669
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:43,495
out of here
and rendezvous with Mike.

670
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:45,383
I think we're going
to plan 'B'.

671
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:05,771
She's in labour.
There's nothing we can do

672
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:07,715
for her now and the children
aren't in any danger.

673
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,035
- She's scared to death.
- We return when we're

674
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,321
better prepared.
- No, we are ending this now.

675
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:24,672
Henry Vicki!
Vicki Henry!

676
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:30,424
A beautiful baby boy,
Marlisse.

677
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,649
Mitch...
Mitch should be here.

678
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:37,410
Hobman I'll make sure
he's called.

679
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:39,573
Hi.

680
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:49,979
Henry.
Vicki!

681
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:51,406
Henry!

682
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,122
Oh, crap!

683
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,169
I guess iron
really does work.

684
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:13,567
- What?
- Compliments of Coreen.

685
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:16,370
- It's gone.
- So does that mean

686
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:18,653
we're going to kill this thing?
- Damn straight, it does.

687
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,697
- Jonah, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

688
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:30,658
The baby?
- Hale and hearty.

689
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:33,419
Another boy.
It must be the water.

690
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:34,950
May I?

691
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,584
Swartalfen So beautiful.

692
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:46,504
Henry, The baby!

693
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:48,611
Feierlich menschen!

694
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:55,668
Come on!
COME ON!

695
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,430
Give me back my baby!

696
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:30,919
So?
You still want a baby?

697
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,562
Mitch Marlisse!

698
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:44,294
Rachel lost the baby.

699
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,229
The Swartalfen's
last act of violence.

700
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:51,873
Is Marlisse's
baby one of them?

701
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:54,538
The connection to the
Swartalfen was broken

702
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:58,890
when it died, but I can still
sense darkness within it.

703
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:03,118
Well, let's just hope it takes after
its mother's side of the family.

704
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,719
