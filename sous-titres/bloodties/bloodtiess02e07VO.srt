1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,600
come on, let's keep going.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,500
that was awesome.???

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
say that after we???

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,400
maybe we should 

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
it was???

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,200
We're in.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
Look at that.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,300
All the goodies.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,300
"Manejer
con cuidajo."

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,100
I think that's Mexican.
Know what?

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,400
I always thought
mummies came from Egypt.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,600
I mean, who knew they
had mummies in Mexico?

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,400
It's not Mexican, dumb ass.
It's Incan.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,400
Where's Inca?

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,400
It's what they used call Mexico before
the Mexicans invaded.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Come on.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,400
What the hell's this?
Where's all the gold?

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
The brochure said the Incas
hid the goodies inside the bundle.

19
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
what did I tell ya?

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,300
Sweet.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,800
But we're just getting started.
Get these other boxes open.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
Ron?!

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,700
This...this is just
all a mistake, right?

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,400
I mean, we just opened up
the wrong box.

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,600
Wendell!

26
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
I need you.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
Serve me and you will live.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
blood ties s2e7

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,300
You made a mistake
entering my home.

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,800
Who are you?

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,700
That's not a bad dream,
that's a full on nightmare.

34
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,200
But you know what?I used to have a re-occurring
nightmare when I was in the academy.

35
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,900
I used to dream that my
bedroom was full of snakes.

36
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
Interesting.

37
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,600
One word about Freud
and I'm going to put a stake in your heart.

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Vicki, what I'm trying to tell you is, 

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,800
it's not the specifics of the dream 
that are disturbing, 

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,200
it's
the fact that I dreamt at all.

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,600
From sunrise to sunset, for all
intents and purposes, I'm dead.

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,700
Well, something
has to be different.

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,000
Could it have been
someone you ate?

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm afraid it might be
something much more serious than that.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,300
Because a vampire's life
isn't natural,

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,400
neither is our death.

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,100
Because we live so long, 
we can sense when we're going to die.

48
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,700
What are you saying?
You know when it's your time?

49
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,800
Assuming nobody puts
a stake through our hearts,

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,900
we decide when to go.

51
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,400
Like the Inuit elders, 

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,000
they would leave their families
and walk out onto an ice floe.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, but Henry, you
don't have a death wish.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
No?
I keep working with you.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, I'm pretty sure
there's another explanation.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,600
All right, I'm going to find out
what it is and we'll stop this.

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,200
I'll kick you the file
when we're done.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Hold-up squad's
thrilled to see us.

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Yeah, it seems
we stepped on some toes.

60
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,300
I think the guys that did this are good 
for a string of jackings.

61
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,700
Yeah, well, when the bad guys graduate 
to murder it's our job.

62
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,900
No wonder Egyptian
mummies get all the press...

63
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,000
no diamond covered sarcophagus,
no gold jewelry.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
No, nothing they left anyway.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm going to see if they were able to 
life any prints off the truck.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Can I get forensics over here!

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,100
What have you got?

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I want the coroner
to take a look at this.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,400
I think it's been a couple thousand years
since it's been on our watch.

71
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,300
Make sure we get a work
up of the neck area here.Okay, guys?

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,900
And get a tissue sample...
Hey! Hey!

73
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,700
"To see the sun in a
dream symbolizes peace of mind,

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,500
enlightenment, tranquility,
fortune, goodwill and insight.

75
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,400
It is a good omen to have the
sun shining in your dream."

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm the vampire.

77
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,000
Right. Bad omen.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,700
Maybe it's about
you're missing the sun?

79
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,300
Which still wouldn't
explain why I'm dreaming in the first place.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
You know what?

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,900
I don't think we're going to
find the answer in a dream book.

82
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,600
Well, I've got some
stuff on sundials.

83
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,100
Yeah, but what
if it's not about the sun.

84
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,300
You know, you said you saw
a guy in the dream,

85
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,600
what did he look like?

86
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,300
He was big.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
He wore vestments
of some kind, like this.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
And he had a head band
that looked like that.

89
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
Some pretty good details
for somebody who didn't see anything.

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Maybe it's Mayan or Aztec.

91
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
No, it's too primitive.
I think it's Incan.

92
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,800
Who knew Professor McAllister's
Meso American history

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
would be good for something
other than picking up boys.

94
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,200
Maybe he's trying
to warn you.

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,400
No.
He's a threat.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Vicki, I think he might be real.

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't think this is something
you can help me with.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Henry, I'm not going
to let you die over something you saw in a dream.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Good.

100
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Each one give me more life,
more awareness.

101
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,600
You can't keep doing this.
People are going to notice.

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I need more.

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Like the mummy in the movie?

104
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,300
To regain what I had
I need a special kind of soul.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I sense one in this place.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, yeah? Who is it?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,900
An undying one, like myself.

108
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,000
Another mummy?

109
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
A nightwalker.

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Once I get it's aya,
no power on earth will stop me.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,100
Oh, good.

112
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,900
The amulet, where is it?

113
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,800
The what?

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,900
The amulet that imprisoned me!
I want it.

115
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,200
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
Ron said that it was his.

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,300
He must have stashed it
before you did the things.

117
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
I wouldn't know where...
>> Give it to me!

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Okay, okay, all right,
all right.

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
You know what?
Screw you, all right?

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
I'm walking.
No, no, no!

121
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,000
You try to stop me, or get in
my way, I'm going to use this.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
And how do you intend
to do that, Wendell?

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,700
What you feel is five years
being taken from you.

124
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,500
Do I try for ten?
>> No, please.

125
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,500
 I forgive you, Wendell,

126
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
because you're going to make it all better.
>> No...!

127
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,200
It's finished.
Nothing can stop me now.

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,200
This dwelling of yours,
it's not suitable for my return.

129
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,900
I need something
a little more elegant.

130
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,600
Something with Internet.

131
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,700
I got a problem.

132
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah? Well, if you keep picking it,
it's never going to heal.

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
No, this is your
kind of problem.

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,500
And it's going to hit 11
on the freak dial,even by your standards.

135
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,300
Really?

136
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, because you see, the last
10 hours of my life 

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,100
have been all about my vampire partner
have nightmares

138
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,500
of burning alive in the sun.

139
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah, okay you're still up
there, buty isten to this,

140
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,800
I found a dead guy, who looks
to be around a 1000 years old.

141
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
The thing is, he's got a tattoo
that he probably got in the last ten.

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,300
Last time I checked there wasn't
much business in doing ink on dead folks.

143
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
It's a spider-web design,

144
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
the same kind that the
Regent Park Titans wear.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,300
It's one of the guys
that hijacked that mummy on the way to the museum.

146
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,100
Problem is,
I didn't find a mummy.

147
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,100
And you think the mummy
has something to do with it?

148
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,600
What else am I going
to think these days.

149
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,000
Was the mummy Incan?

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
How the hell did you know that?

151
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,700
The guy in Henry's
nightmares is...Incan.

152
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Okay, look, it's not bad enough 
that half of the unsolved crimes in the city 

153
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,800
happen to have some kind of
 supernatural element to them,

154
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,500
but you two have to be 
personally connected to all of them.

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
I know.

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
Would you mind talking
to someone about this

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
because it's getting
a little old for me.

158
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,800
So why does
an Incan mummy go AWOL?

159
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,900
I'm already on it.

160
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,400
The way I see it,

161
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,800
it's a classic.
It has to be a curse,

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
like in the movies.

163
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Somebody took the wrong thing 
from the wrong tomb...

164
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
or it's looking for it's lost lover 
and all of a sudden, it's mmies gone wild.

165
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Okay, before I go about
sending a citywide alert for some guy 

166
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,000
lurching around covered
in bandages, 

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,300
I'd really like to assess our other options
first, if you don't mind.

168
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,900
Yeah.Okay, why don't you give me 
a list of any of the Titan members

169
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,300
that fit the general description 
and I'll run them down for you?

170
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
Way ahead of you.

171
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,900
Thank you, for doing this.

172
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,800
If this thing has come back,
what the hell does it want?

173
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,700
That's a Henry question.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,800
great!

175
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Okay, where are we at?

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,700
The show's on loan
from a museum in Peru.

177
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
I got the catalogue.

178
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,800
What is it with
museums and urns?

179
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,500
Who gets a kick out
of looking at urns?

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,700
Ha, ha, don't ask me.
I always went straight to the dinosaurs.

181
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
So what are we checking?

182
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,000
I've been through the
manifest five times.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
There are two crates full
of gold and silver masks,

184
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,100
coins, pearls, statues,
and nothing's missing.

185
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah, except for the mummy
that forensic vaporized.

186
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,400
These guys make a clean
getaway and then abandon the swag in a rented garage?

187
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe.

188
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,000
You know wfromhaheay tt the
wrappings were pulled apart on the mummy bundle, 

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
what they
were looking for was inside.

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,700
Well, the paperwork says
it's a relatively new find.

191
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,900
According to the museum,

192
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,200
the only things that might have been valuable
were a ring and a necklace.

193
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,700
But I don't see how
they could be precious enough to give up on everything else.

194
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,300
Well, maybe the thieves got an eyeful of 
the guy inside and they panicked and took off.

195
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Maybe. Maybe there was something 
in the crate that wasn't in the books.

196
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,100
It was from Peru.

197
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,400
No, no.
I already checked that out.

198
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
The drug squad came up
with nothing.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Did you find out anything on
the guy who rented the garage?

200
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,500
The owner was paid cash.

201
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,900
His description was illuminating.

202
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,500
Some guy with dark hair.

203
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,100
Beautiful.

204
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,900
There's got to be something more 
to it that we're just not seeing,

205
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
something outside the box.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,600
Yeah, something like that.

207
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,900
Bingo.

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Hey, Mike, it's me.

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,700
Yeah, I was running down that
list of gang members you gave me

210
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,900
and I've got a hit.

211
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
Like, I found your mummy thief.

212
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,500
You have a fine home.

213
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
I'll be happy here.

214
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,400
Huh...?

215
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
Nice trees.
Double garage.

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,500
An ancient gold amulet
and no one reports it missing?

217
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,000
The curator didn't
want to say anything

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,600
until he called Peru.

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,400
Said if it got in the papers it'd be a thing.

220
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,100
And now?

221
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
It's a thing.

222
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, at least we got the name 
of the guy you dusted.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's Ron Newbury.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,300
He rented the garage.
Here's your receipt.

225
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,500
I found it in the trash.

226
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,900
Do we know
who he's working with?

227
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,700
No, there was nothing
in the trailer.

228
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,900
Unless that corpse you found
had a day timer on it,

229
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,700
we're out of luck.

230
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,100
You'll have to pull his phone records,
see who he's talking to.

231
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,500
Did you used to be a cop
or is that just my imagination 'cause...?

232
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm telling you,sometimes not being one
is very liberating.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Do you know how long it would have 
taken me to get a warrant for that?


234
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,000
Vicki.

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
This is
worse than we thought.

236
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
The guy who used to resign in
that mummy bundle, 

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
he used to be a priest who wanted to
take over the throne of Cuzco.

238
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,800
See what happens when you
mix religion and politics?

239
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
He ran the temple of
Wiraqocha, the Incan creator.

240
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,100
Now he names himself Pachacamac,
another name for the creator or the sun god.

241
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,300
Yeah, no self esteem issues there.

242
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
We're just getting started

243
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,700
because then Pachacamac
decides he wants more power,

244
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,600
so he switches teams to
worship Supay, the god of death.

245
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,900
Great. You know, for once why 
can't we just have a god of...

246
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,900
oh, I don't know, let's say,fluffy bunnies
and long walks holding hands?

247
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,300
Apparently the guy's
super charismatic.

248
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Suddenly we have this whole
cult following Supay,

249
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
raping and killing as worship.

250
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
That's when he decides
to take over the kingdom.

251
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,800
Supay promises to help
Pachacamac by turning day into night 

252
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
so he
and his followers can invade.

253
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,300
So day turns to night,
Pachacamac makes his move.

254
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,400
And becomes king.

255
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,100
Not quite.

256
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,600
The black-out...it turns out
to just be an eclipse.

257
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
So as soon as the lights
come back up, 

258
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,500
Pachacamac and his cult are captured.

259
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,600
His followers are tossed off the side of a mountain,

260
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,200
sacrificed to Wiraqocha.

261
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,500
So why didn't they just
toss him over as well?

262
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,900
They did.
They went all Rasputin.

263
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,100
Everything they did,
nothing would kill him.

264
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,600
Yeah, when you're
friends with the god of death,

265
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
you get a 'get out of hell
free' card.

266
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay, wait a second.
If he didn't die,

267
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,900
then who's wrapped up
in that mummy bundle?

268
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,200
I said he didn't die.

269
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
I didn't say they didn't bury him.

270
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
They buried him alive?

271
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,600
And they kept his aya
bound in a mystic talisman.

272
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,700
Which is what this thing is.

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Right.

274
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,100
When your thieves took it off
of him, they woke Pachacamac up.

275
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,500
If this is true and
there is a mummy walking around out there, 

276
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,200
again, what
the hell does it want?

277
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,600
Well, I'm thinking death and
power are the top of its list.

278
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
My question is how
do we stop him?

279
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
I can dig up what
I can on the amulet.

280
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
What, like somebody left
instructions for you?

281
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
Well, if Henry's dreaming
about him, 

282
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,100
they have some kind of connection.

283
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,800
So I think Henry's our best source
to lead us to Pachacamac.

284
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,900
You think you can find him
through his dreams?

285
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,600
According to Henry,
Pachacamac wants to find him.

286
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,700
So much power
to kill, so many offered up.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
This is good.

288
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,500
I understand why
Supay has awakened me.

289
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,800
The world is ready.
>> Good.

290
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,100
So I guess you don't
need me anymore?

291
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,500
Can I go now 'cause...?

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,800
I need you Wendell.

293
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,900
I need many more.

294
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,900
They will come.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,200
Their death will be glorious.

296
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,300
Henry!

297
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,800
>> I need you!
>> Oh, you're just a dream.

298
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
>> No!
Not a dream!

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,300
Fitzroy.

300
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Henry Fitzroy.

301
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,800
I will find him
and my life will be forever.

302
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,900
Did we have a date?

303
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,800
In your dreams.
It happened again, didn't it?

304
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,600
I saw him.

305
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
The Incan guy in your apartment.

306
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,100
Whatever's happening to me, it's building.

307
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,800
Henry, I don't think this is a dream.

308
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,100
And I don't think it's some kind of vampire death wish.

309
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,500
I think this person is real.

310
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
An Incan mummy went missing and
I think it's revived itself.

311
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,700
He wants my memories.

312
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,800
He wants my power.

313
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,900
He wants my soul.

314
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,400
Good.

315
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
That's not the first word
that came to my mind.

316
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,700
No, if there is some kind
of connection between the two of you 

317
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
then that is
how we'll flush him out.

318
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,000
Well, that's not a problem.

319
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,900
He wants me.

320
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,700
He knows my name.

321
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,800
All right, then the next time you dream, 

322
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
you are going
to control this.

323
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,900
You are going to
communicate with him.

324
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,000
You are going to find him.

325
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
And how am I supposed to do that?

326
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,500
I haven't dreamt in five centuries.

327
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,100
It's happening in your head, isn't it?

328
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
You have to find a way to guide it.

329
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,200
When we find him,
I get the first crack.

330
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,000
If this Pachacamac is real,

331
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
he'll find out who's the wolf 
and who's the lamb.

332
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,000
Pachacamac's not just a
mummy, he's a friggin' sorcerer.

333
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,500
And you ask why I hate magic?

334
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,000
What if he's coming to you
in your dreams 

335
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
because he can't find you and he's
trying to draw you out?

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,400
Then I'll give him his
fondest desires 

337
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,100
and I'll tear his throat out for him.

338
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,200
Aw, please, do not go
all vampire macho on me.

339
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
If he can hurt you in your
dreams, imagine what he can do to you in person.

340
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Henry, he serves
their god of death!

341
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
He'll die just
like everybody else.

342
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,700
He doesn't!
That's the point!

343
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,400
He wants your life force,
and if you go out there

344
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
you'll be handing it
to him on a silver platter.

345
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
You'll just be
making him stronger.

346
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,200
There's no other way.

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,800
Okay.

348
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,000
What's your suggestion?

349
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,300
 I don't know how
to stop him yet.

350
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,900
But I want to keep you under
wraps during the daytime.

351
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,500
You want to guard me?

352
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,300
I'll catch some
shut-eye, too.

353
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,800
The nice thing about vampire
sleep is you don't snore.

354
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Listen, I'll be back by dawn
and please, do not leave here.

355
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,300
I guess I'll have to
order dinner in tonight.

356
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
No, Fitzroy.

357
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,800
Yeah, Henry, is he in?

358
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,700
Where is he?

359
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,800
I don't know.
He must have an unlisted number or something.

360
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,500
Hey, I'm a thief, okay?

361
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not a P.I.
You want me to rip off his stereo, 

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,200
I'm the guy.
This, I mean...

363
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,700
An Aya like his can
not be hidden.

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,300
There will be signs
even if he wishes anonymity.

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
He will be known.

366
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Now run off like a good
little thief and find him.

367
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,100
Okay.

368
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,700
All right.
Well, thanks for the heads up.

369
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,400
Yeah, I'll talk to ya later.
Bye.

370
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,900
So, you want to tell
me why we're running a Ron Newbury?

371
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,700
Uh...is that my caffeine fix?

372
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,200
Tell me where you got
the lead?

373
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,500
Anonymous tip.
>> Anonymous?

374
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,000
Spelled V-I...
>> I do have other sources, you know.

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,700
You used to have other sources, 
but then you stopped being a detective

376
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,500
Oh, really? Well, is that the insight 
that got you bumped up to detective?

377
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,900
Why, it's truly amazing.

378
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Truly.

379
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
You're shutting me out.

380
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,100
Vicki knows things about
my own cases that you won't even tell me.

381
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,900
Come on, Kate.

382
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,200
If you don't want to work
with me, fine.

383
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,900
But I can't keep covering your
back if you don't have mine.

384
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey, listen to me.
This tip is good.

385
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay?

386
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,200
Want to help me run
this guy or not?

387
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,200
And it leads us where?

388
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,400
Suspected associate on a similar heist,

389
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,700
a perennial loser named Wendell Bauer.

390
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,800
All right, you're cranky
this morning, aren't ya?

391
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
Since when do I take
double cream?

392
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
You want me to shoot you?

393
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm just saying...

394
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm guessing
it's not an open house.

395
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,300
Wendell Bauer?

396
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,600
Police!

397
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Go on through.

398
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,200
Looks like someone
left in a hurry.

399
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Do you think he saw us
from the window?

400
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah, could be.

401
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,700
Damm it.

402
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,100
You found anything?

403
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,500
No, nothing.

404
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,200
Mike?

405
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,800
Yeah.

406
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,500
You so owe me.
>> Why?

407
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
Is this supposed
to be this dull?

408
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,100
Since when are you
an art collector?

409
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,200
We found it.
We know this Newbury's a bad guy.

410
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Score one for the good guys,huh.

411
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
you bet.

412
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,700
i guess you can thank this for me

413
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
sure

414
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,700
mike, where u have been? 
we were trying to hold u for hours.

415
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,200
we foud ???'s place.

416
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,100
there was another body there.

417
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,700
a woman.

418
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,400
what about wendell and mummy?

419
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,100
gone.

420
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,500
vicki u are not hearing me.

421
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
another person is dead.

422
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,600
mike, i hear u.

423
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
ok, henry will be the next. 
that's why we have to stop him.

424
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
one more thing.

425
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
foud the amulet.

426
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,100
Pachacamac why did he leave it behind.

427
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,700
u said it was supposed made of gold, 
but i think he did something to it.

428
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,500
vicki

429
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
are u still there?

430
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,700
Yeah. Listen, I'll call you back 
if I find anything.

431
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,600
Yeah.

432
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,400
Well, got a lead?

433
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,900
You don't suppose the Incans
made a back-up amulet, do you?

434
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
It's toast.

435
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,500
But it was the only thing
that kept Pachacamac dead...ish.

436
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,500
No, I don't think so.

437
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,700
The amulet's just an object.

438
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,300
It's magic that's controlling him.

439
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,400
So what we have to do
is find that magic.

440
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,300
It's still out there.
We just have to find a way to channel it.

441
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,100
So all we need is someone who's a powerful 
magician and a grimoire to work a spell from.

442
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,900
My marks have power and I know someone
who has a grimoire.

443
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,600
No, it's way too dangerous.

444
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Do you think I want to?

445
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
Pachacamac has already
killed two people.

446
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,900
Henry will kill you if he
finds out you're doing magic.

447
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,700
And he'll die if I don't.

448
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,700
I'm willing to take the risk.

449
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,600
So Coreen's
babysitting me now?

450
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,500
You have a heart murmur.

451
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,800
Since I was a kid.

452
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,100
Nothing to worry about.

453
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,900
Great.
Vampire MD.

454
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,300
I can see prime time
possibilities now.

455
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,700
I could smell you, too.

456
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,800
For some reason, nobody ever
likes when I say that.

457
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,300
You guys don't have to do this.

458
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
I can handle myself.

459
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,600
Yes, a tazer's very
effective against evil sorcerer types.

460
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
And I've got Mike and Vicki on speed dial.

461
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,400
I feel safer already.

462
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,700
Look Henry, she doesn't
have to handle anything,

463
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,900
you just need to stay put
with the blinds drawn and the doors locked.

464
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Exactly.

465
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
Exactly.

466
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,900
Do you know where he is?

467
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,800
I have some leads.

468
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
And what are you going to do when you find him?

469
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,900
Whatever it takes.

470
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,800
I've looked after myself
for a long time, Vicki.

471
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,100
I'm not going to run
from a bad dream.

472
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
When I wake up,

473
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,100
I'm going hunting.

474
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,700
I can handle it.

475
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,600
I have to handle it.

476
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,700
And you accuse me
of being macho.

477
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,800
It's just ever since I was
marked I have been drawing evil to this city,

478
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
to the people I care most about.

479
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm not going to let this guy
take your soul.

480
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,900
I've lived a long time,
Vicki.

481
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:56,200
Yeah, and you don't want
to miss your 500th birthday, do you?

482
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,700
I just want to see you
blow out the candles.

483
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,900
Don't do anything stupid.

484
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,900
Henry...

485
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
Sweet dreams.

486
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,900
He's got
the Necronomicon

487
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
and one of the books of blood.

488
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,400
Who knew these were real?

489
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,700
Coreen, we only
have a few hours, okay?

490
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,800
So I need you to find whatever
spell will protect souls.

491
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
Well if it exists, it's
going to be in one of these.

492
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,800
All right, I have to go,
but if anyone tries to get in here...

493
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll call.

494
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll call.
Are you sure you're okay with this?

495
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,900
I have to be.

496
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,700
Oh, and the first rule
of babysitting, no boys.

497
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,500
I found your immortal
super guy.

498
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Where?

499
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,100
I...I don't know yet,
but I know what he does.

500
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,300
Then you haven't found him.

501
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,800
I have to...
The dude draws comics.

502
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I mean, I would have thought
that a vampire would have been like...

503
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,800
a prince or something,

504
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,900
but he draws these
horror comics.

505
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,600
Good work.
Only one thing.

506
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Wha...?

507
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,500
They're called
graphic novels.

508
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,700
You get Crowley-ed?
I wish.

509
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,400
No, I destroyed evidence.

510
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,400
What kind of evidence?

511
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,300
Back at Bauer's apartment,
a mummified body.

512
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,700
That woman that I called
you about.

513
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,400
Kate was going to see it
and I thought,

514
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
"How the hell am I going
to explain this?"

515
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,900
So I turned it to dust.

516
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,400
I know it's hard, Mike.

517
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,000
You did the right thing.
>> No, Vicki.

518
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,400
I did what you would do.

519
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,800
I'm a cop.
Cops don't destroy evidence.

520
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,200
Yeah, but this doesn't sound
like something that the courts would find admissible, however.

521
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Yeah, and when exactly did
that become my call?

522
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Tell me that.
Huh?

523
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,900
You know, I never crossed the
line before you got involved with Fitzroy.

524
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,500
And even then, it was only after
we caught this boogeyman.

525
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,400
This is completely different.
>> No, it's not.

526
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
You couldn't have told
anyone about this.

527
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,600
I trashed a body.

528
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
No body, no evidence.

529
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,200
No evidence, no DNA.

530
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,700
No way to find out
who this poor girl was,

531
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,100
so I can tell her parents
that she's gone.

532
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,500
Oh, and just to ice that cake,
I lied to my partner.

533
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,200
You didn't have any choice.

534
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,400
You ever lie to me
when we were partners?

535
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,900
You're trying to protect her.

536
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,300
You want to get Kate
dragged into this, too?

537
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,600
I can't keep playing
in your world, Vicki.

538
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,300
Hey, you brought this to me.
This is your world, too.

539
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
>> Can't be.
>> Why?

540
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Because it's getting too hard
to deal with what's actually out there?

541
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,900
No, because it's too easy.

542
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,300
If I can't play by the rules,
I can't wear the badge.

543
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
This is your nightmare,
Vicki, it's not mine.

544
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,500
The bad guys, they're
supposed to carry guns.

545
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,800
They're not supposed
to have fangs and claws.

546
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,200
They're not suppose to be able
to suck the life force out of somebody 

547
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,500
so he looks like beef
jerky, for crying out loud.

548
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,100
I mean, this is insane!

549
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,700
I can't keep doing this.

550
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,100
I'm a cop.

551
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,300
They really use eye of newt?

552
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
It's a classic.

553
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
We don't have time for spells
that need ingredients

554
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,300
we'd have to track on eBay.

555
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,800
He got his powers from the god of death.

556
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
It's not going to be all abracadabra.

557
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,700
What else have you got?

558
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,900
Human sacrifice might work.

559
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,800
Don't tempt me.

560
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,200
I haven't seen as many 'thees'
and 'thous' since I studied Hamlet.

561
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,800
Some of it's a little arcane.

562
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,000
What?

563
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,300
I don't think so.

564
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
Would this do what I think it does?

565
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,300
In theory.

566
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,200
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

567
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
I asked you to show
me all the options.

568
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
How is this an option?

569
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,700
Vicki, it's way too dangerous.

570
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,800
would you like
that I do it myself?

571
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
Turn myself into a frog?

572
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,000
No, I don't like this?

573
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
Henry would never agree.

574
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
Well, I'm not going to ask him.

575
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,000
Prep what we need and I will put these books 
back before he wakes up.

576
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
>> Where are you?
>> Fitzroy!

577
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,000
>> Why are you here?
>> I like your work.

578
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
The shadows.

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,300
>> I know what you are.
>> And I know what you are.

580
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,700
I've already taken in
pieces of you.

581
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,700
I like it.
>> I'm not afraid of you.

582
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,000
I can destroy you.
>> Deep down you know you can't.

583
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,300
You know it's your time.
>> You're lying.

584
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,900
You're using what you
found in my brain.

585
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
He's not lying.

586
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,700
Please, just come to him.

587
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,400
Make it easy on the rest of us.

588
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
>> You won't hurt her.
>> Wrong again, Henry.

589
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,400
You know what I can do.
Meet me and she lives.

590
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,400
Henry?

591
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,800
I know where he is.

592
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,700
You saw?
>> He showed me.

593
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,400
I have to go.
>> No, you can't.

594
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
>> I don't have a choice.

595
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,000
Vicki, you've done enough.
I have to do this alone.

596
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Henry, he's a sorcerer.

597
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,500
Who's going to offer up millions of lives
to honour his gods.

598
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,100
I have to stop him.

599
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
This house.
This address.

600
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,500
You can track it?

601
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,400
I will.

602
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
Pachacamac underestimates me.

603
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,100
I can destroy him.
Let's go.

604
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,000
>> Henry!
>> Let's go, let's go.

605
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,300
>> I'm so sorry.

606
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,100
I can not let him kill you.

607
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,400
Oh, my god!
You killed him!

608
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,700
He'll heal.
You'll heal, right?

609
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,000
Henry, I'm so sorry.
I had no choice.

610
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,600
He'll be okay.
You can drink my blood as soon as we're done.

611
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,500
You wouldn't...

612
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,300
It's the only way
I can save your life.

613
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Then let me die.

614
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,500
No, you don't mean that.

615
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,600
Please, before it's too late.

616
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,400
Please, we can
do this together.

617
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,400
Take this offering that we present 
and change it so it may change.

618
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,200
The blood not
brushed by daylight.

619
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,300
The herbs that thrive on dark.

620
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,500
Coreen, no.

621
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Coreen...!

622
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,400
The blood not
brushed by daylight.

623
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,600
These herbs that thrive on dark.

624
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,900
How did you know?

625
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,000
The one that would take will be taken.

626
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,400
This I command.

627
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Vicki, no.

628
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,100
You sure this won't turn
me into a blood-sucker?

629
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
What it will do
isn't much better.

630
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
Vicki, no.

631
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,800
You bastards want
a piece of me?

632
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,800
Here it is.

633
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,300
You have no idea
what you've done.

634
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,900
You could
have knocked.

635
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Knock, knock.

636
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,500
Vicki Nelson.

637
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,300
I met you in his dreams.

638
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,600
Ham and pineapple?

639
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,100
Nah, pizza this late will
just give me nightmares.

640
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,100
The trouble with consuming
souls, 

641
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,300
you pick up their bad habits.
Where's Fitzroy?

642
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,000
Henry couldn't make it.
He hasn't been sleeping well.

643
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,600
So he sent his concubine?

644
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
No one sent me.

645
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,500
I want you to take
my life instead.

646
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,200
And that's why you
brought a weapon?

647
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,900
Thought you might
need a little convincing.

648
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,200
It's rare to see such
nobility in a mere mortal

649
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,400
and such strength in a woman.

650
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,100
u have been dead for a long time

651
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,800
I sense power in you.

652
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,000
Supay will be pleased.

653
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,200
Well, whatever makes
Supay happy.

654
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,300
You'll make
an excellent meal.

655
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,800
Once I have your memories

656
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
 your friend will be
easy to find.

657
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
What have you done?

658
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,500
I poisoned my life force.

659
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,100
You may experience
a little indigestion.

660
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Henry!

661
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,000
Henry.
Coreen...

662
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
You made it!
It worked.

663
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,800
He went to feed.

664
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,800
So he's okay?
>> I offered him my blood.

665
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,500
He wouldn't even look at me.

666
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,800
Did you tell him?

667
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,900
He didn't want to hear it.

668
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,200
Okay, we should go.

669
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,600
He'll call us when he's ready.

670
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,100
Okay, so if we've
got the amulet,

671
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,700
then nothing else
is missing, right?

672
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,600
Nothing the
museum's going to admit to.

673
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,000
But this Newbury guy's
got to be somewhere.

674
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,900
You know something I don't?

675
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,900
I'm just not sold that he's
going to show up, that's all.

676
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,000
An anonymous tip?

677
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,300
Call it a hunch.

678
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,800
Something tells me
our guy is long gone.

679
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
Mike...

680
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,200
It's over.

681
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
You wanna take five.

682
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,200
We've got work to do.

683
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,800
Henry?

684
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,100
Did you come by to stab me?

685
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,000
Hey, come on.
What's a little sword wound between friends?

686
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,200
You crossed the line.

687
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,400
I know the ritual you
performed and I know the price.

688
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,100
Do you?

689
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,700
Yeah...
and it saved your life.

690
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,000
And he's dead.

691
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,200
There was another way.

692
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,300
Do you truly think my hatred for dark magic
 is some kind of affectation?

693
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,000
You fouled yourself,
with my blood.

694
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,400
Me.

695
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,100
And you brought Coreen
into their radar.

696
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,400
What did you want me to do?

697
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,000
Did you want me
to let him kill you?

698
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,700
You know what?
Between the spell, 

699
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
the blood and the marks,

700
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,100
I was pretty sure that if I didn't kill him,

701
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,700
I'd at least give him
one hell of a stomach ache.

702
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,100
You made a deal with the
devil because you were pretty sure.

703
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I didn't make
a deal with the devil.

704
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,900
Who do you think you
called with that ritual?

705
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,000
Who do you think you owe?

706
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,300
I did what I had to do.

707
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay, you have saved my life
a dozen times, and I told you,

708
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,400
I would do whatever
it took to save yours.

709
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,800
I know.

710
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,600
And I wish I could forgive you.

711
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,200
