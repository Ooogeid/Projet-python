1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,100
???

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,800
??

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,300
???

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,300
??

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,300
I've gotta rest.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
I told you, you shouldn't
have done that last hit, man.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
You've been doing too much lately.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
're not doing enough, friend.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,700
I love the venom and the
sweet venom loves me.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeah, come on we got to go.
The last night bus is in ten minutes.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,300
Don't touch me!

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,900
Fine, sleep it off.
I'll see you later.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Sweet venom.

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,600

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,600
The reaper's influence
has fallen over my sanctum.

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,400
Sorry, the reaper?
Oh, the grim...reaper.

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,900
A dead body was found
outside Lexia's club.

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,400
My sweet angel,
you read my mind.

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
Death's hand touches us all

21
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,900
but this boy's passing
might doom the Underground.

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,700
And the Underground
is the name of your bar?

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
The Underground's not a bar,
it's more of a...

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,100
Booze can for blood
sucking wannabees?

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,100
A sanctuary for children of the night,
where they can congregate.

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,800
At nine dollars a drink.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,000
I thought you said she was open to those
who choose to live alternative lifestyles.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
She is. You are.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Believe me.

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,200
Okay, here's the part
I don't understand.

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,500
If he died in the alley,

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,800
what exactly do you
want me to investigate?

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,000
I have enough problems
with the city already.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,900
I don't need them trying
to blame Dante's death on me.

35
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,400
Is there any reason to believe your
establishment might be connected to his death?

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,400
My customers
are like my children.

37
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,800
I nurture them,
like Coreen...my favourite.

38
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,200
The most spiritual
of the night breed.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,700
Okay I'll take the case.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,500
- My fee is...
- $500 a day, plus expenses.

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,700
What a sweet girl.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Do you think she uses a forklift
to g her hair that high?

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,700
Before you start,
Lexia's my friend.

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,500
After Ian died, she was
totally there for me.

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
She doesn't really strike
me as the warm, fuzzy type.

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,400
You just don't know her.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,700
Lexia is guarded
when dealing with mundanes.

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,900
Mundanes?

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
You know, normals,
outsiders.

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,400
You mean me.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,500
This is why you should let
me work the case with you.

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,200
Coreen, I don't even
know if there is a case.

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,300
And if there is, ever since I got these,
half of my cases are a horror show.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,700
I don't want to drag you into it.

55
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,800
Excuse me?

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,600
I almost became a demon bride twice.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I had my mouth stolen
by a voodoo queen.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
I can handle anything
that they throw at us.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Oh, I'm sure we'll read that
in the book of famous last words.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,700
The first thing you need to do
is find out about the dead guy.

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,200
I bet he's chalk full of clues.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,200
Did you just say'chalk full of clues'?

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm in, right?

64
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
I mean, Vicki, this is
going to be so much fun.

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know if I agree
with your definition of fun,

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
- but all right you can help.
- Yes!

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Coreen, be still,
no one likes a perky Goth.

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,600
Gene Hansen is proving to be
a bit of a conundrum.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,200
We know he was last seen alive
at around 4 o'clock in the morning.

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,200
But his physical condition
belies that estimate.

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,700
Oh!

72
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,600
Looks like
he's been dead a lot longer.

73
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,400
Area's swarmed by something.

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,300
Exactly what I was thinking.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,200
On areas not consumed by insects,
I found blisters,hives and swelling.

76
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,800
Anaphylactic shock?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
From insect bites?

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Anything could have triggered
the allergic reaction.

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700
My cousin, if she
even looks at a peanut?

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,100
Blowfish.

81
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,900
Well, these are insect bites,
and that gets Lexia off the hook.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Still, I mean that is
one hell of a bee sting.

83
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,400
We need to go to the Underground

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,300
and find out what Gene Hansen
was doing before he died.

85
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh? Underground?

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,700
I have to go change.
I can't go looking all corporate like this.

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,400
Corporate.

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,500
- Hello.
- Hey.

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,800
I got a case that's taking
a tour through weirdsville.

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,500
- You care to join?
- I'm a little tied up at the moment.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,900
I got a dead...line to meet.

92
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,500
Oh, all right, you don't
have to explain yourself to me.

93
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,700
- I've got a life.
- I thought you were dead.

94
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm busy.

95
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,000
- You're wearing that?
- You're wearing that?

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, this is strictly
a fact-finding mission,

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
- do you understand?
- Right.

98
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,200
We're here to find out what Gene Hansen
was doing the night he died.

99
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,800
I got it.

100
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
If you suspect someone,
don't accuse them.

101
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,100
Don't let on that you suspect.
Okay?

102
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,700
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.

103
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,800
You come directly to me.

104
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,900
- Do you understand?
- Okay, okay, can we just go in now?

105
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,900
All right.

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,400
Wait, wait, wait.

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,900
Don't you think
we should go in separately?

108
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,000
You don't think I fit in?

109
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,400
Yeah, sure, narc.

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,700
Okay, you take the customers.

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,400
Don't let on that
we know each other.

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,200
What?

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,500
So what are you serving?

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
This is a private club.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,300
It's okay, Wynter.
This is Vicki Nelson.

116
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,000
She's doing some work for me.

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
She'll have some questions for you.

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,500
Please feel free to give her
any assistance that she needs.

119
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,800
Taking a walk on
the dark side are we?

120
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,600
Unfortunately, I live there.

121
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,900
How long did you know Gene?

122
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
Since eighth grade.

123
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
Drama club.

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
I never should
have let him stay.

125
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,800
I should have dragged
him into that bus.

126
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,700
It's not your fault.

127
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,600
All that talk about
death's sweet embrace.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
You know what?

129
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,200
It's not sweet.

130
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,900
It hurts.

131
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,900
Did Gene have any allergies?

132
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
I can ask his mother.

133
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Absinthe and wine are
the only things Lexia drinks

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,100
so it's all we serve.

135
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,200
I've got to say I could go
for a tequila every now and then, you know?

136
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,900
And Gene Hansen, what was
he drinking the night he died?

137
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,200
Absinthe.

138
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,700
Anything else?

139
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
Not that I know of.

140
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,300
Drugs?

141
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
In a nightclub?

142
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
Half the kids here are using.

143
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,700
Did Lexia know that?

144
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,000
She'd have to be blind not to.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Yeah, she sure would.

146
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,300
Now this is truly a surprise.

147
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,700
I need your help, detective.

148
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
I don't do parking tickets.

149
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,500
It's not about parking tickets.

150
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,500
Really?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,700
Well, you must want to know
what to get Vicki for her birthday.

152
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,300
You know what?

153
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,400
Between you and me,
she really loves kitten posters.

154
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,200
This was a mistake.

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,700
Hey, hey, Fitzroy, come on.

156
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,200
Hey, come on.
Tell me, what's going on?

157
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Somebody left a dead body
on my doorstep.

158
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,200
There's another vampire
in this city.

159
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,000
And it's just getting started.

160
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,500
???

161
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,200
Under the circumstances
it made the most sense.

162
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,700
No, you totally
compromised the evidence.

163
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
I preserved the body
to the best of my ability.

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
No, you should have called the police,
that's what you should have done.

165
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
And that's why I came to you.

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
You know my life
doesn't bear scrutiny.

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,100
Isn't your job
to serve and protect?

168
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,000
Actually, I don't think that
motto was meant to extend to the undead.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
There's another vampire out there,
and this one is killing people.

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,700
Detective...
I need your help,

171
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,200
unless you'd rather me
handle this on my own.

172
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Okay.

173
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,300
Fine, what's done is done.
Let's just move on, shall we?

174
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,600
What happened?

175
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,600
This is what I know.

176
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
The body appeared
at my door around 9:00 p.m.

177
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
She was already dead.

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,200
The neck had been savaged
and she was drained of all her blood.

179
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,100
So...what? This is
the vampire equivalent of a gift basket?

180
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,400
It wasn't a present.

181
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
Vampires are solitary predators.

182
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,200
It's in our nature.
It keeps us from over populating

183
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,900
and depleting our hunting grounds.

184
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,400
He wants my territory.

185
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
- Does Vicki know about this?
- No.

186
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
And I don't want her to know.

187
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,400
I've been targeted and that
puts everyone who's close to me in danger.

188
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,800
Oh, gee...

189
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,500
Thanks for bringing me
into this.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,600
Okay, if only one of you
can work this town, 

191
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
how do I know I'm not going to
like this other vampire more than you?

192
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,300
Because I'm the devil
you know, detective.

193
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Yes, you are.

194
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,700
Okay.

195
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,300
Okay...

196
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,300
Two conditions.

197
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,600
One, we find this thing,
we put it down.

198
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,500
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
- What's the second?
- Full disclosure.

200
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,300
I ask you something, you answer.

201
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
I want to know what colour your
underwear is, you tell me.

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,800
You got it?


203
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Red. Silk, actually.

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm not actually asking,Fitzroy.

205
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
When do we start?

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
As soon as somebody phones
the police about a dead body.

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,300
Got a quarter?

208
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
I feel so bad
for that Evan guy.

209
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,400
He blames himself
for Gene's death.

210
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Does he have reason to?

211
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Typical Friday night.
Go train in from the burbs.

212
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,000
Burger and a movie
after the Underground.

213
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,100
They must have up to something.

214
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,900
Come on, you don't go out for a burger and
wind up as the main course at an insect buffet.

215
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
What are you thinking?

216
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,900
Well, if it was
an allergic reaction, 

217
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
then maybe it was
something they took.

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Were they into drugs?

219
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
No, didn't seem
like the type.

220
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,300
Yeah, people don't always
seem like the type,

221
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,100
that's why you have to ask.

222
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
You think I screwed up?

223
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,500
Coreen, you're the
investigator, right?

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,900
So you have to consider
all the options.

225
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
If it's any consolation,
if he was doing drugs,

226
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,700
chances are he wouldn't have
been honest with you about it.

227
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
But what makes you
think he was doing drugs?

228
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,100
Because they dress in black?

229
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I always
judge a person's character

230
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
based entirely on their
wardrobe decisions.

231
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,100
If Lexia knew that drugs
were for sale in her place...

232
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,800
No, I know her.

233
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,500
Look, never let your emotions
cloud your investigation.

234
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Because you're the only
one that can do that, rit?

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Look, Lexia is not involved.
Believe me.

236
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,700
Are you sure you wouldn't want to
wait for my report, Detective Celluci?

237
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,600
Doc, you and I both know that

238
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,500
what you find
isn't going to end up in any report.

239
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
Meet Jane Doe.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,800
I see.

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,700
Extensive t
rauma to the neck.

242
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
The flesh looks
torn, doesn't it?

243
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,200
Yes, most likely by hand.

244
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,400
I thought they
used their...you know.

245
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,100
Well, if that's the case
then maybe we should be talking to Vicki.

246
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Well, you see she's
so busy these days

247
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,700
I hate to see her torn in
too many different directions, so let's not.

248
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,300
- I understand.
- Good.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey.

250
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Say, did you get Gene Hansen's
toxicology report back?

251
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm looking for any
evidence of narcotics.

252
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll check and see when
the results are due in.

253
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,900
Okay, thanks.

254
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,700
Hey.

255
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,400
What's up?

256
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,800
You working that beetle mania case?

257
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes, I am.

258
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,800
I have reason to believe the club owner might
have known about drug dealing in the establishment.

259
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,400
If the drugs led to the kid's death, 

260
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
she could be held responsible.

261
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Uh-huh, you got it.

262
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,300
Speaking of which, I need you to check
some names for me - her and her staff.

263
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
See if they had any priors.

264
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
- Do you mind running them?
- Sure, let's go.

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,700
Yeah, I'll even throw in
a little lunch, maybe a few...

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,700
Wait a minute.

267
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,900
It usually takes a few minutes of sparkling
repartee before you'll give up anything.

268
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,100
I'm trying to be nice.
Is that a crime?

269
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,700
No, no.
Who's the customer?

270
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,000
Hey, we doing this or not?
Let's go.

271
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,600
All right already.

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, glasses.

273
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Hi.

274
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,100
You know...when you're
around someone long enough,

275
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,700
you can spot their little clues,
their 'tells'.

276
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,100
And this is apropos of...?

277
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,800
Well, I was in the morgue
today and Mike was there,

278
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,400
you know, investigating that Jane Doe,

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,800
and he offered to help me
gather information, no questions asked.

280
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,700
That was nice of him.

281
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,900
Yeah, he's never done that.

282
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,200
Not in the ten years
I've know him.

283
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,800
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

284
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Hm, apparently, like you
hanging up on me last night.

285
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,800
I have to get some
pages to my editor.

286
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,900
Henry, what's going on?

287
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
Vicki, I've been thinking...

288
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,800
It might be a good idea if we
don't see each other for a while.

289
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Oh.

290
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,100
I have to focus on my work.

291
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,900
Yeah, sure.

292
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,800
Whatever.

293
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
I have to go.

294
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,200
You, um...p, nn..g on bringing
your portfolio with all those pages in it?

295
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Thank you.

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
Lexia Chang had no priors.

297
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,500
Told you.

298
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,000
However, Mohadevan did find
an unknown substance in Gene Hansen's blood.

299
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,900
That doesn't mean
she's selling drugs.

300
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
All right then,
spin me a better theory.

301
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
Something supernatural.

302
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,700
It used to be that would
be my last suspicion.

303
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,000
Noit's my 'go to'.
All right, hit me.

304
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,400
The bugs there are loe
of references from myths.

305
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,100
There's the curse of the locusts
from the Bible,

306
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,600
and there are spells specific
to insect infestation.

307
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,200
And Beelzebub, that's often
referred to as Lord of the Flies.

308
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,800
Why did it go after Gene Hansen?

309
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,900
They running some kind of
black magic thing down at the club?

310
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,300
Goth's are sometimes
into Wicken, not black magic.

311
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,900
Listen Coreen, I know you
don't want to hear this,

312
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,600
but somebody is into something
nasty down there,

313
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,400
whether it's drugs or black
magic or whatever.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,100
Chances are your
friend knows about it.

315
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Are you coming with me or not?

316
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Molech.

317
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Molech, do you
want another drink?

318
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,400
It's Evan.

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,300
No thanks.

320
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,400
Sorry about Dante.

321
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,500
Gene.

322
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,800
They figure out
what killed him?

323
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
What does it matter?
He's dead, right?

324
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,000
There have been people
around here asking questions.

325
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,200
You haven't said
anything, have you?

326
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Of course not.

327
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Good boy!

328
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
No thanks

329
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm just trying
to make you feel better.

330
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Yeah, well, it didn't
do much for Gene.

331
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,700
You don't think this
is what killed him?

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He was doing a lot.

333
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah and he was
sleeping it off in an alley.

334
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
Who knows what could
have happened to him.

335
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,300
Hey, I know how we can make
each other feel better.

336
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,200
I have a new piercing.

337
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,900
Where are you?

338
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,900
There's evidence to indicate that
Gene Hansen died of anaphylactic shock.

339
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,000
The pathologist found an unknown
substance in his bloodstream.

340
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,800
Yeah, an unknown substance.

341
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,500
I need you to be straight with me.

342
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,700
Are you selling drugs here?

343
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm not even going to
dignify that with a response.

344
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,100
Coreen, tell her
I'm not selling drugs.

345
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
You have to tell her,
whichever way it is.

346
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,300
You have to tell the truth.

347
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,500
If Gene died from something
he bought here, you are responsible.

348
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,100
Are you selling drugs?

349
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,700
No!
And we are done here.

350
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,400
You said you could help me.
You call this help?

351
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
She's practically
accusing me of murder.

352
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
We're just trying to
get to the bottom of this.

353
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,500
She's just the same
as all the other mundanes.

354
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,100
They see the way we dress
and they think we're freaks.

355
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,200
She's really
just trying to help.

356
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,600
It's okay, Coreen, I see who you're
siding with -your minimum wage paycheck.

357
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,500
I thought you knew me.

358
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,700
I thought you understood the dark beauty
of what I'm trying to create here.

359
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,900
I do!
Lexia!

360
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,300
Hey, Coreen.

361
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You came into this with an attitude
about my friend and me and our lifestyle.

362
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
You were never looking to help her.

363
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,900
That is not true!

364
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,800
Oh come on, think about it, Vicki,

365
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,300
you can't ever trust anyone, can you?

366
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Hey, excuse me,
excuse me.

367
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Oh my god!

368
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,200
Eew!
Yuck! Eew!

369
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,500
Get off him!

370
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,300
911? Yeah, we need an ambulance
to the Underground Club.

371
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,800
It's at Queen West
and Crawford.

372
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,400
Thank you.

373
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
- Gotcha.
- Good idea.

374
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going to take
them to Dr. Mohadevan.

375
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,600
Oh, unless of course,
you want to do it.

376
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,900
No, you're perfectly capable.

377
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,100
We can't risk letting Vicki
find out about this other vampire.

378
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,300
You don't understand the potential
fallout from this conflict.

379
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,900
You just love to dramatize
everything, don't you?

380
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,600
This is a two-bit turf war, nothing more.

381
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
This is much more
than that, detective.

382
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,800
Fin..
inside.

383
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm all ears.

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,300
In the late 1700s a vampire
ensconced in a Polish village

385
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,200
found himself under siege
by another vampire

386
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,200
who had set out
to take over his territory.

387
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
And don't tell me.
They both wound up killing ach other.

388
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
That would have
been preferable.

389
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,700
The newcomer methodically disassembled the life
the first vampire had so painstakingly created.

390
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,600
He killed friends and
acquaintances, lovers.

391
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Those closest to him
were the first to die.

392
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,800
Which one were you?

393
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
The one still alive.

394
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,200
The rest of the village?

395
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,900
You're not exactly winning
me over here, Fitzroy.

396
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,800
Just be careful
how you act around her.

397
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
The less suspicion we
arise in her the better.

398
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,000
If the other vampire
believes she's with me,

399
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,900
Vicki will most certainly die.

400
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,300
Well, speaking of aroused suspicions,

401
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,600
do you often stand her up to go meet
with your editor in the middle of the night?

402
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,700
Point taken.

403
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,100
What do you have?

404
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,900
Her name was
Gabriel Claremont.

405
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,900
That's it?
A name?

406
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,200
Yeah, and it's more
than I had a few hours ago.

407
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,900
But now that I do have a name,
I get to meet with her parents

408
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,700
and tell them that their child
was murdered for no apparent reason 

409
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,600
while trying to find out
what they know of her last 48 hours alive.

410
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,000
That's what I get to do.

411
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
Then I'll leave you
to that, detective.

412
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,200
Keep in mind Fitzroy,
I'm not doing this for you.

413
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,800
I don't even like you.

414
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
Since we are affording each
other the courtesy of bluntness,

415
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,800
I don't like you either.

416
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,100
Vicki seems to trust
you with her life.

417
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
That's good enough for me.

418
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,600
Any luck with the insects?

419
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,600
I sent them to the
morgue this morning.

420
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Dr. Mohadevan is sending them to an entomologist
at the university for identification.

421
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,500
What about the second victim?

422
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,000
Evan Crane has a puncture
wound on his arm.

423
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,500
I was just talking to him
the night before and now he's dead.

424
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,800
I know, but you're just going to
have to put that aside for now.

425
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,300
Okay, tell me about
the injections.

426
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,200
Well, it's either that or
a sting - her words, not mine.

427
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,700
So it's bugs or drugs.

428
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Maybe it's both.

429
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,700
Okay, now you're losing me.

430
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,900
No, listen.
What if there is a substance

431
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,000
common to both victims that is
somehow attractive to the bugs.

432
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
- Like some kind of pheromone?
- Yeah, 

433
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,300
maybe it's being sold
as a party drug down at the club.

434
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,200
And you think whoever's selling
the drug doesn't even know it?

435
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,800
No, I didn't say that.

436
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,700
But why?

437
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,900
Let's start with who.

438
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,000
It is feasible.

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,400
I know that wasp venom has a pheromone in it
that signals other members of the hive to attack.

440
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,100
Of course one question still stands.

441
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,200
If this is a pheromone,

442
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
then how did it get
into their bloodstreams?

443
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Are you kidding me?

444
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,600
People will try anything if they
think it's goingto get them high.

445
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,000
Remember a few years ago,
people were licking the backs of cane toads?

446
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,400
Do I!

447
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,500
Awful things.

448
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
So, this substance, it could
ostensibly be attracting the insects.

449
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,900
It is possible,
but to be sure 

450
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,100
I need to be able to
run some tests with a pure sample.

451
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
All right, I'll get on it.

452
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,300
Oh, hey, did you have any luck with that thing
you were working on the other day?

453
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,200
What thing?

454
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,100
The Jane Doe, you and Mike.

455
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,800
Yes, we were able to get
an ID off her dental records.

456
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,300
You going to tell me or what?

457
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,300
Why wouldn't I tell you?

458
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,700
It's, uh...Gabriel Claremont.

459
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,400
Oh, okay.

460
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,100
The thing I'm not supposed to tell you is that
this may have something to do with Henry Fitzroy.

461
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,700
 Oh, trust me.

462
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,100
According to her agent, Miss Claremont
had a photo shoot three days ago.

463
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Nobody's heardthrom her since.

464
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
So the last person to see
her would be the photographer.

465
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
I'm still working on that.

466
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,100
I did however find
the address to the studio.

467
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,200
Do you want to go check it out?

468
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,100
- I'll get my coat.
- Okay.

469
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,200
Oh, one other thing -

470
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,400
if this photographer does
lead us to the vampire,

471
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,600
how do we stop it?

472
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,500
- I'll take care of that.
- Oh, really?

473
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,200
What? Surely Detective you don't have
a problem with vampire and vampire violence?

474
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,300
What if this vampire
is stronger than you?

475
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,200
Come on, Henry, anything
is possible here, okay?

476
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,700
I just want to know
how to kill the thing.

477
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,800
All right, I swear that if
I ever try to kill you again,

478
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
I won't use any method
you tell me about.

479
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Strangely enough
detective, I believe you.

480
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,900
Thank you.

481
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,100
A stake through the heart
always works... sunlight, emolation.

482
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,600
Come on, I've seen the movies,
give me something special here.

483
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,200
What?

484
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,000
Like a secret word that
makes our heads explode?

485
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,500
That would work.
Is there one?

486
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,100
No,

487
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,700
but decapitation's
always effective.

488
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,000
Watch where you
swing that thing.

489
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If we are confronted
with the other vampire

490
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
it will attack me first.

491
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
How can you be so sure?

492
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
It won't find you
any kind of threat,

493
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,300
and we can use
that distraction to our advantage.

494
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,900
Hey, I'm the one wearing
the badge here, remember?

495
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,000
And I'm the vampire.

496
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,700
If you want the killing
to stop, you'll do as I say.

497
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Oh, hey, what
about holy water?

498
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Shall we?
Grenfield?

499
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,700
- Live photo release forms.
- Yeah.

500
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,300
Let's see what we find here.

501
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,600
All right, looks like your
basic super model diet.

502
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,900
Diet pills, vodka, cigarettes.

503
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
Gabriel.

504
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,100
At least this confirms
that she was here.

505
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,800
- No sign of a struggle.
- No sign of anything.

506
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,100
- What about blood?
- No.

507
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,800
All right.
Well, I guess we're done here.

508
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Somebody's coming.

509
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Hey!

510
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
Hi!

511
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,300
If you guys were planning a party,
you could have at least put me on the guest list.

512
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,500
All right, who's going
to tell me what's going on?

513
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,200
- It's best if you don't know.
- Best if I don't know what?

514
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,800
Telling you would
kind of defeat the purpose of

515
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,400
'it's best if you don't know'.

516
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,100
Okay, you two have been
skulking around the city for two days.

517
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,900
I want to know what's going on.

518
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,300
I can't believe neither of them
would tell me what was going on!

519
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,100
This is a little hard to picture.

520
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Mike and Henry are hanging out..

521
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,100
No, not just hanging out,
they're working together.

522
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,400
They're investigating
that fashion model murder.

523
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,400
You know what drives me crazy?

524
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,500
They didn't even want me involved.

525
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,700
They didn't want my help, nothing.

526
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Yeah, there's nothing worse

527
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,600
than when you find out somebody
close to you doesn't trust you.

528
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,100
It's not the same thing,
Coreen.

529
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,900
Of course not.
So what are you going to do?

530
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Well, we still have
a case to work.

531
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,800
That might be a little difficult
since our client isn't talking to us anymore.

532
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,200
It doesn't mean we drop the case.

533
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,600
Listen, two men are still dead.

534
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,600
The police aren't treating
this as a homicide.

535
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,700
You still think it has
something to do with that drug.

536
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,300
Well, unless there's some kind of
insect infestation that we don't know about,

537
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,900
the drug is the only thing
those two deaths have in common.

538
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,300
We need to get a pure sample of that drug
so we can find out what the hell it is.

539
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,800
You're going to have to go in.

540
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,700
Me? You don't think
I'll mess up your investigation?

541
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,500
Coreen, I trust you.

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Clearly you're the one suited to this.
I don't know that world.

543
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,600
To be honest I wasn't really
serious about it to begin with.

544
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,700
Is this your way of apologizing 

545
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,400
or are you just trying to
avoid having your hair dyed black?

546
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,600
Is it okay if it's
a little of both?

547
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,800
All right, listen.
There is one condition.

548
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,500
You're going to have
to wear this transmitter.

549
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,200
I'll be able to hear
you at all times.

550
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,200
- Okay.
- All right, you have one hour.

551
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,500
If you don't make contact during that time,

552
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,700
I want you to get out.

553
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
If you look nervous,

554
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,400
you're going to draw heat,
so be careful.

555
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
If you do get into trouble

556
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,300
I want you to say,
"my mother is not going to like this,"

557
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,800
and I will come right in.

558
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,900
I know what I'm doing.

559
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,300
All right, don't accept
any drinks from anyone,

560
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,500
and don't leave your drink unattended.

561
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,700
If anyone gives you drugs,
take them, but do not take them.

562
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,500
Do you understand?

563
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,900
And I will look both ways
before I cross the road,

564
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,700
and I will floss after every meal,

565
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,300
and I'll wear a sweater
just in case it gets cold.

566
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,400
I'll be fine.

567
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,300
Well, you better be
or I'm going to kick your ass.

568
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,300
I'll meet you back here at midnight.

569
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
I have to run an errand.

570
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,300
Hey.

571
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,700
Aww...Did Mike stand you up?

572
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,200
Vicki, if you're here
to grill me again, I just...

573
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,000
Listen, Coreen's going to
go undercover tonight 

574
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,800
and I need someone who can blend to
the Goth scene, keep an eye on her.

575
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,400
I can't.
Not tonight.

576
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,000
Henry, there are two men dead
and I think there's going to be more.

577
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,900
I need your help.

578
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,900
And I'm working on something
that could prove to be just as dangerous, 

579
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,400
- for both of us.
- I know.

580
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,400
That's why we should
be working together, right?

581
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,500
- We're supposed to be partners.
- Yes!

582
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,600
Just not tonight.

583
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Okay.

584
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,600
Sure.

585
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,300
Can't blame a girl
for trying, right?

586
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,500
You know if you feel like it,
we'll be at the Underground later

587
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,600
...you know,
if it's not too much trouble.

588
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,300
Christina, what
do you want from me?

589
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,900
I'm in.
Over.

590
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,400
Aw, come on, Coreen,
it's a one-way radio.

591
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,500
Hey, have you heard
the good news?

592
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,400
Hey.
I'm looking to score.

593
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,500
You know, party favours.

594
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,400
Come on, Coreen.

595
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Do you want
angel tears or crow?

596
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Angel tears?

597
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,500
Come on, come on...
angel tears is acid,

598
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,500
crow is cocaine.
Come on.

599
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,700
I'm actually looking for
something a little different.

600
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,100
Evan told me about it,
but I can't remember the name.

601
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,700
Venom?

602
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
That's it.
Venom.

603
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,000
Do you know where
I can find any?

604
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
Something I said?

605
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,500
I've got a lead.
Over.

606
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,600
Oh!

607
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,800
Wynter.

608
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,300
Hey, I hear you're
looking for some venom.

609
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,200
Yeah, do you know
where I can get some?

610
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Um-hum...

611
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,700
???

612
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
First time's free.

613
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,200
- You don't have to do this.
- You're wrong.

614
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,000
- I do.
- Ugh...oh...!

615
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Let's be on our way.

616
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,700
- Why?
- Well, didn't you know?

617
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Your friend has a powerful enemy.

618
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,700
It's open season on her
and I wanted to be the one to do it.

619
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,900
VICKI, IT'S ME!


620
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,100
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS!

621
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,000
IT'S WINTER!
SHE'S SOME KIND OF DEMON.

622
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,900
WATCH OUT!

623
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,900
You're too
late to save your friend.

624
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,400
I'm over here!

625
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,300
Nope!
Here!

626
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
- What are you?
- What I am.

627
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,300
- You know.
- Demon.

628
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,900
There are all kinds of us,
with all kinds of hungers.

629
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,600
What are you doing
slumming it down here?

630
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,700
Nothing is without purpose.

631
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,300
You want me, right?

632
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
Why'd you kill the kids?

633
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,900
I hook them on the bottle,
then move them up to the spike.

634
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,000
That's when I feed
all their sweet juices.

635
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,400
I had to sacrifice a few
to get your attention.

636
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,400
If your kind get too much
of the bug in them,

637
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,400
my little ones go crazy
and they feed, too.

638
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,800
That's kind of a win-win, right?

639
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,500
That tickled.

640
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,500
Darkness is waiting.

641
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Let it wait.

642
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,300
It'll take a lot more
than that to beat me, bitch!

643
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,900
Henry?
 Sorry I'm late.

644
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,200
Sweet ride.

645
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,700
All right, Mov, thanks.

646
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Well, Mohadevan says it was
some kind of insect venom

647
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,600
although it's unlike
anything she's ever seen.

648
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,100
It's a good thing you didn't
get too much of that in you.

649
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,800
She said you should just keep
taking the antihistamines for the next 24 hours

650
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,900
and you should be fine.

651
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,800
That thing used me
and my friend to get to you.

652
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,500
I almost got you killed.

653
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,600
You were right not to trust me.

654
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No, that's not the point.

655
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,400
You did fine...
all right?

656
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,400
You have a little work to do
on the whole trust thingy.

657
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,700
What do you think?
Is it me?

658
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,800
You just rest, okay?
Just, take it easy.

659
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,100
So what the hell
was this thing again?

660
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,300
A demon bug?

661
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,000
It's actually
the other way around, a bug demon.

662
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,200
Well, I think you
actually both might be right.

663
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,800
ou two, you're just like
peas in a pod lateju.

664
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Hey, you know what?

665
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,200
I am so ready to take my pension
and retire somewhere else sweetheart.

666
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,700
- What did it want?
- Apparently it wanted me.

667
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,700
It was killing those kids
to draw me in.

668
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,000
It's dead now, so you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

669
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Which means I am free to help you two
find that vampire you're been looking for.

670
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Oh yeah, yeah, I figured
it out all by myself.

671
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,500
I can do that.
I'm a private detective.

672
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,600
- NO!
- Henry's right.

673
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,500
- You're out, too.
- Hey, wait a minute, Henry.

674
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,000
We had a deal.
I help you, we take it down together.

675
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,100
The deal's changed.

676
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,800
I don't want anyone else to die.

677
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's going to die?

678
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,500
Since when did you
become altruistic?

679
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
What the hell's going on?

680
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,700
It was a mistake to involve you.

681
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,500
Wait a second.

682
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,400
You know who it is, don't you?

683
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,500
Anyone else dies Henry

684
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,300
and I am holding you
personally responsible.

685
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,200
I work better alone.

686
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,600
Stay out of my way.

687
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,700
She's too powerful.

688
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,300
Henry!

689
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,400
That's great!
I mean that's just great.

690
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,200
So now I've got two of them
running around the city.

691
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,100
He's doing it to protect us.

692
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,400
She's been watching him.

693
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,500
She's probably been
watching him all night.

694
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,300
She?

695
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
And he's figured out who it is
and he's protecting her.

696
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,800
The woman behind the
vampire...Christina.

697
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
And who the hell is Christina?

698
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,200
Trouble.

699
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,500
