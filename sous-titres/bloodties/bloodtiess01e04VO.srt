1
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,087
You into horror titles?

2
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,459
Not really.

3
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:24,677
No, too much blood.

4
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:33,542
First contact.

5
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:40,267
I can sign that
for you if you like.

6
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,151
Are you stalking me?

7
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,618
It's Wednesday.

8
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,449
And that's what, stalking day?

9
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:48,552
It's the day the new comics come in.

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,819
Mr. Fitzroy.

11
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:52,397
We'll take that, too.

12
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:58,279
So what made you so interested
in graphic novels all of a sudden?

13
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,687
Well, I figured if we were
going to work together,

14
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,527
I should know more about you.

15
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:04,708
I would have told you anything
you wanted to know.

16
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:06,964
You see people tell you
what they want you to believe,

17
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,458
these things tell me who you are.

18
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:11,172
The detective brain at work again.

19
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:13,951
Is that what it's like being
in a relationship with you?

20
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:15,899
Coffee and interrogation in the morning?

21
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,597
What's the matter?
Afraid you couldn't stand the scrutiny?

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,643
I've lived long enough that
I don't have to answer to anyone.

23
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,579
And that's what it's like being
in a relationship with you.

24
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:28,649
Fine.

25
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,170
Read my books.

26
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:33,766
Sniff into the secrets of my inner life.

27
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,714
But be careful how deep you dig, Vicki.

28
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:39,324
It might be a dark ride.

29
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:42,906
Come on, Sarah, it's bedtime.

30
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,765
We have to be up early for the movers.

31
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,427
I'm not gonna move.

32
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:48,652
I'm staying here.

33
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,645
Honey, you can't.

34
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:52,222
You'll like where we're going.

35
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,832
I won't! And neither will Buttercup!

36
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,308
Oh, Sarah...

37
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,186
I hate you!

38
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,291
- Guess what?
- No.

39
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:39,309
Okay, close your eyes.

40
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:42,408
Isn't it awesome?

41
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,107
What's so awesome
about a queen-size futon sale?

42
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,845
Not that. This.

43
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,639
"No case too strange.

44
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:53,071
Supernatural and occult our specialty."

45
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,263
- Yeah.
- No.

46
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,550
No, I didn't ask you to do this.

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,484
Look, I'm not Ghostbusters.

48
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,550
They had a lot of clients
and now so do we.

49
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,761
Your 10:30's waiting.

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,570
Oh dear Mother of God, please say
this is not going to be another trip

51
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:07,969
into the Twilight Zone.

52
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,682
This, uh... Steve,

53
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:15,935
he's just a regular guy, right?

54
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,738
Nothing freaky?

55
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,097
He's a mechanic.

56
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,074
He likes old cars.

57
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:25,914
And he just took off...

58
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,964
no forwarding address,
no contact information.

59
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,811
When I asked Celeste
if she knew why he'd left

60
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,985
she said that...

61
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:35,783
it was none of my business.

62
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:40,930
Well, when people run it's usually
because there's someone chasing them.

63
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,639
Did Steve have any bad habits?

64
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:47,560
Women? Cards? Drugs?

65
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:52,550
I don't know what went on between
Steve and my daughter.

66
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,848
From what I saw he was a good man.

67
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,683
With Celeste... gone,

68
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:03,531
Sarah's all alone
and she needs her father.

69
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:05,284
Before I was sick,

70
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,303
I could have looked after her. But...

71
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,927
if her school hadn't taken her in,

72
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,091
I just don't know
what would have happened to her.

73
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:16,790
Emily, I have to ask you,

74
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,998
do you think there's any possibility

75
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:24,181
that Steve might have had something
to do with your daughter's murder?

76
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:29,120
I don't think
he could have hurt Celeste.

77
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:31,140
All right. I will look into it.

78
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:33,403
I can start with the vintage cars.

79
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,877
That's probably a good place.

80
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:39,089
And I need you to tell me anything
you can think of about Steve Jeffries.

81
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,040
<i>I don't remember.</i>

82
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:52,930
<i>It's okay, Sarah. You're not in trouble.</i>

83
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:56,817
<i>Mom went in the other room
and she called me.</i>

84
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,864
<i>And then there was screaming.</i>

85
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,028
<i>Did you hear anybody else?</i>

86
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,849
<i>I didn't hear anybody.</i>

87
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,985
<i>There's nobody out there.</i>

88
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,886
<i>How do you know that, Sarah?</i>

89
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,845
<i>There just wasn't.
I didn't hear anybody.</i>

90
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,422
<i>I just heard Mummy.</i>

91
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:14,903
<i>Then I went out and she was bleeding.</i>

92
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,443
<i>That's all I know.</i>

93
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:17,842
The kid's hiding something.

94
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,903
<i>Okay, Sarah, why don't we take a break?</i>

95
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,952
- She's upset.
- What about cause of death?

96
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,943
- Deep incisions.
- Any stab wounds?

97
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,915
No, more like teeth and claw marks.

98
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,257
From what? Dogs? Animals?

99
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:29,694
That was our first thought.

100
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,665
The front door was open
when we got there.

101
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,346
Burglary is also a possibility.

102
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:34,933
There was no sign of intrusion.

103
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:36,786
She could have left the door open.

104
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,442
Do you leave your door open that late?

105
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,343
Did Sarah mention her dad?

106
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,212
They split over a year ago.

107
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,985
Have you run him?
Murder's a lot cheaper than alimony.

108
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,392
- Is she always this intense?
- Oh, she's just warming up.

109
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,528
There was no alimony,
no history of violence.

110
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,354
The guy didn't even shoot
for visitation.

111
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,778
He deserted his family.
He has issues.

112
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,762
And sometimes people with issues
solve them by getting other people dead.

113
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:04,168
As far as I'm concerned the guy isn't
even on the radar for this.

114
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:06,213
You want to find him
to take care of the girl?

115
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,623
Knock yourself out.

116
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:08,979
Just remember,

117
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:12,481
you're not investigating
a homicide here.

118
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,829
What is she so edgy about?

119
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,210
I wonder.

120
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,370
You okay with this case you've got?

121
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:26,458
Standard missing persons.

122
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:27,932
So, um...

123
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:31,078
Runaway dads, they don't push
your buttons any more?

124
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:34,064
How could they?
They're never there.

125
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,984
Your therapist must be thrilled.

126
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,826
Hey, got some knowledge
on that Fitzroy dude.

127
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:47,306
Yeah, man. Took a lot of work.
That guy flies way under the radar.

128
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:48,723
- I know.
- So...

129
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,977
is he the guy
Vicki's hooking up with?

130
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:53,804
They are working together.

131
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:56,569
Okay, so you're just checking him out

132
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,406
'cause you guys like
the same comic books?

133
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:00,509
No, I think this guy's into something.

134
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:03,088
Yeah. I think
he's into something all right.

135
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,018
Well, what is it with you?

136
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:08,065
I see a sore I bring the salt, baby!

137
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:09,437
That's what friends do!

138
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,820
"...what friends do."

139
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:20,978
Sarah's a very special girl.

140
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,771
I'm happy we're able to help her.

141
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,598
Well, hopefully we can get her
hooked up with her dad soon.

142
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:27,254
It's no problem for us to put her up.

143
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,470
Almost half of our students live here.

144
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,325
Aren't some of these kids a little young
to be in boarding school?

145
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:34,005
Their parents all recognized

146
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:36,231
their children's talents
at an early age.

147
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,616
They understood that enrolling them
in the Cobb Academy

148
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,324
would be the best way to fully realize,

149
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,491
those talents.

150
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,567
I saw your Website.
It says 'gifted children'.

151
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,491
So this is a little Einstein academy?

152
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,251
Some of our students are burgeoning,

153
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,308
writers, scientists, mathematicians.

154
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,279
We have one ten-year-old boy

155
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:59,195
who can work out cube roots
faster than a calculator,

156
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,265
and recall Pi,

157
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,425
to 22,000 decimal places.

158
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,368
And what's Sarah's gift?

159
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,665
She's an artist.

160
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:10,915
Her drawings show
a grasp of imagination,

161
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,572
proportion and composition
of someone well beyond her age.

162
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,473
Did her dad ever come and visit her?

163
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:19,853
You mean since he abandoned
her and her mum?

164
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,031
You're not a fan.

165
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,821
Well, he was something
of a negative influence,

166
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,258
always derisive of what Sarah
accomplished here at the school,

167
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,502
always fighting her growth.

168
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,230
Well, I guess some men
are not supposed to be fathers.

169
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:38,440
Did Celeste say
why she was moving them out of town?

170
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,952
Well, I assumed it was for work.

171
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:43,256
I had given her some recommendations
for schools out west.

172
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,271
Mr. Cobb.

173
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,111
And this is Laurel,
Sarah's art teacher.

174
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,944
She and Sarah
have a special relationship.

175
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,052
I'm very lucky. Sarah made
a painting for my room today.

176
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:57,208
Sarah,

177
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:59,931
this is Miss. Nelson.
She wants to talk to you.

178
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:03,631
Laurel and I are going
to be just over there.

179
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:15,365
Tell you what. If I can call you Sarah,
you can call me Vicki.

180
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,095
So do you like it here at the Academy?

181
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,574
It's good. All my friends are here.

182
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,696
Well, it's good to have friends.

183
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:27,158
Everybody needs somebody
to look out for them, right?

184
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,578
How about your dad?

185
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,799
Think you could live with him?

186
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,078
Daddy doesn't want me.

187
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,666
Did he ever come by
when your mom wasn't around?

188
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:40,971
No.

189
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:42,905
He ever call?

190
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,535
I told you, he hates me.

191
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:50,826
You know, it might feel like that,

192
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,229
but I bet he doesn't hate you.

193
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:56,187
He left because I was bad.

194
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,779
Aw, don't say that. That's not true.

195
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:02,314
I'm sure your dad doesn't hate you.

196
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,825
Come on, who could hate you?

197
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,929
I want to go to my room.

198
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:08,337
Of course.

199
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,802
- Good night, Sarah.
- Sarah, it's okay.

200
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:11,896
Sarah!

201
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,391
Her father really did a number on her.

202
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,701
She thinks it's her fault
the guy took off.

203
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,814
Children idolize their parents,

204
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:26,208
and when a parent abandons them
they often absorb the blame.

205
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,627
So what else do you know
about Steve Jeffries?

206
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:44,705
Henry.

207
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,243
- Long time.
- Too long.

208
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,599
You cut your hair or something?

209
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:50,670
Never.

210
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,895
Something different about you.

211
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,352
- Really?
- Really.

212
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,456
I never change.

213
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,237
Mr. Fitzroy is a major tenant.

214
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,129
He owns half the top floor.

215
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,415
You think he did something?

216
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,769
Oh, no. I'm just trying to help him out.
But, um...

217
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:16,356
we do have to try and keep this on
the 'down low' if you know what I mean.

218
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,772
Nice enough guy.

219
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:21,044
Comic business must pay pretty good.

220
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:23,063
You gotta have some serious gig
to live here.

221
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:26,236
Keep regular hours?

222
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,396
Total night owl.

223
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:31,975
I guess that's where he gets the ideas
for these comics of his, huh?

224
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,031
Pretty disturbing.

225
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:34,861
He gave me a few
for Christmas last year

226
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:36,379
along with a c-note.

227
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,619
I kept the money,
gave the comics to my sister's kid.

228
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,300
Kid's kind of twisted anyway, so...

229
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,976
He's got a lot of friends
coming and going? That kind of thing?

230
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:47,358
You could say that.

231
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:51,172
Mr. Fitzroy is quite the ladies' man.

232
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,117
The phone...

233
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:09,817
Fitzroy.

234
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:14,889
Twenty minutes.

235
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,678
You're going?

236
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,274
Something came up.

237
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:20,927
It's important.

238
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,609
Okay.

239
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,060
You've definitely changed.

240
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:51,691
So you think the child's father told
the mother where he was staying?

241
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:54,388
Well, when guys bail,

242
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,637
they don't usually worry about
staying on the Christmas card list.

243
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,675
As a guy, I might resent that.

244
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:01,834
Really?

245
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:06,302
You don't really strike me
as the long term commitment type.

246
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm the definition of long term.

247
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,927
Not necessarily one woman, of course.

248
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,521
If he didn't tell his wife
where he was living

249
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:19,004
what exactly are we doing here?

250
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:22,558
Well, even if he didn't tell her,
he might have left something...

251
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,004
lead us to him.

252
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,637
You okay?

253
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:33,872
It's the blood.

254
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,816
It's not making you sick, is it?

255
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,323
Just hungry.

256
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,348
Right. Um...

257
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,375
Do you smell anything else?

258
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:45,708
You know, can you sniff out
whoever it was that did this?

259
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,442
I'm a vampire, not a bloodhound.

260
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,697
Right.

261
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:53,472
Okay, well, we are looking for,

262
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,694
anything he might have sent her.

263
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:58,197
You know, a picture,

264
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,093
a card...

265
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,620
Henry.

266
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,108
Look at this.

267
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,518
A vivid imagination.

268
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,436
What can you expect from
a girl who'd just lost her mother?

269
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,884
This was dated
a week before Mom died.

270
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,167
Hi. I'm glad you're still here.

271
00:14:57,824 --> 00:14:59,740
Well, I work when my clients need me.

272
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:04,117
It seems I'm not the only one
who has switched to the night shift.

273
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,756
I wonder if I might ask you
a few questions

274
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:10,465
about the Celeste Jeffries murder.

275
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,822
Oh. It was quite abnormal.

276
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:15,973
Frankly I was beginning to wonder
when you were going to ask me about it.

277
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,242
A real conundrum.

278
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:22,038
At first I thought
it was a creature or creatures.

279
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,216
What do you mean,
like dogs or something?

280
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,673
Well, only if they've started
breeding dogs

281
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,847
that don't shed and leave
no trace of saliva in bites.

282
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,659
Didn't the police find that strange?

283
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:35,831
The police are trained to ignore
things that are too strange.

284
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,405
You used to.

285
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,771
Well, let's just pretend
that I don't find

286
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,133
anything too strange these days.

287
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,635
What's your best guess?

288
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,994
Nothing anyone could arrest.

289
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:51,130
So there are no leads?

290
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:55,713
Well, I know whoever or whatever did it
was scared or angry,

291
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,338
otherwise it would have stopped
when she was dead.

292
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,126
Could something like this
have killed her?

293
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,210
If it existed.

294
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:09,661
Does it?

295
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:17,705
Thanks for your help, Rajani.

296
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:21,512
Why did you show that to her?

297
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,822
Big teeth and claws,

298
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,286
Shonidemon.

299
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:28,047
For my money, this isn't a drawing,

300
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,127
it's a crime scene photo.

301
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,039
All right, you place
your bet on the bogeyman.

302
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,744
I'm going with Dad.

303
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,924
You know, I had lunch
with the bogeyman last week.

304
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:38,478
Really? How is he?
I haven't seen him since I was five.

305
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:48,713
I so deserve a bonus.

306
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:49,793
I pay you?

307
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:52,854
I checked every classic car restorer
in the city and found Sarah's father.

308
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,967
He works at Vanguard
Vintage Auto in Maple.

309
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:56,291
Wow! You are good.

310
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:58,779
You know at this rate
I can take a vacation.

311
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:00,093
What about my bonus?

312
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:01,905
I'll bring you a t-shirt from Jamaica.

313
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:03,899
What do you think of this?

314
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,829
It looks like some kid's got
an active imagination.

315
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:10,744
No, I mean this.
Could it be anything supernatural?

316
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:13,729
I don't know. A Sasquatch maybe.

317
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,320
Last time I checked
they weren't orange though.

318
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,315
Get on the Net and see
if you can find anything

319
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:21,325
that even remotely resembles this.

320
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,608
Meanwhile I'm going to go
check on our honest

321
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,543
to goodness flesh and blood suspect.

322
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,491
Steven David Jeffries?

323
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:40,949
Who are you?

324
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:42,961
Hear about your wife?

325
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:49,636
I didn't hurt Celeste.

326
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,106
I didn't ask.

327
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,794
But a guilty denial's
always entertaing.

328
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:58,033
My ex-wife is dead.
The police obviously don't like ex-es.

329
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,197
Yo, Steve, I need a hand out back
with the Beamer.

330
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,397
Hey Danny,

331
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:05,031
where was I last Saturday night?

332
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:08,577
We're watching ultimate
fighting at the Brew King

333
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:09,998
with the rest of the team. Why?

334
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:11,286
Nothin'.

335
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,751
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

336
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,470
So now what?
You gonna arrest me?

337
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,303
Who says I'm a cop?

338
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,089
Well then, why are we talking here?

339
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,490
I'm a private investigator.
Your mother-in-law hired me.

340
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:24,846
She wants you to come home
and take care of Sarah.

341
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,851
Tell Emily to find somebody else.

342
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,146
I can't help her.

343
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,179
You're the kid's father!

344
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,484
- It confess yet?
- It will.

345
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:45,120
- You found Dad?
- Yeah, he's got an alibi.

346
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:47,345
Something happened
in that family, Mike.

347
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,552
- Aw, Vic...  No!
- The dad knows.

348
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,776
The kid knows.

349
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,885
She knows who killed her mother.

350
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,428
And you still think it's the dad.

351
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:55,993
Look, Kate talked to the girl.

352
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:57,101
The shrink talked to her.

353
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,091
They both believe
Sarah doesn't know anything.

354
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,373
Well, what do you believe?

355
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,206
Phone records
from Steve's garage show

356
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,876
that he did make
a call to the school.

357
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,136
So he did talk to her.

358
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,153
He talked to somebody.
It doesn't prove anything.

359
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,337
It's a start.

360
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,605
You know, ordinarily
I'd say trust your gut but, uh...

361
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:16,952
this one worries me.

362
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,282
Come on, don't worry.

363
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:20,907
You'll get wrinkles.

364
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,199
I told you. He doesn't want me.

365
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,274
I made him go away.

366
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,818
Kids don't make grown-ups do anything.

367
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,862
My dad left when I was little, too.

368
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,524
That's true.

369
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,451
Know what?
Sometimes grown-ups, they just leave,

370
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,592
and it's not your fault,

371
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:05,887
okay?

372
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,610
And I hated my dad after he left.

373
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,094
Do you still hate him?

374
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:16,507
Well, I'm not nominating him for father
of the year any time soon, but...

375
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,630
Did your dad ever
hurt you or your mom?

376
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,874
No. Why are you saying that?

377
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,947
- Can I go back?
- Just one more thing.

378
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,332
Is this your dad?

379
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,397
No, that's Buttercup.

380
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,404
See?

381
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,882
Buttercup wouldn't hurt anybody?

382
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,121
Ms. Nelson,

383
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,647
I appreciate your concern
but you're upsetting her.

384
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,698
Sarah, it's time for your session.

385
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,052
I'll take you down.

386
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:02,256
Laurel?

387
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,901
- Vicki, right?
- Yeah.

388
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:07,623
Do you mind if I ask you
some questions about Sarah's art?

389
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,429
Sure. She's got a great eye.

390
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,891
More than you know.

391
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:14,602
You sent this to her mom
a few days ago.

392
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,419
Maybe this was a bad idea.

393
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:18,846
Excuse me.

394
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:20,904
You also called her father I think.

395
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,594
Because Steve called here
and talked to someone.

396
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,514
It wasn't Sarah
and I don't think it was Cobb.

397
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:29,974
I was worried about her.

398
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,955
I am worried. She's...

399
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,133
been drawing things
like that for a few months.

400
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,124
I spoke to both her mom and her dad.

401
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:39,046
Is this something to do with
why Sarah's mom was moving them?

402
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,290
I think so. She wanted to give Sarah
a change of scenery.

403
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:44,877
I thought it was a good idea.

404
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,318
And the dad?

405
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:49,267
It was like he already knew
what was going on with her.

406
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,072
And it seemed like he didn't care.

407
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:55,898
Yeah, I kind of got that feeling, too.

408
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:01,168
Was there anything else going on
that had you worried beside the picture?

409
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:04,032
It wasn't just 'a' picture.

410
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,318
It was pictures.

411
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:53,207
Very good. It increases
both dexterity and direction.

412
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:55,596
Hello, Sarah.

413
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,018
Hello, Buttercup.

414
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,385
I think...

415
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,415
we have to talk.

416
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,744
When I first saw these
I knew she was gifted.

417
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:08,774
I showed them to Mr. Cobb and...

418
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:10,051
he agreed.

419
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,192
He even made her
one of his special students.

420
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:13,422
Special students?

421
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:14,739
He takes a special interest

422
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,774
in the brightest
and most talented kids.

423
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,845
For him it's all about letting
kids' talents take

424
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:20,112
them as far as they can go.

425
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:24,311
The pictures started getting
more and more violent.

426
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,982
Could this represent her dad?

427
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,210
Some kind of abuse?

428
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:33,383
I don't know. I'm not a psychologist.
I...

429
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:35,483
I just wanted somebody
to get her some help.

430
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:37,966
We have a problem, Sarah...

431
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:40,118
- with Laurel.
- Why?

432
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,779
- Laurel's my friend.
- You're my friend, Sarah.

433
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,864
Laurel has lied to us.

434
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,068
She sent a picture
of Buttercup to your mom.

435
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,171
That's why your mom wanted to move.

436
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,227
- She wouldn't do that.
- She did.

437
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:54,415
And now she's talking
to the other woman.

438
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,934
- Why?
- Because they want to take you away.

439
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,194
And they want to take
Buttercup away from you.

440
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,717
They know that Buttercup hurt your mom.

441
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,468
He didn't mean to.

442
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:07,074
They don't care
about that, Sarah.

443
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,449
Laurel's talking to her now,

444
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,327
trying to take you away.

445
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:13,524
She shouldn't do that!

446
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,165
- What is that?
- I...

447
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:25,886
I don't know.

448
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:32,139
I don't want to hurt people.

449
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,131
It's not you, Sarah. I told you.

450
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,455
It's Buttercup.

451
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:39,188
Let Buttercup go.

452
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,249
You should be angry.

453
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,415
Laurel wants you out of her class.
She hates you!

454
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:47,815
Then I hate her!

455
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,535
Vicki!

456
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:02,477
Get out!

457
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:18,444
What happened?

458
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:21,096
I don't know but I'm going to find out.

459
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,514
Just get some rest, okay?

460
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,484
Vicki!

461
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,563
Are you coming to accident scenes now?

462
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:32,045
The paramedics called
and said that you were involved.

463
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,273
What happened?

464
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:35,161
See, here's where
we're gonna have a problem,

465
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:36,795
'cause I could tell you but...

466
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:39,715
But, uh...
I'm not gonna believe you, right?

467
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:45,708
Why do you automatically take
that attitude with me these days, huh?

468
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:49,153
Okay. A giant transparent creature
appeared in the room,

469
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:52,106
smashed me to the floor
and nailed Laurel to the light fixture.

470
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,587
You know, a woman almost died here,
Vicki. This isn't a joke.

471
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:56,798
I'm serious.

472
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:00,199
What,

473
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,681
like all of your cases now
are suddenly something

474
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:04,246
out of the crypt of terror?

475
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,748
I assume Fitzroy's in this somehow.

476
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,175
Henry has nothing to do with this.

477
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,186
He wasn't even here.

478
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:13,374
He is now.

479
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:19,337
I've got work to do.

480
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,013
Mike...?

481
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:28,006
A breakdown in police relations.

482
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,532
Yeah, more like a meltdown.

483
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:37,981
You're wasting your time.

484
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:39,634
I told you I'm done with Sarah.

485
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,573
You know, she's a kid,
not a poker game.

486
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:45,136
You don't just get to fold
your hand when you don't like it.

487
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:49,314
You have no idea what's going on.

488
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,978
Stay out of it.

489
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:53,513
You know, I lay awake
at night sometimes

490
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,434
praying that one day
that'll be my style.

491
00:26:55,435 --> 00:26:56,971
So far it hasn't happened.

492
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,166
You don't know her.

493
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:01,052
Besides, I couldn't help her anyway.

494
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,179
Celeste wouldn't let me.

495
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:05,168
So you and your wife had
some problems, big deal.

496
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,330
Everyone does.

497
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:09,348
When you have a kid
you are supposed to be there for them.

498
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:14,392
You people deserve what's coming to you.

499
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:17,960
Get out of here.

500
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,138
Sarah's teacher was almost
murdered by something tonight,

501
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,523
and I think you know
who or what it was.

502
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,933
Now...

503
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,342
this lady here's trying to help you.

504
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:31,703
I'm ambivalent...

505
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:33,931
and advise you to be nice.

506
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:36,578
All right.

507
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,855
You want to know what it is?

508
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:43,944
Why not?

509
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:45,874
It's not like you'll believe me anyway!

510
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:53,505
What did this?

511
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:55,772
It was Sarah.

512
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,842
You know, you can start
making sense any time now.

513
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,551
Did you ever have an imaginary friend?

514
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,522
Yeah, the kind that lived in a castle
and came for tea parties.

515
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:04,690
Not any that did that.

516
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:05,883
Well, Sarah's did.

517
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:08,371
Even when she was a baby,

518
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:10,089
things started happening.

519
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:12,483
Stuff would shake around her,

520
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:14,720
or fall off shelves
or even just break.

521
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,451
Celeste thought it was poltergeists,
you know,

522
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:19,446
like the movie. I know, crazy, right?

523
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:20,779
You'd be surprised.

524
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,169
Go on.

525
00:28:23,654 --> 00:28:24,725
As she got older,

526
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,180
whenever something happened,

527
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:27,992
she'd say her doll did it.

528
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:29,401
Buttercup.

529
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,748
So, what... is she psychic?

530
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:32,856
Telekinetic.

531
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:35,288
Yeah, that's what Cobb said it was.
Her headmaster?

532
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,302
I met him.

533
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:39,114
We found him through a psychologist
we were taking Sarah to.

534
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:40,898
He said he could help us.

535
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:43,266
Said she was gifted.
And at first it was great, you know?

536
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,672
Things stopped breaking.
Sarah seemed happy.

537
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:47,918
And then, it all changed.

538
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,049
Whenever Sarah wanted something,

539
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:52,237
Buttercup would just take it.

540
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,519
And whatever power she had it...

541
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,427
just kept getting stronger.

542
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:58,690
It doesn't exactly sound like
the school helped much.

543
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,492
I told Cobb what was happening.

544
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,690
He just said it was all under control.

545
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,830
I wanted to take Sarah
out of the school.

546
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:08,381
Celeste fought me.
Cobb had her all messed up, too.

547
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:11,836
Then one night I come home from work.

548
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:14,052
Sarah's trashed the kitchen.

549
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,748
Sarah, you can't keep doing this.

550
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:19,386
Buttercup didn't mean to.

551
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:22,872
It wasn't Buttercup, honey.
He's not real.

552
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,882
Don't say that!

553
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:27,389
Sarah, you've got to stop this.

554
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,107
Buttercup hates you! Hates you!

555
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:37,125
I barely survived. So yeah,

556
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,969
I think I know what killed Celeste,
but who's gonna believe me?

557
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,744
I think you're sitting
with the whole club.

558
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:45,388
You know, Celeste was planning
to take Sarah out of that school.

559
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:48,685
I knew it would turn on her, too.

560
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,790
If only she'd listened to me sooner.

561
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:53,202
Well, you can still help Sarah!

562
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,780
She'll be fine, her and that thing.

563
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:57,733
No, if what you're saying about
that school is true, she is in danger.

564
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,367
We need you to take her back!

565
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:02,333
She almost killed me once already!
I'm not going back for more.

566
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:04,746
Oh, so what? You're gonna let Cobb
turn her into a killer?

567
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,351
What kind of a father are you?

568
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,499
Not a very good one, I guess.

569
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,452
Sorry.

570
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:16,515
You know what? You call me
when you grow a conscience.

571
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:22,836
Son of a...

572
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,649
So what now?

573
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:28,447
Not exactly something Child Services
is set up to handle.

574
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:31,589
No, it's the kind of thing parents
are supposed to be responsible for!

575
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,824
This guy is leaving
his kid high and dry!

576
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,092
He has his reasons.

577
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:38,069
Yeah. Yeah, they all have
their reasons, don't they?

578
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:39,837
His wife rejected him.

579
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,921
His daughter almost killed him.

580
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,541
Steve isn't the same guy as your father.

581
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,460
Like, everybody's got
their father issues.

582
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:51,220
Mine took me 300 years to get over.

583
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,552
His stuff has a totally epic feel.

584
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:03,805
He really creates his own universe.

585
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,403
What kind of universe?

586
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,168
You know From Hell, right?

587
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,323
Right. Yeah, I love that one.

588
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,614
Yeah, same sort of historical detail.

589
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,931
He did this one set in World War I.
It's like you're there.

590
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,374
And there's this creature
that shows up during Christmas...

591
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,424
No spoilers, Edwin.

592
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,913
If it's on the cover
it's not a spoiler, Brent!

593
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:25,936
So what other stuff are you into?

594
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,152
We've got
the underground stuff upstairs.

595
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:30,897
I'm into finding out about Fitzroy.

596
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:33,254
- What's he like?
- Like I told you.

597
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,494
Like more.

598
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,409
But with a Warren Ellis edge.

599
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,800
You have a Warren Ellis edge.

600
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,935
- You're an idiot...
- You live with your mother...

601
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:40,994
Hey! Hey!

602
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:43,732
So,

603
00:31:44,464 --> 00:31:45,750
signings usually at night?

604
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:47,886
Yeah, it's great.

605
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,586
Some of our customers
actually have day jobs.

606
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:55,917
Hm... really loves
the blood, doesn't he?

607
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,302
Oh yeah

608
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,246
this one time a Goth chick came in

609
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:02,331
and sliced her finger and asked him
to sign in the book in blood.

610
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,433
I thought he was gonna jump her
right there.

611
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:06,697
- She was hot!
- She was so hot.

612
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,532
Vicki Nelson.

613
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:25,367
Come on...

614
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:28,989
Vicki Nelson. This better be good.

615
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,407
Hey. It's me.

616
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,888
<i>Hey, Mike.
I was going to call you.</i>

617
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:35,423
What time is it anyway?

618
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,042
<i>You sleeping?</i>

619
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:39,793
No. I was just resting my eyes.

620
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,494
I found out something
about Cobb, you know,

621
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,856
the guy who runs the school?

622
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:48,612
More transparent monster stuff?

623
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:51,446
<i>No, it's Cobb. He's, uh...</i>

624
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,598
He's doing something to the kids,

625
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,209
you know, to Sarah Jeffries
and maybe some of the others.

626
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:57,542
What are we talking about here,

627
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,716
- abusing them?
- <i>No, more like mind control.</i>

628
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:04,063
You know, using their mental powers
to kill people.

629
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:07,512
I didn't hear that last part but, uh...

630
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:09,813
<i>I'll sniff around the rest of it, okay?</i>

631
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:12,189
- Okay. Thanks.
- <i>I'll call you. Vicki,</i>

632
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,331
do me a favour
and stay away from that school.

633
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:15,974
<i>Oh, Mike, you know better.</i>

634
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:18,693
Never give orders to a girl
who's had less than three hours sleep.

635
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,076
I was totally just calling you.

636
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:49,625
Here I totally am.

637
00:33:49,635 --> 00:33:50,804
Steve Jeffries just called.

638
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:52,503
He said to tell you
that you were right.

639
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:54,101
He said he's going to get his daughter.

640
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,034
- What?
- He said he's on his way.

641
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:57,649
You put the family back together.

642
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,996
Happy ending, right?

643
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,051
Yeah, either that or
I just sent a man to his death.

644
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:06,937
Come on!

645
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:11,538
Henry, hi. It's me.
I really need you right now.

646
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:14,008
Sarah's dad is on his way
to the school...

647
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:16,899
<i>I've got to get there and stop him
before he does something stupid.</i>

648
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,850
Nine out of ten people who do that,
later report it was a bad idea!

649
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:45,649
What are you doing here?

650
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,616
Trying to stop you
from getting yourself killed.

651
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,973
I don't need your help.

652
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,860
Actually, I think you do.

653
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:52,777
Come on. Let's go get your daughter.

654
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,226
<i>Vicki  Henry. Hi. It's me.
I really need you right now.</i>

655
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,460
<i>Sarah's dad is on his way to the school.</i>

656
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,068
<i>I've got to get there and stop him
before he does something stupid.</i>

657
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,232
<i>Please, please, please,
please meet me there.</i>

658
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:08,481
Bye.

659
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,655
Let's talk gifted kids.

660
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:36,412
Ms. Nelson.

661
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:40,506
Mr. Jeffries!
I'm sure Sarah would love to see you.

662
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:42,599
Let's go.

663
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:48,937
We have visitors.

664
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:54,754
- Sarah?
- Daddy?

665
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:56,707
I'm going to take you home.

666
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,472
Sarah,

667
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:00,937
he's come to take Buttercup away.

668
00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:07,381
Sarah, don't!

669
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:29,587
You should've told me
if you wanted to follow me.

670
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,110
'Cause you got nothing to hide, right?

671
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,532
So I wouldn't have to slow down
so you woudn't get lost.

672
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,016
You should go back to tailing school.

673
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:36,274
Wouh, tailing school.

674
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:37,391
Whatever you call it.

675
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:39,396
What are you doing here,
haunting the place?

676
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:42,284
Not, so romantic, Vicky's here,
and she's in trouble.

677
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:43,764
You can join me if you like.

678
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,108
I'm only doing what's best for Sarah.

679
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:55,747
- By turning her into a killer?
- She's not a killer.

680
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,399
Buttercup is, right?

681
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,315
Buttercup is very special.

682
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:00,992
There is no Buttercup.

683
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,740
There is what Sarah believes.

684
00:37:02,741 --> 00:37:04,890
And the power of the mind
can shake reality.

685
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:07,594
Quantum physics bails this out.

686
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:09,246
You're a quantum nutjob !

687
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,098
Sarah lives in the real world.

688
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,652
The real world is what
destroys a child's beliefs

689
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:15,650
and the potential that
accompanies them.

690
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:19,606
I will let Sarah keep Buttercup alive.

691
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:24,701
And he will give her power
that few people can even imagine.

692
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,570
With you advising her, right ?

693
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,645
Not a chance.

694
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,890
- Come on. We're gettin' outta here.
- Look what he's doing, Sarah.

695
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:35,469
He wants to hurt Buttercup.

696
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,586
Steve, put the gun down.

697
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,065
Stop it, you shouldn't do that.

698
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:49,220
Get out of the way.

699
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,414
Oh, right, a linebacker couldn't budge
this thing.

700
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:56,034
Right, uh...
We're gonna find another way in.

701
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,773
Look, Sarah,
your dad just want to help.

702
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:15,406
No, he doesn't.

703
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:18,338
He had a gun, that's bad.

704
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:20,187
You're bad, too.

705
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:24,535
- Everybody, freeze.
- Mike, put the gun down.

706
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:31,884
My bet is with you dead,
this whole nightmare will be over.

707
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:33,522
Henry, no!

708
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:35,353
Nobody hurts anybody.

709
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,160
Sarah, that's not
what we're supposed to do, right?

710
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:45,397
Come on, you don't want to do this.

711
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,359
- Tell Buttercup stop.
- No!

712
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,164
Sarah...

713
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,535
Don't let Buttercup do this.

714
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:56,675
You can control him.
Don't let him control you.

715
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:58,610
I don't have to listen to you.

716
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:00,640
Mr. Cobb said so.

717
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,969
Sarah, I love you.

718
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:05,354
I just want to take you home.

719
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:07,610
He's just lying, you know that.

720
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,891
Sarah, listen.

721
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,708
I talked to your dad, he loves you.

722
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,241
He-- You-- You have to forgive him.

723
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:19,170
You said you didn't forgive your dad.

724
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,576
- You dad came back.
- Don't listen to her.

725
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,675
He's right there, he loves you
and he's gonna take you home.

726
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,350
You lie.

727
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:35,876
Buttercup didn't do those things,

728
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,763
I did.

729
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:43,192
It was me all the time,

730
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:45,013
and I didn't stop it.

731
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,282
Daddy?

732
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:08,257
You okay?

733
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,861
Man, family reunions are a bitch.

734
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,945
Sarah, honey, I missed you so much.

735
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,072
Me too.

736
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:30,268
We're gonna be okay.

737
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:32,344
You and me, and Buttercup.

738
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:33,883
Buttercup is gone.

739
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,291
It's gonna be okay, Sarah.

740
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,578
Who are you, Fitzroy?

741
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:10,900
I draw comic books.

742
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:12,337
Sleep with that.

743
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,163
I saw you in there and what you did.

744
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:16,740
The way you looked.

745
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:19,337
You're not even human.

746
00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:21,826
Hell, what kind of freak, are you?

747
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,442
Henry, no!

748
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:29,206
Henry, please, put him down.

749
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:30,831
Oh, god please, Henry.

750
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:38,629
Mike, it's not what you think.

751
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,793
What this? You knew this?

752
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,396
It's not all Bram Stoker and...

753
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,495
What?

754
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,823
What, he's cast for the family vampire?

755
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:51,166
What the hell are you doing
with him Vicky?

756
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:52,490
We work together.

757
00:41:55,023 --> 00:41:56,929
What else? Huh?

758
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:00,619
Mike...

759
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,951
It has been a really...

760
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,233
long day.
