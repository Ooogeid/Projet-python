1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,900
Deeds.
Nelson.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,900
Wow! Undercover does
not agree with you.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,400
You look like hell.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,400
You've had better days
yourself, babe.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Thanks, so to what
do I owe the pleasure?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I heard you were
in the crazy business.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, you know if I wanted
to be insulted before my first

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
coffee, I would have continued
working with Cellucci.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,500
I came to you because I may
need your help with a homicide.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,600
You're a cop.
You know how to work a case.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,800
This one's a little
different.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,000
Why?
Who died?

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,400
Me.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,900
Okay, why don't we start
at your place?

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
I went to my apartment first.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,900
Everything's just like I left
it - no sign of a break-in.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,600
No sign of your...body?
It sounds worse when you

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,800
actually say it.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,500
What do you mean apartment?
Didn't you have a house

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,100
in the Beaches?
Divorce cleaned me out.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,200
You blew another marriage?

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,300
We're trying to find
my lifeless body

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,400
and you're busting my balls
over my marital problems?

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,000
One divorce is a problem.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,700
Four is a one-man
catastrophe zone.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,700
About the death thing?
Right. Sorry.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,600
I mean, I've been living
on the edge a long time...

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,400
dying I can handle.
The question is,

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,900
why am I a ghost?
>> Hm.

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
You see that?
You see that?

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,000
If I can't pick something up,
how come I can sit down?

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,900
Well, my guess is, that if
you think about it too much

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,700
you can't do it.
But when you're not trying

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,000
so hard, you can.
You see?

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,300
Maybe I came to the
right place after all.

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,400
All right.
So where else...where else

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,300
could your body be?
>> I've been working undercover,

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,500
riding with a bike gang.
Chances are we're not talking

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
about a tidy
little aneurysm here.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, so who was
your supervisor?

41
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Fry.
You remember him?

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,800
Yup. All right.
When was your last check-in?

43
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,000
I talked to Fry...

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,500
I can't remember.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
I mean, I probably report
to the guy every day, but...

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Maybe it's some trauma
related to the death,

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,100
that's why you can't remember.

48
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,700
Remember what?
What death?

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Coreen, this is Paul Deeds,
we used to work together.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,500
Is Paul invisible?
No, he's a ghost.

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,200
You don't have to whisper,
Nelson, I know I'm a ghost.

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,800
I can't believe it.
He's right there.

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
He passes through doorways.
He can't pick anything up.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,600
I could give her a try.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,400
I mean I can't believe
there's a ghost in the room

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
and you're the one who
gets to see him.

57
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,600
Red thong.

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Are you wearing a red thong?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,300
Cool.

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
And observant.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
Classy.

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,200
Vicki >> I would have gone
to Paul's supervisor myself,

63
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,000
but you know, he's never
going to be straight with me.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Mike >> Oh, I know.
Undercover is so unfair.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,900
They won't tell
civilians anything.

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,700
Ah, yes, but you,
oh distinguished officer

67
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,500
of the law,
you could ask him.

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,400
And why the sudden
interest in Paul Deeds?

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,500
He's a client.
Sort of.

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,200
Oh, wow.
There's a whole world

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,500
of intrigue in that 'sort of'.

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't even know
why I hesitate anymore.

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,200
He's a ghost.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
A ghost.
>> A ghost.

75
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,500
>> So did he just come
rattling his chains to you,

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
moaning that he had a case?

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,400
No, no chains, just
leather and denim.

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,700
Essentially yeah, that's i

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
All right.
Look, if he's a ghost,

80
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,800
then that means that he's dead.
And if he's dead,

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,500
then there will be a hundred
cops all over this case.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,300
Well, you see, that's
where he has a problem.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
There's no body,
not yet.

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Paul 'Dirty' Deeds -
make the bust no matter what.

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
>> He sure closed
a lot of cases.

86
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Yeah, he just didn't
care how he made that close.

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,700
You gotta figure that has
something to do

88
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,700
with why he's dead.
>> What are you saying?

89
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm saying that
I never trusted the guy.

90
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,000
So it doesn't matter then
that somebody offed a cop?

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
>> No, I'm just saying
that even then,

92
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,600
he probably had
some kind of angle.

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
He's not here now, is he?
>> No.

94
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Oh, apparently I'm the only
person who can see him.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Of course you are.

96
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,900
So are you going
to ask Fry or what?

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,300
Yeah, but I think
I'll skip the ghost part.

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,300
Good call.
>> Okay.

99
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
Stripes and checks,
it's interesting.

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,500
>> Bye.

101
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,100
Henry >> I have very little
experience with ghosts,

102
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,700
and this one I don't see.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> Ummmm...
oh.

104
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Paul >> What the hell is this?

105
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,200
Ah! He's in your bedroom.
>> What's he doing there?

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,800
Um...cops have a natural
curiosity.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Remind him that
curiosity killed the cat.

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,900
Right.
Hey, Paul, you want

109
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,500
to get out of there?
My friend may have

110
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
some skeletons in his closet.

111
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
Whoa!
Tell me about it!

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
Do you see him now?
>> I'm glad I don't.

113
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,200
What does he remember
of his demise?

114
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,100
Nothing much so far.

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
So you have a dead client
who doesn't know how he died.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,100
Vicki, I don't like this.

117
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,600
Mmm...is there a...
It just hit me.

118
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,300
Are you guys...?
>> No.

119
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, so you and Mike
are still getting it...?

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,100
No, no, no, no.
>> Then maybe I got a shot?

121
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
Do you remember
anything or not?

122
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,500
>> Vicki...
>> Standard.

123
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
He says he was
at the Standard.

124
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,500
It's a biker bar.
It's kind of a....

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,000
I know it.
I don't always hunt

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,800
in the opera circuit.
One has to vary one's diet.

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Everybody enjoys a little
fast food now and again.

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
Paul >> Girl.

129
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,000
He says that he was there.
He met a girl.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300
He didn't know her previously.

131
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,400
How do you know he
is who he says he is?

132
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,400
Look, I know him, okay?
And no one's going to

133
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,900
investigate his death
without a body.

134
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
How did he get to you?

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Same reason as everything
else gets to me these days.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Apparently
I'm a ghost beacon, too.

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,100
Cowley >> Detective Deeds
has been riding undercover

138
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,600
with the Wolverines for
over two years as Paul Pevere.

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
His cover has him
as an ex-con with experience

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
in international drug shipments.

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Wolverines have had a run of
tough luck lately, haven't they?

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
One of their members was
killed recently, right?

143
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
And a drug shipment stolen,
and a club house fire-bombed.

144
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,800
Well, if they're feeling
targeted, that's just going to

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,900
make them even more dangerous.
>> There's a lot of pressure

146
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,100
on organized crimes to use
Deeds' Intel soon,

147
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,400
to make a trafficking case.
>> What? Just trafficking?

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
>> That's all I'm supposed
to know.

149
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,700
And it is certainly all
I am telling you

150
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,400
without more information.

151
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,100
At this point
I don't have much.

152
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,900
I just got a tip that Deeds
might be in a little trouble.

153
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
You do realize they made us
out for cops the moment

154
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,700
we walked in here, right?
>> So?

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
t means they're paying
attention to the cops

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
on the outside and not
the one on the inside.

157
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,700
Works for everyone.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
You worked under Deeds.

159
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, yeah, good cop,
lousy person.

160
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,700
Yeah, he was a good cop.

161
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,500
> Was?
>> Is.

162
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,000
Maybe 'was'.

163
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,900
Internal Affairs
is taking a look at him.

164
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,500
They think he'sent?

165
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm telling you because
I trust you, Cellucci,

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
but it goes no further
than this table.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,700
Not your partner,
not your shrink, nobody.

168
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,900
Understood.

169
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
In the last couple of months,
he hasn't produced

170
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,800
anything we can use.

171
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,800
We were counting on Intel
to put a lot of Wolverines away.

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,400
There is some concern that he
might be a little crooked.

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's like being
a little pregnant, isn't it?

174
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,500
I guess we'll know
soon enough.

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,300
When you called, I wondered
if you might know something.

176
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,900
It doesn't fit with the
general picture I have.

177
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,900
I just spoke with an outside
source that said, um...

178
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Said that Deeds might
be in a little trouble.

179
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
He knows how
to play the part.

180
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,100
Yeah, the question is,
who is he playing it for?

181
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,500
Coreen >> If you ever want to be
convinced about the one world

182
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
concept, every culture's
got vampires, ghosts,

183
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,900
body snatchers, werewolves.
We're all afraid

184
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,400
of the same things.
Henry >> Um-hum.

185
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,900
In most countries ghosts
remain behind because of

186
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,600
unfinished business
or dissatisfaction.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,700
If Paul was murdered I suppose
that meets both requirements,

188
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
right?

189
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,400
You're a vampire
reading about vampirism.

190
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,200
Like you've never
read a self-help book?

191
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,200
What are you looking for?

192
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,900
This situation reminds
me of a myth I heard.

193
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,900
Early vampires who would
visit the living.

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,800
At first they'd seem benign,
but then they would strip

195
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,600
a person's life force.
>> Paul came to Vicki for help.

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,600
Not knowing how
or when he died.

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,900
Not knowing where his body is.
Dragging Vicki into who knows

198
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,400
what kind of situation.

199
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
You don't think
he is who he says he is?

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
Ever since Vicki and I met,

201
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
supernatural things
have been drawn to her.

202
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
This very well could be
the ghost of Paul Deeds.

203
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
But it also might be
something very different.

204
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,300
Astaroth?

205
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
Or something he sent
to do his dirty work.

206
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,200
If you'd excuse me.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
You take all the fun out
of supernatural sometimes.

208
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,100
You rang?

209
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
Paul?

210
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Oh, Vicki!

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
You're a sight for sore eyes.

212
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
What are you doing here?

213
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,500
Ask Serpico.

214
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,800
Giving organized crime an
assist with a Wolverine murder

215
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,500
I thought that Paul here,
might be able to help.

216
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,500
Threw me over the car,
cuffed me.

217
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
I thought he was going to
take me down to Cherry Beach

218
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
and beat me.
>> Well, we had to make

219
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
it look good, didn't we?
>> Mmmmm.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,200
You look yummy.

221
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,900
You don't.
You're burning up.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,500
That's because I'm lovesick.

223
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,000
Why don't we spend a dirty
weekend in the Bahamas

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,900
together, baby?
>> Yeah, you bring me back

225
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,800
that snowball from hell
and we'll talk.

226
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
Same old Vicki.

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,300
Same old Paul.
>> Yeah.

228
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,100
Are you sure you're okay?
>> What?

229
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,000
Why this sudden concern
with my health?

230
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know.
Does the cow know

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
it's misng that?
>> You want a bite?

232
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
No, thanks.
>> A little red meat

233
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
never hurt anybody.
Unlike the swill they call

234
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
coffee around here,
but I love it, love it.

235
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,400
The Paul I met, he couldn't
pick up a sandwich,

236
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
let alone hug me.

237
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,400
>> Yeah, mostly what I noticed
was Paul walking around.

238
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
That fever,
did you feel that?

239
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,500
Vicki, the man is alive.

240
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,800
Yeah, apparently so.

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Did you find out
what he was up to?

242
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Is up to.
>> What's a verb tense

243
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,500
between friends?
>> Okay look, you know how

244
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm supposed to trust you
on this Paul-is-dead-thing?

245
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
Well, I'm following up on
something, and if and when

246
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,700
it pans out,
I'll let you know.

247
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
Will you call me later?
>> Yeah.

248
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
Ew!

249
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,900
> I hear Vicki's walking
on the wild side.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,300
You know - werewolf ate my baby,
vampire killed my boyfriend,

251
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,800
that sort of thing.

252
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
We're not really that close.

253
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,400
So this 'Spanky' Edwards
murder...

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,100
Who do the Wolverines
think did it?

255
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,300
Bartender >> I don't remember.
Henry >> Take a closer look.

256
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
My eyesight's not so good.
>> He may have met a woman.

257
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,800
Lucky man.

258
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,600
> Tell me if you saw
him two nights ago.

259
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,100
> Yeah, this guy, he was
here when that girl came in.

260
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Seemed like the sort who knew
what she was looking for.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,700
> Just happened to be him.

262
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,900
Yeah, I guess, but I don't
think they knew each other.

263
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,300
What happened?

264
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,700
They started talking,
talking led to dancing, close.

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Next time I looked back
they were disappearing

266
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,700
into the washroom.

267
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
I was just hoping they
remembered to lock the door.

268
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,000
A few minutes later,
the guy comes out

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,900
and books out the door.
>> And the girl?

270
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,600
She came back in here,
and sat right there.

271
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,300
Seemed kind of funny...
I figured maybe she was stoned.

272
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Then she just keeled over.

273
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Fainted?

274
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,400
Died.

275
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,800
Mike >> You busy?

276
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,800
I had a pretty interesting
conversation with Paul Deeds.

277
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,100
I heard. Bringing him in
was not a good idea.

278
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,500
He's a Wolverine.
We talked about

279
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,200
the Wolverine murder.
I don't think he suspects

280
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,700
anything deeper to it.
>> Maybe.

281
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,700
So, what was so interesting?

282
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,000
I asked him who he thought
was targeting the Wolverines.

283
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
He likes the Only Ones for it.

284
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,000
>> Could be.
They're ambitious.

285
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,900
O.C. has a detective
inside the Only Ones.

286
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,900
He said they didn't do it.

287
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,500
Maybe Deeds isn't as good
at his job as he thinks he is.

288
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,600
Or maybe he's got reasons of
his own to hide information.

289
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,200
>> Or maybe Deed's isn't
stealing from the Wolverines.

290
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,500
Maybe he's selling them out.

291
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
To who?
>> I don't know,

292
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,400
maybe another gang,
maybe another agency.

293
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,300
I think it's worth
following up on.

294
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
Give it another day.

295
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,400
Yeah, you got it.

296
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,500
Paul >> Are you telling me
I'm not dead?

297
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,700
>> No, I'm telling you that your
body is still walking around.

298
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,600
I don't know, it might be some
kind of demonic possession.

299
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
You know, your spirit's being
ousted to make room

300
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,600
for something else.

301
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Like some kind of
spiritual squatter?

302
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,100
Coreen's at some underground
library researching it

303
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,600
right now.
It's just that a sudden

304
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,300
penchant for red meat
isn't much of a clue.

305
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,400
The guy's killing
my health regime.

306
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,900
You're taking
this awfully well.

307
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,800
You figure out how I can
hit something and I will.

308
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,400
Well, your body is still
hanging out with the Wolverines

309
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
so that kind of rules
them out as suspects.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Who else would want you dead?

311
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
Seriously dead or
just a little dead?

312
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,100
Two lists?
What is wrong with you?

313
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,500
> You don't take on
undercover to make friends.

314
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
What, like you don't have lists?

315
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,500
See, I knew you and I weren't
that different, Nelson.

316
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,800
You catch a case, you
don't stop until it's done.

317
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
You don't care who or what
gets in your way.

318
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
No, no, there's
always a line.

319
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh, yeah?
Mrs. Donovan...

320
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,700
the firebug's wife.
You gave te t interview.

321
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,500
Talked about
how he killed that kid.

322
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,300
You did everything you could
to get him set up

323
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,000
as a dangerous offender.
He pulls life, and three days

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,900
later she comes after you
with a butcher knife.

325
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah, with a crazy ass
gleam in her eye.

326
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,300
See?
Everybody's got lists.

327
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,800
It's just, I think I would
handle that differently now.

328
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
That's where we part ways,
Nelson.

329
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,800
You see mistakes and think
you can learn from them.

330
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,800
Are you saying
you can't learn?

331
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,100
I don't see mistakes.

332
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,700
Vicki >> This is the girl
Paul met at the bar?

333
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
Henry >> She dropped dead
right after he left.

334
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
Mohadevan >> How old
do you think she is?

335
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Vicki >> Early twenties?
>> Precisely, on the outside.

336
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,000
But on the inside she has
the cellular structure

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
of a seventy-year-old woman.

338
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,400
Her liver is darker
and smaller.

339
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,700
She has advanced
arteriosclerosis of the heart.

340
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,700
I found atrophy
in all the tissue.

341
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,500
It'sascinating.
>> Isn't there that aging

342
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
disease?
>> Progeria, but she's

343
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,200
too old for that.
>> Correct, and progeria

344
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
is genetic.
This girl is normal

345
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,500
in every respect.
It's just like she's burned out.

346
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,900
What do you think caused it?
>> I haven't the slightest idea.

347
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Is there anything else
besides the aging?

348
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,700
>> Her diet was terrible
but hardly terminal -

349
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
a stomach full of raw meat.

350
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,600
[pager beeps]
Excuse me.

351
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Paul's body was chowing
down on raw steak today.

352
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
>> This girl was his last
memory, or at least

353
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,900
the last memory he told
you about, anyway.

354
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,000
Paul >> Wow! Vicki!
Oh, we meet again.

355
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,900
I must be living right.

356
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,300
Though, I have to wonder,
what are you doing here?

357
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,600
>> She's a friend of a friend.
>> Hm.

358
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,200
>> Do you know her?
>> Me? No, no friend.

359
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,500
Just in the neighborhood.
>> I'll tell you,

360
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,200
for someone who's undercover,
you're awfully visible.

361
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,900
>> Who's he?
>> My chiropractor.

362
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,500
Henry >> You never know when
something needs to be cracked.

363
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah, I guess you have time
now to take care of your health.

364
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Tough break, though, having to
leave the job you love.

365
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,000
This one has its benefits.

366
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,500
You haven't changed.

367
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,700
You're one of those cops
who are going to die

368
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,300
with their boots on.
>> Yeah, just like you, right?

369
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,300
>> Yeah. We've got that
in common all right.

370
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,300
Too bad.
She's pretty.

371
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,900
You never know what's
coming for you, right?

372
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,200
>> Okay, now I know you don't
know him, but that man

373
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
is not right.
>> That doesn't mean

374
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,300
the thing that contacted you
is Paul.

375
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,700
When you're a cop you have
to learn to trust your gut.

376
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,800
And I'm telling you,
that was not Paul Deeds.

377
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
My client is.
>> Okay, fine.

378
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,300
you want me to kill him now?

379
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,000
It's lovely to know that's
an option, but perhaps

380
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
we'll save that for later.

381
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,900
Later.

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Mike >> Hey, Dave, it's me.

383
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,400
He
I'm outside the
Alleycats Body Rub.

384
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,500
It's an Asian gang, right?

385
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,800
Dragons, right.

386
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,400
Do you know if there's
a turf war going on

387
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,500
between the Dragons
and the Wolverines?

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
That's what I thought.

389
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,100
Listen, see if you can
find out any info

390
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,700
on an attractive Dragon girl,
late twenties, she's driving

391
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,200
a black porche, can't make
out the plates just yet.

392
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,800
Yeah, thanks.

393
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,800
Paul >> Hello, beautiful.

394
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,400
Anyone can see
us here, idiot!

395
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,700
>> Idiot, ha! It turns me on
when you call me idiot.

396
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,600
You're the one
who's committing suicide.

397
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,200
Your boys just took over
another Wolverine operation.

398
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,300
I am here for my thank you.

399
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Your thank you was
already delivered.

400
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,300
>> Cash? That isn't the
thank you I'm looking for.

401
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,500
Forget it.

402
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,500
Don't say no right away,
baby, I brought you a gift.

403
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,600
Your active file with th
cops just got a little lighter.

404
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,900
>> Sweet little Wolverine,
I might just keep you.

405
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,500
>> I think you can
do better than that.

406
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,900
I don't fraternize
with employees.

407
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,300
Well, think of
us as partners.

408
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
>> Can't get a promotion
in your own bike gang?

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,900
>> They don't wear
tights like you.

410
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
>> This is good,

411
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,800
but I want you to
really impress me.

412
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,200
>> Don't tease me, Lady Fang.

413
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,900
>> I'm not.

414
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,100
>> Impressed, coming up.

415
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,400
I can't wait.

416
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,100
You're going to be yummy.

417
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,500
Vicki >> Interesting girl, she
took a left turn after college

418
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,000
ended up dealing drugs.
>> What kind?

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
Small time dime bags mostly.

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,700
She's got a few charges,
but no convictions.

421
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
>> I talked to Tessa's mom.
She says her daughter had

422
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
cleaned up over the last
few months.

423
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Got straight in N.A.
Was working full time.

424
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,700
Just one small wrinkle.
>> Oh, the kind of wrinkle

425
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,400
we like?
>> A boyfriend who was still

426
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,700
in the life.
Probably still an addict.

427
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
Mom says Tessa was
trying to save him.

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
Did you get the
boyfriend's name?

429
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
>> Derek Pheasant.
I don't know how much good

430
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,900
it will do us, though,
because he's dead, too.

431
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,300
When did he die?
>> Four days before Tessa.

432
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,400
Bouncer >> What the hell
are you doing in here?

433
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,900
Mike >> Chuntao Fang.

434
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,400
You got a minute?

435
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,100
Unless you got a warrant,
cop, get out!

436
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,300
>> Oh, come onon.
Tell me is it that obvious?

437
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,200
Hey, is it the tie?
It's the tie, isn't it?

438
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
You guys all
have the same smell.

439
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Well, you know, we do
get a volume discount.

440
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,400
I don't talk to cops.

441
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,700
>> Oh, you don't, huh?
Well, you certainly seem

442
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,900
to talk to Wolverines,
or at least one of them.

443
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,800
So it looks like the Dragons
are moving into Wolverine

444
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,500
territory, doesn't it?

445
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
Three deaths so far.

446
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,900
>> Since when do cops
care about bikers dying?

447
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,900
>> Well you see, Chuntao,
homicide is homicide.

448
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm after the killers,
or killer.

449
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,300
I think you've come
to the wrong place.

450
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,600
You know, Chuntao, I'm
really starting to doubt that.

451
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,300
Well, you look kind of
busy here, so...

452
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,600
you have a nice day,
Miss Fang.

453
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,500
Fang.
You know, that would make

454
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
a nice alias for a Wolverine,
wouldn't it?

455
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,800
We'll be in touch.

456
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
Nice.

457
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,000
> Okay, what are the chances
that Derek Pheasant

458
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,600
just dropped dead?
Henry >> He was a junkie.

459
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,800
So we'll look at
the coroner's report.

460
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,800
Come on, two deaths, one
after the other like that.

461
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,400
>> And then your client was
evicted from his body

462
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,300
right after being with her.

463
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,900
It may well be jumping
from body to body.

464
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
Aha!
Aha!

465
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,500
See, you can admit it,

466
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,600
any time now.

467
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,800
>> All right, the spirit
you've been seeing probably

468
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,100
is that of Paul Deeds.

469
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,800
> Seriously, you're
becoming a fine detective.

470
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
And I'm not telling you to
give up your critical mind.

471
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,700
I mean, you get cocky,
you get sloppy.

472
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,900
A fine detective,
you really think so?

473
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,300
I'd make a good partner then?

474
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
>> Oh, you jostling for
space on the letterhead?

475
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
>> For starters.

476
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,500
i tell you, after the last
few months, with everything

477
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
that's happened, I couldn't
have done it without you.

478
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I mean I wouldn't
have wanted to.

479
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,100
>> That means more than
a mountain of letterhead.

480
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,600
Coreen >> You wanted
the mocha, right?

481
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,600
>> Yeah, exactly what I wanted.

482
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,500
Crueler?

483
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Biker >> Hey, Paul!

484
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,400
>> Hey, I got something for you!
>> What?

485
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,700
It's hot!
[gunfire!]

486
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,200
Vicki >> Nothing like Homicide
the morning of a fresh murder.

487
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,500
Yeah, and I've got
a feeling you know

488
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,100
what we're dealing with.
Come on, let's go to my desk.

489
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,900
Vicki >> So, Tessa's boyfriend,
Derek, was pre-deceased

490
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,300
by a hooker named Mary Wallace.

491
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,900
They all died of the same
mysterious cause of death,

492
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,700
burning out from the inside.

493
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,600
Now, Mary Wallace had a john
named Bert Winters,

494
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,300
this is according to the
girls on the stroll.

495
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,200
Also dead.
>> Yup. So, Tessa Bradley,

496
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,800
Paul Deeds, Bert Winters,
Derek Pheasant, Mary Wallace,

497
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,200
All dead.
And they all knew each other,

498
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,600
okay, however superficially.
And they've all died

499
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,100
from the same cause.
>> Yeah, except that Deeds

500
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
isn't dead.
>> Well, not yet.

501
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,000
Okay, so what is killing
all of these people?

502
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,800
I don't know.
Coreen's looking into it.

503
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,500
Did you find anything out?

504
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,800
I'm not sure.

505
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,500
Oh.
You can't tell me.

506
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Which means Internal Affairs
is looking into it.

507
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,000
I didn't tell you that.

508
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,800
Look Vicki, be careful
with Paul, okay?

509
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,000
And I don't just mean the guy
who's walking around.

510
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,400
You're going to blame a guy
who's dead for something

511
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,000
his body is doing?
>> There's more to it than that.

512
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,900
I know he played fast
and loose, believe me,

513
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,500
but he was always straight up.
>> Yeah, maybe he was

514
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,300
straight up, but that's
a slippery slope and you

515
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,800
and I both know that, Vicki.

516
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,500
Okay, you cut a few corners
here and there and before

517
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,200
you know it, you can start
justifying anything to yourself.

518
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,300
I'm pretty sure that
Paul wasn't clean.

519
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Vicki, I know you like the guy.

520
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Just ask him, will you?

521
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,800
Sure.

522
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,300
Vicki >> Bert begat Mary, Mary
begat Derek, Derek begat Tessa

523
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,600
and Tessa begat...
Paul >> And Tessa begat me.

524
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,800
It moves quick.

525
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah, it's gone anywhere
from three-and-a-half weeks

526
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
to as short as six days.

527
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,200
Guess I should
treasure every moment.

528
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
Well, we have to get this
thing out of you before

529
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,200
it does too much damage.
Your body's in good shape, so...

530
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Thanks for noticing.

531
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
> What I mean is that maybe
we can get this thing out

532
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,400
before it does too much damage.

533
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,100
Look Paul, there's something
I have to ask you about,

534
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,200
and I need you
to be straight with me.

535
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Are you saying
I haven't been?

536
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,300
I just found out that IA
has been investigating you.

537
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,100
Why would they be doing that?

538
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,800
Did you get in too
deep with the bikers?

539
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,400
Did you take a payoff
you shouldn't have?

540
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,200
You got the wrong guy.

541
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,600
Paul, this thing is jumping
from low-life criminal

542
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,600
to low-life criminal.
What did it want with you?

543
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Maybe it thought I had
a bright future in the gang.

544
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,300
No, I talked to
your boss downtown.

545
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,400
He says you haven't delivered
any Intel on the Wolverines.

546
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
You couldn't have been
that connected then.

547
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,500
Are you saying I can't
do my job or that I'm dirty?

548
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,800
What I'm saying is that this
thing isn't attracted to looks.

549
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,700
It's attracted to a certain
kind of essence.

550
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,100
So something was going on with
you and you better tell me

551
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,200
what it was or I stop looking.

552
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,100
Wow, you give 17 years
to this job.

553
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,000
four lost marriages, no kids,
and now I'm dead, and the

554
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
only person who knows it is you.

555
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,900
You're my only ally and
now you want to smear me?

556
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
Thanks for nothing, Nelson.

557
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,600
Paul...
Henry >> What was that?

558
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,200
You felt that?

559
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,800
Man, I'm busting your chops for
not trusting my instincts,

560
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
and then this guy goes
and plays me.

561
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,600
He was a good cop in his time
and he was also your client.

562
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
You can't blame yourself.

563
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,300
You found another one?

564
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,900
> Yeah, died in a flop house
a couple of weeks ago.

565
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
> Humble beginnings
for the chain.

566
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,700
Maybe they're
>> Mcareer opportunities.ls.

567
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,500
He goes from this low-life
and its unemployed john

568
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,400
to biker in six weeks flat.

569
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,800
The Ekimmu moves
in and gets a twofer.

570
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,600
The Ekimmu?

571
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,000
Coreen and I found a
description of an ancient

572
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Babylonian entity.
It moves from one body

573
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,400
to the next.
Its whole raison d'etre

574
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,200
is to create violence and chaos.

575
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,300
The Ekimmu, you're sure?

576
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,700
>> Well, the raw meat
was the real clue.

577
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,500
It lives in a perpetual state
of hunger and anger.

578
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Raw meat being its
poison of choice.

579
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Now, according to the book,
it jumps from one gender

580
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,600
to the next.
But it has to touch

581
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,800
Its victim to make the move.

582
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,000
By touch I'm assuming
you don't mean a handshake.

583
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,300
I'd imagine something
a little more intimate.

584
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,600
You would.
>> So as it moves, I mean that

585
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,300
would be the moment that Paul
would be able to jump

586
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
back into his body.

587
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,800
> Right, and it hasn't
been in there that long,

588
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,700
so maybe the cellular damage
isn't that far advanced.

589
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,400
Now all we have to do is find
Paul and find a way to trap

590
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
the Ekimmu between bodies.

591
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, that might be a little
difficult because I think

592
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,600
he just fired me.

593
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,500
You can pick a fight
in two dimensions?

594
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
You know, that's incredible,
Vicki.

595
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,300
Look, Henry, I heard
a rumour that he was dirty.

596
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,700
I don't know if he's
planting lies, stealing secrets

597
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,800
or destroying evidence,
but I had to ask.

598
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,000
Something's going on.
>> When we were at the morgue,

599
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,300
there was a sheaf of papers
in his jacket.

600
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
I didn't think anything
of it at the time.

601
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,700
Records is down there.
>> Would he have access?

602
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,300
He'd find a way.
If we could just figure out

603
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,500
what he was up to, then maybe
we can figure out what's coming.

604
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,300
Or who's next.

605
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Will you drop
me at the station?

606
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Yeah, and while you're there?

607
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,700
Well, maybe you can't
see a ghost, but perhaps

608
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,200
you can shadow an Ekimmu.

609
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Henry >> What was the
name of the massage place?

610
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Alleycats.

611
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,600
You're there, aren't you?

612
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,600
If you are there, there's always
a way to make things right.

613
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,800
Paul >> A vampire lecturing me.

614
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,700
I took something for
myself, no one got hurt.

615
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
I know that some of my
greatest joys have occurred

616
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,400
only because of what some
people called my curse.

617
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,900
So being a ghost will
actually solve my issues.

618
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,800
You're classic.

619
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,300
I may be becoming
a detective after all.

620
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,200
I think we just figured out
where it's going to strike next.

621
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,300
ght, October 3,
Wolverines, surveillance photo.

622
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,800
Mike >> Yeah, still here.

623
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,400
October 8, Wolverines,
micro cassette recorder?

624
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,600
Still here.
>> So how many 'still here's'

625
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,700
is that?

626
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,000
Okay, try looking
up the Dragons.

627
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,500
Because...?

628
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,000
Because he's involved
with them somehow.

629
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,800
What do you mean?
Playing one gang against

630
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
the other?
>> I saw him having a real close

631
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,700
confab with their leader.
>> Define close.

632
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,300
Sharing the
same breath, close.

633
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Okay, November 5, Chuntao
Fang surveillance photo.

634
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,900
Did you say November 5?
>> Yeah.

635
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,200
>> Gone.

636
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,600
Right, there was also
surveillance on Chuntao Fang

637
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,600
from December 7th, 13th
and 20th.

638
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,300
You mean there was.

639
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,500
In fact this whole file
seems a little slim.

640
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,500
These dates, they're from
months before that thing

641
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
took over Paul's body.

642
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,500
So what are you saying?

643
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,500
Paul was working
for the Dragons?

644
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,000
> Give me a better theory.

645
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,300
> All right, see
what you can find.

646
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,500
Can't find.
>> I'm going to have

647
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,500
a conversation with Crowley.
See if she can authorize

648
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,700
a wiretap of the
Alleycat's Massage.

649
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
>> The what?
>> Seems to be Fang's

650
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,200
headquarters.
>> Of course it is.

651
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,400
>> Okay, I'll be
back in a minute.

652
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,200
All right, November 12,
micro cassette recording.

653
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,800
That Dragon's missing, too.

654
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Everybody knows that
dragons don't exist.

655
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,300
Not in here they don't.

656
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,000
See, what I'm trying to
figure out is how much trouble

657
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,700
you and I can get into.

658
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Well, that would
depend on who's asking.

659
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,000
You think you know who I am?

660
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,100
Yeah, you couldn't get into
the underworld, so you're here

661
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,500
acting like a tourist at
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

662
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,300
A bit self-righteous, but
I think you could be some fun.

663
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
>> You ask around.
Everybody says I'm no fun.

664
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
> I'm willing to give it a try.

665
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,400
Stupid creature!

666
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,400
Don't try to hold on to
your miserable existence!

667
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,000
>> I've worked very hard to
be this miserable.

668
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,700
Paul >> Vicki.

669
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,700
You're back.

670
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,500
> You don't sound
too happy about that.

671
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,400
You should have told
me what you were up to.

672
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,900
Chuntao Fang?
You stole police records.

673
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,400
It wasn't me.

674
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
Right.
And what about the files

675
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,700
bo that went missing
six months ago?

676
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,000
>> Nothing I did
compromised my job as a cop.

677
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,700
All right, so I gave some
information about the Wolverines

678
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
to another gang.

679
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,300
Telling one group of bad guys
about another group of bad guys,

680
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,600
letting them take a bite
out of each other,

681
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,300
I don't see that as a crime.
>> No, especially not when

682
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,200
you're getting paid for it.

683
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Oh...there's that sanctimony
I missed and loved

684
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,700
about everybody in this job.
You know what?

685
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,600
I thought you were different.
I thought that you

686
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,400
would understand.
>> Understand what?

687
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
How to get people killed
by remote while you make

688
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,100
money off of it?
>> I was getting results,

689
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,100
bikers off the street!
More than I would've done

690
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,600
in ten years if I was
doing it straight!

691
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,900
Oh, the end justifies
the means.

692
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,100
It was just a perk that a big
wad of money fell into your

693
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,800
pocket while you were doing it.

694
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,800
I didn't do wrong.

695
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,700
You don't see mistakes.

696
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,100
> Oh, wow, okay.

697
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,000
I took some cash.

698
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,500
I gave myself to this job and
it took everything so big deal.

699
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
Big deal.

700
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,500
I thought you were
one of the good guys.

701
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,000
I stuck my neck out for you.

702
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,800
I told people that despite all
the bravado and all the bluster

703
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
That you were a good cop.

704
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,700
Man, what a mistake that was.

705
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,800
I come bearing gifts.

706
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,900
Cedar.

707
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,700
A cedar dagger?

708
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,300
The Ekimmu
is a Babylonian spirit.

709
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,900
This is a Babylonian solution.

710
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,600
Coreen says the moment
to strike is very precise.

711
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,700
The Ekimmu has to
be between bodies.

712
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,900
I think we all
know who that body is.

713
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Let's go.

714
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,200
>> Lady Fang, did you like that
love letter I sent you, baby?

715
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Two dead Wolverines,
I'm impressed.

716
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,500
>> You're impressed.
Want to have some fun now?

717
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,400
What's you're idea of fun
my sweet carnivore?

718
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,400
The usual - destruction,
chaos, death.

719
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,000
>> That better not be what's
on the menu for tonight.

720
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,300
>> You're on the menu tonight.

721
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,900
Henry >> VICKI, NOW!

722
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,700
Oh god, is he dead?
>> Where's the ghost?

723
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,600
i don't know.

724
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,900
Paul!

725
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,600
Paul!

726
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,300
Tell you what, Nelson,
I'll take fighting

727
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,000
the bad guys we used to,
over this crap any day.

728
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,300
Hey, that's my livelihood
you're talking about.

729
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
> You're welcome to it.

730
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,200
I'm sorry.

731
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm sorry I lied to you,
I'm sorry for everything.

732
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
> That's okay, it happens.

733
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,200
>> No, it's not
supposed to happen.

734
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,900
It's not supposed to
happen to people like us.

735
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,100
We're the good guys, right?

736
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,100
Yeah.

737
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,200
Yeah, we're the good guys.

738
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,100
>> Man, I'm beat.

739
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,900
You know?

740
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,400
>> Hey, hey, hey!
>> Get if off of me!

741
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,200
Calm down, calm down!
>> Get it off! Keep it off!

742
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,900
Let's go.

743
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,900
>> I'm sorry.

744
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
That's a first.

745
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,100
Did something
crawl into you, too?

746
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,400
I was mad at you for not
believing I was talking

747
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,700
to Paul's ghost.

748
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,900
I was wrong, too.

749
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,000
I took everything
he said at face value.

750
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,200
It never occurred to me
that he lied about it all.

751
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, except for the ghost part.

752
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
We all need to
believe in something.

753
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Mike >> Hey.
>> Hey.

754
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,100
Internal's investigation
will get filed away.

755
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,300
Yeah, but it won't matter.
When people remember Paul Deeds,

756
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,500
all they're going to
remember is a dirty cop.

757
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,200
They didn't see what we saw.

758
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,700
In the end he came clean.

759
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
>> No fun in remembering that.

760
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
We'll remember.

761
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,400
Night.

762
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,000
>> Mike's going to be one
of those guys who dies

763
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,300
with his boots on, too,
isn't he?

764
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
We all will.

765
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,500
We?

766
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Yeah, we!
