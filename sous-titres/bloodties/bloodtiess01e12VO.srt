1
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:08,070
It breaks
my heart every time.

2
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:10,985
I know.
Poor girl sacrificing herself

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,375
to save her village.
- No...

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,228
Orlok, dying for love.

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,747
Vampires knows
when dawn's coming.

6
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,193
You can feel the sun
long before you see it.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,375
Anyone ever try and
keep you up past your bedtime?

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,880
Passion can be a great
distraction for vampires

9
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:33,227
as well as humans.
And playing on the edge

10
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,072
of getting burned
is part of the fun.

11
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:37,062
You'd think there'd be easier
ways of getting a meal

12
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:38,863
than having to get involved
in a messy romance.

13
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:40,449
It's not about taking blood.

14
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,050
When I feed,
there's a connection.

15
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:48,441
Every emotion adds to the
quality of the experience.

16
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:54,245
Sometimes it's taking someone in a
dark alley and tasting their fear.

17
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,531
Sometimes it's tasting a lover
in the throes of passion.

18
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:02,810
Then it's easy
to forget the dawn.

19
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,056
Popcorn?

20
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:12,732
Passion isn't something you
can shut out forever, Vicki.

21
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,198
It knocks down walls.

22
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,321
It sweeps you off your feet.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,015
It can change your life.

24
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:24,147
Isn't this supposed
to be a double feature?

25
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,467
Yeah.

26
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,397
ARGH! DAMMIT!

27
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,499
How the hell did you
get in here?

28
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,173
Exactly.

29
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:20,640
What did you do to my place?

30
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,413
Dude, you've got about five
seconds to get out of here.

31
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:24,481
I don't think so.

32
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,887
Sweet stereo.

33
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:36,085
And when I say sweet,
I mean wicked awesome.

34
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,592
Okay, so here's
how the day is shaping up.

35
00:02:56,627 --> 00:03:00,225
10:30, Walter Brioux, looking
for his estranged daughter.

36
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,637
11:30, Anna Reggit,
needs someone to check out

37
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,624
staff pilfering
at her clothing store,

38
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,748
and then at 2:00...
Are you okay?

39
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,638
Hm?
They're, um... burning

40
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,386
or something today.
- You should put something

41
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,763
on them.
- Like what, demon-off cream?

42
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,977
I should just get them removed.

43
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,231
Laser or skin grafts
or something.

44
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,039
You wouldn't.

45
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,239
They're demon brands, Coreen,
they're not 'Hello Kitty'

46
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:28,785
tattoos.
Actually, that would be worse.

47
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:31,520
They're part of you now.
They're powerful.

48
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:32,440
You've seen that.

49
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,866
Yeah, and I still have
no clue how to use them.

50
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,079
- We could try to find out.
- No, I think I'll deal

51
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:38,820
with them the same way I deal
with everything that's

52
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:41,089
complicated in my life.
- I'll just avoid it

53
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:44,484
until it goes away.
- Oh, and that works for you?

54
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,845
Oh yeah, job, friends, love.
My decks are clear.

55
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,012
Funny, I was happy
when I walked in here.

56
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:53,839
- Excuse me, Ms. Nelson?
- Yes.

57
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:56,670
- My name is Camille Stokes.
- Can I help you?

58
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,467
I need to talk to you.
I believe it's urgent.

59
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:00,734
Have a seat.

60
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,403
You probably won't even
believe what I have to tell you.

61
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,585
I have a very
open mind these days.

62
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,357
Well, you see, I'm psychic.

63
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,983
Last night I had a dream,
a terrifying dream.

64
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:16,446
And you were in it.
- But we've never met.

65
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,874
I saw you and this office
and the thing that

66
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,562
wanted to hurt you.
It was pure evil.

67
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,909
Now since when does my
landlord show up in dreams?

68
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,904
Don't joke about this.
I saw you die.

69
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,931
- How did I die?
- I saw a room, red walls,

70
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:35,235
black floor.
There was a pentagram,

71
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:38,565
and someone was
invoking something evil.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,636
- Who was doing the summoning?
- I don't know,

73
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:45,530
but I know what he was using.
Three powerful objects -

74
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:48,528
a stone chalice,
an ancient dagger

75
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:50,786
and a book,
a mystic book.

76
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,149
- What else did you see?
- The thing in the center,

77
00:04:55,855 --> 00:05:01,282
it took you, your body. But I felt
it was more interested in your soul.

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,435
When you disappeared,
that's when I woke up.

79
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,517
I'm sorry, you probably think
I'm crazy, but the vision

80
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:11,297
was so powerful
I had to look you up.

81
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,827
Does any of it mean
anything to you?

82
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:17,296
I really wish it didn't.
If you have any more visions,

83
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,521
would you mind giving me a call?

84
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,684
Of course.

85
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,782
I'll be in touch.

86
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,019
Do you think she's right?

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,725
Maybe this is just some
random woman having a bad dream.

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,140
What about all
the stuff she saw?

89
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:38,384
The chalice?
The knife?

90
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:41,932
Henry already destroyed that.
- Yeah, I thought he did.

91
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:51,469
What do you mean clawed?
Like an animal?

92
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,725
Oh, beautiful.

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,852
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be down
in ten minutes.

94
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,815
All right.
- Catch of the day?

95
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,092
Yeah, somebody dumped the
body of a guy in the Annex.

96
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,319
He was sliced up pretty bad.
- Yeah, how bad?

97
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,714
Well, whoever did it opened
up his throat and bled him out.

98
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:07,059
- Is Dave still in court?
- Yeah, all week.

99
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:07,973
I'll come with you.

100
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:10,557
Depends...
one of those for me?

101
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,932
- You know it.
- Hey, welcome aboard, newbie!

102
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,468
Oh, I'm driving.

103
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,853
Hey, if you're good you
can play with my siren.

104
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,820
Oh, promises, promises.

105
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,025
We need to talk.

106
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,406
Look, this woman came
into my office today.

107
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,157
She's a psychic no less.
- Vicki, this really

108
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,854
isn't a good time.
- There is a point.

109
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,482
I promise you.
So this woman comes into

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,956
my office and she tells me
she's having a vision of, uh...

111
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:35,822
Oh.

112
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,906
- It's business.
- I understand.

113
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:41,829
I'll be waiting.

114
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,744
You don't rest, do you?

115
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:47,983
You know, I thought you were
the Prince of Darkness, but it's

116
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:49,804
really more like the Lord
of Lechery or something.

117
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,599
- A man has to eat.
- You don't have to play

118
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:55,233
with your food.
- I take it this 'warning' you received can't wait.

119
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:58,710
Hm, well let's see, she said
a demon was coming to get me

120
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,334
and that someone was assembling
the objects used to summon him.

121
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,928
That can't be, right?
Because you destroyed all

122
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,434
of the objects Norman Bridewell
used to summon the demon.

123
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:09,854
You did destroy them, right?
- I took care of them,

124
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,632
like I said.
- And that's why someone's

125
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,840
having visions of demons
throwing a surprise party

126
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,231
for me.
- Vicki, you don't know

127
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,552
this psychic.
You don't know how

128
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:18,829
accurate her gift is.
Visions are like dreams.

129
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:21,253
You have to know how
to interpret them.

130
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,556
Hm... let's see.
Astraroth dragging me

131
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,824
into a pentagram
and eating my soul.

132
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:28,599
Pretty clear.
- That's why I separated them.

133
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:31,027
With the objects divided
they can't be used

134
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,421
in that ritual again.
- Well, maybe that's why

135
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,234
someone is trying
to unseparate them.

136
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:36,878
Where are they?

137
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:39,299
The grimoire and the chalice
are with trusted friends.

138
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,564
The knife is safe here with me.

139
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:45,998
Yeah, cause, uh... no one
could get in here, right?

140
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,531
What do you want?

141
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:52,395
Gather them up and destroy
them like we said we would.

142
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,211
The night's almost over.

143
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,195
If you insist, we'll
collect and destroy them.

144
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,558
Tomorrow.

145
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:04,005
Bon appetit.

146
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:29,780
I've made contact.

147
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,329
<i>Do you
have what you need?</i>

148
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,137
She's already connected
with the nightwalker.

149
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,097
They're so stupid they'll
lead us right to what

150
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,942
we're looking for.
Lemmings.

151
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:59,148
- Any luck on the ID?
- No...

152
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,150
not yet.

153
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:05,836
The poor boy's fingerprints
aren't in the system.

154
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:08,380
The guy's built.
We should see if any

155
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,739
of the campus hockey teams
had any no-shows today.

156
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:12,764
And how'd you get
to hockey player?

157
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,134
Forearms, and the
calluses on the palms.

158
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,812
Betcha he shot left.

159
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:22,290
So, Doc, what caused
that slash on our

160
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,791
hockey player's neck?
- Whatever did,

161
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:27,107
it was razor-sharp.
All the major veins and arteries

162
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:29,689
in the neck were severed.
- Like that case a few

163
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:32,236
months ago, the five bodies.
- Yeah, it's kinda

164
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,790
what I'm thinking.
- The cause of death

165
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,561
is certainly consistent,
and the fact that the body

166
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:37,811
is missing all of its blood.

167
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,974
You think it's the same guy?

168
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,535
It's him, or it's
someone pulling a copycat.

169
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,416
I've got a feeling we're
going to see a lot more bodies

170
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,244
piling up
before this is through.

171
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,868
Thanks, Doc.

172
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,425
If only you could talk.

173
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,584
Wakey, wakey.

174
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,564
Bad dream?
- Yeah, I was having this

175
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:09,928
crazy nightmare that I was
a private investigator spending

176
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:12,314
all my time chasing around
things that sane people

177
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,860
don't believe in.
- I wish we could both

178
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:17,200
wake up from that dream.
And by the way, when are you

179
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:19,456
going to lock
that front door of yours?

180
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,643
Bad for business.
Besides, I don't think

181
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,987
it would stop the things
that are chasing me these days.

182
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:27,178
Let me guess, demon
convention in town?

183
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:28,876
Oh, you heard
their radio ads.

184
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:32,663
Well, I'm not an expert
in these matters but we've

185
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,128
got a dead kid and it looks
a lot like the demon killings

186
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,317
from a few months ago.

187
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:38,864
Where did you find him?

188
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,484
Brunswick, just south
of Bloor.

189
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,317
A psychic came in here,
told me she'd had a vision

190
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:54,070
that someone had started up
a new pentagram with a fresh set of corpses.

191
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,513
She said the demon was after me.

192
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:59,154
Look, Vick...

193
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,639
my sister and her husband,
they have a place in Mexico.

194
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:11,313
Maybe you should take some
time off, catch some rays, huh?

195
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,276
- You think I should run?
- If it'll keep you alive,

196
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:14,951
yeah I do.
- This isn't like witness

197
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,516
protection, Mike, these
things will find you.

198
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,894
So what are you
going to do, Vick?

199
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,493
Call it a preemptive strike.

200
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,630
The demon needs certain things and I'm
going to make sure it doesn't get them.

201
00:11:28,444 --> 00:11:31,376
All right, so what
can I do to help?

202
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:37,385
The demon has to work through
somebody, so if we could find

203
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,686
whoever it is, we could stop this
whole thing from going to hell.

204
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,424
You left the chalice
in an antique store?

205
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,490
This is anything
but an antique store.

206
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,033
Maurice is a
powerful individual.

207
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,974
Who also happens to
sell dusty old furniture?

208
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,797
He knows this world and he
hates magic even more than I do.

209
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,593
He promised he'd keep
the chalice safe.

210
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,930
Let's just hope he's
a man who keeps his promises.

211
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,807
Nothing here for you.

212
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,595
You're not much
of a salesman.

213
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,349
You're not much
of a customer.

214
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:31,705
What do you want, Henry?
- The chalice.

215
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,136
- Don't be absurd.
- I know I asked you

216
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,533
to guard it,
but the situation's changed.

217
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,226
The chalice is
perfectly safe.

218
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,849
I don't think you understand.

219
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,342
What part of the apocalypse
do you think eludes me, my dear?

220
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,601
I have been fighting demonic
influences since before

221
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:48,207
you were born.
- Then we both want

222
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:50,906
the same things.
So just get the chalice and let

223
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:54,888
me destroy it once and for all.
- Vicki was connected

224
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:57,249
to the ritual.
- And one person has already

225
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,540
been killed trying
to bring Astaroth back.

226
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:01,675
Henry, when you asked me
to guard this, you made me

227
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,422
swear never to reveal it's
whereabouts to anyone, even you.

228
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:09,076
The situation has changed.
It's important.

229
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:13,245
Well, I have no idea
where it is.

230
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,626
- You lost it?
- It is beyond anybody's reach,

231
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,403
even mine.
- You used a concealment spell.

232
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:23,355
You always were
a clever one, Vampire.

233
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,744
I thought you said he hated
magic even more than you do.

234
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,187
I only use magic
to defeat magic.

235
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,291
No one will ever see
the chalice again.

236
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,367
Well, I don't know about you
but I would sure feel

237
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,409
a whole lot safer if we
destroyed the damn thing.

238
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,043
Who says it would
let you hurt it?

239
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,552
The concentration of evil
channeled into these things

240
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,237
gives them their own power.
- There must be some way

241
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,888
to find the chalice.
Even if we can't destroy it,

242
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,691
we have to try.
- I have taken on a burden.

243
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,924
You're best out of it,
both of you.

244
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,632
I'm sorry, but what I do
I do for the good of everyone.

245
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,267
It is my mission.

246
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,591
Thank you, Maurice.

247
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,711
Come on.

248
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:11,837
Maurice knows more about
the chalice than either of us.

249
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:14,012
If he feels it's safe,
maybe we should trust him.

250
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,770
Maybe that concealment spell
works on us but how do we know

251
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,080
it's going to work on a demon.

252
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:20,300
There comes a moment when
you have to believe in people.

253
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,589
I'm running a little bit low on that right now, not

254
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:26,198
to mention time and patience.
- It's been safe with Maurice.

255
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,714
He'll continue to protect it.
There's nothing else

256
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:33,226
we can do right now.
Are you coming?

257
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:36,299
No, I need some air.

258
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,339
Do you know what time it is?

259
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:00,963
Somewhere between way
too late and way too early.

260
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,188
What do you know about this
case you're not telling me?

261
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,691
- You know what I know, Kate.
- The last time these murders

262
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:11,327
started up, there was all kinds of
talk about pentagrams and black magic.

263
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,329
You know, people talk.

264
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,752
People also said Vicki
was involved in it somehow.

265
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:22,307
We've all heard the kind
of cases she's taking

266
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,864
on these days.
- Come on Kate, it's a living.

267
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,240
This is crazy stuff.
You don't want to get involved.

268
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,038
Yeah, tell me about it.

269
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:33,892
Take a break.

270
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:36,190
We'll get on this
in the morning.

271
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:38,130
We'll find this guy.

272
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,421
Yeah, you're right.

273
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,818
Let's call it a night, huh?

274
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:54,627
We're closed.

275
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:11,614
Ms. Nelson, I told you,
you couldn't have the chalice.

276
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:12,747
I understand.

277
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,448
I just had to ask again.

278
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,562
I hope you can understand
how important this is to me.

279
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:23,502
My dear, I know what
the demon did to you,

280
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,959
and I promise you, Henry would
never have brought the chalice

281
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:29,278
to me if he didn't think
I could protect it.

282
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,783
Are you sure about that?

283
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:33,908
Absolutely, there's no
way anyone could find it.

284
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:38,184
What if I ask nicely?

285
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:47,645
I know what you are,
and I'm not afraid.

286
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,907
- It's here.
- No.

287
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,804
You think you're so smart.
You should have read

288
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,775
the fine print dude.
The thing about spells is

289
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,711
the magic dies
with the person who cast it.

290
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,967
Argghhhh!

291
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:33,887
The same killer
as our hockey player?

292
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,269
- It looks that way.
- But he doesn't bother

293
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,796
to move the body.
He's getting sloppy.

294
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,293
You know, I thought
everybody had security cameras

295
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,364
these days.
- Maybe nothing worth stealing.

296
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:46,225
All looks like junk to me.

297
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,861
It's hard to tell
with some of this stuff.

298
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,713
There's got to be at least
a few hundred dollars.

299
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,790
So our killer's not
in it for the money.

300
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,795
Try this. What if it's not
about who he kills, but where?

301
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,984
Well, the first body
was moved.

302
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,209
Then the placement of the
body, maybe there's some

303
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,419
sort of pattern to it.
- Kills like that

304
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,579
are usually posed.
The first body was just dumped.

305
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:13,704
Looks like the killer just
left him where he fell.

306
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,890
Maybe time's our way in.

307
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,446
Maybe the killer's
on a timetable.

308
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:20,615
Hey, um... Mike!

309
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:22,786
Oh, no, she's fine,
let her through.

310
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:25,004
- What is she doing here?
- Well, if this is the same

311
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,814
guy as our last killer,
I thought Vicki might

312
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,590
have some ideas.
- Yeah and, hey, who doesn't

313
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,385
like starting their day
with a homicide?

314
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,942
It's always nice to have
a joke at the crime scene.

315
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,288
- Ouch!
- Yeah.

316
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:38,563
All right.

317
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,024
You know, Vick, there's
some interesting books here.

318
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,136
Yeah, I'm sure Maurice
has quite the collection.

319
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:50,314
- You knew him?
- I met him last night.

320
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:54,212
Henry and I were here,
before he was killed.

321
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:56,158
That's great.

322
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,386
So I suppose you even
know the motive.

323
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:03,743
Maurice was guarding one of the
objects needed to summon the demon.

324
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,585
Looks like he
did a hell of a job.

325
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,707
I think that whoever's doing
this killed him they got

326
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:09,829
what they came for.
- What does that mean?

327
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,121
That he's ready
to let the demon through?

328
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:13,965
Not quite. He still needs a few more things.

329
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,701
Unfortunately, I happen
to be one of them.

330
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,873
So whoever it was
has the chalice.

331
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:25,785
But everything else
is still safe, right?

332
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,249
Henry thought the
chalice was safe.

333
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,664
I don't care what Maurice says
about these things not being

334
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,770
able to be destroyed.
I want five minutes alone

335
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,841
with them and a sledgehammer.
- What if we can't

336
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,116
destroy them?
It just keeps killing

337
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:36,846
until it gets them?
- Maybe.

338
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,960
Or until we find whoever's
doing this and stop them.

339
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:42,813
It's going to be okay.

340
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:46,513
We stopped it once, and that
was before we were

341
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:49,515
supernatural experts.
No case too strange, right?

342
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,645
I guess, but I'm still looking up wards
and protection spells just in case.

343
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,900
Any luck tracking
down Camille?

344
00:19:57,675 --> 00:20:00,497
She's not in the book and
motor vehicles doesn't have

345
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,384
any record, but there are still
a few 'C. Stokes' out there

346
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,499
that I haven't heard from yet.

347
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:07,937
Well, she is a psychic.

348
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:10,035
She might have a stage name.

349
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,649
Call Mike and see if police
records have anything on her.

350
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:15,206
If she's tuned in
to whoever's doing this,

351
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,822
she might be in as much
danger as we are.

352
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:19,334
Either that or the demon
is the one placing the visions.

353
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,227
You're getting
as paranoid as I am.

354
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:23,776
I like that.

355
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:25,745
Where are you going?

356
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,302
I've got to go see
a man about a grimoire.

357
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:44,862
It's not your fault.

358
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,586
Maurice trusted me.

359
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,678
I believed that if the objects
were separated, he'd be safe.

360
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,483
He knew the risks.
He thought they were safe.

361
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,540
I should know that
using magic's never safe.

362
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:58,546
I knew he wouldn't be able
to resist having an object

363
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,185
that was used
in an actual summoning.

364
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,225
I used his obsession.
- Look, we just have to get

365
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,304
the rest of them back.
Where's the book?

366
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,314
- Dr. Sagara has it.
- You gave that book

367
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,619
to one of your best friends?
- She thought some good

368
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,545
would come from studying it.
- Henry, we know

369
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,513
what that book does.
We don't need to study it.

370
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:15,412
You might as well have painted
a target on her back

371
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,400
and handed out bows and arrows.
- She's aware of the danger.

372
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:18,864
She won't have told
anyone she has it.

373
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,165
We don't even know how they
found Maurice, they might be

374
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,431
able to sense the objects.
We have to get it back from her.

375
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:24,760
Until we know
how they really find it,

376
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:26,972
I'm not going to endanger her.
- It may already know

377
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,872
she has it.
Not telling her is putting

378
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:30,683
her in jeopardy.
- Contacting her right now

379
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:32,250
could be leading them
right to her.

380
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:35,856
Once we know it's safe,
we'll get the grimoire.

381
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,618
Then you and I can have
an old-fashioned book burning.

382
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:42,964
It's going to be okay.

383
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,973
It'll be okay?

384
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,017
You said I was afraid to
give myself over to passion.

385
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:49,264
Do you really think that's true?

386
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,319
Well, there's passion
and then there's passion.

387
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:55,704
Like the passion of longing
for a lover's lips,

388
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:59,022
his delicate touch.
And then there's passion

389
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:02,305
for gun magazines
and shaking down suspects.

390
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,053
And you think I'm the latter.

391
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:06,716
It doesn't
matter what I think.

392
00:22:08,456 --> 00:22:09,984
Good to know.

393
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:30,580
I didn't expect you.

394
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,826
I have bad news.

395
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:36,175
Maurice Baloc is dead.

396
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,117
Oh, I'm sorry.

397
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:42,622
He was...
He was one of a kind.

398
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:46,058
He was, wasn't he?
I'm afraid I was

399
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:48,701
kind of responsible.
- What are you talking about?

400
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:49,987
I gave him something.

401
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:52,950
Something some very
dangerous people wanted.

402
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:56,275
- I see.
- I came for the book.

403
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:00,290
- It's safe with me.
- Nothing's safe.

404
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:05,761
I just don't want
you to get hurt, too.

405
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:10,557
- You've changed, you know?
- No, it's the same old me,

406
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,346
Henry Fitzroy, vampire at large.

407
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:18,295
Well, if you really want the
book, I'm happy to give it to you.

408
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,648
You're one of the few people
I know with the strength

409
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:22,397
not to be corrupted by it.

410
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:26,228
Unlike that poor deluded
young man you took it from.

411
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:29,371
Who knows?
Maybe he wasn't so deluded.

412
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:32,238
Anyone who thinks that
they got the best of a deal

413
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,501
with a demon is a fool.
- Sometimes you've got

414
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:36,729
to wonder who the real
fools are, don't you?

415
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,709
I'm sorry, I was
judging very harshly.

416
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:44,702
I remember Norman from classes.
He had great potential.

417
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,573
He could have done great things.

418
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:50,522
He shouldn't have been
treated like that.

419
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:55,569
How compassionate
of you, Henry.

420
00:23:57,673 --> 00:24:02,378
I think Vicki's good for you.

421
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:07,182
- She's a very special woman.
- Um-hum.

422
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,215
Don't assume she's
as strong as you think.

423
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,092
- Really?
- Even after I knew that

424
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:17,752
vampires and demons and magic
were real, there was

425
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:20,420
a part of me
that never believed it.

426
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:23,019
I had to force myself
to not be afraid.

427
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:25,526
But then I had to deal
with things like this

428
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,998
and then I understood.
There's nothing wrong

429
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,292
with being afraid.
It keeps us sane.

430
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,984
But you have to
embrace the fear.

431
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,615
Tell her that Henry.

432
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:42,219
Don't let her get away without
really letting her love you.

433
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:43,985
Like I did.

434
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,554
You and I were...

435
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,489
What we were is different.

436
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:53,218
Tell her.

437
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:55,033
I just might do that.

438
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:58,135
Thank you.

439
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,740
Thank you for the book.

440
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,115
Hey.

441
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:31,823
Where's Coreen?

442
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:35,192
She's running down leads on
that psychic, Camille Stokes.

443
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,462
None of that
will matter soon.

444
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,885
It's almost over.
I took your advice.

445
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,273
I visited Betty
and got the book.

446
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,519
You did?
Where is it?

447
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:46,349
It's back at my place.
We can destroy it together.

448
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:49,185
- Good.
- That's what you wanted,

449
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,084
isn't it?
'Cause it scares you.

450
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,561
I want that demon bastard
back in hell where he belongs.

451
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:57,413
You don't have to act
brave with me, Vicki.

452
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,140
We know each other
better than that.

453
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:04,474
I just want this to end.

454
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:09,870
The marks, the demons, all of
it, no matter what it takes.

455
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,236
It's not easy.

456
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,958
Maybe you have to accept
the marks.

457
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:18,130
I thought you hated them
even more than I do.

458
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:20,236
But they're part of you now.

459
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,860
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

460
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:29,467
It's what makes us sane. You have
to embrace what you're afraid of.

461
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:33,104
Yeah, maybe you're right.

462
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,962
I mean there are times when
I wonder if we're going

463
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,884
to survive the next
couple of hours.

464
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,417
And I realized that if I died,

465
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,342
there would be things I would
regret not having done.

466
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,667
I thought you wanted that.

467
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:04,152
Oh god, Vicki Nelson,
queen of bad timing.

468
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,545
- No, that was great timing.
- Don't patronize me.

469
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,553
I liked it.
Let's try it again.

470
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:10,527
- You're sure?
- Of course.

471
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:17,955
Aw...

472
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:20,966
Wow, maybe this
is a bad idea.

473
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:23,468
You know, we should probably
stay on point,

474
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,697
head back to your apartment,
get the book and the dagger

475
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:26,882
and destroy them.
I have a friend

476
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,650
who's a glassblower.
She's got a kiln.

477
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:32,227
- It's at my apartment.
- Henry, what is wrong with you?

478
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,876
- I've gotta go.
- Hey!

479
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:50,346
I can't kill you yet, so we're going
to have to do this again sometime.

480
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:56,053
Oh, by the way, you're a wicked
kisser and when I say wicked,

481
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,867
I mean totally sweet.

482
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,494
Vicki, what are
you doing here?

483
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,907
I've been thinking and
I have something to tell you.

484
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:18,350
- About the demon?
- About me.

485
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:20,590
What's this about, Vick?

486
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:24,949
About what you said,
that I'm afraid of passion.

487
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:27,309
I said too much.

488
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,663
Even if I didn't want
to believe it,

489
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:32,150
you've made it perfectly clear
what we are to each other.

490
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:35,647
Wow, you give up easy.

491
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,730
I was just...
I was afraid.

492
00:28:39,673 --> 00:28:41,010
I knew what I wanted.

493
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:45,395
It's just something was
stopping me from getting it.

494
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,332
Really.

495
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:51,990
Yeah, and I'm not going
to let that happen anymore.

496
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:04,415
Come on, Henry, pick up.

497
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:08,001
Come on, be there, be there.

498
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,269
Dammit.

499
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,069
Are you looking
for something?

500
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,588
No, just making
myself comfortable.

501
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:24,771
Well, I could make
you more comfortable.

502
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:30,945
Maybe we should save this
'til later.

503
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,787
You know, let's just get that
dagger and destroy it.

504
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,412
The dagger can wait.

505
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:39,173
We have more important business.

506
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,482
More important than someone
bringing a demon to earth?

507
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,986
I don't think so!

508
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,258
Just get it, all right?

509
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:52,458
Who are you?

510
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:56,672
ARGHHH...!
GRROOOWWW...!

511
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,286
We could have had such
a beautiful relationship.

512
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:13,690
- Uh, uh...
- No, no, don't get up.

513
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,835
I got it.

514
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,360
Oh, I like that. You're hesitating
'cause she looks like your girlfriend.

515
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,039
Now that's more like it.

516
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,815
Hey, baby...

517
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,952
You know if you give me that
back, I'll even let you live.

518
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,723
This can summon a demon, I
wonder if it can kill one, too.

519
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:53,939
Let's find out.

520
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:56,219
You wouldn't kill her.
You couldn't.

521
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,429
This isn't her body.
It's a lie.

522
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:01,946
Are you sure about that?
It feels pretty real to me.

523
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:03,944
I mean I would know.
I was just with her.

524
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:07,849
- What did you do to her?
- A gentleman never kisses and tells.

525
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,058
Oops, just did.

526
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:14,431
Whoever you are and whatever
you are, it's time to die.

527
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:17,696
HENRY!
OOF..!

528
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:23,037
You really shouldn't
have stolen my shape.

529
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:25,009
It's not like you're
having any fun with it.

530
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:45,191
Who are you?

531
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,158
You people forget so soon.

532
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:52,159
- Norman!
- Ding! Gold star!

533
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:54,791
Now who says blonds
are stupid, huh?

534
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:55,871
Not a real blond.

535
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,100
Henry!
Henry, are you okay?

536
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,511
I'll live.
You?

537
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:08,756
That depends.
Were you just at my

538
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,127
apartment kissing me?
- If I did, you'd rember.

539
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,464
Oh! Blech! Blaw!
I really need some mouthwash.

540
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:16,290
- You're bleeding.
- I'd hate to waste it.

541
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:23,722
Stop!
We've a demon to stop.

542
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:27,458
Well, at least he
didn't get the knife.

543
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:29,600
It's not over.
He knows where it is now.

544
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:32,208
He'll come back for it.
- Oh god, I have to warn Coreen.

545
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:39,627
Coreen, I was
hoping you'd be here.

546
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:41,203
Camille!
You're okay.

547
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:43,640
Vicki was worried about you.
- I'm fine.

548
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:45,681
Why wouldn't I be?
- It's just like you said,

549
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,688
the demon's back.
It's after Vicki and we thought

550
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:48,774
it might come after you, too.

551
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,787
Just a sec,
that might be her.

552
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,427
Yeah, it prably is.

553
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:01,391
Vicki Nelson investigations.
This is Coreen speaking.

554
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,697
How may I help you?
- What are you doing there?

555
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,276
Oh, just visiting
an old friend.

556
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,865
<i>She's going to come
back to my place.</i>

557
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,785
You want to join us?
- Vicki, don't come!

558
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,029
Don't you hurt her, Norman!

559
00:33:12,064 --> 00:33:15,449
You bring me that
dagger and she's all yours.

560
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,194
Vicki! I'm not fooling
around with you anymore, okay?

561
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:25,799
I need this. Oh, do I need
this, and so does Coreen.

562
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:28,591
Wear something nice.

563
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:36,631
Ohh... dammit!

564
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,219
This is the same
killer, isn't it?

565
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:43,521
I believe so. It's the same
pattern, same level of violence.

566
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,517
- Where did they find her?
- At a dumpster near

567
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:48,582
Bloor and Spadina.
She's been dead three,

568
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:50,700
four days.
- I don't suppose she has

569
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,783
a name, does she?
- Everyone has a name.

570
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:56,194
But fortunately for us
our friend had a record.

571
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:58,336
Consorting with
the devil, eh?

572
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:01,368
Detective, please,
not in front of the client.

573
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:06,078
Credit card fraud,
forgery, domestic violence.

574
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:07,686
Her jacket's several pages long.

575
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,504
Her name's Camille Stokes.

576
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,861
You knew her?
- Vicki did.

577
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,565
Have any idea where she lived?

578
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,536
On Lunnigan.

579
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:21,752
I think it was...
52 Lunnigan?

580
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:22,751
How did you know?

581
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,479
Just a sec.

582
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,161
<i>Mike, we found
the murder.</i>

583
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:33,322
It's Norman Bridewell.

584
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:35,500
<i>Since when does hell
have exit privileges?</i>

585
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:37,688
He wasn't dead
when he was taken so apparently

586
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:39,807
he didn't pass 'go'.
- All right, some of this

587
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:43,065
is starting to make sense.
Your psychic, Camille Stokes,

588
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,758
she lived in Bridewell's
building.

589
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,104
<i>What do you want to bet
he's still connected to that</i>

590
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,850
<i>pentagram in his
old apartment somehow?</i>

591
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,750
There's no such thing
as coincidences these days.

592
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:52,612
Mike, he's got Coreen.

593
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:54,775
All right, listen, Vicki,
I'm going to go in after her.

594
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,009
- Not alone.
- I can't exactly call

595
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:59,587
a SWAT team in on this one.
- This is my fight.

596
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:01,850
He wants me, and if he
doesn't get me,

597
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,856
he's going to kill Coreen.
I will meet you there.

598
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:07,351
No, Vicki! Vick?
Oh, dammit!

599
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,048
Why'd you ever get me and
let me know what's going on?

600
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,153
We're supposed to be
working on this together.

601
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,055
It's complicated.

602
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,691
But not so complicated that
you can't bring Vicki into it.

603
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:23,292
I can't pretend to understand
you relationship with her,

604
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:24,978
but I don't know why
you're cutting me out.

605
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:26,657
Kate, don't do this, okay?
I'm in a lose,

606
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,267
lose situation here.
- That's what I'm saying

607
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:33,257
to you, it doesn't have to be.
- I will fill you in as soon as I can.

608
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:38,553
Fine.
Play it on your own.

609
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:43,128
But understand that when it hits
the fan, you're the one wearing it.

610
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,008
Great.

611
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,674
Yup.
Yup.

612
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:08,498
Help!

613
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,677
It worked! I just learned that's already

614
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,475
"How to stop it,?..."

615
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,078
Pretty cool, uh?

616
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:21,040
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Yeah.

617
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,097
Pretty much.

618
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:24,976
But, uh...

619
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:26,622
That's all well that you and I,

620
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,548
isn't it?
- You don't have to do this.

621
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,664
This stuff that I did...

622
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:34,367
I can't go back, Coreen.

623
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:39,178
I get to play this out,
...all the way.

624
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:43,850
Besides, come on,
it all gone be over soon,

625
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,546
uh? Imagine, you and me

626
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:49,756
- This is the end of the world, or something?
- No.

627
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:53,193
Not for me, not for you either.

628
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:56,872
If you just play nice, Coreen,
ok? I like you, I like you a lot...

629
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:58,768
- You've killed people..
- There's billions more

630
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,602
where they come
from, trust me, ok?

631
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:03,136
Are you gonna kill me?

632
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:14,136
I don't know, dead sucks

633
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:18,134
but then again you would
make a wicked hot demon.

634
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,165
It's done.

635
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:34,006
- Do you really think this is gonna work?
- You have to have faith, Vicki.

636
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:53,819
Here we go again.

637
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,050
Is she's in there?
- I can smell it.

638
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,026
It's not?
who knows we are here.

639
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:09,936
Hi guys. You took your time.
I was going to start

640
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,842
without you.
- Yes. Empty try, Norman.

641
00:38:12,843 --> 00:38:16,737
You need the dagger and you need me.
- So, did you bring it?

642
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:19,536
You kept her out of the
party. Then let her go.

643
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:24,009
Dagger first, and I would like Vicki

644
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:26,767
to bring it to me.
- Take me instead.

645
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,117
No, you know that? what I need.
- Henry, give it to me.

646
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:34,794
Vicki, this may not work.

647
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:40,057
Vicki, no! Let her go Bridewell!

648
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:43,538
Well, who the hell are you? You think, uh

649
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:47,414
shooting me is gonna stop me?
- Might make me feel better.

650
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:56,821
Now excuse me, I have a little
ritual thing here to take care of

651
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:58,339
ok? We talk about this later.

652
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,373
Vicki would you just give it to me?
- Ok, Norman, we'll play in your way.

653
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,991
Do you want the
dagger? Here it is!

654
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:08,617
Nice throw! All right, here we go...

655
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:22,298
It's time Vicki. Go.
- Run Coreen, get out of here.

656
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:25,481
- Not without you!
- That's your spirit use that, (?)

657
00:39:25,516 --> 00:39:27,447
no more?, Vicki

658
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:38,966
Yes.
- Aahh!

659
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:53,310
- Aahh, what did you do?
- How the day your blood's part on priest on the way over?

660
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,350
I'm in trap!

661
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:08,855
- It's over, Norman.
- Not yet.

662
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:19,704
Do you think this is over?

663
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,566
You felt it, all the crazy things
you've been joint to use

664
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:27,673
it was you, Vicki!
And if you like or not

665
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:31,433
I've trust that they'll come knocking.
These marks,

666
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:33,984
you think that they're
a curse? they're a gift.

667
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,139
You just have to embrace them, Vicki.

668
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,699
and you can have
anything that you want,

669
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:40,929
even him.

670
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:00,900
God, I hate what that happens!

671
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:03,683
- Vicki...
- Yeah, wait...

672
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:06,592
Thank you, I didn't think that
anybody could stop him.

673
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:09,025
He was gonna kill me and take me with him.

674
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:11,426
There's still be stays down this time.

675
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:20,373
What do you gonna do with those?
- Same thing I should be done from the beginning

676
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:22,297
We can destroy them together.
- Good.

677
00:41:22,298 --> 00:41:25,485
Yeah. That's not all well, I got three unsolved
homicides that I gotta deal with.

678
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:30,449
- I think there's the bright side, it could been four, five, six.
- Yeah, I'll be sure to tell Crowley that.

679
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,215
Hey, how's your hand?
- Aah, it'll be all right.

680
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:37,329
All right. Hey, come on, Coreen,
let's give a close look at those cuts.

681
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:44,081
I'm concerning about Norman may
have done while he was acting as me.

682
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:47,811
Oh, not much, no, no
seemed in your way.

683
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:51,936
Really? 'Cause he said, you know,
you fell like he's just been with you.

684
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:57,319
- Ok, may he fooled me for like...a second.
- How far that that second take him?

685
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:01,844
Ah, come on, don't take the crazy
ideas, you know demons, they lie.

686
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:06,586
- Of course.
- Oh, he got you, too.

687
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,249
Vicki, maybe we just forget that
something that happened.

688
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:13,174
Absolutely.
