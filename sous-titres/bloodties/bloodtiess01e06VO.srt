1
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:04,920
Marcy shot in the low nineties that day.

2
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:08,047
Outplayed me by three stokes.
We were unbeatable.

3
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:13,367
Used to be we did everything together.

4
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:15,918
Now she's busy, I'm busy.

5
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:19,157
And you think she's getting busy
with somebody else.

6
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,087
That's one way of putting it.

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,866
Do you really want to find out
if your wife is cheating, Mr. Howsen,

8
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:27,281
- or do you want to stay married?
- Yes,

9
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,159
and yes.

10
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:30,642
What I'm saying is,

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,680
your money could be
better spent on counselling.

12
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:33,769
Or a hit man.

13
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:36,458
I'm kidding.

14
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:39,087
People get upset.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,197
They over-react a little and
suddenly they're divorced,

16
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,586
wondering how they got there.

17
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:45,155
Can you help me or not?

18
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:49,965
I can start first thing tomorrow,
but you should know

19
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:52,509
that some spouses find out
they've been investigated

20
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:54,134
and the marriages never recover.

21
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:57,638
I'm dying by slow degrees here,
Ms. Nelson.

22
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:59,966
If it's over, I want to know.

23
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:03,734
I'll call you tomorrow.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,959
Anything juicy?

25
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,353
Ectoplasm in his Beamer?

26
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:13,203
A poltergeist in his summer house?

27
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,542
He's wearing horns.

28
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:17,495
Adultery, again.

29
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:19,833
Where do people find the time?

30
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:27,172
You are so worth blowing off
that meeting for!

31
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:34,817
Are you free tomorrow?

32
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:41,408
Gary's working late
every night this week.

33
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:45,156
Last night
he didn't make it home 'til five.

34
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,748
Anyhow...

35
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:52,398
It's not all wine and roses, right?

36
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:28,884
All right, call me later.
Yeah.

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,869
What, did we have plans?

38
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:34,745
Well, that depends.
Did you get that raise?

39
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,426
Yeah, yeah, and I bought
this place with it, too.

40
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:40,773
Well, in that case I am free for dinner.

41
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,322
That's good to hear.

42
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:45,423
Let me just clean up this mess
and we'll be on our way, all right?

43
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:48,052
Well, this mess is why I'm here.

44
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,352
My client called.

45
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,535
She's dead.

46
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:06,496
I came upstairs

47
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:07,942
The bath was running.

48
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,770
I found Marcy.

49
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,502
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:20,528
It was him,

51
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,657
the guy...
Whoever she's been...

52
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,259
I want you to find out who did this.

53
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,102
That's why the police are here,
Mr. Howsen.

54
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,503
They know what they're doing.

55
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,578
I didn't come home last night,
Ms. Nelson.

56
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,009
I sacked out in my office.

57
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,163
I just came home this morning
to change my shirt.

58
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:41,559
But nobody saw me,

59
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,132
and I know how it looks to these guys.

60
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,188
Mr. Howsen?

61
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,747
Detective Graham.

62
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,376
Can we talk over here?

63
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,993
I need somebody on my side.

64
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,476
I didn't kill my wife.

65
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:56,551
I didn't!

66
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:14,638
- Suffocation or strangulation?
- His wife cheated on him and hired you?

67
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:16,657
Could be.

68
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,421
We should have gone to my bar.
I hate traing new bartenders.

69
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,256
Where have your hands been tonight?

70
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,481
Ask me again in a couple hours.

71
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,223
So what's eating you?

72
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,215
My client made a joke
about hiring a hit man,

73
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,159
and 24 hours later his wife is dead.

74
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:01,422
If he was going to have her killed,
why would he joke about it?

75
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:04,456
Maybe he's setting me up
as his alibi.

76
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,569
Are you always this paranoid?

77
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,982
Well, he doesn't have an alibi.

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,688
He also doesn't have a ghost,

79
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,054
or a monster, or a zombie.

80
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:16,777
This'll be great.

81
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:18,881
So you say,

82
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,713
but your eyes say something else.

83
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:22,957
Right.

84
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,009
Your eyes say
that plain old murder's boring.

85
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,851
They say that supernatural,
other-worldly, freaky,

86
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:32,217
turns you on.

87
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,552
It always has to come back to you,
doesn't it?

88
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,411
This could be your fate, Vicki.

89
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:39,852
Fate, right.

90
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:41,751
Like I'm fated to go blind.

91
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,751
Like I'm fated to bring hell to earth.

92
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,369
So is your client worried
about his upcoming experience with...

93
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:54,927
'justice'?

94
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:59,612
If that's supposed to be
a slag against cops,

95
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,307
I'd stop right there.

96
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,190
Well, it's not a slag against ex-cops,
which is what you are.

97
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,016
Are you trying to suggest
that Mike is good at his job?

98
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:09,932
Not just his job.

99
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:12,946
I'm sure.

100
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:15,885
Good night, Vicki.

101
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,685
Henry, come on.

102
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,402
Marcy was great, Ms. Nelson.

103
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,867
She wanted it all,
and she was getting it.

104
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,688
And then somebody
broke in and killed her

105
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:42,212
for no reason.

106
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:43,827
Broke in?

107
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,944
Well, it wouldn't have been anyone here.

108
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:48,430
Oh, it had to be a stranger.

109
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,913
All of our people are vetted.

110
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,575
See, Mr. Howsen thought
Marcy might have been seeing someone.

111
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,594
So maybe that's your stranger.

112
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:57,871
I don't think Marcy was fooling around.

113
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,448
No, Marcy loved Gary.

114
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,490
Oh yeah, right, and love has Ouch
a great track record.

115
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:04,396
She was very happy.

116
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:06,595
We all are.

117
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:09,534
Marcy had a meeting that day,

118
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:12,220
but she was home,
and the bed was a mess.

119
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,468
- How's that?
- She wasn't the best housekeeper.

120
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,216
Who knows what happens
inside a marriage?

121
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,349
Okay, just so you know,

122
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,077
avoiding my questions

123
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,277
isn't going to help
solve your friend's murder.

124
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,753
It was nobody here.

125
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,534
Who's that?

126
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,675
- My gardener.
- 'Your' gardener?

127
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:36,225
'Our' gardener.

128
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,427
Emmanuel.

129
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:38,854
He works for all of us.

130
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:42,264
Was he working last night?

131
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,776
In a way.
He was teaching us flower arranging.

132
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,405
He's very talented.

133
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,558
Crime Scene says the prints
are of the loving couple.

134
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,140
A few others came up,
checked out as cleaning staff.

135
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,745
Leave their prints behind?

136
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,510
What kind of cleaning is that?

137
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,897
Good help, Dave, hard to find.

138
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:04,850
What is that? A dig?

139
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:07,209
If you don't know, you prove my point.

140
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,004
- The friend of a friend delivered.
- Thanks.

141
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,084
You know what? I'm going
to leave you two lovebirds alone.

142
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,816
Oh, but, watch out,
he's still carrying that Vicki torch.

143
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,198
- Thanks for the tip, Cupid.
- Yeah, thanks, Dave.

144
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,799
- There was a message.
- Yeah?

145
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:26,501
Something like, "The next time
Celluci wants me to spend a day

146
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,027
in records investigating
a murder from 1932,

147
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:30,538
tell him he can go..."

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,015
Forget it. Later.

149
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,423
Hey, Kate!

150
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,358
Thanks.

151
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:25,364
Vicki Nelson, private investigator.

152
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,327
I have a few questions.

153
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,634
You want to know
where I was last night.

154
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,225
Well, that'd be a start.

155
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:35,967
I gave a class in flower arranging,

156
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,706
to Cheryl, Isabel, and Wendy.

157
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:42,176
Marcy not invited?

158
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:43,931
She didn't come.

159
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:45,884
Didn't she?

160
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,088
If only she had.

161
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,684
You two spent time together?

162
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:58,920
I took care of her... garden.

163
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:00,817
I bet you did.

164
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:08,594
"She shines like the rose-fingered moon

165
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:10,960
"rising after sundown,

166
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,239
"erasing all stars around her. "

167
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,165
Poetry's really not my thing.

168
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:21,893
"Her light spreads
on roses and tender thyme,

169
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:25,161
"and the blooming honey-lotus. "

170
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,979
You're sure you didn't see Marcy
last night?

171
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,120
Flower arranging lesson.

172
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,105
Would you like one?

173
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,450
No, thanks.

174
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,552
Cheryl?

175
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,183
Cheryl?

176
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,615
Hi, who're you?

177
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,512
Vicki Nelson, working for Gary.

178
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:04,281
- Oh... the PI.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:05,871
Nice to meet you.
I'm Bruce Caldwell,

180
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,147
Cheryl's husband.

181
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,192
Is she around somewhere?

182
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,870
I'm sure she's not far.

183
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,302
She's never where I think
she's going to be.

184
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,340
Come on inside.

185
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,304
Terrible about Marcy.

186
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,266
Do the police have any suspects?

187
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,595
Not as yet. How 'bout you?

188
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:26,238
You mean, do I suspect somebody?

189
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,108
No, not around here.

190
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,752
And they're sure it's murder?

191
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,657
Well, she didn't strangle herself.

192
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:33,460
How about that gardener?

193
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,366
Oh, I don't know the guy.
I don't know.

194
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,723
Don't the police usually
suspect the husband?

195
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,652
What, especially if he's jealous?

196
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,926
Well, I don't know if Gary was jealous.

197
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,297
I do.

198
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:46,285
- This is subtle.
- My mother's.

199
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:48,135
She was an anthropologist.

200
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:51,318
I used to be fascinated
with those things when I was a kid.

201
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,169
- No cable.
- Ah.

202
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,390
Where are they from?

203
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,089
All over.

204
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,737
I'm ashamed.
It's a significant collection and I...

205
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,596
don't remember much about them.

206
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,219
They're a little valuable.

207
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,219
A little creepy.

208
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:08,909
Oh, I don't think so.

209
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:11,859
My mother used to keep
them in individual cases,

210
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,028
but Cheryl thinks that's tacky,

211
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:15,840
too 'collector-y'.

212
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:20,011
The women were really women
back then, weren't they?

213
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,777
I always figured the artists
must have been teenage boys.

214
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:26,218
Yes, that would explain a lot.

215
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,778
Well, I'm going to take
another look around for my wife.

216
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,883
A gardener who quotes poetry.

217
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:46,967
You sound almost jealous.

218
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:48,919
How endearing.

219
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,529
Jealousy's a useless emotion.

220
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,299
"After 450 years,

221
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,172
"I don't waste my time
on futile feelings. "

222
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,463
- Don't knock experience.
- I never do.

223
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,916
And experience is telling me

224
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,915
that there is something between
those women and that gardener.

225
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:07,010
I mean, their alibi is too neat.

226
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:08,597
Why wasn't Marcy invited?

227
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,842
I'll go over tomorrow,
sniff around some more.

228
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,428
Anywhere in particular?

229
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:15,320
You're kind of twisted.

230
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,683
Has anyone ever told you that?

231
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:18,674
Maybe I'll come.

232
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:20,862
He sounds irresistible.

233
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:23,857
So he's handsome.

234
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,172
There's no crime in noticing.

235
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,968
You don't sound like a cop

236
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,630
talking about a suspect.

237
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:33,076
I'm trained to notice details.

238
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,447
So am I.

239
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,979
Like your heart beating faster.

240
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,374
Too much caffeine.

241
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,704
If you need to relax,
I could quote you some poetry.

242
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:48,864
You could try.

243
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,080
Apparently it works.

244
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,489
If you want to know what works?

245
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:59,118
You could get the garbage
on your way out.

246
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,440
Hi.

247
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:11,834
Are you okay?

248
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,596
You weren't just, uh...
over at my place.

249
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:18,091
You know, somehow, like...

250
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:20,591
in bed with me,
running your hands all over my body?

251
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,375
- That kind of thing?
- That depends,

252
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,436
- were you enjoying it?
- Henry...?

253
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,754
Are you sure?

254
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,003
I think I'd remember it.

255
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,036
Okay.

256
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:34,728
Okay, good.

257
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,029
Well that's a load off. Whew!

258
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,482
Disappointed?

259
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,447
No, no, relieved.

260
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,259
You don't look relieved.

261
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:45,104
Oh no, this um...
this is my relief face.

262
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,153
Because finding me in your bed

263
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,698
running my hands all over
your body would be...

264
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,533
horrible.

265
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,453
Unless you were invited.

266
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,387
I'm all ears.

267
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,745
Obviously, here's the catch.

268
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:03,198
You're a vampire,
I'm a half-blind private investigator.

269
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:05,511
These stories always end up tragic.

270
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,013
We could beat the odds.

271
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,753
I'm not much of a gambler.

272
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:14,439
'Night, Hank.

273
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:20,545
We could cuddle after.

274
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,922
What about the gardener?
You check him out?

275
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,645
Not as much as you did, I bet.

276
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,792
Come on, Mike. You know,
Coreen ran a dozen databases...

277
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,351
came up with nothing on this guy.

278
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,562
Yeah, we figure Zorro's
an illegal immigrant.

279
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,112
We're gonna sit with it.
He'll get nervous,

280
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,772
make a mistake,
then we'll bring him in.

281
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,312
What about his alibi?

282
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,058
Oh, you mean his harem?

283
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,965
You mean the harem that just

284
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:55,425
figured out they're a harem?
Yeah, that's the one.

285
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,858
Yeah, they're remarkably consistent.

286
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,290
So, any other suspects?

287
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,860
Come on, Vick.

288
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:07,607
You know we like Gary for this,

289
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,386
but I'm not going
to talk to you about it.

290
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,766
Okay, how about we don't talk
about it over dinner?

291
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,898
No work talk. I swear.

292
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,866
This so-called dinner,
just the two of us?

293
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,969
Is there somebody
you want me to bring?

294
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:24,712
Is Henry working this with you?

295
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,135
He is.

296
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:30,186
And you're killing the moment,
in case you were wondering.

297
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,238
Well, you know,

298
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,614
I wouldn't want to kill
the moment but...

299
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,294
come on, Vick,
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

300
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm going to try
and remember that this is coming

301
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,806
out of concern for me,

302
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,887
not out of some kind
of caveman complex.

303
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,676
Why can't it be both?

304
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,414
Emmanuel?

305
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:41,732
Hot?

306
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,064
A little.

307
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:50,651
I'd say a lot.

308
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,533
So...

309
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,605
Isabel, Marcy.

310
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,788
Just how many lawns
are you trimming around here?

311
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,849
Oh... you have such great energy, Vicki.

312
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,161
You must have many lovers.

313
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:07,283
I saw you with Isabel.

314
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,583
And Gary saw you with Marcy.

315
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,035
The police are watching you.

316
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,834
I didn't do anything

317
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,237
that people didn't want me to do.

318
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,376
I cared for Marcy.

319
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,076
I didn't hurt her.

320
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,292
- Who did?
- I don't know.

321
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,383
Listen, I think you do.

322
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,190
Cheryl.

323
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,094
I finished at work early.

324
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,779
And I wanted to talk to you
about the fall plantings.

325
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,732
Any luck with Marcy's murder?

326
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:46,095
Shouldn't you be at work?

327
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,597
Shouldn't you?

328
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,994
Isabel has brochures

329
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:52,013
about the new irrigation system.

330
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,125
Excuse me.

331
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,719
Emmanuel was just giving me
a little shoka primer.

332
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,815
He said the flower you started with
is in this garden?

333
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,824
Which one is it?

334
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:12,111
- That one.
- The pink one.

335
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,502
My mistake, the pink one.

336
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:18,864
Thanks.

337
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,181
These women are lying
about the night of Marcy's murder,

338
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,930
so we're going to unleash

339
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,178
Henry's mojo on them.

340
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:37,178
I don't have mojo.

341
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:38,802
I have charm.

342
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:41,441
- Charisma, if you will.
- I would.

343
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:45,135
Well, whatever it is, you're taking it
to the Golf and Country Club tonight.

344
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,772
- A golf club?
- I know, I know,

345
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:50,037
but sometimes you gotta go
where the case takes you.

346
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:52,401
Meanwhile, we're going to go
back to Richie Rich Estates.

347
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,306
I want to search
the gardener's cottage.

348
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,590
I want to search the gardener.

349
00:20:58,364 --> 00:20:59,613
He's our suspect.

350
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,374
Delicious until proven guilty.

351
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:13,557
So, you okay with this?

352
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,461
I've talked to women before.

353
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,869
Yeah, but not as a PI.

354
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:19,029
Yet I usually get what I want.

355
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:23,256
You've not going to,
you know, bite them, are you?

356
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,787
Are you going to tell me I can't?

357
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:27,697
Good.

358
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,477
It's just that
it's not exactly protocol.

359
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,450
You are going to tell me I can't.

360
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:34,334
Well, it's an investigation,

361
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:36,591
not a picnic.

362
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:40,104
Is this really about something
I might do,

363
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,653
or something I didn't?

364
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:45,146
The other night, when I didn't stay.

365
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,836
Then you showed up at my place...

366
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,337
Oh no, no.
This is completely different.

367
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,256
Completely.

368
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:55,472
- If you say so.
- Yeah.

369
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:58,113
I've got to change.

370
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,324
- Call me later.
- You got it.

371
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,643
I'm not going to.

372
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:06,413
- Bite them?
- Bite them.

373
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,883
Tell me about
your flower-arranging class.

374
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,597
What really happened that night?

375
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:49,749
We were practising shoka.

376
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:51,993
It's a Japanese style.

377
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,698
- Sounds exotic.
- Yeah.

378
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:57,976
And was Emmanuel there with you?

379
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,206
Emmanuel...

380
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:03,122
was in the living room.

381
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:04,588
We all were.

382
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:08,419
To think that shoka
could have saved her life.

383
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,630
Except that Emmanuel wasn't there.

384
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,311
Emmanuel was there.

385
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,297
He's the shoka expert.

386
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,749
Oh God, Mike Weir did come.
Excuse me.

387
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,594
I think you like living life
on the edge.

388
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:27,798
Other people think they understand you,
but they don't, do they?

389
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,107
Nobody does.

390
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:31,013
Like my neck.

391
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:33,445
I've always got this pain right here.

392
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,112
And I never talk about it.

393
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,060
Oh, excuse me.

394
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,201
Just keep that filthy mind of yours

395
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,845
on the case and Emanuel.

396
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:55,471
All I'm saying is, two great guys

397
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,424
and every night
you're going home alone.

398
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:59,007
Look, I'm just...

399
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:01,668
too busy for the messy
relationship stuff right now.

400
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:03,322
Too busy for the messy...?

401
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,915
'Cause the working women
here sure aren't.

402
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:08,741
I appreciate your concern, Coreen,

403
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,966
but I'd appreciate
you shutting up more.

404
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:18,004
Well, you know,
there was this 'thing' the other night.

405
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,901
Who, Henry or Mike?

406
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:21,431
Neither.

407
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:24,591
I mean, really it was just
this weird dream.

408
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:26,620
I mean it was like
someone was in bed with me,

409
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,005
running their hands all over my body.

410
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:30,620
No face?

411
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,660
Just an impression.

412
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:34,482
You know, like the...

413
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:37,806
like the weight
of a body pressing down on me.

414
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:40,909
- And then what?
- It felt really real, though.

415
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:42,171
Really real?

416
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:44,098
Real.

417
00:24:44,204 --> 00:24:45,975
You know, Vicki,
it sounds like an incubus.

418
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,450
- A what?
- Incubus,

419
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:48,840
a sex demon.

420
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:52,192
Sort of a virtual vibrator
for the Medieval set.

421
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:54,774
Nah, I think it was just a dream.

422
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:57,973
Call the police!

423
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,246
What happened? Is she all right?

424
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:37,239
- Are they on their way?
- On their way.

425
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:38,926
Oh God.

426
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,524
Isabel!

427
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,525
Bloody hell.

428
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,629
Henry!

429
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:16,140
Please, some respect for the game.

430
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:18,402
- Vicki fought a demon!
- What?

431
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:20,130
Something attacked Isabel

432
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:22,094
and Vicki tried to kill it,
and it knocked her

433
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,582
across the room,
and it has glowing red eyes,

434
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,469
and we think it might be Emmanuel
and...

435
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:29,026
You golf?

436
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,796
My father killed the Scottish king.
Yes, I golf.

437
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,918
"Demons attack night."

438
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:38,603
It's kind of a large search term.

439
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,838
It looked like it was sucking
the breath out of her.

440
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,673
- Incubus do that.
- Yes!

441
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:45,265
Vicki had a visit the other night,
you know.

442
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,788
Lucky.

443
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,514
"The other night,"
when you came over.

444
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:51,701
The hands all over you.
The hands you hoped were mine.

445
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,135
Feared.

446
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:57,660
Incubus, from the Latin 'incubo',
meaning burden or weight.

447
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,545
Do I need to explain that part to you?

448
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:01,926
No, no, it's okay.
I, uh... remember.

449
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,252
Check this out.

450
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,083
"The incubus could be a nasty lover,

451
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,951
"with a sexual organ
that was freezing cold,

452
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,749
"double-pronged
or painfully large."

453
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,835
Do those two words
really belong together?

454
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:13,805
And you think I should
take up with the 'messy'.

455
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,225
An incubus has the power

456
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:17,253
to put everyone in the house
into a deep sleep.

457
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:19,042
Once she succumbs,

458
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,177
the woman is dragged
into hell for eternity.

459
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,766
The Country Club!

460
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:24,710
That's how they resisted me.

461
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,376
They were under the influence
of the incubus.

462
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,188
I thought you were irresistible.

463
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,325
You resist him.

464
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,081
The incubus got there first.

465
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,801
Some excuse.

466
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:35,576
Look,

467
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,715
it looks like one of the idols
at Cheryl's house.

468
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:39,229
She has an incubus idol?

469
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,342
Sort of. They're the husband's.

470
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:51,657
It doesn't make sense.

471
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,216
Idols are used to worship.

472
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:55,638
Yes, but they're also used
to summon demons.

473
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:57,033
Like the creep who did this to me.

474
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:58,852
So someone summoned an incubus

475
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:00,317
and it killed Marcy and Isabel?

476
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,950
You're asking
the wrong gal about that,

477
00:28:01,988 --> 00:28:04,922
but find out more about these idols,
and get me a meet with Cheryl.

478
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,995
And I want to know how many
more of your friends have to die

479
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:16,734
before you tell me
about you and Emmanuel.

480
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:19,427
- You don't have to yell.
- Well, apparently I do.

481
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,885
We have this 'networking group'.

482
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:28,030
It's a way for us
to get together on expense.

483
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,054
We usually don't end up
talking much business.

484
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:32,997
Just complain about our husbands
not giving us attention.

485
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:36,225
I swear to gawd,
every time I'm feeling frisky

486
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:38,979
he's just laying
there like a log, sleeping.

487
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,101
At least you're getting wood.

488
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:45,568
"Oh Gary, give me a little loving."

489
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,940
"I am too busy
or that right now, baby."

490
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,797
"Oh, come on, Gary,
I'll pay for the golf vacation

491
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,316
"you always wanted if you'll just..."

492
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:56,059
"Marcy, Marcy,
these things are worth money."

493
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,361
...Yeah, yeah, he could solve
more than my problems.

494
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:06,883
Oh, look at him. Wouldn't it be great
if he was like a genie in the bottle?

495
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,100
And all we had to do is rub him,

496
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:11,810
- God willing! I'm willing!
- and make a wish?

497
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,329
And Emmanuel showed up the next day?

498
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:20,527
Not exactly.

499
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,785
We all started having
these weird dreams.

500
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:25,888
Like someone was in bed with us.

501
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:28,548
Someone you wanted to be in bed with.

502
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,491
And then,

503
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,679
I figured Marcy had hired him.

504
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,523
Turns out Marcy figured
Isabel had hired him and so on.

505
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:41,898
He needed a place.

506
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,935
I had the guest cottage on my property,

507
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:46,156
so...

508
00:29:47,623 --> 00:29:48,956
And the dreams?

509
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,322
We're all pretty career-driven.

510
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:56,470
You have your own business,
you must understand that.

511
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,587
You focus fully on one thing,

512
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:01,146
other things disappear...

513
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:04,564
cooking at home, lazy Sundays,

514
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:05,888
sex.

515
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,066
There's not much time.

516
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:11,083
Not much will, either.

517
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:15,638
So you traded in the dreams for reality.

518
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,244
There was no shoka class.

519
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,009
I was with Emmanuel
the night Marcy was killed.

520
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:28,262
I asked the girls to cover for me.

521
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,855
And that was when we discovered

522
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,413
we were all using the same gardener.

523
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,563
Well, wasn't your husband ever home?

524
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:36,413
Bruce...

525
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,352
Bruce could sleep
through an earthquake.

526
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:45,879
And the night Isabel was killed?

527
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,452
I asked.

528
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,198
None of us were with him.

529
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:55,022
All right, shoot.

530
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,999
Okay... I know you hate
this stuff, but...

531
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:01,391
Emmanuel might be an incubus.

532
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,860
It's a special interest group?

533
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:05,874
No, it's a type of sex demon.

534
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,817
No, Vicki, I know what it is!

535
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:10,544
I read! I watch TV! I know
all about these things, all right?

536
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:11,563
They're just...

537
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:14,117
fiction, myths, stories.

538
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,319
Like Henry.

539
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:16,915
Hey, speaking of which, where is he?

540
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:19,966
Attacking women in bed sounds like
more his kind of thing, don't you think?

541
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:22,081
No. Don't mistake this
for something it's not.

542
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,212
You mean don't mistake
an incubus for a vampire?

543
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:27,292
I can't believe I just said that.

544
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:30,130
All I'm saying is that
if you find Emmanuel just...

545
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,383
be careful, that's all.

546
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:33,008
We'll find him all right
and when we do

547
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,346
we'll put him away for life.

548
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,088
Yeah, but how do you lock up
an incubus anyway?

549
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,224
Well, you're the expert,
why don't you tell me.

550
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:43,696
I'll get back to you on that.

551
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,677
Vicki, what are you scheming?

552
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,762
Nothing.

553
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,175
I'll be in touch.

554
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:58,039
Doctor Sagara says
there's no definitive method

555
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:59,212
to trapping an incubus.

556
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:03,203
Hm, apparently all you have to do
is cry the unhappy marriage blues

557
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,353
in your million dollar McMansion,
and he just...

558
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:06,489
shows up.

559
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:08,685
That's calling him.
We want to trap him.

560
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:10,170
Excuse me. Sagara thinks

561
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,512
the idol might help bring him in.

562
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,842
And we'll need a ritual circle
to hold him,

563
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:16,377
spruce for manifestation,
civit for lust...

564
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:17,982
and the right bait.

565
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,202
I'd volunteer but,

566
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:22,326
the bait has to be sexually frustrated.

567
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:26,843
What?

568
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,702
I'm not sexually frustrated.

569
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,876
And when he ended up
here the other night, what?

570
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,294
He took the wrong exit?

571
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:41,416
We haven't seen him since Isabel...

572
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,008
Yeah, I can't imagine why.

573
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:46,646
The murders are so at odds
with the way he is.

574
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,087
Was. Is.

575
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:49,993
What the hell are you doing?

576
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,749
Bruce, Vicki's going to borrow it.

577
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,054
These belonged to my mother!

578
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,679
You don't just give them away.

579
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:55,876
I wasn't.

580
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:57,632
Show some respect for once.

581
00:32:57,658 --> 00:32:59,076
They're not for you
or for anyone.

582
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,146
Understand?

583
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:01,989
I'm sorry. I should have asked.

584
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,103
Sorry.

585
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,108
I paid off the mortgage
when I got my promotion.

586
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:11,337
I think it's been hard on him.

587
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:17,692
Well, if this doesn't work,

588
00:33:17,702 --> 00:33:19,176
at least it smells nice.

589
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:21,050
So now what? I just...

590
00:33:21,786 --> 00:33:22,791
wait?

591
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:24,904
I know this will be hard for you,
but try to be

592
00:33:24,913 --> 00:33:26,500
in an open, receptive mood.

593
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:30,356
Okay, open and receptive

594
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,516
to a demon coming to kill me.

595
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:34,104
Sure.

596
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,118
Open yet?

597
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,469
So, this is your trap?

598
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,531
- Henry was out of line.
- Sorry.

599
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:45,550
How'd you get in?

600
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:47,805
Hey, you were supposed
to give those back!

601
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:49,148
Sorry.

602
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,129
What are you doing here, anyways?

603
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:54,237
Well, I figured you could use
a little professional help.

604
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,686
- She's already got it.
- No, I said professional help.

605
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,449
Not bloodsucking
bastard son-of-the-king help.

606
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:01,524
I looked it up.

607
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:03,778
Fitz. Roy.

608
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,648
He reads.

609
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:08,822
Yeah, you two are
going to be a big help.

610
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:57,579
Okay, so we called
an incubus, now what?

611
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,593
I must say, Vicki,
I'm disappointed in you.

612
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,230
You should try it from my side.

613
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,438
Would you give me your hand,
please?

614
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,316
No, I don't think so.

615
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:16,212
Look, we know what you are, Demon.

616
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,691
Why would you kill Marcy and Isabel?

617
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:22,675
It wasn't me.

618
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,445
I care for these women,

619
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:28,881
and it makes no sense
for me to harm them.

620
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:32,132
I have food, shelter,

621
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:34,310
good sex.

622
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:36,404
- And look at him!
- Thank you, bella.

623
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,809
So you just get pulled through

624
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:41,673
to this side and decide
to take on physical form?

625
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:42,992
Pretty much.

626
00:35:43,114 --> 00:35:46,307
But why?
What is so great about this world?

627
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:49,218
These women...

628
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,321
so tough by day.

629
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:53,349
At night, with me...

630
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,612
they were vulnerable.

631
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,870
They responded to me, need me.

632
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,787
I could feel that.

633
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,656
I can feel that within you too, Vicki.

634
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,029
A longing.

635
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:10,780
I have no longing.

636
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,062
There is no longing.

637
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,815
OK, actually I've been
thinking about getting a dog.

638
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,007
You don't have to explain.

639
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,246
- No, explain!
- No, explain!

640
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:27,227
The women!

641
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:31,135
Look, I made a difference

642
00:36:31,144 --> 00:36:32,900
in their sleeping lives.

643
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,539
I wanted to make
a difference in their days.

644
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:41,071
He's lying. He's a demon.
It's like breathing to them.

645
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,681
- Yeah, unlike vampires.
- Focus.

646
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:46,707
All right, Cheryl's confession has

647
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:49,336
him outside of Marcy's house
at the time of the murder.

648
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:51,232
Okay, well, say he didn't do it,

649
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:53,403
there were a dozen other
idols in that house

650
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,163
- maybe we're looking the wrong one.
- I may be able to help there.

651
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,515
You said to find out
what I could, so...

652
00:37:00,062 --> 00:37:01,499
A doll did it.

653
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,444
Did you miss the part
where the demon showed up?

654
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,932
Did you miss the part
where you started talking about dolls?

655
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:08,740
- Idols.
- They're the same rules...

656
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,382
they don't apply any more, Mike.

657
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:11,773
Yeah, I get that, Vick.

658
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,362
Tiny little killers, huh?

659
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:16,390
That's not such a stretch, now is it?

660
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,582
Tell me detective,

661
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:19,831
- you sleep with your windows open?
- I repeat,

662
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:20,878
focus!

663
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,526
So then, who's our hooded killer?

664
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,054
Maybe her. She's one of the Furies,

665
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,440
- the Angry Ones.
- Relative of yours?

666
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,608
- Stop it!
- From Greek mythology.

667
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:31,755
Sagara says

668
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:33,821
it's probably the oldest piece
in the collection.

669
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,419
This one seems to be Megaera.

670
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:37,090
She attacks whoever you're jealous of.

671
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:38,649
Well, Gary was jealous of his wife,

672
00:37:38,677 --> 00:37:39,973
I mean, admittedly so.

673
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,654
Was Isabel's husband jealous of her?

674
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:42,809
Oh, not so much.

675
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,695
All the women
were jealous of each another.

676
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:46,592
Isabel was the focus of that.

677
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,381
She's spending
the most time with Emmanuel.

678
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,023
Yeah, but there's no pattern here.

679
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,084
Listen to this.

680
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,164
In the myths, Megaera responds

681
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,713
to the strongest feeling of jealousy,

682
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:57,037
not necessarily to the person
who summoned her.

683
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:00,172
So either they're passing
around this idol...

684
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,378
Or someone hasn't learned
how to use it properly yet.

685
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:04,988
I think I know who.

686
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,308
Come on, demon, we're taking a ride.

687
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:21,019
I know you can feel it.

688
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:24,608
Eating me up inside.

689
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:28,383
She ruined everything.

690
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:31,885
Ridiculed me.

691
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:35,594
Feel it!

692
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:46,193
You're a child, Cellucci,
cutting me off at the light.

693
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:48,226
You've been driving for what, 90 years

694
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,211
and you still choke at a yellow?
It's pathetic.

695
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:52,723
Okay boys, we have a murder to stop.

696
00:38:58,447 --> 00:38:59,644
Get her.

697
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,469
- Hey, stay here.
- Excuse me.

698
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,405
All right! That's it!

699
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,766
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

700
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,860
If you can't control yourself,
somebody else will.

701
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:21,374
Get a grip!

702
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:28,465
Where are you going?

703
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:30,503
She's in there!

704
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,352
Get back here!

705
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:34,860
I'm in control here!

706
00:39:35,836 --> 00:39:37,218
Henry, cut it out!

707
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:03,765
Not them! I'm the angry one!

708
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,497
She's a jealousy demon, you idiot!

709
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:09,602
Sorry love, already dead.

710
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:20,981
Don't make me hurt you!

711
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:22,413
- Give it to me!
- No!

712
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,784
Give it to me!

713
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:25,577
What the hell is going on in here?

714
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,033
Get back!

715
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:52,839
Glad I'm not the one writing the report.

716
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:56,650
Murder by jealousy demon
in the second degree.

717
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,522
It practically writes itself,
doesn't it?

718
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,770
Trepidations adds a certain vibrancy
to any encounter,

719
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:04,495
but I prefer curiosity,
willingness, passion.

720
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:07,446
A constant diet of coercion gets tired
after a couple hundred years.

721
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:11,102
Exactly, and it's amazing how women
have changed over this past century.

722
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,881
The art of romance
is lost on women today.

723
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,326
- I know...
- So what about him?

724
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,877
Henry's free to do what he wants.

725
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:22,065
No, the other freak.

726
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,408
Is he sticking around or what?

727
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,327
He hasn't broken any laws.

728
00:41:25,663 --> 00:41:27,532
No, just a couple of hearts, right?

729
00:41:27,748 --> 00:41:30,208
Oh, I think he can cure them.

730
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,952
I was talking about the husbands.

731
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:35,491
I knew that.

732
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:37,819
Still,

733
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:40,176
freak factor aside, it does just

734
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:41,960
come down to human emotions,
doesn't it?

735
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:43,209
And jealousy.

736
00:41:44,187 --> 00:41:46,201
Seemed to be a lot of
that flying around tonight.

737
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:49,239
Vicki, I'm not jealous of Henry.

738
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,398
I'm just worried about you.

739
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:55,513
Well, you know I always work
better with a partner.

740
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,344
Maybe.

741
00:41:57,917 --> 00:41:59,632
There's a lot about Henry
you don't know.

742
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:00,940
And you do?

743
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,201
Look,

744
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:07,463
I know that every time I've needed him
in my corner he's been there.

745
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:10,834
Reminds me a lot of somebody else
I used to work with.

746
00:42:12,493 --> 00:42:13,779
Just trust me on this.

747
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:15,732
I do trust you.
