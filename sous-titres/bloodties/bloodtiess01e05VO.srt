1
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:16,339
Hey, Mike.

2
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:18,058
Glad to see you alive.

3
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:19,999
I was going to have
to send out a search party.

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,840
I got your messages.
I've been busy.

5
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,930
Well, look who over-ordered, as usual.

6
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:26,033
Gotta help me here.

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,593
I'm not here for Chinese.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,549
This is serious.

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,567
I've never seen you
turn down free Chinese.

10
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,142
You should have told me
Fitzroy was a vampire.

11
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:36,762
Yeah, because you've been
so open to that kind of thing before.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,283
So what do you want me to do?

13
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,945
Rally the villager? Light a few torches?
Drive a stake through his heart?

14
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:41,953
Yeah, maybe.

15
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,900
You're kind of forgetting that
he saved my life, so he can't actually

16
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:45,944
be a threat to me.

17
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,914
Okay, so you do admit, though,
that he is a danger to other people.

18
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,553
Don't twist my words.

19
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:53,407
Last time I was at the multiplex,
these were the bad guys.

20
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,520
Do you believe everything
you see at the movies?

21
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,435
Look, he's helping me.

22
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,003
Helping you with what?

23
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,576
Catching zombies and werewolves,
that kind of thing?

24
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:04,952
Mike, I know this seems unbelievable,

25
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,920
but is it any stranger than
any of the guys that we put away?

26
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,502
How about that guy
who stuffed his victims

27
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,126
and used them as marionettes?

28
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,766
Does it get any weirder than that?

29
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,426
Comparatively,
Henry's a frigging lightweight.

30
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:19,834
How much did you order?

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,043
Far, far too much.

32
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,631
You got any Kung Pao in there?

33
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,002
I think I...

34
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:34,469
lost my appetite.

35
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,750
Hey, hon, lost track of time.
I'm leaving right away,

36
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:11,610
- 5, 10 minutes max...
- <i>Stamp...</i>

37
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:13,865
- O'Connor?
- <i>You failed me.</i>

38
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:15,507
How'd you get to a phone
this late at night?

39
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,255
<i>You're a dead man.</i>

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,663
Look me up
when you get out of prison.

41
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:21,230
- I'll buy you lunch.
- <i>You hear me?</i>

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,541
Leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

43
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,640
<i>You...</i>

44
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,102
<i>hear me,</i>

45
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,111
<i>Stamp?</i>

46
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:38,360
<i>You're dead.</i>

47
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,623
<i>You're all dead.</i>

48
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,200
<i>Stamp...</i>

49
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:37,568
When Freddy
wasn't home by midnight,

50
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:39,602
I knew something was wrong.

51
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:41,734
A janitor found him
in the elevator.

52
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,326
They're saying
it was a heart attack.

53
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,650
But, you believe otherwise?

54
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:51,745
I'm sorry,

55
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,322
it's just...

56
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,681
It's okay.
Just take your time.

57
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,635
It was Magnus O'Connor.

58
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,316
Magnus O'Connor.

59
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,919
He's a former client of Freddy's.

60
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:13,528
Yes, defense attorneys
are bound to make a few enemies,

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,704
but why do you think
Magnus O'Connor is involved?

62
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:18,464
This is from his cell phone voice mail.

63
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,686
Stamp..

64
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,550
<i>You failed me.</i>

65
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,287
<i>You're a dead man.</i>

66
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,768
<i>You hear me?</i>

67
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,031
<i>You're dead.</i>

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,082
<i>You're all dead.</i>

69
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,075
What did O'Connor
have against your husband?

70
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:44,633
All I know is that Freddy loved to win.

71
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,525
But when he lost that case,

72
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:48,297
he seemed relieved.

73
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,816
Whatever you want is going
to cost more than doughnuts.

74
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,255
You can't hide ulterior motive
behind a box of doughnuts.

75
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,790
Plus, I would make sure
that we were totally square

76
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,424
before I asked for any favors,

77
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:26,598
you know, like everything
you have on Magnus O'Connor.

78
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,471
And what is so important
about Magnus O'Connor?

79
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,875
Remember Fred Stamp,
the defense attorney?

80
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,110
Found dead in an elevator.

81
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,374
And it couldn't have happened
to a nicer bottom feeder.

82
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,001
Coroner's report said natural causes.

83
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:40,786
Well, Mrs. Stamp thinks that
O'Connor wanted her husband dead.

84
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:42,956
Oh, all right.

85
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:45,887
O'Connor,

86
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:47,831
Magnus.

87
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:49,643
Oh, he's a sweetheart.

88
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,765
Solid jacket of assaults
from his teens on.

89
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,648
Suspect in six hits with
the Irish mobs in Montreal and,

90
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:55,830
a couple of the bike clubs.

91
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,624
- Any affiliations?
- No,

92
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,089
pure freelancer.

93
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,446
Seems like
hurting people was a vocation.

94
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:04,376
Ten years ago,
he got nailed on a traffic violation

95
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,456
with a severed head
on the passenger seat of his car.

96
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:09,202
Nobody likes riding alone.

97
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,270
They gave him dangerous offender status,

98
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,035
no chance of parole.

99
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,852
His first night in Millhaven,
he kills his cellmate.

100
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:17,157
Did he try to turn him out?

101
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,167
No, I think he just
wanted his own room.

102
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:20,894
Well, what about prison?

103
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,980
Any gangs, any other affiliations?

104
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,534
No, total loner. Only one visitor,

105
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,905
every week.

106
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:28,060
Mom.

107
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,066
He's not your guy.

108
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,803
Why not?

109
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,190
Killed himself a week ago.

110
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:52,567
Henry?

111
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:02,925
Work not going well?

112
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,636
Is this really necessary?

113
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:10,101
If you want to talk you have to pose.

114
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:14,243
Okay, Fred Stamp
is a defense attorney, right?

115
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:15,868
He's found dead in his elevator.

116
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,999
Coroner says cardiac arrest,

117
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:21,015
but his wife finds a threatening
voice mail on his phone

118
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,757
from psycho freak ex-client,
Magnus O'Connor.

119
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:29,130
This works a little better
if we bounce ideas off of each other.

120
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,707
Okay. Why?

121
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,028
Because we want to consider
every possibility,

122
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,273
you know, you don't want to commit
to any one theory too soon.

123
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,075
What if the first theory
is the correct one?

124
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,795
This is the way we do it, okay?

125
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,738
You said you wanted to learn
how to work cases?

126
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,297
This is how we work cases.

127
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:43,959
Fair enough, I'm listening.

128
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,359
Mrs. Stamp thinks that
Magnus O'Connor is the prime suspect,

129
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:50,265
but there's a little problem
with that one,

130
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,899
the guy committed suicide a week ago.

131
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,073
He hired somebody.

132
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,295
That was easy.

133
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:57,863
Why go to all the trouble
to have someone killed

134
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,444
when you're planning to commit suicide?

135
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,431
Maybe this is just a coincidence.

136
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:02,870
Or maybe,

137
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:06,118
O'Connor sought revenge
from beyond the grave.

138
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:09,874
Oh yeah, that is great.
That is just what I need.

139
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,148
I thought you wanted
to consider every possibility.

140
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:14,843
Are you done?

141
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,068
Just about.

142
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,865
Yeah, it's just you forgot the...

143
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:27,363
cheesy job, bad eyesight
and demon tattoos.

144
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:30,811
Well, that's how I see you.

145
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,210
Great. Vicki Nelson,

146
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,928
warrior princess.

147
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:57,133
The salon is closed.

148
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,152
I'm not taking any customers.

149
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,276
This is a house of mourning.

150
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,370
I'm not here for a haircut.

151
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:05,792
I'd like to ask you some questions
about your son.

152
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,275
Brady?

153
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:11,204
What have you been up to now,
you no good layabout?

154
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:12,932
Actually it's your other son, Magnus,

155
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,988
I'm here about.
I'm a private investigator.

156
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,131
What do you want to know?

157
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:21,858
Just wanted to know about any
of his friends or acquaintances.

158
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:24,348
Why don't you just let him rest?

159
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:25,785
Mrs. O'Connor,

160
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,921
your son's defense attorney
was found dead the other morning.

161
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,414
He was a good lad!

162
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,829
He quit school when his dad died

163
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,603
so he could support me and Brady.

164
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,669
He built me this salon.

165
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,995
They killed his spirit in there.

166
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:42,361
I'm very sorry for your loss.

167
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:44,286
You have no idea!

168
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,344
Get out.

169
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:47,706
Get out now.

170
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,713
You shouldn't have done that...

171
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:58,526
made her cry.

172
00:09:58,775 --> 00:09:59,986
You come round here again,

173
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:01,469
you'll live to regret it.

174
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,845
You're not like your brother,

175
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,540
and he might have
actually intimidated me.

176
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,180
People who cross this family get hurt.

177
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:11,251
That's not intimidation. It's a fact.

178
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,326
Brady?

179
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,678
On your way then.

180
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:35,629
Is it possible something besides
cardiac arrest killed Fred Stamp?

181
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,267
Oh, no.
Everyone will die of cardiac arrest.

182
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,624
That just means that
your heart has ceased to beat.

183
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:43,562
What you want to ask is,
"What caused the myocardial infarction

184
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,543
that led to Mr. Stamp's cardiac arrest?"

185
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:47,458
What killed Fred Stamp?

186
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:50,183
There were no injection marks
on his body and

187
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:52,409
nothing unusual
in his toxicology report.

188
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,690
So no external triggers?

189
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:56,202
Not necessarily.

190
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,939
Bruises on his heart.

191
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,324
See it?

192
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,986
Observe.

193
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:08,737
Someone reached into his chest and
squeezed his heart until it stopped?

194
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,456
Like I said,

195
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,118
a heart attack.

196
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,833
What do you know
about Magnus O'Connor's suicide?

197
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,054
I have access to every coroner's report

198
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,340
for the last 20 years.

199
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:28,880
Oh, yes.

200
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:32,354
This is the coroner's diagram
showing the location of wounds

201
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,748
Magnus O'Connor inflicted on himself.

202
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:36,753
Right up your alley.

203
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:45,947
What? No doughnuts?

204
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:49,855
Did O'Connor's file happen
to mention he had a pentagram

205
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,780
carved into his chest
when he killed himself?

206
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:54,306
Uh... let's see.
Well, now that you mention it...

207
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,438
And you failed to tell me this... why?

208
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,720
Because I am not going
to give you any more excuses

209
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,292
to go hunting
for the boogey-man, that's why.

210
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:01,861
So you lied to me about a case?

211
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,476
I'm trying to stop a killer.

212
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,182
And I'm trying to keep you alive,
Vicki.

213
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:06,862
Detective Celluci!

214
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,229
You have homicides to investigate.

215
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,010
Your socializing
can wait 'til after hours.

216
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,630
You're one of those kids who got off
on being the hall monitor, weren't you?

217
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:17,364
The rules are there
for a reason, Nelson,

218
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,838
not that you ever understood that.

219
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,463
Yeah. Rules don't solve cases.

220
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:22,791
Detective Celluci...

221
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,434
my office.

222
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,627
Look, Mike,
I need that coroner's report,okay?

223
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,671
There's something hinkey.

224
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,180
Fine, on one condition.

225
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:35,644
I'm feeding you information,
you tell me where it takes you.

226
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,834
- Got it?
- Fine.

227
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:38,740
Fine.

228
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,997
So, the guards found him on the floor,

229
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,781
surrounded by aircle of salt

230
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:52,114
with a burning candle,
a glass of water and incense.

231
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,306
Okay, keep going.

232
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,372
He carved the pentagram into his chest

233
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:57,297
then sliced open his arms with an...

234
00:12:57,697 --> 00:13:00,496
elaborate shiv made
out of a flattened spoon.

235
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,773
Apparently it was Arts and Crafts
day on the cellblock.

236
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:07,511
There are four Celtic elements of life--
Earth, air, fire and water.

237
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:10,920
The pentagram is the connection
between the elements and the spirit.

238
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,180
Now I think

239
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,553
killing himself was part
of some sort of magic ritual.

240
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,661
So... what?
He sacrificed himself to kill Stamp?

241
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:22,821
Look, people hate their lawyers,
but that's a bit much.

242
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,013
I need to find out exactly

243
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,557
what this ceremony means.

244
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:28,511
There's someone we can talk to

245
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:29,900
but I haven't talked to them in a while.

246
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,280
Well, now's the time to catch up.

247
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,634
No, well you see,

248
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,206
initiating contact with this
person carries certain

249
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,469
implications I'm compelled
to consider before...

250
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,813
Well, consider on the way.

251
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:01,887
This is your expert?

252
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,944
Henry Fitzroy!

253
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,467
I never expected to see you again.

254
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,377
That's one hell of an entrance

255
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,307
And you brought a friend. Sit.

256
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,569
No thanks, I'm actually
just here for your...

257
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,304
professional opinion.

258
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:20,802
Anyone can purchase my services.
Cash only.

259
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:24,520
In your case, I'd consider
an alternative form of tribute.

260
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:27,995
Oh, Henry,

261
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,062
you do miss me don't you?

262
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,384
I'd like you to have a look at these.

263
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,499
All in good time.

264
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,483
Have you been tattooed recently?

265
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,920
Scarred?

266
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:51,896
Show them to me.

267
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:53,502
Don't...!

268
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:58,386
What do they mean?

269
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,771
These marks are like these sticks.

270
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,429
They're spells or rituals.

271
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,185
They can focus great power.

272
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:07,598
I knew this was a bad idea.

273
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:11,469
Your faith brands
this magic as evil, Henry.

274
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,704
My interpretation
is much more enlightened.

275
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,544
I prefer the word 'foolish'.

276
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,922
So what else do the sticks say?

277
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,485
The photos you brought,

278
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,410
they show a cleansing spell,

279
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,571
the Wiccan equivalent of last rites.

280
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:27,632
What does it do?

281
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,419
It prepares the spirit for the journey
to the House of Donn,

282
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:33,263
or Heaven, you might call it.

283
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:35,488
It's a very simple spell.

284
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,723
Anyone could do it. Even you.

285
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,545
I'll keep that in mind.

286
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,340
Now, unless there's anything else
you want to talk about?

287
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,495
We're done here.

288
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,877
Then I'll ask you to show
yourselves out.

289
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:52,537
Gratuities are always welcome.

290
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:56,199
- There's a box on the table.
- Don't... touch that.

291
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,335
Vicki, everything she said
about magic was a lie.

292
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,832
- Those marks are evil.
- You think I need reminding?

293
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,654
She's hiding something,

294
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:12,184
and so are you.

295
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:14,406
Sinead and I were involved,

296
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,256
before I realized

297
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,256
how immersed
she was in the Dark Arts.

298
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:20,885
I'll give you one thing,

299
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:23,434
you have the best break-up
stories of anyone I know.

300
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,000
Thank you.

301
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,913
This is going to be one of those,
"I want to know,

302
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:37,213
I don't want to know,"
situations, isn't it?

303
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:38,858
His name is George Neeley.

304
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:40,971
He died by the same hand
as the defense attorney.

305
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:42,971
Neeley, the prosecutor?

306
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:44,811
Tell me,

307
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,878
have you ever heard of iodine and

308
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,813
a-naphthoflavone
fingerprint visualization?

309
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:49,930
What do you think?

310
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,401
A process that can lift fingerprints

311
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,185
from generally
'unprintable' surfaces,

312
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:55,622
such as human skin.

313
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:58,823
Are you telling me that you found
fingerprints on George Neeley's heart?

314
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,395
Partial thumbprint on Neeley's,
and a full finger on Stamp's.

315
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,582
This would never stand up
in court, but,

316
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:06,979
the fingerprints match
those of Magnus O'Connor.

317
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,936
You do realize we're talking
about dead people killing people?

318
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,239
It would appear so, yes.

319
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:14,286
Can I borrow this?

320
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,379
Coreen, hey.

321
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,437
I need you to find out
if George Neeley

322
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:24,250
ever prosecuted Magnus O'Connor.

323
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:27,752
You know, find out who the presiding
judge was, while you're at it,

324
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,546
sooner rather than later.

325
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,095
Thanks.

326
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:41,328
Sinead.

327
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,770
I was surprised to see
you the other night.

328
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,502
- It was a good surprise.
- Now is a bad time.

329
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:48,714
You painted.

330
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,691
You really here to talk
about decorating?

331
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,076
Don't be such a grouch.

332
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:56,463
So I used a little magic on you.

333
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:59,148
I never complained
when you drank my blood.

334
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:01,458
It's impolite to refuse
a drink when offered.

335
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,383
I never asked you to use magic on me.

336
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:04,961
I did it for us.

337
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:06,396
To keep me tied to you.

338
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,134
You used to enjoy being tied.

339
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,274
You don't want me
to use my craft, I won't.

340
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:26,062
And you can still drink my blood,

341
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,518
as much as you want.

342
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:49,973
Justice Pettigrew!

343
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,284
Hello!

344
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:55,937
Justice Pettigrew!

345
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:37,780
Who are you?

346
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,330
My name is Vicki Nelson.

347
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,048
I'm here to help you.

348
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,339
He told me he killed,

349
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:47,135
Neeley and Stamp.

350
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,788
And I was next.

351
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,069
I tried to call 911, but...

352
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:52,836
all I heard was his voice.

353
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,090
Judge, what's going on here?
What is this all about?

354
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:57,569
I have no idea!
He's a psychopath.

355
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,587
You see, in my experience
guys who go to jail

356
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,025
blame either the prosecutor,

357
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:02,932
or their defense attorney,
but not both,

358
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:04,406
and not the judge.

359
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:06,230
What exactly are you implying?

360
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,619
I'm not implying anything.

361
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,046
I'm not the one
who was hiding in a panic room.

362
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,099
What does Magnus O'Connor
have against you?

363
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:15,226
Nothing.

364
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:18,118
Magnus O'Connor is a killing machine.

365
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,010
So you all put your heads together
and decided to railroad him?

366
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,814
Okay, sorry to have bothered you.
I will be on my way, but...

367
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,331
be sure to say 'hi'
to O'Connor when you see him.

368
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,204
It didn't start out as a set-up.

369
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,025
Everyone knew he was guilty...

370
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:39,678
of all the killings,

371
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:42,265
not just the one
where he was caught red-handed.

372
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,970
Everything needed
to convict him was in that car.

373
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:46,387
And then a rookie detective

374
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,284
blew the whole thing
by opening a door.

375
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,918
The evidence fell out,
the cop covered it with a jacket.

376
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,675
The evidence was corrupted.

377
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:56,112
So you, Neeley and Stamp buried
that information in the name of justice.

378
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:57,596
Stamp never knew.

379
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:03,378
And now Miss Nelson, it's your turn.

380
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,335
I'm working for Stamp's widow.

381
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:09,199
I figured out the connection
between Stamp, Neeley,

382
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:10,852
yourself and O'Connor.

383
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,835
I figured O'Connor
would want you dead as well,

384
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,778
so I came here to try and...

385
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:16,403
stop that from happening.

386
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:18,168
And now the full story?

387
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,149
Magnus O'Connor isn't...

388
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,225
quite alive.

389
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,596
It's going to take me
some time to explain.

390
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:29,230
I just need you to what I say

391
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,549
and I will try and get you
out of here in one piece.

392
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:34,717
Pack a bag.
We're getting you out of here.

393
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:04,082
I missed this.

394
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:05,800
It did have its moments.

395
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,463
I'm on my way.

396
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:16,913
Henry, no. Stay with me.

397
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,416
I have to go.

398
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,429
You'll have more fun if you stay.

399
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:39,498
That's more like it.

400
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:41,320
You did it again, didn't you?

401
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:42,597
That's what you want.

402
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,561
You dare use magic on me?

403
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:54,317
It's to protect you.

404
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:55,581
I saw your future.

405
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,684
You're in danger and
I just want to keep you safe.

406
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:58,717
Vicki...

407
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,254
Forget about her. It's too late.

408
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,907
Pray you're wrong.

409
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,751
Hey, I want you to take him to a hotel.

410
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,817
Make sure you're not followed.
Pay cash.

411
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:33,742
- Don't contact anyone.
- Okay.

412
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,377
How do I know I can trust him?

413
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:36,992
Because I trust him with my life.

414
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,147
You do?

415
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:40,356
Thank you.

416
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:42,647
How do I know I can trust you?

417
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,079
Would you like to stay here
and wait for O'Connor?

418
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,013
Let's go.

419
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:49,522
Mother of god!

420
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:10,909
You okay?

421
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,825
Come on.

422
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:24,858
Vicki, no... Don't!

423
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,516
Victoria, he's dead. I can smell it.

424
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,747
Please...
just meet me back at the office.

425
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:44,296
I have to call 911 now.

426
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:10,929
I know these men are connected.

427
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:12,573
I want to know why they are dying

428
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,846
<i>Quid pro quo or persona non grata.</i>

429
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,655
Neeley and Pettigrew
conspired to railroad

430
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:21,119
a con named Magnus O'Connor.

431
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:23,410
Stamp got painted
with the conspiracy brush.

432
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:24,951
Evidence?

433
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,633
Pettigrew confessed before he died.

434
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:29,460
Suspects?

435
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,752
I think a member of the O'Connor family

436
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:33,546
is trying to avenge Magnus' death.

437
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:36,594
Any of them wear loud silk tracksuits?

438
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:39,895
A neighbor saw a guy lurking around
Pettigrew's house yesterday morning.

439
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:42,243
When he confronted the prowler,

440
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:43,766
he told the neighbor to...

441
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,719
'eff off you effing wanker'.

442
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:47,409
His 'effs', not mine.

443
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:48,949
Had to be Brady O'Connor.

444
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,592
You two, go question O'Connor.

445
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:54,995
- You should have come to us first.
- I wasn't sure

446
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:56,329
And now a judge is dead.

447
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,855
You never could follow protocol.

448
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,362
Pettigrew's death is on your hands.

449
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:06,542
Come on Mike,
I don't need this from you, too.

450
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:07,673
Tough.

451
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:08,940
What happened to our deal?

452
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:10,462
I didn't have anything concrete.

453
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:12,567
You've always been a bad liar, Vicki,

454
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:13,974
and you better start talking right now

455
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:15,459
before I arrest you on obstruction.

456
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,882
Yeah, but just remember if I do,
you can't freak out.

457
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,008
Fine.

458
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,360
Pettigrew, Stamp

459
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:23,802
and Neeley were killed
by the ghost of Magnus O'Connor.

460
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,784
Ghost.

461
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:27,563
Great.

462
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,719
- Got any proof?
- I saw him.

463
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:30,817
Any real proof?

464
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,737
Two crushed hearts with Magnus
O'Connor's fingerprints on them.

465
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,669
Anything else?

466
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:37,913
Neeley and Pettigrew forced

467
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,617
a rookie detective to lie
on the stand in order to ensure

468
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,129
O'Connor's conviction.

469
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:45,136
I think that the ghost
is going to after that cop next.

470
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:47,905
You're taking this rather well.

471
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:50,214
Well, you know,
in light of everything else lately

472
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,981
a killer ghost seems like nothing,
right?

473
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:57,781
Okay, I can ID the detective
from the casebook, but...

474
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:59,406
listen,

475
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:01,800
from now on I am part of this,

476
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:03,091
do you understand me?

477
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,316
Somebody's got to watch your back.

478
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,706
You could lose your job for this.

479
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,072
Well, I guess I'll just have to open up
a private investigation agency, won't I?

480
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,140
We've got to find a way to stop this
son of abitch, and fast.

481
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,595
That might be tough
when he can walk right through you.

482
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:26,574
- We can't even touch him.
- I can.

483
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,977
We were on the stairs at the house...

484
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,775
I reached out for him,
it was just instinct, but...

485
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:34,084
I grabbed his ankle.

486
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:38,108
Henry, my marks heated up and glowed.

487
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:41,527
He was as surprised as I was.

488
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:44,543
Maybe Sinead's right about these things.

489
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,459
It's not that simple.

490
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:49,069
Dark magic marks you.

491
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:50,553
It draws forces towards you

492
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,722
and you're already
in enough danger because of it.

493
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,374
So be my safety net.

494
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:02,650
You can throw them all you want,

495
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,317
you're not going to find
a future with Henry in there.

496
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:06,538
I'm closed.

497
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:09,308
Well, you start talking
this won't take long.

498
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:12,137
All your answers are in here.

499
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:14,789
What, are you going to tip me to death?

500
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:20,870
You don't want to know.

501
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:26,428
Now...

502
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,564
tell us the truth!

503
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,662
Three men connected
to your brother's trial are dead.

504
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:41,179
Now one, I'll say is natural causes,

505
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,327
two,

506
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,148
an unhappy coincidence.
Three?

507
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,721
I'd say that smells like revenge.

508
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,425
You know what I smell?

509
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:49,908
Look, you've got motive!

510
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:51,533
Witnesses place you at the scene.

511
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,270
You killed three men, right?

512
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,382
Is that a question?

513
00:29:55,664 --> 00:29:57,100
- Look...
- Dave.

514
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:07,418
Look Brady...

515
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,469
we understand,

516
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:14,021
really.

517
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:16,312
He was your brother, your blood.

518
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,809
Now he's dead,
you had to do something.

519
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:20,237
I get honor,

520
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:21,931
family.

521
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:25,013
If somebody messes
with one of my own, I'm not waiting

522
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,584
for the system,
you know what I'm saying?

523
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,891
The reason he's dead
is because of the killing.

524
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:30,985
That was my brother's way.

525
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,867
He knew I wouldn't do it, so...

526
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,144
Who knew?

527
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:38,496
Brady, you know who did this. Tell me.

528
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,341
I don't know anything.

529
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:44,676
Who did Magnus hire
to kill these men?

530
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,442
He didn't hire no one.

531
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:47,766
That's the truth.

532
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,460
I'm not saying nothing else,

533
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:51,920
not without a lawyer.

534
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:03,599
I touched a ghost tonight,

535
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:06,115
even though I know that's impossible.

536
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:09,580
We're trying to save somebody's life.

537
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:11,495
It's in your best interests to help.

538
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:15,242
Your marks.

539
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:17,824
Do you notice anything
familiar in the photos?

540
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:20,382
- The pentagram?
- It's a powerful symbol.

541
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:23,041
Binding. The soul and the flesh.

542
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:25,126
The natural and the supernatural.

543
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,755
- You and the demon.
- What are you talking about?

544
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,074
How is Vicki bound to Astaroth?

545
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:31,370
Only time will tell.

546
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:33,730
Look, all I want to know
is how to stop O'Connor.

547
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,980
Okay, that was not
a cleansing spell he performed.

548
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:38,267
What did O'Connor do?

549
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,057
It blocks the spirit's passage.
Traps it.

550
00:31:43,414 --> 00:31:44,691
Binds it to what?

551
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:47,414
Something or someone.

552
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:48,890
Why did you lie to us?

553
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:52,654
I know better than to cross
any person who is capable of

554
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:54,439
teaching that kind of magic to a thug.

555
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,016
Who's doing it?

556
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,578
Take a look at you photos.

557
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:01,606
You already know the answer.

558
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:05,400
Let's go.

559
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:09,580
Goodbye, Sinead.

560
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:10,894
See you soon.

561
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:20,560
Is it true what they say?
Were you at that judge's house?

562
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:21,824
- No!
- Liar!

563
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:23,593
- I didn't do anything.
- Quiet.

564
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:26,701
Whew, I'm glad she's not my mom.

565
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,307
Yeah? So is she.

566
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,839
She said we already had the answer.

567
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:43,578
What are we looking for?

568
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,757
I don't know. Just keep looking.

569
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,928
Let me think about this.
Revenge is personal, right?

570
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,496
Crushed hearts are personal.

571
00:32:51,497 --> 00:32:53,026
I mean if you just wanted
somebody dead,

572
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:54,463
you'd hire a hit man, you know?

573
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,449
One shot to the head,
it's over, right?

574
00:32:57,713 --> 00:33:00,164
It's a binding spell,

575
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:04,295
and it binds the spirit to someone.

576
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:07,384
And the pentagram is
a binding symbol, right?

577
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,701
And that's Gaelic for mother.

578
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:11,039
Son of a bitch...

579
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:13,445
and I mean that literally.

580
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:15,793
We got a problem.

581
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:19,624
One guess who screwed up
O'Connor's case.

582
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:27,266
Just put it down there.

583
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,224
Who knows who else
O'Connor was going to target.

584
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,338
He was in and out of the system so many
times anyone could be his next kill.

585
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:35,847
- Okay, well I'll help...
- Thank you detective.

586
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,183
I'll take it from here.

587
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:56,221
So let me get this straight.

588
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,127
Magnus kills himself in prison

589
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:01,280
and his mother makes his ghost get
revenge on the people who put him there?

590
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,162
Stamp loses his case.

591
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,965
Neeley, Pettigrew and Crowley

592
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,983
all conspire to conceal the evidence.
It makes sense.

593
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:10,633
What terrifies me is that
I'm starting to get to the point

594
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,098
where that makes sense to me, too.

595
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,403
- Where's Crowley?
- Back at the office.

596
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,264
You need to go keep an eye on her.

597
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,926
O'Connor's being summoned by the mother,

598
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:20,475
so we have to go find her.

599
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,484
Well, if she's behind this,
then I'm coming with you.

600
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:24,128
No, someone has to stay with Crowley.

601
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:27,343
I mean, I really don't think she wants
to spend quality time with me, so.

602
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:29,620
So I'm supposed to go baby-sit her

603
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:31,643
while you go square off with some...

604
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,352
psycho ghost all by yourself?

605
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,432
I've got her covered.

606
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,021
I'll hold you to that.

607
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:45,210
I can't believe this.

608
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:47,867
All these years,
Crowley has been riding me

609
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,487
about obeying the rules and
she's the one breaking protocol.

610
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,797
- She's not the villain here, Vick.
- I know!

611
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,764
It just still sucks to have
to go save her.

612
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,013
We need to talk.

613
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,741
I don't have time.

614
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:17,722
Make the time.

615
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:20,711
Please.

616
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:27,650
Lavena O'Connor?

617
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:29,924
You're too late.

618
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:33,548
Oh, my God.

619
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:36,619
It doesn't pay to cross my ma.

620
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:37,886
Where is she?

621
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:40,563
She's gone off to kill that cop.

622
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,160
- Crowley.
- We have to help him.

623
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:43,362
No, no, don't!

624
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,324
She says it will wear off

625
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:46,906
she lets it.

626
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,300
I can't believe
she'd do this to her own son?

627
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,804
What she did to Magnus was worse.

628
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,255
He performed
that binding spell all on his own.

629
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:58,048
Magnus wasn't always a killer.

630
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,567
She turned him into that.

631
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,346
She used her magic

632
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,036
and made him get a taste for it.

633
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,196
When the prison
put him out of her reach,

634
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,346
she made him kill himself.

635
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,581
Said she could bring him back.

636
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,286
That's insane.

637
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:16,784
Sanity is not this family's strong suit.

638
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:19,497
Go help your friend.

639
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,091
You try not to hurt her, yeah?

640
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:27,809
She is my ma.

641
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,395
I pulled the Magnus O'Connor case.

642
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:38,000
You had just been assigned to homicide

643
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:39,306
when O'Connor got pulled over.

644
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,947
You were the rookie cop who spoiled
the evidence in the case, weren't you?

645
00:36:46,346 --> 00:36:47,491
Nice detective work.

646
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:56,934
Even after I opened the door
and the head fell out,

647
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,775
we still would have
had him dead to rights.

648
00:36:59,155 --> 00:37:00,160
So what happened?

649
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:01,390
A playground.

650
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,817
Kids everywhere,

651
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,385
I didn't want them to see the head so

652
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:08,423
I draped my jacket over it.

653
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:13,139
You can't beat yourself up
for being compassionate.

654
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,266
I do not want this
becoming squad room

655
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,646
gossip, understand?

656
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:19,422
Breathe a word of this to anyone

657
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:20,821
and I will bury you.

658
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,671
This...

659
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:26,935
doesn't make you look incompetent.

660
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,409
This really doesn't make you look weak.

661
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:30,268
I mean, if anything
it makes you look human.

662
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:32,747
Thanks for the hug.

663
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:35,968
I'm tired.

664
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,193
I'm going home.

665
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,526
All right, well then,
I'm going with you.

666
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:41,457
Three men have already
died because of this.

667
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,100
You're likely the next target.

668
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,772
I can take care of myself.

669
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:07,390
I touched him before.

670
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:09,648
If I have some kind of connection
to him, I'm going to use it.

671
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:11,761
It would be silly to try
to convince you otherwise.

672
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:13,728
Straight up, waste of breath.

673
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,191
At least you're consistent.

674
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:12,582
Crowley!

675
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:16,594
Don't do that, Celluci.

676
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,101
Hey, ma's boy!

677
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:33,679
No, Vicki, Don't!

678
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,934
Kill her! Kill her!

679
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:40,530
Kill her!

680
00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:43,188
You talk too much.

681
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,048
Mike, are you okay?

682
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:19,620
Oh, she's alive!

683
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,463
Oh, thank god.

684
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,111
- Where's Lavena?
- She's dead.

685
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:27,576
How did she die?

686
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:29,925
Heart attack.

687
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:32,244
I was just trying to stop her.

688
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:38,875
- Here, help me.
- You're okay.

689
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:57,475
hat did you tell them?

690
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,240
The truth.

691
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,348
That Lavena O'Connor
attacked Crowley in the parking lot.

692
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,404
I just didn't tell them
that her weapon of choice

693
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:06,582
was the ghost of her dead son.

694
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:08,492
Thank you...

695
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:10,710
both of you.

696
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:13,012
All right.

697
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:15,331
Oh, for god's sakes.

698
00:41:16,054 --> 00:41:18,537
Would the two of you pretend
to play nice just for a minute?

699
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,998
It's been a long night.

700
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:24,667
Saving lives is exhausting.

701
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,340
Saving lives,
that's a first for you, huh, vampire?

702
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:29,533
Like you'd know.

703
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:32,171
Your job doesn't even start
until it's too late for the victim.

704
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:34,134
Really.

705
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:39,718
I have this...

706
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:42,830
You two better get going
I've got this report to file.

707
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,895
Oh yeah, I've got to figure out
how to bill this.

708
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,301
- Goodnight, Mike.
- Goodnight.

709
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:21,470
Just like magic.

710
00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:26,240
