1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,320
Clark,I know hunting down
zoners is your top priority,

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,710
but if you haven't found
anything in south america,

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,150
we still have a situation back
here in kansas we need to deal with.

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,020
No,he'll be here in 15 minutes.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,720
Okay. Great.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,230
I'll see you in a few.

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,180
Dr. Casselli.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,900
You're early.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,270
You are annoyingly persistent,
miss sullivan.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,060
I've already told you
I don't know anything.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,960
Don't sell yourself short,
doctor.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,100
I think you're
a very knowledgeable man.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,510
In the last few months,

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,770
over a dozen patients have been transferred
out of the high-security wing at belle reve.

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,700
I believe that's your signature
on all the paperwork.

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,450
Patients are transferred in and out
of mental facilities all the time.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,280
Even ones that exhibit
unusual abilities?

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,080
Where are they transferred to?

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,570
Is luthorcorp involved?

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,480
Does this have anything to do
with 33.1?

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,840
Okay. I'll take that
as a "no comment. "

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,050
I didn't want any of this.

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,130
But it was so much money.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,680
Chloe? You okay?

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,370
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,770
Just in the nick of time,
as always.

27
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,870
It wasn't me. He was already
down when I got here.

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,250
What?

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,280
Well,if it wasn't you,
then who -

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,800
he's open! Pass the ball!

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,960
Pass the -

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,480
oh! What's the matter
with you,man?

33
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,490
Still too slow,stretch.

34
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,930
Bart.

38
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:23,721
He got away from you?

39
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:25,400
I thought you were
the fastest man alive.

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,110
He saved your life,
which is more than I can say.

41
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,050
Oh,come on,clark.
It wasn't your fault.

42
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,790
Even with all your powers,
you can't be everywhere at once.

43
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,120
I have to be.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,510
I'm the only one who can round up
the prisoners from the phantom zone

45
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,380
and stop lex from experimenting
on people with abilities.

46
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,550
What did you find out
from casselli about 33.1?

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,480
Nothing,
and I'm not going to.

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,030
Casselli was
in and out of prison

49
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,000
before the ink could dry
on his fingerprints.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,260
How'd he get out so fast?

51
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,300
I don't know,but a luthorcorp lawyer paid
casselli a visit right before his release.

52
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,130
Lex.

53
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,500
Casselli could be stashed
halfway around the world by now.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,110
I'll get in touch with lionel.
Maybe he can tell us something.

55
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,210
I'll keep sifting
through my luthorcorp intel.

56
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,300
Maybe we'll get lucky, and I'll
come up with a few bread crumbs.

57
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,130
Hey,gorgeous. What's up?
You miss me?

58
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm bart allen. We had a moment
on the town last time I was here.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,160
Two years ago,
before you had a boyfriend.

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,570
Oh! Right!
Wow.

61
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,110
It's good to see you again,
bart.

62
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,140
The pleasure's all mine,
seÑorita.

63
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,190
I'll see you around.

64
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,350
Muy caliente.

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,470
Knock it off.

66
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,630
What's with the spanish?

67
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,850
I just grabbed lunch
down in mexico,man.

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,800
They got this burrito down
there - el intestine-o buster.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,220
You got to take a run down there
with me to try one.

70
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,680
What are you
doing here,bart?

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,290
I'm hanging out with my
amigo,man. What's it look like?

72
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,090
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

73
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,800
Last time you blew through town,
you stole my dad's wallet

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,030
then swiped a priceless artifact from
lex. You nearly got yourself killed.

75
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,640
Yeah. Yeah,those were
the days,huh?

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,400
Yeah,all right.
Look,man,

77
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,040
I already told you, things
are different now,okay?

78
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,620
I mean,back then,I needed a super-kick
in the butt, and you laid it on me,

79
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,920
and ever since then, there's been no
more stealing for this gringo,I swear.

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,830
Am I really supposed to
just buy that?

81
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,120
I could squirt out some tears
if that'll help.

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,020
No,but the truth might.

83
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,830
What were you doing
at the daily planet?

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,470
I saw chloe-licious
had a byline a while back.

85
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,470
And I was in town on business,
figured I ought to check it out.

86
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,000
What kind of business?

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,030
I'm a courier. I pick
things up. I drop them off.

88
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,770
Lickety-split. Don't have a fit.

89
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,710
All right. Look,man,whatever.
You don't trust me. That's fine.

90
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Okay,I'll be gonebefore you can even blink.

91
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't know.

92
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,400
I can still blinkpretty fast.

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,260
Mexico,huh?Want to go get that burrito?

94
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,180
Excelente.

95
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,910
Now,that is what I call
a three-martini lunch.

96
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,140
It wasa four-martini lunch

97
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,890
if you include the onethat
you spilled on my shirt.

98
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,160
Right.

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,670
Well,how am I ever going
tomake it up to you?

100
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,180
I don't know.
Because,uh...

101
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,700
it's my favorite shirt.

102
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,240
Well,then,I think we
shouldget it into the laundry

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,020
so that it doesn't stain.

104
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,930
Yeah. That's a good idea.

105
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,410
I got to take this.

106
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,010
Go ahead.

107
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,480
Give me five minutes.

108
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,140
I,uh...

109
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,150
you know,what I had in mind

110
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,690
is gonna take a little
longerthan five minutes.

111
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,210
Rain check?

112
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,720
Sure.

113
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,290
I'll just put it nextto the rest of
the umbrellas you keep handing me.

114
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,620
Lois -

115
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,680
I mean,is it just me

116
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,080
or is this relationshipall
interruptus and no coitus?

117
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,700
You're always running off
just when thingsstart getting interesting,

118
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,520
and I like being interested -a lot.

119
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,510
Yeah.
I know. You're right.

120
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,450
It's,uh...
it's not fair to you.

121
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,100
I think we should takea break.

122
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,950
You mean like,what...

123
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,220
see other people?

124
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,820
Uh,well,okay.
Yeah,I mean,if that's what you want.

125
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,740
I was actually thinkingmore along the lines
of taking a vacation...

126
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
together.

127
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,770
Really?

128
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,890
Yeah,really.

129
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,110
No rushing outin the
middle of the good stuff?

130
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,730
No. None.

131
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,520
It'll be you,me,and...

132
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,160
monte carlo?

133
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,040
There's just a few thingsthat
I do need to take care of

134
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,100
before we go,and I think once we get -

135
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,160
god,you're good at that.

136
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,830
- I'll start packing.
- Okay.

137
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,210
Bye.

138
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,420
GAME ON

139
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,960
I need to talk to you. You alone?

140
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,780
Just meand my shadow,dad.

141
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,230
Lana's in paris with
nell,shopping for a wedding dress.

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,530
That's goodshe's out of the country
consideringwhat's happening.

143
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,090
Look,if this is aboutdr. Casselli -

144
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,310
casselli?He's the least of our worries.

145
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,020
Another luthorcorp facilityhas been hit.
That's six.

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,870
Each one of them hassome
connection with 33.1.

147
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,160
The only thinghoused in those facilities
was peripheral research.

148
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,200
All the vital data isstill
secure in the mainframe.

149
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
How long do you think beforethat
location is compromised?

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,140
If it ever became publicthat
luthorcorp is experimenting

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,570
on peoplewith abilities -

152
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,130
it won'T.

153
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,550
What's this?

154
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,190
A single framepulled off a security camera
from one of the break-ins.

155
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,440
Whoever is responsible

156
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,950
has the ability to move
fasterthan a speeding bullet.

157
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,980
Such a unique individual would make an
interestingtest subject to add to 33.1,

158
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,990
don't you think?

159
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,660
What do you plan to do?

160
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,820
Protect our investment.

161
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,000
Come on. I'll walk you out.

162
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,790
Yeah,I got it.

163
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,270
Meet me at the rendezvous.

164
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,310
Hey,are we gonna do this or are you
gonna lurkin the shadows all night?

165
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,320
Just being careful.

166
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,520
After all,I'm not as fast as you.

167
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,930
Clark.

168
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,730
I was,uh,just thinking about you.

169
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,680
You got a funny wayof showing it.

170
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,890
I've left youhalf a dozen messages.

171
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,330
I'm sorry. I've been preoccupied.

172
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,410
Helping that doctorfrom
belle reve get out of jail.

173
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,030
Clark,my involvementwith
belle reve is past history.

174
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,440
But it appearsthat you still have

175
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,780
a very active interestin
breaking into luthorcorp.

176
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,410
Where was this taken?

177
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,590
Mexico - the luthorcorpprocessing plant.

178
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,940
If you're going to
continueplaying games like this,

179
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,610
you should be more careful.

180
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,050
This isn't me.

181
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,120
No?

182
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,300
Who is it,then?

183
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,020
God,mrs. K,thank you so much.
This was so good.

184
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,250
Where do you put it all?

185
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,280
You eat more than clark,and
he's twice your size.

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,470
Yeah,well,you know,I burn a lot of calories.

187
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,090
Well,there's plenty morein the fridge.

188
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,520
I have to runto a meeting.

189
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,960
Would you mindcleaning up?

190
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,820
Yeah,anything for you,mrs. K.

191
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,350
It's niceto have you here,bart.
I hope you stay longerthis time.

192
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,370
Hey,what's up,man?You just
missed a killer spread.

193
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,700
You can cut the act.

194
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,580
I know about luthorcorp and the
break-ins by somebodywho's as fast as me.

195
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,430
Yeah. Faster,actually.

196
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,310
You know what's funny? I actually believed
your storyabout how I changed your life.

197
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,120
Look,it's not a story,clark,okay?

198
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,450
Really,I'm not the same guy.

199
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,870
You stole from lex before.
You're stealing from him again.

200
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,980
What's the difference?

201
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,000
It's just - ugh! -It's complicated.

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,650
I'm a smart guy. Explain it to me.

203
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,030
I can'T.

204
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,900
Why not?I thought we were amigos.

205
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,160
We are.

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,320
Then tell me why you're
stealingfrom luthorcorp.

207
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,080
I JUST  I CAN't

208
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll find outfor myself,then.

209
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,040
Look,I'm sorry I can't tell
youall my secrets,clark.

210
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,220
Okay?
I thought a guy like youwould understand.

211
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,350
I know it's justa vacation,but -

212
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,640
what? Vacation?No,vacation is palm springs.

213
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,260
Monte carlois a fairy tale.

214
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,490
Yeah,hopefullywithout prince charming

215
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,680
having a disappearing actevery five minutes.

216
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,730
Um,I think you'll be
keepinghis full attention,lois.

217
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,990
Yeah,you know,I'd better. It's not
like I govictoria's secret for anybody.

218
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,460
What do you think?
Should I have gone with the blk lace?

219
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,690
No.

220
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,540
Something tells me greenis
definitely his color.

221
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,660
Hey,chloe.

222
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,380
God. Smallville. Learn how to knock.

223
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,510
What if I'd been naked?

224
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,060
Lois is jetting offto
monte carlo with oliver.

225
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,920
Oliver?

226
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,290
I'll send you a postcardif I'm not too busy.

227
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,940
No,lois,you should,um...

228
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,160
get a couple new bikinis.

229
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,060
Good idea. Thanks,smallville.

230
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,430
Maybe it wasn'tsuch a good idea
to help oliverkeep his secret from her.

231
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,370
What,that he's the green arrow?

232
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,190
No offense,but you weren'texactly honest
with lana about your secret,either.

233
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,340
Look how that ended up.

234
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,390
Maybe all keeping secretsdoes sometimes is
force you to lieto the people you care about.

235
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,790
Are we stilltalking about oliver?

236
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,530
The guy who saved youat the planet -

237
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,390
he didn't exactly get away. It's bart.

238
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,000
What? Wait a minute.
Bart can superspeed,too?

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,260
He's actually a lot fasterthan
I am. That's the truth.

240
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

241
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,330
It's fine. You were
protecting him. It's okay.

242
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,600
I mean,if anyone gets it,it's me.

243
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,670
But why are yououting him now?

244
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,690
I think he's headed for
trouble,and I need to find him.

245
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,110
Can you gps his cellphone?

246
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,510
Yeah,I can try. Do you have his number?

247
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,660
He broke into a luthorcorp
plantdown in mexico.

248
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,020
Now I think lexis on to him.

249
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,190
If he tries to break intoanother facility...

250
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,910
no good. His phone must be off.

251
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,010
What about call history?Can
you pull up a record?

252
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,490
Legally?Absolutely not.

253
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,660
There's over a dozen callsto that number
in the last 24 hours.

254
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,680
Let's see who's onthe other end.

255
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,470
Artemis global
consortium?Never heard of them.

256
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,090
It's as subsidiaryof J.L. International,

257
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,350
which is a satellitecompany
currently orbiting...

258
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,490
queen industries?

259
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,630
It's oliver.

260
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,870
He's using bartto attack luthorcorp.

261
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm in.

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,020
Not so fast now,are you?

263
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,080
Oliver.

264
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,910
Look,clark,whatever's gotyour
tighty whities in a bunch,

265
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,020
now is not the time.

266
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,450
Where's bart?I saw his phone records.

267
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,340
I know he's working for you.

268
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,240
Not for me. Working with me.

269
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,050
There's a difference.

270
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,790
It's not gonna matter whenhe
ends up in jail or worse.

271
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,400
Yeah,you don't knowwhat
you're talking about.

272
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,540
I know how muchyou hate lex.

273
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,380
Is that whyyou recruited bart -

274
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,810
to help withyour little vendetta?

275
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,330
No. To stop 33.1.

276
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,970
You know about 33.1?

277
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,280
Why didn't you tell mewhat you were up to?

278
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,540
Clark,do you check in with me
every time you run offto save the world?

279
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,060
Oh,that's right. For a
second there,I forgot.

280
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,600
You like to wait for troubleto
show up on your doorstep.

281
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,060
That's not true.

282
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,320
Then why haven't you
doneanything to stop 33.1?

283
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,500
I was busywith another problem.

284
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,470
What could be more urgentthan lex luthor
developing an armyof superfreaks,clark?

285
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,910
That's what he's doing.

286
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,660
He's starting a war.

287
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,520
What have you found out?

288
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,620
Not enough.

289
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,840
Last nightbart infiltrated a place that
was supposed to housethe mainframe for 33.1.

290
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,160
That's the last timeI heard from him.

291
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,260
So I reconnedthe target this morning.

292
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,090
The placehad been stripped clean.
Everything's gone.

293
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,830
The whole thingwas a setup.

294
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,920
Lex has bart.

295
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,710
We have to find him.

296
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,450
- My team's already on it.
- Your team?

297
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,080
Not everybodyflies solo,kent.

298
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,990
Morning,sunshine.

299
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,810
I know you.

300
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,170
You've stolen from mebefore.

301
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,220
I want a lawyer.

302
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,510
And I want a ponytail.

303
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,150
Disappointment abounds.

304
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,930
Who do you work for?

305
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,700
What you see is what
you get,there,goldilocks.

306
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,670
You're a low-level thief.

307
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,830
Swiping corporate dataisn't your style.

308
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,410
Now,tell mewho you're working for,

309
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,820
and this won't have to getunpleasant.

310
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,140
All right.

311
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,750
All right.

312
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,590
I work for a guycalled mr. Kiss-my-butt.

313
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,570
Would you like meto introduce you?

314
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,600
The floor of your cellhas been outfitted with
pressure platesdesigned to track movement.

315
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,660
Stop in one placefor even a
millisecond after I activate them,

316
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,640
and you fry.

317
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,560
Last chance.

318
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,670
Well,maybe you'll feelmore talkative
when you get tiredof running.

319
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,500
Aah!

320
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,260
A.C.,Checkthe luthorcorp manifests.

321
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,420
Gotcha.

322
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,990
How long have you guysbeen working together?

323
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,020
I joined upabout six months ago.

324
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,510
Ollie and bart had
alreadybeen doing their thing.

325
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,270
What about your girlfriend -katherine?

326
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,920
Dude,don't even go there.

327
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,310
She gave it her best shot.

328
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,270
But with all this hardwarein me...

329
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,340
I'm sorry,victor.

330
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,740
Ollie found me. I was living on the streets.

331
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,380
He gave me a warm meal,roof over my head...

332
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,000
and a reason to go on living.

333
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,940
Did he just saysomething nice about me?

334
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,160
Maybe he's startingto rust.

335
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,640
A.C.,How'd you fallinto all this?

336
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,180
I got into a little troublesinking a whaler
off the coast of japan.

337
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,130
A little trouble? That'swhat
you're gonna go with?

338
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,930
Ollie had to save your
scalybutt from getting filleted.

339
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,010
I would have gottenout of it.

340
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,050
Before or after they packed
youinto a thousand little tin cans?

341
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,340
Well,at least he wouldhave
been dolphin-safe.

342
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,260
Fish jokes.

343
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,400
That's all I ever getare fish jokes.

344
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,430
So how's lois doing,man?Is she all right?

345
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,940
I think you'd have to askyour boss.

346
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,040
Now is not the time.
We need to focuson locating bart.

347
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,280
And how exactly did you
get himinvolved in this?

348
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,110
He's never beenmuch of a team player.

349
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,530
Looks like you two
havesomething in common,huh?

350
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,170
Actually,I was out on
patrolin star city one night,

351
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,450
and I came across bart.
He was helping himselfto a free meal.

352
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,720
I could tell he was a good kid,you know?

353
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,650
He just neededa little direction,
so I offered him a job.

354
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,670
Look where that got him.

355
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,670
I underestimated lex.

356
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,410
It won't happen again.

357
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,220
I've compiled a listof all luthorcorp
holdings within a 100-mile radius.

358
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,690
Bart could be heldin any
one of those facilities.

359
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,090
That's a lot of real estateto cover.

360
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,000
I think I know someonewho
can help us narrow it down.

361
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,490
Victor stone and arthur
curryare working for him,too?

362
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,180
Yeah,oliver's been busy.

363
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,920
Is there anythingin your luthorcorp intel that
can help us find outwhere bart's being held?

364
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,920
I don't know.

365
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,990
Uh... wait.

366
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,870
When I had my feelers outfor dr. Casselli, I
managed to shake loosesome internal documents.

367
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,280
In the last few days,
there's been a flurryof equipment transfers

368
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,140
to the ridge facilitieson
the outskirts of metropolis.

369
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,820
Doesn't luthorcorpmove
equipment all the time?

370
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,740
This isn't just a coupleof forklifts,clark.

371
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,580
Half a ton of lead
shielding,electrical pressure plates,

372
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,160
more than $20 millionworth of equipment
to measure high-velocityparticles.

373
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,700
Bart. Take everythingand bring it to oliver.

374
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,240
Me? Clark -

375
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,390
I can get to the ridgefaster myself.

376
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,770
I can't let anythinghappen to bart.

377
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,220
Mr. Queen,it's chloe
sullivan. Clark sent me.

378
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,470
Where's clark?

379
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,010
He went to rescue bart.

380
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,340
He told you about bart?

381
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,860
We trust each other.Clark
tells me everything -

382
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,990
well,almost everything.

383
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,150
I did have to figure out about your
green-leather fetishon my lonesome.

384
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,770
Don't worry. I didn't say anything to lois.

385
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,820
Although,you mightwant to consider -

386
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,370
hey,let's just stick tothe
main plot,there,sidekick.

387
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,260
So,what do you got?

388
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,120
Hopefully a solid leadon bart.

389
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,230
Where are victor and A.C.?

390
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,410
Guess we're not that good
at the whole "secret" partof this yet.

391
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,580
Yeah,but you're great
atgetting caught by the villain.

392
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,130
Anyway,I think bart'sbeing held
at a placecalled the ridge facility.

393
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,700
That's down by the docks.

394
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,580
It's on our listof possible 33.1 targets.

395
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,500
All right,boys. You know the drill.
Let's gear up and get out.

396
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,340
Oh,no.

397
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,110
What now?

398
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,170
Lead shielding. This isn't just for bart.

399
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,560
I think the ridge facility'sbeing used
to refine meteor rock.

400
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,070
Clark's in trouble.

401
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,930
restricted

402
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,540
Green arrow to watchtower.
We're in position.

403
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,090
Okay,there should be a securityaccess
panel near the east door.

404
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,480
According to this schematic,
you need to very carefullyrewire the sys-

405
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,830
or...

406
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,680
I could just jack in andshut
the whole perimeter down.

407
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,060
You can do that?

408
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,100
Queen industries upgrade.

409
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Accessingperimeter security.

410
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,470
Perimeter neutralized.

411
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,310
Aquaman,you're up.

412
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,570
Perimeter breached. Proceeding to target.

413
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,470
You'd make one hellof a can opener.

414
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,520
You'd look good on a bag of green beans.

415
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,880
All right,we're in. Which way?

416
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,290
The refinement vault's100 meters southwest.

417
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,640
Still no word from clark.

418
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,910
If he's in there,we'll
get him out. Let's go.

419
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,830
You've gota different mission.

420
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,930
You're the boss,robin hood.

421
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,210
What mission?What are you doing?

422
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,540
Watchtower to green
arrow. What's your status?

423
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,330
Switchingto silent running.

424
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,210
Stand byfor instructions.

425
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,110
Aquaman,do your thing.

426
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,320
Hey. You're not supposed to be here.

427
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,690
Neither am I.

428
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,990
Come on.

429
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,510
- I'm all right.
- You sure?

430
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,430
Green arrow to watchtower.
Boy scout'sout of the woods.

431
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,630
Boy scout?

432
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,620
If you hadn't ran off,you
couldhave picked your code name.

433
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,940
You don't want to playfor
the team,that's fine.

434
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,520
Point taken. Where's bart?

435
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,000
"Impulse. " He didn't get to
pickhis own code name either.

436
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,000
Watchtower will guide you
towhere he's probably being held.

437
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,140
What are yougonna be doing?

438
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,860
What I do best.

439
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,160
Watchtower to boy scout. Let's find impulse.

440
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,830
Cyborg to aquaman.
Where the hell are you,fish stick?

441
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,610
Dude,what took you so long?

442
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,920
Nice.

443
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,110
But,please,put a shirt on.

444
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,800
I swim fasterwhen I'm naked.

445
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,020
I bet you do.

446
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,960
You're lucky I still gotmy pants on.

447
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,680
Impulse located.

448
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,720
Bart,you okay?

449
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,680
Muy bueno,amigo.

450
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,970
I don't care. I want a level-one lockdown.

451
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,640
No one gets in or out.

452
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,890
Little late for that.

453
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,470
You got 10 minutesto clear
your people out of here

454
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,960
before I blow this placeoff the map.

455
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,680
You.

456
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,090
You remember. I'm touched.

457
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,120
Well,it's a little hardto forget.

458
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,260
Last time we met,you
put an arrow in my chest.

459
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,830
You put a bullet in mine. Bygones?

460
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,190
Go to hell.

461
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,700
You first.

462
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,770
Can you superspeed?

463
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,320
Yeah,I just
- I need a minuteto catch my breath.

464
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,570
You know what? You're
gonnahave to catch it later.

465
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,640
Aquaman,cyborg,rendezvous alpha confirmed.

466
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,740
We're on the move.

467
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,390
Watchtower,have all luthor'speople
cleared the building?

468
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,500
The last heat signaturesare
moving away from the north.

469
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,790
Wait a second. What are you doing?

470
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,360
What do you thinkI'm doing?

471
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,890
You want more of your
friendsto end up in here?

472
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,440
Yeah,I'm voting noon that one.

473
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,570
Watchtower,are you sureeveryone's
out of the building?

474
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,980
100% positive.

475
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,720
All right. Let's do it.

476
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,860
have the jet fueledand ready.
I want to be in the airas soon as possible.

477
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,500
Hey.

478
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,090
I hope your bird's gotsome serious lift,
'cause this thingweighs a ton.

479
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,670
Aren't you packed yet?

480
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,840
Where's your stuff?

481
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,080
Lois,um...

482
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,280
don't even think about sayingwhat
I think you're gonna say.

483
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,450
I'm sorry.
I,um,I have to go awayon business.

484
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,730
Postpone it.

485
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,610
It's not that simple.

486
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,460
Nothing with you ever is.

487
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,350
You're like two completelydifferent people.

488
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,670
There's the charming,romantic guy
that I fell in love with,

489
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,780
and then there'sthis other guy

490
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,560
who can't stick aroundin one place
long enoughto see what he's missing.

491
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,190
Ever sincemy parents died...

492
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,690
...I've jumped aroundfrom city to city,

493
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,410
from continentto continent.

494
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,580
And... in all those years...

495
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,240
...not once have I regrettedleaving anyone.

496
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,950
But then I met you.

497
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,550
Then stay.

498
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,170
I can'T.

499
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,050
Because there are more importantthings
in this world than what I want...

500
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,860
and what I love.

501
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,860
I hope somedayI can explain why.

502
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,680
Don't expect meto be waiting around for that
when you get back.

503
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,340
I'm not coming back,lois.

504
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,240
At least not anytime soon.

505
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,440
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,410
I never wanted to hurt you.

507
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,220
Well,you finally got
aroundto it anyway,didn't you?

508
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,690
This is the... the moment,right?

509
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,480
The moment that I'm gonna regretfor
the rest of my life, isn't it?

510
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,460
Yes.

511
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,580
I loved you.

512
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,480
Bart allen - gone. He escaped.

513
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,300
A multimillion-dollarinstallation destroyed.

514
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,240
33.1 irrevocablycompromised.

515
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,160
But,son,at least you found out the jolly
green archerand his extraordinary cohorts -

516
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,530
they're not yourrun-of-the-mill adversaries.

517
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,550
Which is exactly whywe
have to continue with 33.1.

518
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,400
If terroristslike green arrow
are recruiting peoplewith abilities,

519
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,340
the only way to protect freedomand democracy
is to fight firewith fire.

520
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,550
Freedom and democracy?

521
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,750
Well,I hadn't realizedyour
goals were quite so lofty.

522
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,530
Well,there's a lotthat escapes your
attention in your declining years,dad,

523
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,260
but not mine.

524
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,730
The security footage
from the ridge facilitywas destroyed.

525
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,230
However,several guards
describeone of green arrow's men

526
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,140
as someone that
soundedremarkably like clark kent.

527
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,550
Clark. Impossible.

528
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,210
A word that always seems to popup
when talking about him, doesn't it?

529
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,810
Lex,it was not clark.

530
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,040
How can you be so sure?

531
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,580
Because I was having dinnerwith him
last night when all this happened.

532
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,610
Martha made pot roast with new
potatoesand tiny little baby carrots.

533
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,350
It was delicious.
Clark had three helpings.

534
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,730
Don't worry,son.

535
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,270
You still haveplenty of enemies out there
plotting your downfall.

536
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,100
Okay. Thanks.

537
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,480
So the daily planetis running with the story

538
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,440
that a gas explosion destroyedthe vacant
luthorcorp building down by the docks.

539
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,950
Vacant?

540
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,720
Looks like the luthor
cover-upmachine is in full swing.

541
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,060
Well,at leastwe got bart out
before lex ran himinto an early grave.

542
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,800
Come on. No worries. I
had plenty of juice left.

543
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,530
Could have fooled me,
the way you cleaned outmama kent's fridge.

544
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,570
That's 'cause I like to stayfueled up.

545
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,570
Just in case I need
to,uh,spring into action.

546
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,250
I still have a boyfriend.

547
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,610
Yeah. Well,a man can dream,can't he?

548
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,270
Now you knowwhy we call him impulse.

549
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,620
Impulse,cyborg,aquaman,green arrow.
What do you guys callyour team?

550
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,350
I don't know. I've been
thinkingthat we need something cool.

551
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,080
We need something like -like -

552
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,550
I was thinking about somethingwith
the word "justice" in it.

553
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,530
After all,that's what lexis
gonna get a big dose of.

554
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,310
Victor and A.C. Were able tohack into the
33.1 mainframe before we blewthe building.

555
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,740
That wasyour other mission.

556
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,320
Haven't met the computer
yetI couldn't crack wide open.

557
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,400
What did you guysfind out?

558
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,560
That lex isn't satisfied
playingin his own backyard anymore.

559
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,350
Luthorcorp is starting updivisions
of 33.1 all across the globe.

560
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,410
Wherever there's evidenceof
people with abilities,

561
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,880
there'll be laboratoriesto
do experiments on them.

562
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,760
We can't let that happen.

563
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,820
We won'T.

564
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:39,400
Gentlemen,our first target is a large
facilityon the island of corto maltese.

565
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,470
You guys know the drill.
Wheels up in 30 minutes. Get your gear.

566
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,720
You coming,amigo?

567
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,330
Yeah,you got to comewith us,man.

568
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,670
We could usethe big guns.

569
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,340
They're right,you know
- you'dbe a major asset to the team.

570
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,270
I want to be a part of
this,guys. I really do.

571
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,240
But...

572
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,540
that problem I told you
about -the one that I caused -

573
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,180
I have to take careof that first.

574
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,690
This isn't the endof the story,clark.

575
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,620
This is just the beginning.

576
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,560
Chloe.

577
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,730
Come on,boys.

578
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,140
Let's go save the world.

579
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,150
You know,you have some
prettyamazing friends,clark kent.

580
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,170
Yeah. I do.
