1
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:07,007
After a week of captivity
on the farm,

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,236
with nothing but "Project Runway"
and "Beauty And The Geek", for company,

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:11,916
you finally take me out...

4
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,462
- To the corn festival.
- Harvest festival.

5
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:16,462
Smallville's big event.
Just try to enjoy it.

6
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:18,167
Clark,
we're wasting our time.

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,830
My father sent me here
with one mission.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,552
I have to find that crystal
for my ship.

9
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,193
We have to find
that crystal.

10
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:25,950
I've been working on it.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,779
Well, I seriously doubt
it's buried under one of these bushels.

12
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:31,823
No offense, but I can cover
twice the area that you can.

13
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,575
Consider your wings clipped.
You're not flying.

14
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:38,100
The people who found your ship are gonna
be looking for the person who came in it

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,996
If you use your abilities,
it'll lead them straight to you.

16
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,106
You just have to fit in.

17
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,231
How do I fit in with him?

18
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:03,098
Jimmy?

19
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,180
Hey... cool down.

20
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:10,684
Used to happen to me
all the time.

21
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,955
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,211
ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joing us...

23
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:18,308
It's the harvest festival's
centennial anniversary.

24
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,823
There's a town legend that
a famous outlaw robbed a train

25
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:24,878
and buried the loot
somewhere in smallville.

26
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:27,598
The map to the gold is suposed to be
hidden inside the time capsule.

27
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:37,399
What I don't get is why everyone is so
excited to open up a bunch of old junk.

28
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,058
How did you...

29
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:23,532
Move.

30
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,009
Out of our way.

31
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:29,027
The new Miss sweet corn
has arrived.

32
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,489
Maybe fitting in
won't be so bad after all.

33
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:02,189

37
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:56,346
Hey, buddy.

38
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,789
Kara throw you
out of the house, too?

39
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,418
That's all right.
You can hang out here with me.

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Uh-oh, looks like
you found us.

41
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,642
Kara, i'm almost done here.

42
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:41,168
Would you grab me the phillips-hd
screwdriver over there in the toolbox?

43
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:49,811
Lana.

44
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,312
Sweetie, I'm done letting them
call the shots.

45
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,904
This time, it's my turn.

46
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:35,793
Just think, by the end
of the week, we'll be in cabo.

47
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,150
Just you and me,
and the money.

48
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,427
Lana,
I thought you were gone.

49
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,036
If you knew how that felt...

50
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,721
Clark, I am so sorry.

51
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,686
I never wanted to hurt you.

52
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:13,823
But you didn't trust me enough
to let me help.

53
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,565
I was trying to protect you.

54
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Clark, I know you.

55
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,101
You're gonna rush inhere
and try and save someone,

56
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,966
even if it means putting
your own life in danger.

57
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:29,658
And when lionel threatened
to hurt you...

58
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,957
I couldn't take
that chance.

59
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,389
It's a little ironic,
hearing someone else say that.

60
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:45,649
But I guess I'm just not used to being
the one that needs to be protected.

61
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,212
I can't wait to see the look on Chloe's
face when she finds out you're alive.

62
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,839
She can't.

63
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:00,907
Not yet.

64
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:04,796
I committed serious crime,

65
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:07,104
and I wasn't supposed
to come back here.

66
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:10,906
My name has to be cleared before
I suddenly reappear in Smallville.

67
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,068
Well, then, you'll stay here
at the farm with me.

68
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:19,506
You'll be safe.

69
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,823
But I have to warn you, my life
has become a little more...

70
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:35,901
complicated.

71
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:41,373
That might be
an understatement.

72
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,163
Lana,
this is my cousin, Kara.

73
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:47,038
Hi.

74
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,362
Say hello to the next
miss sweet corn.

75
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,419
Uh, listen, uh,

76
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,331
when I talked about fitting in,

77
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:01,378
I was thinking of something
with more clothes.

78
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,291
T- this is definitely
not blending in.

79
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,531
You meen undercover?

80
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,013
Yes, exactly.

81
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,037
And this is...

82
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:12,505
Not covered.

83
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,602
Um, look, can you just
go change, please?

84
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,422
Now.

85
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:22,141
Fine.

86
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:27,377
You said, "n."

87
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:31,536
I guess I don't have to ask which side
of the family you come from.

88
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,892
Why don't I leave you two alone?

89
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:38,927
Something tells me you've got
a lot of issues to talk about.

90
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:43,131
She's nice.

91
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,444
There might be hope for you.

92
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:47,489
Listen, Kara,
entering a beauty pageant,

93
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:49,589
putting yourself on stage
under a spot light...

94
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,055
It's not fitting in.

95
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,413
It's standing out.

96
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,078
Right.

97
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,943
Kind of like being the captain
of a football team.

98
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,535
Looks like you wanted
the same thing I want,

99
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,970
while you were living
the all-american dream,

100
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:14,025
I was stuck in some cryogenic coffin,

101
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,991
wasting the best years of my life.

102
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,998
I don't want to miss out
on anything else.

103
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,921
And if you're anything like me,

104
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,986
you're gonna do this
whether I want you to or not.

105
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,231
But not until you learn
to control your abilities.

106
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,363
Is this really necessary?

107
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:47,656
It's all about control,
which you don't have.

108
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,447
Me? Get back to me
when you can fly, eartboy.

109
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,077
Well, you're the one who almost
lit up the whole fair.

110
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:57,324
Has anyone ever told you
you're a little uptight?

111
00:09:57,968 --> 00:10:00,177
You definitely get that
from your father.

112
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:05,551
Listen, I've spent my entire life
trying to hide my identity.

113
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:08,351
I can't have you exposing us
both in a single night.

114
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,921
Watch and learn.

115
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,161
Now you try.

116
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:23,150
Let's see you put a mug
on this melon.

117
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,191
Please.
What am i, like, 5?

118
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:38,534
That's it!

119
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,750
You're not ready!

120
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:43,576
And out there on that stage, there're
too many things that can go wrong!

121
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,357
You want me to fit in?
No problem.

122
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,726
But I'll do it my way.

123
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:29,321
Uh... I need to talk to you.

124
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,336
Where's Karly?

125
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:37,145
See, that's what I need
to talk to you about.

126
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:42,191
There's been a problem,
but I took care of it.

127
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:51,489
Hi.

128
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,146
I was wondering...

129
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,668
Yours looks so good --

130
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,080
Amazing, really.

131
00:11:58,347 --> 00:11:59,963
Would you help me?

132
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,211
I'm sorry, sweetie,

133
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,914
but you need help
with more than just your makeup.

134
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,939
Why don't you go grow
some corn or something?

135
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,618
Must be a big relief,

136
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:20,365
being exonerated
of such a brutal murder.

137
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,390
Agent Carter, department
of domestic security.

138
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:32,541
My men have been
watching your team

139
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:36,239
comb through every waterlogged
farm shack after the flood,

140
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,539
ever since you found
the spaceship.

141
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,266
I had a feeling

142
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:44,234
the mystique of anonymity
wouldn't last long against a Luthor.

143
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,587
Against?

144
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:50,303
Throwing down the gauntlet
when we've barely been introduced?

145
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,903
Not a big fan of small talk.

146
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:59,253
I'm here about your latest obsession,
i'd like to show you this.

147
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,785
Understand that your men
have been passing these around town.

148
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:09,154
Now, why would the government
be interested?

149
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,122
Because you are.

150
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,990
Nice work, hotshot.

151
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:23,491
Although saving the polar bears
hataken on a whole new meaning.

152
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:27,000
I've seen enough speedos
and hay shoulders to last a lifetime.

153
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:29,652
Have I mentioned
i'm really glad you're back?

154
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,569
I'm not just back...

155
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,150
But bearing gifts.

156
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,631
Oh, my.

157
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:38,142
One of the Miss sweet corn contestants
was just iced like a popsicle.

158
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,594
Thanks, Jimmy,

159
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:44,009
but I can't exactly run out to
Smallville for frozen sweet corn.

160
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,939
I've got stories I've got to file.

161
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,006
What's gotten into you?

162
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,985
Chloe, someone set this girl's
dial to deep-freeze.

163
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:54,642
This has "meteor freak"
written all over it.

164
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,052
It's exactly the kind of story
that your new editor ordered.

165
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,268
Yeah, I'm just not sure
a judas priest reunion

166
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,101
at madison square garden counts
tord per diem, "L."

167
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:07,542
"L"?

168
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:09,224
Okay, okay.

169
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,320
Lane, d-don't take it out
on my eardrum.

170
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,432
E-mail me your story, and we'll talk
about Rwanda when you get back.

171
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,571
Frosted beauty queen!

172
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,784
Not bad, Sullivan.

173
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,525
- Actually, it's not --
- I knew if I light a fire under you,

174
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,915
you'd stop boring me
with city-council proposals,

175
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:27,458
and bring something
headline-worthy.

176
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,452
Mr. Gabriel,
Jimmy Olsen.

177
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:30,869
Right.

178
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,309
Panda boy. Good.

179
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,608
Polar bear, actually.

180
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,118
Listen, Chloester,

181
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,843
hustle down to Smallville.
Take panda boy with you.

182
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:41,923
Get the scoop on our ice princess
before any of the other papers,

183
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,438
and you might just get to follow
in your cousin footsteps.

184
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:51,246
How much blunt trauma do you think a
stapler to the back of the head would cause?

185
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,326
Show him what you got,
Chloester.

186
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,550
Look, you're busting your butt
on stories of substance

187
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,088
while lois is on assignment
in new york, grabbing all the glory.

188
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:05,013
Are you really gonna let your cousin
beat you out of the basement?

189
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,033
Remind me to thank my mom.

190
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,055
Before Kara,

191
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:26,253
I had no idea what she and my dad
went through.

192
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,865
You turned out well.

193
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,849
Clark, don't you think you're
being a little hard on Kara?

194
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,780
Lana, I'm trying to help her.

195
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,485
Kara didn't grow up here.

196
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:41,855
She has no idea what could happen
if someone started using her abilities.

197
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,150
And right now, she's about a fireball
away from lighting up the whole town.

198
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,013
This is how you've had to live
your whole life, isn't it?

199
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,465
Hiding?

200
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,897
No, adjusting.

201
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:55,113
And sooner or later, Kara's got to
figure out how to do the same thing.

202
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,492
Clark, your parents trusted you enough
to live your life,

203
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,611
and find that balance on your own,

204
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:05,399
don't you think kara
deserves the same chance?

205
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:09,944
You don't have to be
too hard on yourself.

206
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,365
Something tells me that
you are never going to understand

207
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:19,365
the heart of a teenage girl, whether
she's from Krypton or Kansas.

208
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:25,220
All the conversations I imagined
having with you about my powers...

209
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,700
This was not one of them.

210
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:33,680
I can't believe I ever worried
that you wouldn't understand.

211
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,069
Looks like you don't know me
as well as you thought you did.

212
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,116
Five, six, seven, eight...

213
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:56,620
Okay, girls, take five minute break
and we'll pick it up from the top.

214
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,881
How can I help you, sheriff?

215
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,987
I need to speak with you about
the girl we found in the alley.

216
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:21,662
All I know is she and two other girls
entered at the last minute.

217
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,278
I really don't have any
more information about her.

218
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,039
Are you sure no one saw you?

219
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,405
What you did to karly?

220
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:31,782
She wanted out.

221
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,360
What else was I supposed to do?

222
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,320
Maybe we should just hit
the time capsule and go home.

223
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,685
Don't be an idiot.

224
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,077
We need this pageant.

225
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:39,685
It's the perfect distraction.

226
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,371
Just stick to the plan.

227
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:49,548
Do your thing.

228
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,556
Hey, Chloe, where are you?
Thought you were gonna meet me.

229
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:03,105
I've got a major lead on our ice queen.

230
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,182
Lana...

231
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,357
I got your message.

232
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:15,469
I guess it would have been a little
awkward for you to come to the mansion.

233
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,525
Don't sit down.

234
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,262
You won't be staying long.

235
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:24,078
I understand.

236
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:28,107
This isn't a conversation
I've been looking forward having.

237
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:32,256
I guess I just wasn't ready.

238
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,907
You promised you'd take care
of everything,

239
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,925
that I could come back to Smallville.

240
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:43,379
Well, with a little persuasion,
the, uh...

241
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:46,521
The D.A. has agreed
to not press charges.

242
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,821
The evidence has been destroyed,

243
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,937
and the felon my father
bribed to confess to the crime

244
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:54,016
died in prison of natural causes.

245
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,784
You're a free woman.

246
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:07,150
I don't suppose I can ask you...

247
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:12,575
to somehow see that every
horrible thing I did...

248
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:16,930
was because I truly do love you.

249
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:20,498
No.

250
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:22,735
You can't ask that.

251
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,185
Of course.

252
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:33,034
My lawyer is drang up
the settlement agreement.

253
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,578
I don't want your money.

254
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,275
Should I assume that excludes
the $10 million

255
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,816
you skillfully siphoned out
from under me?

256
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,166
I was trying to escape.

257
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,167
I'm not admonishing you.
I'm applauding you.

258
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:52,908
It's not every day someone is clever
enough to manage a coup like that.

259
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:57,089
Although I'm not sure
Clark would see it that way.

260
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:09,411
I understand he has a cousin visiting.

261
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:17,762
From Minnesota.

262
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,649
I look forward to meeting her.

263
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:52,143
Hey, thank you so much
for calling us.

264
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:53,313
No problem.

265
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,625
I saw the door you ripped off.
Was anyone there?

266
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:59,831
You mean, did I screw up
like you keep expecting me to?

267
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:03,996
I'm sorry if I was a little busy
trying to save Jimmy's life.

268
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,449
I thought you'd be proud of me.

269
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,322
Kara, I --

270
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,574
I'm gonna have to weigh in
on her side on this one.

271
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,355
Doctors said that Jimmy's suffering
from hypothermia, but he'll be fine.

272
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:18,772
I know.

273
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:21,507
I just want to make sure
the sun is shining when he is.

274
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,145
Meet the weather girls.

275
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:25,531
I did a little bit of digging,

276
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:28,299
and it looks like they've been bffs
since before kindergarn.

277
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,065
According to that,
they were all caught

278
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,089
in some freak storm
during the last meteor shor.

279
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:33,721
Is it possible that
they all have powers?

280
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:36,810
It would explain what is the cause,
but I don't get it.

281
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,581
If they're so inseparable,
why turn on each other over a --

282
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:39,524
A tiara?

283
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,177
Clark, I don't think
they're competing for the crown.

284
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,002
Our meteorological misfits have
traversed the entire midwest.

285
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:48,271
mud wrestling championship.

286
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,939
Ring girls at a casino prize fight.

287
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:54,512
And my personal favorite,
oktoberfest maidkins.

288
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:56,369
That's the girl
that was put on ice.

289
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,720
And every time, there's a major
heist in the city.

290
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:01,802
They're thieves?

291
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,562
It's twistedly brilliant.

292
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,305
They're after the map.

293
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,995
And the treasure, which is
supposedly millions in gold bars.

294
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,582
And given the rate
of inflation,

295
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,733
we're talkinthe mother lode
of all buried booty.

296
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,733
More than enough to kill
your best friend over.

297
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,643
And anyone else.

298
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,173
Don't tell me u're leaving?

299
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,030
I thought I need more help
than just my makeup.

300
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,988
Maybe my cousin is right.

301
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,250
I don't belong here.

302
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:59,176
I'm sorry I waharsh on you, but that
was before I knew you were special.

303
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:01,322
I saw you, Kara.

304
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:03,388
You're a very talented girl.

305
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:06,477
No, I'm just like everyone else.

306
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,937
No. You're not.

307
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:13,032
You have powers
just like us.

308
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:15,379
You guys--

309
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,289
How?

310
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:22,231
Let's just say we were in the
right place at the right time

311
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,138
dung the last meteor shower.

312
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:30,393
But the important thing is,
you're not alone, Kara, and we need you.

313
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:32,696
We're going on a...

314
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,658
Treasure hunt,
to find the time capsule.

315
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,970
But we can't do it
without you.

316
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:40,822
Here's a photo of the gold
before it was stolen.

317
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,183
It's more than enough to buy

318
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:46,503
a new prada bag every season
for the rest of our lives.

319
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:51,003
All we need to do
is get that map.

320
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,079
Count me in.

321
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:21,253
Little Miss sunshine double-crossed us.

322
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:12,794
Thank you, ladies.

323
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,562
That was lovely, huh?

324
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:15,716
And in just a moment,

325
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:18,414
I will announce Smallville's
new miss sweet corn.

326
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:24,161
I've been looking for her
because I believe she saved me.

327
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,983
Not just from the river.

328
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,715
I'm talking about much more
than that, Carter.

329
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:36,065
She saved me from drowning
in the evil of my ways.

330
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:39,653
Oh, an angel?

331
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:45,059
No mortal woman pulled me
from that river.

332
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:48,046
She doesn't exist...

333
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,250
so you can stop looking for her.

334
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,916
Perhaps I can help you refocus
on your real target.

335
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,130
The spaceship you found...

336
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,640
wasn't the first to land in Smallville.

337
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,905
My work at the dam...

338
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:09,871
3 years of research,

339
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,599
300 gigabytes...

340
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:15,984
All attempt to prevent
what I believe is coming,

341
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:18,376
what a fear is inevitable.

342
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,092
If your research is so inflammatory,
why incriminate yourself?

343
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,508
Well, given the magnitude
of the project, I --

344
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,534
I think it's time to reach out
to the government for help.

345
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,030
I mean, we are on the same side,
aren't we?

346
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:46,938
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

347
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,450
the moment you've
all been waiting for,

348
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:52,320
Smallville's new miss sweet corn...

349
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:55,451
Kara Kent.

350
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:12,692
Thank you so much.

351
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,344
You've made a newcomer feel
so welcome.

352
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,490
Hold on.

353
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,954
Please, everybody,
stay seated.

354
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,908
I'm gonna have to ask you
to come with me, miss.

355
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,352
What's happening?

356
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:27,237
Your friends
tipped us off.

357
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:32,498
Kara Kent, you're under arrest.

358
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,345
Haven't you learned anything?

359
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:47,350
Breaking into the time capsule,
what were you thinking?

360
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:50,420
I was thinking I had to
get to that map before anyone else did.

361
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,657
You shouldn't have stolen
the map at all.

362
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,210
Even if the treasure it leads to
is kryptonian?

363
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,166
Then why wouldn't you tell me?

364
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,183
Where do you
want me to start?

365
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:08,350
Your patronizing watermelon tutorials,
your reprimands,

366
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:11,584
or your general interest in
everything I've done since I showed up?

367
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:13,027
Where is it?

368
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:14,555
I'll show you.

369
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:18,603
You're gonna stay here until
Chloe can get you out legally.

370
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,657
- Just give me the map.
- I can't.

371
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,108
Why not?

372
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,658
When the sheriff dragged me away,

373
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,942
there was some freak gust
of wind and blew it away.

374
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,249
Okay, it's all right.
It's all right.

375
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:28,524
Sounds like one of the weather girls.

376
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:32,078
Look, just tell us
what you saw on the map.

377
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:35,287
Keep digging.
It should be there.

378
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:40,551
There's no way
there's gold in here.

379
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,218
Maybe it's diamonds.

380
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:48,875
Well, there'd better be
something good in this box.

381
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:54,221
That's it?

382
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,831
That doesn't belong to you.

383
00:30:58,187 --> 00:30:59,609
It does now.

384
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,448
You're not as tough as you talk.

385
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:22,421
But I am.

386
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:43,145
Kara, be careful.

387
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,969
These rocks can kill you.

388
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,240
Clark, I'm so sorry
I didn't listen to you.

389
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:04,623
For once I'm not.

390
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,299
You saved me.

391
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:11,363
And even though it's not the way
I would have done it,

392
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:15,193
I know that you need to figure out
how to use your abilities your own way.

393
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,889
Does that mean you're gonna stop
trying to tell me what to do?

394
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:21,078
Probably not.

395
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:24,365
Isn't that what family's for?

396
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:34,930
This can't be from your ship.

397
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,564
It was buried over 100 years ago.

398
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:40,429
And I don't recognize this symbol.
I think it's a code.

399
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:45,769
It's some kind of S.O.S.

400
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:47,800
From who?

401
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:49,935
I don't know.

402
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:54,477
But if this is still on Earth,
so is the kryptonian that left it.

403
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,415
Exactly how many of us
have been here on this planet?

404
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:08,351
I'm starting to think that Earth might
play a bigger role in our fathers' plans

405
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:10,116
than we realised.

406
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:13,403
For now, all we can do is try
to figure out who left this.

407
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,237
In the meantime...

408
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:17,650
I'll be fitting in.

409
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,161
And this doesn't say
"Smallville,"

410
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:24,501
I don't know what does.

411
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,365
It is a big demotion, though,
from Miss sweet corn to coffee jockey.

412
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,151
Well, you'll adjust.

413
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:33,909
Just don't expect me to keep
looking over my shoulder,

414
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,095
living this life of suffocating
repression just because you do.

415
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,145
"Suffocating repression,"
huh?

416
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:40,529
Hey, it's your language.

417
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,959
I just studied it.

418
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:43,330
Our anguage.

419
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,431
You're one of us now.

420
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:48,611
"Us"?

421
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:50,274
Kal-El...

422
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,013
Clark...

423
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:56,277
You're not human,

424
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:57,337
no matter how much
you want to be.

425
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,688
We can harvest-corn
and we can pump mochas all we want,

426
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:04,187
but it's not gonna
make us one of them.

427
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:08,142
I may have been born on another planet,
Kara, but Earth is my home.

428
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:11,744
Everyone I love,
everyone I care about is here.

429
00:34:12,226 --> 00:34:13,595
It's where I belong.

430
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:16,404
What about in 50 years?

431
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:21,227
Look, we both know what's gonna happen
to everyone that you love.

432
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:25,140
I'm sorry, but if you think
you can just spend your life

433
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,677
hiding here on the farm
and growing old with Lana...

434
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,288
You're fooling yourself.

435
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:06,373
What do you have for me?

436
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,200
We found her...

437
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,737
Just where you said
she would be.

438
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:21,688
Congratulations.

439
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,345
You just delivered
a front-page freak story.

440
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:26,053
I'm just glad you're finally
out of the frozen-food section.

441
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,748
You know, when we first
got together,

442
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:35,253
I thought that you were
pretty prejudiced...

443
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,036
Quick to jump to the conclusion
that some meteor-infected murder

444
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,475
was behind every bad thing
that happened in Smallville.

445
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:44,999
Jimmy...

446
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:47,004
But you were right.

447
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:52,741
I've seen enough now to know
that sooner or later they all...snap.

448
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,585
So, from now on,
it's open season on the infected.

449
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:01,132
What do you say we clean up
this town, partner?

450
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,359
Sorry. I just came back for my bag.

451
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:20,908
Why don't we go upstairs?

452
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:23,300
Okay.

453
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:36,322
You have no idea how good
it feels to be back here,

454
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,109
despite everything
that's happened lately.

455
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,752
"Everything" meaning, Kara?

456
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:45,930
Meeting your cousin has definitely
been an experience, but,

457
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,518
I was talking more
out what's going on with us.

458
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,583
Clark, I was afraid that you
wouldn't forgive me for marrying Lex...

459
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:54,974
Or for leaving.

460
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:59,132
Lana, nothing could ever change
the way I feel about you.

461
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:05,095
- I've made so many mistakes.
- We've both made mistakes.

462
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,685
This is our chance to start over.

463
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,069
I just hope you know
what you're getting into.

464
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,619
I know exactly
what I'm getting into.

465
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,276
Clark, I came back here for you...

466
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,079
For us.

467
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,780
I never want to let the past
come between us again.

468
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:37,727
I want us to wake up every morning
and be there for each other.

469
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,423
I want to grow old together.

470
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:02,488
Tell me it's not too late
for a cappuccino.

471
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,456
Um, sorry.
We're closed.

472
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:09,605
Even for the owner?

473
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:14,754
Technically,
I don't even work here yet...

474
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,583
At least not until tomorrow.

475
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,389
I just came down to pick up
the bag that I left.

476
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:23,205
I want to thank you
for saving my life.

477
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:28,208
I know it was you,
at the river.

478
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:31,468
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

479
00:38:31,468 --> 00:38:33,787
You ripped the roof off my car.

480
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,885
You must have been
through a terrible ordeal.

481
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,050
You were there.

482
00:38:45,254 --> 00:38:46,361
It's okay.

483
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:49,894
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

484
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,505
Your secret's safe with me.

485
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,177
I've already protected you,

486
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:00,829
like I would have protected others close
to me if they'd have told me the truth.

487
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,362
This time, I'm hoping
to change all that.

488
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:07,606
I just need you
to be honest with me.

489
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,401
Look, I'm sorry,
Mr. Luthor.

490
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:16,086
The onlyecret I've got is
that I make a lousy cappuccino.

491
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,799
It's probably not the best thing
to confess to your boss, huh?

492
00:39:20,644 --> 00:39:23,514
Twice I've been pulled back
from the brink of death,

493
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:27,577
and both times it was
by a member of the Kent family.

494
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,308
I'm not a man who believes in
coincidences.

495
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,248
Sooner or later,
i'll find out the truth.

496
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:45,449
Are you a savior?

497
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:48,943
Or are you a warning?
