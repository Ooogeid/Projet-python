1
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:08,758
Sorry about he heels.
I need the inches.

2
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:18,717
- I'm not sure this is such a good idea.
- Either R.A.O. Incorporated

3
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:22,157
is throwing a Valentine's Day party
for their workers behind this wall

4
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:26,286
or they are running double shifts on a
Saturday night a total union violation.

5
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:30,786
Lois, I'm sure someone is keeping an eye
on this situation.

6
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,177
Bingo.

7
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:46,435
They are moving more tech equipment
into that building than NASA.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,839
And if they're skulking around
in the middle of the night,

9
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:51,457
they are definitely
hiding something.

10
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:02,732
Nice teddy. Next time, buy her
a silk one. She's not 6 years old.

11
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:05,241
I think we should drop this story.

12
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,203
You sound like you want it all
to yourself. Is there something

13
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:11,681
about that tower that you're not
telling me?

14
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,753
No. It's Valentine's day.

15
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:19,490
We should be out having dinner
together, by candlelight.

16
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,460
Valentine's day is just
a smarmy Hallmark holiday

17
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:24,396
engineered by corporate executives

18
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:26,866
to convince people
to spend hard-earned money

19
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:29,093
on dead flowers
and overpriced meals...

20
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:33,298
but not you two.

21
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:39,249
You're kind
of overreacting, even for you.

22
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:43,087
History has proven
that if I embrace V-day

23
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:47,216
in any romantic way at all,
it always ends in disaster.

24
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,824
Valentine for the lady?

25
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:54,291
- No, thank you. She doesn't really...
- Actually.

26
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,093
What?
I didn't have any dinner.

27
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:01,398
Happy Valentine's day.

28
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:19,831
Easy with the pixie dust there,
Tinker Bell.

29
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,624
Looks like it's too late
to follow that story anyway.

30
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,753
It's never too early for nachos and
too late for hard-hitting journalism.

31
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,480
Maybe we should put our relationship
before our work, just for tonight and...

32
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,770
Hold hands? You could come a-courtin'
on your horse and buggy.

33
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,985
All we need is a chaperone.
Sounds mighty traditional.

34
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,631
And what's wrong with that?

35
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:49,760
With all of our crossed text messages
lately, I thought maybe sometimes...

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,297
I want...

37
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:57,624
us to have a more
traditional relationship.

38
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:10,280
The R.A.O. has scheduled
a ribbon-cutting

39
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:14,150
at the solar tower in two days.
I'm gonna need the exposé now.

40
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:16,086
Two days.

41
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,721
Maybe I should check on those building
permits that you were talking about.

42
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:23,850
You wanted to avoid the whole
Valentine's-day-thing thing, right?

43
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,654
Anything for your career, sweetie.

44
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,800
Here's the scoop, buddy.

45
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:43,279
A traditional woman does not
spend her time in the office

46
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:46,673
when she can be at home
taking care of her man.

47
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,577
I quit.

48
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,978
Smallville 9x13 Persuasion

49
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,617
Synchro: Flolo

50
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:40,404
For Seriesssub.com

51
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,123
I was gonna ask you for the lowdown
on your v-day with Lois

52
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:57,630
but something about you being here with
me tells me it didn't go over so well.

53
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,737
Do you have the passports
and I.D. cards ready?

54
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:05,007
Or we could get right down
to business.

55
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,032
All the materials
you would ever need to escape

56
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:11,256
- your life and start a new one.
- Thanks, Chloe. You're a life-saver.

57
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:14,023
If by that you mean sweet on the outside
and empty in the middle,

58
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,719
that's pretty much exactly
how I feel right now.

59
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:19,443
I realize you're not on board
with me helping the Kandorians.

60
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:22,791
Yeah, you know how it is.

61
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,226
You find out that one of them
skewers you to death

62
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,962
in the post-apocalyptic future,
you kind of lose interest.

63
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,995
I know it seems like I may have
overlooked some of their mistakes.

64
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,823
By "mistakes" do you mean them building
a tower so they can give themselves

65
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:38,097
- powers to take over the world?
- I want to lead them to a better place.

66
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,696
The tower will be
completed in two days.

67
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:44,108
Granted, they haven't got
the satellites up and running

68
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,309
to change the atmosphere,
but come on.

69
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:50,411
We both know
one of them killed your father.

70
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:54,540
Maybe it would just be safer if we sent
the Kandorians to the Phantom Zone.

71
00:05:56,925 --> 00:06:00,585
I know that you're saying
that because you want to protect people

72
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,711
but right now, I want you
to focus on watching my back.

73
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,637
Leave the rest of The Planet to me.

74
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,240
I will protect you...

75
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:20,562
no matter what it takes.

76
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,724
Faora. Alia.

77
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,616
I have the papers.

78
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:38,745
It's your new life. You'll have
your own identities.

79
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,800
I misjudged you, Kal-El.

80
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:02,215
I was born into the military.

81
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,712
I never had a choice
to live as a civilian.

82
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:09,116
We can't repay you.

83
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:12,985
Tell me who killed my father.

84
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,301
I know that Zod took him from Tess.

85
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,886
And was he the last one
to see Jor-El alive?

86
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,945
I know you want justice,
but be careful.

87
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,779
Zod has a lot of loyal followers
and if you go after him,

88
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:31,007
there will be war.

89
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:05,050
Hey, sweetie pie! Welcome home.

90
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,414
Lois, what's going on?

91
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,189
I moved in.

92
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:13,756
But don't worry, I'm camped out
into the guest room until

93
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,185
we get engaged.

94
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:19,824
Engaged?

95
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:35,680
Move over, Betty Crocker. I have got
this cooking thing down.

96
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,974
How's your pot roast?

97
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,974
Oh, it's delicious.

98
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:46,788
Wonderful.

99
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,781
It was really sweet of you
to do all of this.

100
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:53,226
I am just so proud of you
for bringing home

101
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:56,575
the bacon. The least I can do
is cook it up in a pan.

102
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:00,488
And, well...

103
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:04,993
never let you forget
that you're the man.

104
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,623
Lois, did something happen?

105
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,642
You just seem so cheerful.

106
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,098
You said you wanted
a more traditional relationship,

107
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,227
And you were very persuasive.

108
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,708
What if I miss the old Lois?

109
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,287
Too late.

110
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:30,356
<i>I quit my job at The Planet.</i>

111
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,792
- You did what?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,921
Now, instead of being chained
to a desk all day,

113
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:41,079
I get to be your ball and chain.

114
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,468
You can't quit reporting.
That job is your life.

115
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:49,472
And now my life is with you,

116
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:53,242
for better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer.

117
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,032
Lois, what are you talking about?

118
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,346
You're absolutely right.

119
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,782
What kind of adjective is "poorer"?

120
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,210
Somebody is gonna need an editor...

121
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,866
for their vows.

122
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:13,392
Right. There's something at the

123
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:16,818
office that I need to...
investigate.

124
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,663
All right, Mr. Cold Feet.
I'll keep the home fires burning.

125
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,981
Rain check on talking
about the big event for now.

126
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,360
You better make an honest woman
out of me, Clark Kent.

127
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,755
Security!

128
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,282
I'm afraid
they're otherwise engaged.

129
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,887
Ah... no.

130
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:03,076
I like you just where you are.

131
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:07,029
Then maybe you'd like to join me.

132
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,510
You're already in bed
with someone else.

133
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,891
Wrong choice of bedfellows.

134
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:26,049
I'm moments away
from completing my tower.

135
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:29,228
I thought you needed
the Book of RAU to finish it.

136
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:33,066
We found another way. And it seems
your satellite systems

137
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:35,883
are lagging behind schedule.

138
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:38,530
We're onlining the safety tests now.

139
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:42,583
- I'll handle that, thank you.
- Only I can run them.

140
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,944
Now that I've got your fingerprints,

141
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:49,331
I can access all of
the networking data without you.

142
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,168
Cheers.

143
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,569
You're digging your own grave.

144
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:04,631
Then, you better make sure there's
room in there for both of us.

145
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,458
You neglected to tell me

146
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:13,976
that Kal-El was supplying
new identities to my people.

147
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,529
They're no more your people
than they are his.

148
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:38,000
And eventually,
he will be their leader.

149
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,428
Now, don't underestimate
their loyalty to me.

150
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,397
But they don't see you
as the savior that he is.

151
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:54,270
There's blood on your hands. You're
tainted, a reminder of their past.

152
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:57,069
He's the promise for their future.

153
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,535
It's what you've always wanted,
isn't it...

154
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:06,075
Help give my people their powers
so they can save your doomed planet?

155
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,113
Hand over the reins
to Kal-El and then what?

156
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,460
Get rid of me?

157
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,252
If necessary.

158
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,631
We need the knowledge of your people

159
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:24,133
to help us reverse the damage
we've done here,

160
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:26,935
to show mercy to this planet.

161
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,231
When I take over
those satellites tomorrow,

162
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:40,435
and when I gain my own powers...

163
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:46,507
you will be the one who needs mercy.

164
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:11,842
It is amazing what four hours
of scrubbing a kitchen can do.

165
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,323
- It simply sparkles.
- Okay. Let's open a window.

166
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:20,827
I think you may have gotten a contact
high with that lemony-fresh scent.

167
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:23,528
And why is
your vinyl collection here?

168
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,355
Drum roll, please.

169
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,847
Chez Kent has a new resident.

170
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,650
I moved in!

171
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,208
Great. We can have you move back
to the Talon

172
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,376
and all packed up
before the sun's up.

173
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:41,759
I'm sorry that you're
having a hard time with this

174
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:44,049
but this love train
has left the station.

175
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:46,096
No, the love train
has jumped the tracks.

176
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:49,019
I've seen Clark in love before,
and it always holds him back.

177
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:50,824
You know what?

178
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,169
It's a little sad that the only
way that you can get close to Clark

179
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:58,298
- right now is to play mother hen.
- Clark is a very private person,

180
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:01,509
when the chips are down,
everyone can see your cards.

181
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,861
Clark knows that he can trust me.

182
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,078
Just like The Blur?
When you were secretly talking to him

183
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:12,683
and you announced it to everyone
on national television?

184
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:18,583
I never planned for it
to happen that way.

185
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,021
You know what?
As long as I've known you

186
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,890
you have always had to have the scoop
but when it comes to understanding

187
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:27,606
the real Clark, you are always gonna be
a second-stringer.

188
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:42,325
This whole Martha Stewart-makeover
thing isn't fooling anyone.

189
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:46,897
Once Clark knows you, the real you
underneath all of this Lois armor,

190
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,636
he's gonna see that
you're just a scared little kid

191
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:53,761
who runs away
the second anything goes wrong.

192
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,830
If you really love him,

193
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:00,905
the best thing you can do
for Clark is leave him.

194
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,999
Excuse me.

195
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:29,102
You sold my friend and I some
candies the other night.

196
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:31,879
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

197
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,381
You were with the bitter chick.

198
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:38,391
Right. The bitter chick isn't feeling
so good. She kind of got sick.

199
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,820
I'm retracing her steps.

200
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:43,302
Was there anything
in that chocolate you sold her?

201
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:45,075
Yeah. Fat.

202
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,716
I ate two boxes
and gained three pounds.

203
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,986
Thanks.

204
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:02,562
Fairy dust.
That was cute. Where'd you get it?

205
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,442
Yeah, i don't know what it is,

206
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,402
but it comes from some quarry
in Smallville.

207
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,404
Meteor rock.

208
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,278
Is that your girlfriend?

209
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,667
No, she's not my...

210
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:27,820
we don't use that word.

211
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,930
Are you all right?
What's the emergency?

212
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,507
False alarm.

213
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:55,420
Are you sure?
'cause you seem kind of...

214
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,870
kind of pathetic. Right?

215
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:05,529
Why even bother going
through the motions?

216
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:08,399
This whole moving-in thing
together was a joke.

217
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:12,528
- You're not yourself right now.
- Come on! I'm not stupid.

218
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:16,396
I could tell that you just hated
that burned brick of meat!

219
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,608
Let's get you some water.

220
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,860
Stop trying to sugarcoat it.

221
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:26,080
I am not good for you.

222
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,132
Chloe was right
to protect you from me.

223
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:32,085
Chloe can be
overprotective sometimes.

224
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,310
No.

225
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,090
She hit the target head-on.

226
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:42,659
She said that it was gonna
wreck us, and she's right.

227
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,896
Clark, I don't...

228
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:48,465
I don't know the first thing about

229
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,547
family time
or dinners at home. I don't.

230
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:56,384
Lois, I'm glad
that you're opening up to me,

231
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,344
but there's something else
going on here.

232
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:04,042
You're right.

233
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,935
Something is going on.

234
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,906
I've made a fool of myself
long enough.

235
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:19,036
It hurts me to be around you.

236
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:25,015
I have to leave you, Clark.
Leave Smallville.

237
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:31,664
Lois, you need to sleep on this.

238
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,557
I promise things
will look better in the morning.

239
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:40,050
No, they won't. I'm a big girl.

240
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,640
I can pull myself up by my own
bootstraps, thank you very much.

241
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,507
I had hoped that somehow I'd be able
to pull it off,

242
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,843
The whole making-a-home thing.

243
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,935
Stop.
You are home.

244
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,143
No.

245
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:00,386
A home is for real.

246
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:04,012
For always and forever.

247
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,782
Not this.

248
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:09,916
Goodbye, Smallville.

249
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,521
Lois, you can't leave.
Not yet.

250
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:19,019
I promise we'll be together,

251
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:22,429
- always and...
- forever?

252
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,474
Do you mean it?

253
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,604
I do.

254
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,370
Guess we can move my stuff
out of the guest room now.

255
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,440
It's good you're here. For some reason,
Chloe has shut me out

256
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,742
of all of Watchtower's systems.
Everything's encrypted.

257
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:12,945
I'm sorry to hear that,
Emil But I have my own fires to put out.

258
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,747
- Do you know where Chloe is?
- She's gone.

259
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:18,703
She's activated laser trip wires
around the system core.

260
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:22,319
There's firewalls around
firewalls around firewalls.

261
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:25,789
I can't get into it.
I've tried every iteration.

262
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:29,746
Emil, look, I want you to calm down.
Just try to relax for once.

263
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:52,844
Whatevs.

264
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:56,371
This place goes nuclear,
it is not my problem.

265
00:21:57,573 --> 00:22:00,150
I want you to go back
to the way you were.

266
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,810
There are no backsies
in this lifetime.

267
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:05,681
Where are you going?

268
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:08,390
I need a brew.
This job's way too stressful.

269
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:12,519
I need to figure out a way to reverse this.
I breathed in some sort of new meteor rock.

270
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:17,884
Dude, hasn't anyone
ever told you not to inhale?

271
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,766
This is serious.

272
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:22,235
It's like you and Lois
are doing whatever I say but then

273
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,364
I can't un-do it. Normally Kryptonite
only affects me, not other people.

274
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,947
Sounds kind of like hypnosis
to me. People are pathetic.

275
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:34,168
They're open to suggestion.

276
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:37,437
I bet it's great with the ladies.

277
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:41,207
How do I stop putting people
into hypnotic trances?

278
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,785
Well, maybe...

279
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,189
you don't need to stop.

280
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:51,115
Maybe you just need to chill.

281
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:55,385
Use it or lose it, Kent. Come on!

282
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,788
There's got to be something
out there that you're after.

283
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,020
There is no luck.

284
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,672
Oh, Mrs. K., can I really?

285
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:22,986
Thanks so much!

286
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,627
But actually,
I'm wearing it right now!

287
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,388
I found it
in the back of your closet.

288
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:33,983
I know. Clark will just love it.

289
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,283
Thanks...

290
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:40,301
Mom.

291
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,667
Okay, I have breaking news.

292
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:57,660
Brace yourself.
I am getting married!

293
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:10,855
Come on, dad. Can't we just
hitch a carrier to Greece?

294
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,481
I'm only getting married once.

295
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:29,559
We need to talk.

296
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:35,423
Why would I make time for you?

297
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:38,312
You're trying to isolate me
from my people.

298
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:41,371
You lost your right to lead
when you killed my father.

299
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,619
He was a brother to me.

300
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:55,313
We had our differences,
but I could never take his life.

301
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:05,828
I want you to tell me the truth.

302
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:08,828
Did you kill Jor-El?

303
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:21,871
I didn't kill him.

304
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:25,207
But I know who did.

305
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,049
Tess Mercer.

306
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:33,126
How is that possible?

307
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:37,159
She obviously had her own agenda and
was the only one who knew where he was.

308
00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:39,938
She was the only one
who could finish the job.

309
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:44,459
You are his firstborn.

310
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,341
Only you can seek retribution.

311
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:53,866
- I'm not gonna kill Tess.
- It's the Kryptonian way.

312
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,887
You cannot let this injustice stand.

313
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,020
Kal-El.

314
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:11,241
You knew when you started on this path
that you had to get your hands dirty.

315
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,667
You must avenge him.

316
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,831
I can't.

317
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:36,788
I tortured him.

318
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,625
I beat him black and blue.

319
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:44,906
I threatened him, and he still
wouldn't give you up.

320
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:51,722
You were the son he never met,

321
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:54,832
he was still willing
to sacrifice his life for yours.

322
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:58,865
He died protecting you,
you won't even defend his honor.

323
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,315
You don't think I want justice?
You don't think I want revenge?

324
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,125
You don't think sometimes
I want to be a killer like you?

325
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:35,281
I can't believe
he piggybacks my cameras.

326
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:40,852
And I can't believe
you actually managed to be of some use.

327
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:44,065
Go ahead.

328
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,660
Hack yourself silly. You'll never crack
my system.

329
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:51,298
This isn't so much cracking
as it is bleeding out.

330
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,998
This is the digital equivalent
to the ebola virus.

331
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:01,489
You take down my firewalls,
and you'll be exposing Clark

332
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:04,407
to much greater dangers
than you can even imagine.

333
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,113
I've done everything in my power
to postpone this,

334
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:12,700
but the day has finally come.

335
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,506
The tower is ready. It's linked up
to the satellites.

336
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:19,763
The countdown has started,
and in t-minus 18 hours,

337
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,994
the atmosphere will turn red

338
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,179
and the Kandorians
will have their powers.

339
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:30,260
But I have lost my faith in Zod.

340
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,910
If Clark joins them,

341
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,937
he can rule over all the Kandorians,

342
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:38,993
even Zod.

343
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,264
But you and I have to work together.

344
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,376
It's quite the offer.

345
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:54,180
Let me think about it.

346
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,586
I'm sorry,

347
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,878
but embracing the red skies
definitely violates

348
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:07,286
my no-conspiring-with-baddies
policy.

349
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:54,004
Should have aimed a little higher.

350
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:11,016
My father was murdered,
and I'm here to collect.

351
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:12,992
Collect on what?

352
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:15,677
Justice, vengeance.

353
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,424
It just depends
whose side you're on.

354
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,850
You confided in me, Clark.

355
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:40,975
You revealed your powers.

356
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:43,715
You know I haven't
told anyone your secret.

357
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,049
Only to sell me out to Zod
and the others.

358
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,850
No.

359
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:53,934
So that you could lead them.

360
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:56,448
You've seen the future, Tess.

361
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:57,938
You know what happens.

362
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,896
Which is why you have to join
the Kandorians

363
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,448
and defeat Zod so he doesn't
take your powers away.

364
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,639
He doesn't take them, Tess.

365
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:11,907
Your tower does when it goes online.

366
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,739
No, the satellites just create
a shield that filters the radiation.

367
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,000
And block the source
of my power, giving them theirs.

368
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:21,210
You have to believe me.

369
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:25,340
I had no idea
that your powers disappeared.

370
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,029
Don't worry, Tess.

371
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,795
I'll save your world.

372
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:35,768
Just not with you in it.

373
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:22,773
Alia?

374
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,253
Why did you call me here?

375
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,074
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:43,836
I did it in the name of RAU.

377
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,219
Jor-El...
he thought we were abominations.

378
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,344
He would have destroyed us.

379
00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:00,095
You killed him?

380
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,878
Justice must be served.

381
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:05,218
Yeah, mom, about the engagement...
there was a miscommunication.

382
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,213
They're gonna print a retraction.

383
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,847
Sure, I'll tell her.

384
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:10,496
Okay, I love you, too, mom.

385
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:16,378
My mom says, "when you're ready,
you can borrow it."

386
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,847
Do you have any idea
what she's talking about?

387
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:23,054
Nope.
It's greek to me.

388
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:27,989
Speaking of Greece,
your dad left a message.

389
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:29,978
You know what?

390
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,403
I just need to make
a few phone calls here.

391
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,095
Donna Reed on crack.

392
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,722
I just... I'm never gonna buy
chocolate from another fairy.

393
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:39,995
I promise you.
I wasn't myself.

394
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,003
I don't know
what she put in that stuff.

395
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:44,665
It's too bad.
I kind of liked your outfit.

396
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,254
You really are an old-fashioned
romantic, aren't you?

397
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:55,334
I guess it's easier to complain

398
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,617
about Valentine's day than it is
to give it a shot.

399
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,720
So, in the face of the candy-coated,

400
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:05,124
emotional manipulation of V-day,


402
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:09,606
Maybe I just need to trust that
what we have is something more.

403
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:19,839
It's Chloe.

404
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:23,390
She's been really sweet. She left 12
messages apologizing for what she said

405
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:27,165
after she found out that I moved
in together... with you, here.

406
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,426
Yeah, we should talk.

407
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:33,661
Right. When you asked me
to move in with you here,

408
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:36,065
I know it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

409
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,431
- Yeah, but it wasn't...
- and about the whole proposal.

410
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:42,093
It was a dream-come-true
level of "wow,"

411
00:35:42,363 --> 00:35:46,247
but, things are moving
a little too fast for me.

412
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,833
Right.

413
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,948
I don't know what I was thinking.

414
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:57,029
We should just stick to our plan
and take things slow.

415
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:00,546
I am so relieved
to hear you say that.

416
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:04,776
We just have to continue
being honest with each other.

417
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:06,595
Yeah.

418
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,635
About everything, right?

419
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:10,891
God knows I spilled my guts.

420
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,126
Clark, if you had
a really big secret...

421
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:19,396
would you trust me with it?

422
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:23,518
You're the most
trustworthy person I know.

423
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,078
But I confessed to the whole world

424
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:29,248
that I was talking to The Blur
on national television

425
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:31,450
And I really meant
to keep that secret.

426
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:33,719
I don't think The Blur minds, Lois.

427
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:35,668
You were doing the right thing.

428
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,761
- You were protecting him.
- But that's not the point.

429
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:40,792
I know it sounds crazy,

430
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,909
But I'm just afraid that my big mouth
is gonna wreck our relationship one day.

431
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:46,631
Don't worry, Lois.

432
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,838
It's not gonna be that easy
to get rid of me.

433
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:18,811
How'd she die?

434
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:26,291
By my hand.

435
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,465
You killed her?

436
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,802
She confessed
she murdered your father.

437
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,576
She was one of the zealots who thought
he would find a way to destroy us.

438
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:48,292
She didn't deserve to die.

439
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:51,536
You've gone too far, Just like when
you did when you sent me to see Tess!

440
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,651
You want to become one of us.

441
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:59,083
You want to live by our ways,
and yet, you reject them.

442
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,177
Kal-El, when you came to us
with your powers, I thought...

443
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,716
I thought it represented hope
for all of us,

444
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:07,686
but because you were too weak
to do it,

445
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,805
I had to kill
one of my own soldiers...

446
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:14,406
... to get justice for you.

447
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:20,844
This isn't my kind of justice.

448
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:26,660
In the coming days, you will see
there is only one kind of justice.

449
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:32,207
And then you will have to decide

450
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:34,162
if you really are one of us.

451
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,095
If you were really
under a command to protect me,

452
00:40:00,323 --> 00:40:01,890
why didn't you let me kill her?

453
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,470
Because sometimes protecting you

454
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:07,428
means protecting you from yourself.

455
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:10,771
You're someone
we all have to believe in.

456
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,925
Nothing can compromise that.

457
00:40:16,734 --> 00:40:19,091
Zod took matters into his own hands.

458
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,178
He killed Jor-El's murderer.

459
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,576
It was Alia.

460
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:32,137
So, now Alia can't slay me in
the future like she's supposed to.

461
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:35,994
This means the future
that we saw is changing.

462
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,913
But there's only one way to be sure.

463
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:08,871
When the first rays of the sun

464
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:11,259
fall upon the solar towers
tomorrow morning,

465
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,222
it will herald the dawn
of a new age of infinite power.
