1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Hey, fight fans !

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,200
Are you ready ?

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
Tonight's undercard
is a special twin matchup

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,300
introducing two new combatants.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
In this corner,the voluptuous...

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,200
the vicious...

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,900
vixen !

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
And now...

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,500
entering our arena
for the very first time...

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,900
ladies and gentlemen,please welcome...

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,100
the all-powerful,the all-american...

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,000
man of steel !

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,500
You're paid to keep an eye
on the fights,

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,500
not me.

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,400
The view in here's a lot better.

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,200
Security guard by day,

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,600
catholic schoolgirl by night --

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,200
you're a woman of many talents, athena.

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,900
And a woman of many desires.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Unfortunately,none of them are you.

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,300
Taking off early ?

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,600
Rough day.

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,200
How's the fight going ?

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
It will all be over soon.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,000
Big guy just showed up.
He's an animal.

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,300
Where'd maddox find him ?

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,400
Outside a bar in omaha 

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,700
busting up a group of hells angels.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,500
Next time I catch you peeping at me...

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,800
I'll put you in a cage with him.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,300
What the hell's going on here ?

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,100
He's tearing up the place.
He just killed maddox !

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
- Who ? !
- Titan !

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,700
Time to die, kryptonian.

46 Hours Earlier

39
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,800
Thanks, oliver.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Yeah, I'll call you
if I find anything. Bye.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
"Police are baffled over a recent string"

42
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,300
of bizarre citizens' arrests.

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,100
"Numerous career criminals
have been mysteriously delivered"

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,900
to stations throughout the metro area,

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,900
in most cases unconscious."

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Clark, do you know
anything about this ?

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,800
Sounds like some bad guys

48
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,100
have finally been brought to justice.

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,700
Well, some of them
were hurt pretty badly.

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,200
That sounds like
a little more than justice.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,400
They were meteor-infected
and put up a fight.

52
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,600
I know you're trying to help,

53
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,300
but you can't go about it this way.

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
It's -- it's not right.

55
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,600
You know what's not right, mom,

56
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,000
is staying up here and doing nothing

57
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,000
when I could be out there
making a difference.

58
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,000
Now, I got to go.

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,900
Oliver gave me a tip.
I got to follow up on it.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Clark...

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,000
I know how difficult
lex and lana's wedding was for you,

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,200
but ever since that day,

63
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,200
it's like you've become another person.

64
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,800
Why ?

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Because I'm not distracted by
my feelings for lana anymore ?

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
That I could finally focus
on what I need to do ?

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Sweetheart,you should never consider

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,700
what you felt to be a distraction.

69
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,700
Love is a natural human emotion.

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Then maybe my mistake was having
those feelings at all.

71
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm not human, mom.

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,300
It's time I stopped pretending to be.

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,100
Live ! OR Die !

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,100
Clark, oh, my god.
Can you believe this ?

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,400
A krypto fight club
on the internet ?

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
How come nobody else knows
about this ?

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
According to oliver, getting
the link and the password

78
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
costs more than most people
make in a year.

79
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,300
Get up !

80
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,800
Get up !

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,700
Clark,he just killed that guy.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Chloe, I need you to trace
the link back to the source.

83
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm trying,
but they're bouncing it off

84
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,700
about a billion different
proxy servers.

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,400
I mean...

86
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,600
Whoever's running this operation

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
made sure that no one
would be able to find him.

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,700
Didn't oliver and your superpals
give you anything else ?

89
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,900
It was a short conversation, chloe.

90
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
I've been kind of busy lately.

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,900
All he said was he thought the
location was somewhere nearby.

92
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
The security on this stream
is off the charts.

93
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,600
I mean, I can't record it,
I can't download it.I can't.

94
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,300
Hey, hey, fight fans !

95
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,800
Your winner and still
undisputed champion...

96
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,000
the one, the only...

97
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,000
titan !

98
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,200
Freeze that frame.

99
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
What is that ?

100
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,500
Is that kryptonian ?

101
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a prison tattoo.

102
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
Chloe, titan isn't meteor-infected.

103
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
He's from the phantom zone.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
I thought we'd end the evening
with a toast.

105
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,300
We've officially been married one week.

106
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,000
The baby's safe.
It's just sparkling cider.

107
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,300
It's not quite the same as
celebrating on the beach in boquete,

108
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
but I guess it will have to do.

109
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,200
Lex, I'm sorry.

110
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,700
I know how much you wanted
to go on this honeymoon,but, 

111
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
like I said before,

112
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,500
I don't think that flying off
to some foreign country

113
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800
is good for the baby.

114
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,400
Are you sure
that's the only reason

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
you gave up a week in paradise ?

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,800
Ever since the wedding,I feel like
you've been pulling away from me.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Everything happened so quickly --

118
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,900
this pregnancy,the wedding.

119
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,900
I still feel
like I'm trying to catch up.

120
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,700
I just need a little time.

121
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Take as much time as you need.

122
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
We have the rest
of our lives together.

123
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,500
Look, I'm sure things will
be different once the baby's born.

124
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
Right ?

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
To our new family.

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,100
Clark...slow down.

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,900
I don't have enough money
to hire a full-time maid

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,900
to clean up every time
you decide to blow in.

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,600
What did you find ?

130
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,900
The url and the password

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,600
that oliver gave you
are both null and void,

132
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,400
which means that the fight-club
promoters must be rotating them

133
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,700
in order to maximize security
and profit.

134
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
You have nothing !

135
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,700
Don't bite my head off.

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
You know I always have
something up my sleeve.

137
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm starting to think that supersleu
thing

138
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,800
might be my latent krypto power.

139
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
Okay, so it turns out that
our billy idol look-alike

140
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
is actually a meteor-infected
belle reve resident.

141
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Now,this is the weird thing.

142
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
After he was killed in that cage,

143
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,800
he was returned back to his padded cell.

144
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,200
The orderlies found his body
this morning.

145
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,200
So if we find who got him
in and out of the hospital,

146
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,100
he'll lead us straight
to the fight club...

147
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,400
and to titan.

148
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,600
Already on it.

149
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,200
See ?Your sidekick
isn't completely useless.

150
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm sorry I snapped,chloe.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm worried that titan might be
a bigger threat than I thought.

152
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
Your friend down at metropolis
precinct helped me find these.

153
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,100
It's titan's victims.

154
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,100
They were all found between
a crater outside of omaha,

155
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,500
where I think he landed,
and metropolis.

156
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,400
He left the same wound
on all the bodies, and --

157
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,200
and they're all fighters.

158
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,600
I know why --

159
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,400
the tattoo on titan's arm.

160
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
From what I could tell,
it said he was a warrior

161
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,600
enhanced for combat.

162
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,500
Ever since he's been here,
he's been looking for a fight.

163
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
What better challenge
for a brawl-loving zoner

164
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,200
than a rumble at a krypto fight club ?

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Hey.

166
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,000
Can you believe this ?

167
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,000
I couldn't find proof of the
chupacabra in the everglades,

168
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
so now my editor wants to downsize me.

169
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,400
If I don't come up with
an article in the next 48 hours,

170
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,200
I can say adios to my weekly paycheck.

171
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,200
- Is that a story ?
- No.

172
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,300
Okay, look,normally I would be hands-off,

173
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
but this puppy needs a bone.
Please, coz.

174
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,300
I'll owe you big-time.

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,300
There's no story for
the inquisitor here, lois.

176
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,800
It's just a dead end.

177
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm sure after a shower and a cappuccino,

178
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,500
you'll come up with something in no time.

179
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
Clark's right.
We'll give you some room.

180
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,500
I could have used a little help.

181
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,800
"Fr-44."

182
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Fort ryan, hangar 44.

183
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,100
Hey, puss in boots.

184
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
Where you going ?

185
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,900
Whoa.Hey, my car overheated
on the way to work,

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
and I just needed some water
for my radiator.

187
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
What are you all dressed up for, kitten ?

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm a dancer...

189
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,800
at the phoenix.

190
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
Strip club down the road ?

191
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Yeah.

192
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,100
Look, I go onstage in 15 minutes.

193
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
I could sure use your help.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,500
This place...is a little
off the beaten path.

195
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
How'd you even know
we were back here ?

196
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,800
My dad's a general.

197
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,800
Before the base was mothballed
and sold off,

198
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,800
I came here all the time with him.

199
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,700
A general, huh ?

200
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,000
I bet he's proud of how
his little girl turned out.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Come on...

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
help a girl out ?

203
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
I'll leave your name at the front door.

204
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,800
You can watch my act.

205
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,200
I do a killer
stars-and-stripes routine.

206
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,900
I've always been a sucker
for a girl in boots.

207
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Lucky me.

208
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,500
Wait right here, kitten.
I'll be right back.

209
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,400
You're a very nosy girl,kitty cat.

210
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,200
Pretty nice moves...

211
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,500
for a stripper.

212
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,500
Oh, honey, I learned even better
ones as an army brat.

213
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
For your information,

214
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,600
my daddy is proud of me...

215
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
kitty cat.

216
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,800
If you were my little girl,

217
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,200
I'd be proud of you, too.

218
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,600
So, I think I found
our vince mcmahon wannabe,

219
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,800
and he has total access to an
endless supply of meteor freaks.

220
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,600
Meet richter maddox,

221
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,500
executive administrator at belle reve.

222
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,600
How's this guy keeping titan
locked up in belle reve ?

223
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,800
Actually,our jolly mean giant
isn't in the belle reve yearbook.

224
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
He must be freelancing.

225
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
Maddox isn't just pulling
fighters from the hospital,

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,900
he's using outside talent ?

227
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,800
If I can talk my way into that ring,
I'll find titan.

228
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,400
These bouts are televised live.

229
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
You can't risk showing people your face.

230
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,200
I don't have a choice, chloe.

231
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,800
Clark, he can kill you.

232
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,200
Not if I kill him first.

233
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,800
Keep me updated on your progress.

234
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,600
You have full discretion,bartlett.

235
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,800
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,800
CONFIDENTIAL

237
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
Corto Maltese - Compromised 

238
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Lana ?

239
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,500
Lex. 

240
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,100
Lana.

241
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,800
Oh, my god.

242
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,900
There's something wrong.

243
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,700
Lana.

244
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Somebody help me !

245
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,000
Someone !

246
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,800
Smallville Medical Center

247
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,200
Lex.

248
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
Lana.

249
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,400
Mrs. Luthor, you shouldn't
get out of bed yet.

250
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Lana,you just passed out.

251
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,500
You're at smallville medical center.

252
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,100
Where's dr. Langston ?

253
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Is the baby all right ?

254
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,200
He didn't return my page,
so I called in dr. Albright.

255
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,200
She's been my family doctor for years.

256
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,200
You're going to be fine,mrs. Luthor.

257
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,500
You just need to get some rest.

258
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,800
Is the baby all right ?

259
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Could you give us a minute ?

260
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
Lex.

261
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Lana.

262
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
There were complications.

263
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,800
- We lost the baby.
- No.

264
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,700
- I'm sorry.
- No.

265
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,800
BELLE REVE SANITARIUM
KEEP OUT !

266
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,800
You scared me.

267
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,000
Where did you come from ?

268
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,000
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

269
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,600
I've had a long day,

270
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,400
so if you're looking to check in,

271
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
the admitting desk is in the front lobby.

272
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm looking for you, mr. Maddox.
I want to fight.

273
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,500
- What did I do to you ?
- No.

274
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,300
I mean I want to be
in your fight club.

275
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
you must have me confused
with someone else.

276
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,900
It happens.I have that kind of face.
Come here.

277
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,700
I know about the fight club.

278
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,600
I know you're not only using
patients from belle reve.

279
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,600
I want in.

280
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,600
Okay, look.The only place
I can get you into

281
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,000
is this psychiatric facility.

282
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,000
You're clearly a very sick person,
and you need help.

283
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,800
If treatment's not
what you're looking for...

284
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,600
then I suggest you back off.

285
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,600
You're barking at the wrong dog, jethro.

286
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,100
Now put your tail between
your legs and get lost.

287
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Not until you let me in that cage.

288
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah.

289
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,900
Now, you're just full of surprises,
aren't you ?

290
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
You haven't seen anything yet.

291
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
No, I bet not.

292
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,500
Now, I thought with your pretty face,

293
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
you've never gone a round
in your life.

294
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,700
But now I can see it in your eyes.

295
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,300
Yeah, there it is.

296
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,600
You got some fight in you,
don't you ?

297
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Welcome to the show.

298
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Yes !

299
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,700
Hey, what do you think of
the name "the man of steel" ?

300
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,500
"Man of steel" ?

301
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah, I give all the fighters their monikers.

302
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,400
Trust me, it's name that
no one's ever going to forget.

303
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,900
I got a feeling about these things.

304
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Some people say I'm psychic.

305
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,200
Now, remember.
Play it up for the cameras.

306
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,600
People are forking over top dollar
to see these fights online,all right ?

307
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,000
- Where's the crowd ?
- Well,what's crowd ?We don't have a crowd.

308
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,800
***Can't have a crowd
if you want to keep this secret.

309
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,500
Besides,who needs an audience
when you got 50,000 watts of sound ?

310
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
Check that out.I just bought that.

311
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,700
***Gate !

312
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,000
Now, here's how it works.

313
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,300
We sell the spectacle
to the "high rollers" online.

314
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,300
And the noise pumps up
the fighters for the fight.

315
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,000
- Where's titan ?
- Titan ?

316
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,800
That's the main event.

317
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,500
I want to warm you up
with something easy.

318
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,200
It won't be much of a fight,
but then again, it doesn't matter

319
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300
because all the fans want to see
is somebody die.

320
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,300
Then who am I fighting ?

321
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,300
Get off me !

322
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,900
- ***
- Lois ?

323
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,300
Smallville ?

324
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,000
Stand by on one.

325
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,400
We're online...

326
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,300
in 3...2...1.

327
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,300
Hey, fight fans !

328
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,100
Are you ready ?

329
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,900
Tonight's undercard
is a special twin matchup

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
introducing two new combatants.

331
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
In this corner,the voluptuous...

332
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,200
the vicious...

333
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,200
vixen !

334
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
Yummy.

335
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,500
And now...

336
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,600
entering our arena
for the very first time...

337
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,900
ladies and gentlemen,please welcome...

338
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,900
the all-powerful,the all-american...

339
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,900
man of steel !

340
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
I can't wait.

341
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
Ladies.

342
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,100
Good luck, pretty boy.

343
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,200
Lois, what are you doing here ?

344
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,600
Trying to stay alive.

345
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,700
- Punch me.
- What ?

346
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Look, not too hard,
just enough to make it look real.

347
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
All they want is a fight.

348
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,500
So when I hit the mat,
maddox will come back in.

349
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,100
We make our getaway.

350
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,900
I'm not going to punch you, lois.

351
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,300
Fine.

352
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Then you take the dive.

353
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,300
That is not just a six-pack on you.
That's a steel case.

354
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,700
Kal-el.

355
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,700
Whoa ! Wait, wait.

356
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,900
The light feed went down.

357
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,800
Show's over !

358
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,900
Lois...run.

359
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,000
What the hell's going on here ?

360
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,800
He's tearing up the place.
He just killed maddox !

361
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
- Who ? !
- Titan !

362
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,400
Leave her alone !

363
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,900
The human means nothing to me.

364
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,400
You're the fight I've been hoping for.

365
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,700
You don't belong here.

366
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,000
You're the one that doesn't belong.

367
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,100
Time to die, kryptonian.

368
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
My turn.

369
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,300
Good fight.

370
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
Sorry to bother you with business, sir.

371
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
- I know this must be a difficult time.
- Get to the point.

372
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
We located the fight club,
as you instructed.

373
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
- So you have titan ?
- Negative.

374
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,500
He was dead when the team arrived.

375
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,300
According to your reports,

376
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,800
titan decimated some of the toughest
meteor freaks out there.

377
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,800
Now, who could have taken him down ?

378
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,100
We don't know, sir.

379
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,800
We lost our internet link
right before the team moved in.

380
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,100
They did retrieve titan's body.

381
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,500
I think you'll find
the autopsy report interesting.

382
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,700
He wasn't a meteor freak.

383
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,500
No, sir.

384
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Titan wasn't human.

385
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,900
How's lois ?

386
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,400
She's pretty banged up,

387
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,700
but the doctor says
she's going to be all right.

388
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,300
She's already started working on her
article about the fight club.

389
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,700
Don't worry.She didn't see me
do anything newsworthy.

390
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
I won't be making any headlines.

391
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,400
I'm glad to know she's fine.

392
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,200
How are you doing ?

393
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,700
I thought that titan
was the last prisoner

394
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,300
I let escape from the phantom zone.

395
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,600
But looking at all these...

396
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,700
if there are any more out there,
I'm sure you'll find them.

397
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,000
And then what ?

398
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't know how to return them
to the phantom zone.

399
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,500
The only way to get rid of them...

400
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,700
is to kill them like I did titan.

401
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Clark...

402
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,000
from what you told me,
that was an accident.

403
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,400
That's what I keep telling myself.

404
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,000
Well, what if it wasn't ?

405
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,000
He would have killed you.

406
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600
So I just killed him first ?

407
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,600
How does that make me
any different than titan ?

408
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,600
What you're feeling right now
is what makes you different --

409
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,000
regret, remorse for a vicious creature

410
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,400
who would have murdered you and lois
without a second thought ?

411
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,500
Those feelings are what make you human

412
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,300
no matter how much you deny it.

413
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,400
And what about the anger ?

414
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,700
I wanted to kill him, mom.

415
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,500
I wanted to kill him
with my bare hands.

416
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,900
I've never felt rage
like that before.

417
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,600
You were angry
before you ever heard of titan.

418
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,400
We both know that's not
what this is about.

419
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,800
How could lana do it ?

420
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,000
How could she marry lex ?

421
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,400
I don't know, clark,
but she made her choice.

422
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,500
Or someone made it for her.

423
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
I have to figure out what happened.
I got to do something.

424
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,900
Honey...

425
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
I understand how much this hurts,

426
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,700
but part of being human,
of being in love...

427
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
is learning to let go.

428
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,800
If you can't,

429
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm afraid the anger you're
feeling will always be there.

430
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,700
Nell called.

431
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,400
She wanted to know if you'd
like some company tomorrow.

432
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,500
I don't know.

433
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Lana, you haven't left this room
since we got back from the hospital.

434
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,300
I like it here.

435
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,900
I called dr. Langston
to tell him what happened.

436
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,700
They told me he was killed
in a car accident.

437
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,600
Oh, my god.

438
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,200
That's terrible.When ?

439
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,300
The day of our wedding.

440
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,100
Lex, why is all this happening ?

441
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Some things in life are just...

442
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,400
out of your control.

443
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,300
Sometimes you have to let go

444
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
and leave it in the hands
of a greater power.

445
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,200
I lost our baby.

446
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm -- 

447
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm so sorry.

448
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,700
Hey...

449
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,100
it wasn't your fault.

450
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,900
I have to know for sure.

451
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,400
I need to get my files
from dr. Langston's office.

452
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,100
We will.

453
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,700
Lana, how can I make --

454
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,700
how can I help make the pain go away ?

455
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,600
What can I do ?

456
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,600
Are you sure these are
all of her files ?

457
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Thank you for your help,dr. Albright.

458
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,100
And forget you ever heard of lana luthor.
