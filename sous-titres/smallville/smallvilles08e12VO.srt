1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:01,233
Previously on "smallville"...

2
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:03,460
you saved me.

3
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,932
well, that was the last time. the
burning sunn may streng then you,

4
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,216
but it has the opposite effect on me.

5
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:09,112
it stripped me of my powers.

6
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:11,945
detective john jones.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,089
i wanted to be close
by in case you need me.

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:19,833
lana?

9
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,832
does clark know about you?

10
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,760
i think i can safely say he knows
more of my secrets than he does yours.

11
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:27,136
you weren't planning on
coming back, were you?

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,713
mr. luthor is a firm
believer in truth and justice.

13
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,040
he's done more for this
world than you ever will.

14
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:37,025
he dedicated his life to
making it a safer place.

15
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,012
dispatch, this is detective jones.

16
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:43,581
please tell me you
have a 20 on my suspect.

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,525
suspect was just spotted
turning north on riverside.

18
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:47,828
black-and-white
in pursuit.

19
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:29,380
you're under arrest for
three counts of murder.

20
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,356
thanks for your assistance, officers.

21
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:39,348
just doing our job, detective.

22
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:30,925
this isn't exactly what i had in mind
when i suggested coffee after work.

23
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,197
after work?

24
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,597
- oh, lana, what time is it?
- relax.

25
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,256
it gives me a chance to see
clark kent in his new element.

26
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,160
shirt and tie...  you must be
turning heads left and right.

27
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,169
i guess i've been too
busy at work to notice.

28
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,837
you know, with everything else going on...

29
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,924
any leads on that thing that took chloe?

30
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,559
a night watchman

31
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:03,283
and two ambulance drivers were
murdered the night of the ceremony.

32
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,763
lana, i'm gonna find this thing
before it hurts anyone else.

33
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:08,371
i know you will.

34
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,403
you've become the man that
i've always known you could be.

35
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:19,523
i should probably leave you to it.

36
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:21,979
next round's on you.

37
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,856
emergency staff to the e.r.
incoming trauma, metropolis p.d.

38
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,627
g.s.w. to the chest.

39
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:33,537
b.p. is critical.
he's lost a lot of blood.

40
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,866
he's alive, but we can't get a pulse.

41
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,585
all right, i'll take it from here.

42
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,203
no one in or out
without my authorization.

43
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,821
clearing the wound.
b.p. is dropping.

44
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:43,349
we've got to get the bullet out... now!

45
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:45,823
charge the paddles.
we're losing him. clear!

46
00:03:47,303 --> 00:04:15,792

For seriessub.com

49
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:44,561
what are you doing here?

50
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,009
i was out on patrol.
i heard the call go out over my scanner.

51
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,377
whoever that is,
he can't just operate on jones.

52
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:51,787
why? 'cause he's martian?

53
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:55,727
i get it, clark. it's fine.
he's in good hands with emil. trust me.

54
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:59,439
after i got poisoned, i
figured, you know, guys like us

55
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,215
could probably use a
specialist on the payroll.

56
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,945
since when did jones become one of us?

57
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:07,043
well, he's gotten me out
of a few tight scrapes with the police, clark.

58
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:12,124
he wanted to meet with me after
his shift to talk about something...

59
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:13,061
i don't know what it was.

60
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:15,411
if he hadn't sacrificed his
abilities to save my life,

61
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:16,907
that bullet wouldn't
have left a scratch.

62
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:20,738
and now you feel guilty,
and that's your thing, and i get it... that's great.

63
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:23,265
but standing here doing nothing
is not gonna solve anything.

64
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:27,665
do you know what he was working on?

65
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:29,521
no.

66
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:32,386
i think you should follow your leads.

67
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:35,545
and i'll follow mine.
hey, let's face it.

68
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:36,769
teamwork's never really
been our strong suit.

69
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:53,817
what is your focus?

70
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:54,961
true victory.

71
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,937
and what is true victory?

72
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,609
victory over one's self.

73
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,273
first principle of aiko.

74
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,930
that'll be all, terrence.

75
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,633
the enigmatic lana lang.

76
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:20,577
in the flesh.

77
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:23,233
to what do i owe this honor?

78
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,289
i wanted to thank you.

79
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:29,328
there's been a startling
lack of coverage on my return in the daily planet.

80
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,736
i tend to keep my
reporters on a short leash.

81
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:34,543
most of the time.

82
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:43,431
you have just as much
presence... as lex said you did.

83
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,600
you'd have to to tame a luthor.

84
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:51,215
high marks...

85
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,191
coming from the woman entrusted
with the luthor legacy.

86
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,575
he must have had a lot of faith in you.

87
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,728
it wasn't easy to earn.

88
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,624
i wonder how much of
that trust would remain

89
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,657
if he knew how much
of his company's money

90
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,511
you were siphoning into a
project called prometheus.

91
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:14,193
unless, of course, there's
still someone higher

92
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:16,039
than you calling the shots.

93
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:21,695
lex is alive.

94
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:24,935
and you know where he is, don't you?

95
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:33,471
seems that you've been wasting a
very gifted imagination, ms. lang.

96
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,154
the planetruns a fiction section on
sundays, if you're interested.

97
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,074
i used to see that look in the mirror.

98
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,785
you'll do anything to
defend lex, to protect him.

99
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:51,937
he has a way of turning that
kind of devotion against you.

100
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,073
well, you don't know lex like i do.

101
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,122
for your sake, i hope you're right.

102
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,241
glad i caught you before you left.

103
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,233
yeah, i just need to be back at
the hospital before jimmy wakes up.

104
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,345
i wouldn't have asked...

105
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:28,777
heroes don't take holidays.

106
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:31,698
so, from what i can hack, it
looks like our favorite martian

107
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:35,135
has been pulling profiles
from a handful of officers from the 44th precinct.

108
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:42,383
you ow, i got to say,
being at the mercy of modern technology really sucks.

109
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,582
i know, i know.
i'm happy to be brainiac-free.

110
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,975
but my evil upgrade was
really... convenient.

111
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,272
i'm just glad everything's
back to normal.

112
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:54,968
so it would seem.

113
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,335
how are things now that
lana's back in your orbit?

114
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,199
it's not like that.

115
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:05,663
i think.

116
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,000
clark, things always get messy

117
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,167
when you start throwing
around the clark/lana triangle.

118
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:12,927
and i'm speaking from experience

119
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,439
when i say that the
third point always hurts.

120
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,191
i'm not trying to hurt anyone.

121
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:21,927
how about lois?

122
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:25,982
yeah. it's that obvious.

123
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:30,998
lois is so...

124
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:34,842
yeah.

125
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,592
seeing lana come back,
it's lik she never left.

126
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,808
can't just stop loving
someone just like that, right?

127
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,047
i understand the need
for closure, clark. just

128
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,602
promise you're not gonna
slam my cousin in the door.

129
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,058
ballistics says it's a
bg-49 armor-piercing bullet.

130
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,922
which mysteriously
vanished from the evidence.

131
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:12,555
clark, you said you
returned that, didn't you?

132
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,522
i did, chloe.

133
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,034
you said jones was
looking into the 44th.

134
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:21,186
only someone from that system
could have stolen the evidence.

135
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:24,282
chloe, this could have
been an inside job.

136
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,523
you think jones was shot by a cop.

137
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,296
if that's the case, then someone higher up
in the force needs to know about this.

138
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,830
and you think someone on the force
is just gonna open up to you, a reporter?

139
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,941
clark, these guys protect their own.

140
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:38,789
jones is fighting for his life.

141
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,461
i'm not gonna let whoever did
this hide behind their badge.

142
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,454
all right.

143
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,478
if we're gonna sneak you
across this thin blue line,

144
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:50,380
you're gonna need something
a lot more substantial than just a press pass.

145
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,203
danny boy.

146
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,492
you all set for your newidekick?

147
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:08,972
he was born ready.

148
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:10,756
besides, who can resist
this handsome face?

149
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:12,916
better than looking at
his ugly mug all day.

150
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,611
give 'em hell, danny!

151
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:17,652
come on. let's go.

152
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,627
you the transfer from cove city?

153
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,012
joe, you ready to save the world?

154
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,520
that's quite a sweet
tooth you got there.

155
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:49,688
yeah.

156
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:52,874
got them from my kid last halloween.
now i can't stop eating the things.

157
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:56,372
he loves the bana ones. i think root
beer is the only one worth the effort.

158
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,442
help yourself.

159
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,744
what's the matter, foreman?
don't they have squad cars back in cove city?

160
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,072
i just... i guess i'm not
used to riding in one so nice.

161
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,608
nice?

162
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,648
good to see you got a sense of humor.
you're gonna need that here.

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,365
let's just hope you live long
enough to catch that surf again.

164
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,720
it was a detective that got shot, right?
what's his name?

165
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,544
jones?

166
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:26,946
yeah, well, that might be a headline
back where you come from, but here,

167
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:30,090
some detective getting plugged
is just another day in metropolis.

168
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:38,666
blood on a badge is
blood on a badge, right?

169
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:40,626
no matter what city you're in.

170
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:44,166
wearing this badge is
like putting a bull's-eye right over your heart.

171
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,646
meanwhile, we got these
costumed idiots running around,

172
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,262
getting in our way,
taking all the credit.

173
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,461
the green arrow, red-blue blur?

174
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,157
great pumpkin.

175
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,078
yeah.

176
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,501
you think they do more harm than good?

177
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,188
what i know is that cops
got rules, capes don't.

178
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,598
adam 13, there's a 10-30 in progress

179
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:13,430
at 550 south broad in
the slums... code 3.

180
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:15,742
10-4, dispatch.

181
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,598
junkies hitting the pharmacy... again.

182
00:13:20,574 --> 00:23:28,708
someone i'm looking for.

183
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:29,709
all right.

184
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:30,110
you ready to see how we
do it in the big city?

185
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:43,823
make sure everyone's okay.

186
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:55,568
stop right there!

187
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:03,876
hold it!

188
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,767
you run track, foreman?

189
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:31,237
a little here and there.

190
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:49,355
i guess i owe you one.

191
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:16,382
transmitting data to you now.

192
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:18,317
hey.

193
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:18,684
who are you supposed to be?

194
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:20,519
warrior angel?

195
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,020
no.

196
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:25,658
i'm the red-blue blur.

197
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,659
it's a losing battle.

198
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:27,160
don't worry, dad.

199
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,262
he'll grow out of it.

200
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:29,762
you must be joe.

201
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,930
i'm danny's wife, suzie.

202
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:32,565
hi.

203
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,836
it's nice to meet you in person.

204
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:37,837
in person?

205
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:38,304
you arenotstill carrying
that picture around.

206
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:41,307
he's had that thing since senior year.

207
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:54,253
dad!

208
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:56,789
hey, bud.

209
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,156
thanks for looking out for him today.

210
00:25:59,235 --> 00:25:59,692
losing his partner really tore him up.

211
00:26:03,706 --> 00:26:04,330
it's good to know that someone's
still got his back out there.

212
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:09,068
how long did they ride together?

213
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:10,769
since they graduated the academy.

214
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:13,339
one day they both went out
and only danny came home.

215
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:17,076
mike always thought he was bulletproof.

216
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:22,481
now every night, i hold my breath,

217
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:24,316
waiting for him to
walk through that door.

218
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:29,187
i know the world needs him, but...

219
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:37,362
we just need him more.

220
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,465
to foreman.

221
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:39,698
rookie really earned his keep today.

222
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:46,939
and to us.

223
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,774
we all made it home safe.

224
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:49,040
may we all be as lucky tomorrow.

225
00:26:59,384 --> 00:26:59,718
excuse me.

226
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:00,285
it's too bad all of us weren't so lucky.

227
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:03,188
you know, with what happened with jones.

228
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:09,428
yeah.

229
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,462
yeah, you know, the damn
shame is, nobody knew the guy.

230
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,167
ask anyone in this precinct.

231
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:15,767
lone wolf like jones, you know,
he stands out from the pack.

232
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,072
and that's not a good thing.

233
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:23,375
safety in numbers?

234
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:24,042
well, i wasn't making light
when i said we're all brothers.

235
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:27,045
hard to stick your neck out
for a guy you don't even know.

236
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:30,081
isn't that what police
officers are supposed to do?

237
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,292
you believe the stones on this guy?

238
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:43,528
good for you, e.

239
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:47,666
good for you.

240
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:48,500
but listen.

241
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:48,867
you keep your eyes on the street,

242
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:50,702
and you leave the detective
work to the desk jockeys.

243
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:54,039
don't be stupid like jones.

244
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:02,647
always wear your vest.

245
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,021
foreman, we got to go.

246
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:43,555
i guess i'm not as good a
judge of character as i thought.

247
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,025
it seems that you stole some
sensitive information from me.

248
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:53,397
and i thought we were bonding.

249
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,835
rain check on girls' night?

250
00:28:57,845 --> 00:28:58,336
you know, it's nice to finally
see what lex saw in you.

251
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,543
you're stunning.

252
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:07,879
and devious.

253
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:08,212
what lex saw in me was an equal,
someone that he couldn't control.

254
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:18,422
really?

255
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:18,789
i guess i shouldn't send my condolences
about the miscarriage, then, hmm?

256
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:25,463
it gave me the perspective i need
to see lex for who he really is.

257
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,236
i know he thought that was
the only way to keep you.

258
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,376
but he always ved you.

259
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,510
when you stole the data, you corrupted
our files, and we've lost everything.

260
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,114
prometheus is the one
chance lex has at survival,

261
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:45,817
and i won't let you jeopardize that.

262
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,667
seriously, what's up with
the money suit oh this?

263
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,970
it's my tax refund. it's
actually quite convenient.

264
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:40,704
thanks.

265
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,572
isn't that dangerous?

266
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:42,172
you got a better way?

267
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:42,773
yeah.

268
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:43,474
what?

269
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,174
i got people.

270
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:45,109
people?

271
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,277
yeah, my people do their thing,

272
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,413
they get me my refund, and
load it on pre-paid card.

273
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:51,248
so... the money goes onto a card,

274
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,084
instead of being made into a suit.

275
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,155
save money, and access it
fast when you put your tax

276
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:01,024
refund on our h&r block
emerald pre-paid mastercard.

277
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:02,259
can you see if i've got
anything left back there?

278
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,134
like a couple of bucks or... nothin'?

279
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:26,343
some things are just
made for each other.

280
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:37,347
like the new iphone 3g and the
nation's fastest 3g network.

281
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:37,580
got you a little present,

282
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:42,118
danny.

283
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:43,353
look who surfaced.

284
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,920
listen, listen.

285
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:45,555
i got acquitted, all right?

286
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,089
the judge let me off, no strings
attached, all right, so...

287
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:48,224
you got off on a technicality,
you piece-of-trash cop killer!

288
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,728
do you have y id what you
did to my partner's family?!

289
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,000
what you did to me?!

290
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,767
danny...

291
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:58,100
we may not control the system, but
we definitely control the streets.

292
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:03,105
i'm sorry.

293
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:06,976
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.

294
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:07,543
i'm...

295
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:08,077
danny, he killed your partner.

296
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:10,647
don't hold back.

297
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:14,050
justice must be served.

298
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:17,520
i'm sorry.

299
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,689
just gonna stand
thereforeman, or you gna man up

300
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,197
and give your partner a hand?

301
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,246
clark, what the hell are you doing here?

302
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:46,149
you got to get out of here... now!

303
00:34:57,436 --> 00:34:58,027
were you this devoted before
or after your accident?

304
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:02,331
someone's been doing her homework.

305
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:07,303
i don't know what you want from me.

306
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:09,238
two years ago, your survey
team was in south america,

307
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:12,074
collecting disease samples for
luthorcorp when an explosion

308
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:17,380
destroyed your camp.

309
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:19,348
and you were left for dead.

310
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:21,817
lex saved my life.

311
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:23,486
i owe him everything.

312
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:23,953
this is how a luthor
rewards that kind of loyalty.

313
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:31,126
what are you doing?

314
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:39,501
i'm opening your eyes.

315
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:42,037
there's a nanotransmitter
hardwired to your optic nerve.

316
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:44,773
you've been lex's eyes and
ears for quite some time.

317
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:48,743
he's watching us right now.

318
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,458
lex might have saved you, but
he never trusted you, tess.

319
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:28,784
i'm sorry.

320
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:29,351
i'll let you know as soon
as detective jones wakes up.

321
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:32,154
he's strong, but he's
not out of the woods yet.

322
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:36,691
thank you, doctor.

323
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:37,759
foreman.

324
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:38,059
take it easy.

325
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,359
take it easy?!

326
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:41,296
come here.

327
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:41,863
i saw you chatting up
your buddy the green arrow.

328
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,065
he took down our whole squad,
and you just let him walk.

329
00:36:45,977 --> 00:36:46,535
look, i don't know what
you think you saw...

330
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:48,603
all you do is ask questions
about some detective,

331
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:50,538
and then i find you checking
up on him in the hospital, too?

332
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:52,373
who are you, joe?

333
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:55,277
you fed? i.a.b.?

334
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:55,777
i want to take down
the guy who shot him,

335
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:57,913
and i know that the shooter's
a part of your squad.

336
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:00,448
they crossed the line, danny.

337
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,951
this isn't the first time
they've gone after somebody

338
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:04,953
who slipped through the system.

339
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:06,654
someone has to.

340
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,323
what about john jones?

341
00:37:08,324 --> 00:37:08,890
he was on to your little
lynch mob, wasn't he?

342
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,461
danny, someone shot him to cover it up.

343
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:17,265
who are you protecting?

344
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:17,565
you don't roll over on a badge.

345
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:20,135
not ever.

346
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:20,468
then why is it okay to shoot one?

347
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:23,871
hey, these guys have my back.

348
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:26,341
which is more than i can say for you.

349
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:28,510
i do have your back, danny,
and i might be the only one.

350
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:37,452
this is not justice.

351
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:40,288
joe, i'm just one man.

352
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:44,392
what can one man do?

353
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:45,026
ask yourself why you put that
uniform on in the first place.

354
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:09,918
imagine my surprise when i stumble
upon metropolis' finest going gangland.

355
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:14,155
thug's a really good look for
you and your crew, by the way.

356
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:17,591
they're not all bad, oliver.

357
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:19,127
some of them are out there every day,

358
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:20,728
risking their lives and their families,
trying to do the same thing we are.

359
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:24,132
yeah, i'm sure you're right.

360
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:26,667
you know, i always forget...

361
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:27,268
how many parolees did
we rough up last month?

362
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:29,904
do you remember?

363
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:30,505
of all people, i thought
you would understand

364
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:32,073
that this isn't just black and white.

365
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:34,042
no matter how noble their
intentions when they started,

366
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:35,810
clark, these people have gone too far.

367
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:40,114
and you never have?

368
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:40,548
danny watched that guy kill his partner.

369
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:43,084
tell me you've never been
tempted to look in the eyes

370
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:46,320
of someone who just committed
so much pain and j...

371
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:51,125
kill him.

372
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:51,626
kill him for the greater good?

373
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:53,628
you gonna stand there and tell
me that's what you believe?

374
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,200
i didn't think so.

375
00:38:59,210 --> 00:38:59,767
what i'm saying is that saving
someone, truly saving them,

376
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:02,436
is not about knocking them out
and throwing them in a dark room.

377
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:05,772
it's about helping them find
their way back to the right side.

378
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:10,711
you know what, clark?

379
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:14,215
some people are beyond saving.

380
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:14,848
that's the suspect that
jones tracked down last night.

381
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:18,085
but he didn't find his
way back to custody, clark.

382
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,121
he did, however, manage to find
his way to the bottom of a river.

383
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,424
now, these people are taking
the law into their own hands.

384
00:39:24,935 --> 00:39:25,426
how many more people have to
die before you do anything?

385
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:27,862
all right, look. i have narrowed
it down to simmons and talbert.

386
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:30,764
both have sniper traing.

387
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:31,966
great!

388
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,500
you sit here and you play detective.

389
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:34,802
i'm gonna go make sure
your boys don't get a chance

390
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:36,804
to put another person in the hospital.

391
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,031
what's the matter?

392
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:07,201
there's something you
need to know about joe.

393
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:12,673
i made a couple calls.

394
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,640
he's not who he says he is.

395
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:49,977
could have called ahead.

396
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:50,578
i would've had the wife set
a place at the table for you.

397
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:52,212
clark kent, you're under arrest

398
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:54,014
for the attempted murder
of detective john jones.

399
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:07,194
you set me up?

400
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:25,078
you're better than this.

401
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:27,381
you did the right thing.

402
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:27,681
just one loose thread to tie up.

403
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:31,985
your hands have been clean
for way too long, danny boy.

404
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,391
hey, smile.

405
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:37,991
you're gonna be the man
who killed the green arrow.

406
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:27,073
white chocolate macadamia.

407
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:28,541
walk away right now.

408
00:42:30,244 --> 00:42:31,010
no, i have to have one.

409
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,746
but i caved on that brownie yesterday.

410
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:34,481
but then i took that cardio class.

411
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,817
so i'll get the small
ones and only have a few.

412
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:39,252
how 'bout no...

413
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:41,955
research shows that extra
helps reduce snack cravings.

414
00:42:41,965 --> 00:42:44,357
and the flavor lasts longer
than a confrontation between...

415
00:42:44,892 --> 00:42:45,758
your wavering willpower...

416
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:47,460
wow, you're good, you.

417
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:50,096
and a vicious, delicious
macadamia nut cookie.

418
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,499
extra. lasts longer than that.

419
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:54,867
what if you could give your family

420
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:57,169
just what they want this
holiday for one low price?

421
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,172
introducing sprint family plans.

422
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:01,674
you'll get unlimited
nationwide text, video,

423
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:03,675
picture messaging and more.

424
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:05,911
and save at least $240 a year

425
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:09,115
over comparable at&t and verizon plans.

426
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:11,817
what better way to bring
the family together?

427
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:15,321
america's most dependable 3g network.

428
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:17,990
come to a sprint store and
find out how much you can save.

429
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:40,647
deaf, hard of hearing and people with speech
disabilities access www.sprintrelay.com.

430
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:42,315
i couldn't get away from
these stubborn stains.

431
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,750
they just kept coming back.

432
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,686
it was so irritating and i felt
like my home was never clean.

433
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:48,588
that's why i
have lime-a-way,

434
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:49,956
and it comes with duraguard

435
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:51,824
which helps keep my home clean longer.

436
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,593
lime-a-way not only removes
the toughest hardwater buildup

437
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:56,562
and eliminates gritty lime scale,

438
00:43:57,098 --> 00:43:59,532
but it's formula with
duraguard acts like a shield

439
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,400
to protect from stains coming back.

440
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:36,736

you said you were transferring
me. we're not gonna kill you.

454
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,630
you're just the bait.

455

456
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:51,203
how you know the arrow's gonna show?

457
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:55,941
he can't help himself.

458
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:56,575

can bet he's been watching us.

459

00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:17,362
let him have it.

464
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:17,963
target spotted, moving
toward your position.

465
00:47:36,748 --> 00:47:37,215
showtime, kid.

466
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,650
you're welcome.

467
00:47:39,018 --> 00:47:39,851
damn it, turpin, move in.

468
00:47:39,918 --> 00:47:40,318
turn around.

469
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:48,092
show me your hands.

470
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:48,993
that's not bad.

471
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:49,560
it's not every day someone
gets the drop on me.

472
00:47:53,198 --> 00:47:54,065
is this all a joke to you?

473
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:55,333
that guy took a shot at me.

474
00:47:55,343 --> 00:47:55,800
and you were gonna what?

475
00:47:57,035 --> 00:47:57,769
put him in the ground?

476
00:47:57,803 --> 00:47:58,336
damn it, turpin, you
got the shot. take it.

477
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:04,708
you're joe's partner, right?

478
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:09,814
his name is clark kent.

479
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:12,216
this isn't about him, okay?

480
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:12,450
you got the shot, danny.

481
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:14,318
take it.

482
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:14,852
it's not too late for you.

483
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:16,821
you don't have to do this.

484
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:17,455
why don't you capes just mind
your own damn business, huh?!

485
00:48:20,368 --> 00:48:20,658
you don't know these guys like i do.

486
00:48:23,328 --> 00:48:24,095
i got a family at home.

487
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:24,695
and when your little boy
asks you who you saved today,

488
00:48:26,598 --> 00:48:27,131
you can tell him you
killed a man in cold blood.

489
00:48:29,902 --> 00:48:30,535
it ain't like that.

490
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:31,169
i knew you were a part of this,
but clark actually trusted you.

491
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:34,105
he thinks you just lost your way.

492
00:48:40,344 --> 00:48:40,811
take the shot!

493
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:41,446
man, if this is what you need
to do to find yourself, then...

494
00:48:50,821 --> 00:48:51,288
... then do it.

495
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:52,122
you do it.

496
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:52,723
you pull the trigger, and
you can prove clark wrong.

497
00:49:00,498 --> 00:49:00,998
be a real hero.

498
00:49:21,686 --> 00:49:22,386
take the shot, danny.

499
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:28,158
you should have pulled
that trigger, kid.

500
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:30,895
dispatch...

501
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:33,130

00:49:39,737 --> 00:49:40,270
officer is down.

504
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:42,138

525
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:20,169
we will

526
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:23,906
rock you

527
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:25,241
with unbeatable prices

528
00:51:25,277 --> 00:51:27,443
on everyone's favorite football foods,

529
00:51:29,113 --> 00:51:30,947
game time costs less at walmart.

530
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:32,015
save money. live better.

531
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:35,838
walmart.

532
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:36,972
hey.

533
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:38,708
hey.

534
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:39,141
feels good to be back on my feet again.

535
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:44,013
i don't know how many
favors you had to call in.

536
00:53:46,091 --> 00:53:46,716
thank you for getting me out
of trouble with the police.

537
00:53:49,462 --> 00:53:49,785
it was the least i could do.

538
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:51,954
could have used some backup out there.

539
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:54,423
why didn't you call me in sooner?

540
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:56,659
same reason i've had to pull you
from the brink of death before.

541
00:54:02,074 --> 00:54:02,665
same reason you let your
guard down last night.

542
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:10,339
pride.

543
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:10,940
afteknowing what it's like
totrulyfeel powerful...

544
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:17,012
to have the ability to change fate...

545
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:21,317
it's hard to admit when
you can't do it alone.

546
00:54:25,564 --> 00:54:26,188
i guess going solo has really
caught up with us lately, huh?

547
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:31,193
you know, for everything danny's
crew did wrong, i have to say...

548
00:54:35,474 --> 00:54:35,998
knowing there's always someone
there who has your back...

549
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:40,302
that kind of brotherhood can make
you feel like you could do anything.

550
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:53,882
when i thought my life was over,
you gave me a reason to keep going.

551
00:54:59,331 --> 00:54:59,654
i wouldn't be who i am without you.

552
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:10,065
i trusted you.

553
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,370
because i respected you.

554
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:15,804
i've done everything you've ever asked.

555
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:20,042
you've seen that with your own
eyes, and apparently with mine.

556
00:55:34,356 --> 00:55:34,890
but not anymore.

557
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,357
i hope you watch with rapt attention

558
00:55:38,861 --> 00:55:39,795
as your bank accounts close,
as you lose all contact

559
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:42,330
with the outside world, as your
life disappears before your eyes.

560
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,254
goodbye, lex.

561
00:56:13,762 --> 00:56:14,162
i loved you.

562
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:23,972
you son of a bitch.

563
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:28,343
mercy.

564
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:30,512
sure hope your s'mores
are worth the drive.

565
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:34,649
i wouldn't want you
to spoil your appetite.

566
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,454
we're going to dinner.

567
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:39,754
i'd like to discuss a merger.

568
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:47,195
a merger?

569
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,030
what kind of merger?

570
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:53,167
any kind you want.

571
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:07,848
don't keep me waiting.

572
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:09,717
all right, bud.

573
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,093
it's p.j. time, okay?

574
00:57:20,161 --> 00:57:20,561
- green arrow?
- no.

575
00:57:22,697 --> 00:57:23,064
robin hood.

576
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:23,698
you know, most people think
he's a bad guy, but he isn't.

577
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,001
at least that's what my
kid tells me. go figure.

578
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:29,370
must be all those bright colors.

579
00:57:33,718 --> 00:57:34,242
danny, i'm sorry i couldn't
tell you i was a reporter.

580
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:37,345
yeah. well, i can't really
be mad at you, clark.

581
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:42,750
i want to be.

582
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,284
but, uh, you were just doing
what you felt was right,

583
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:46,521
which is more than i can say for myself.

584
00:57:51,726 --> 00:57:52,293
i just got all...

585
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:53,260
turned around.

586
00:57:53,528 --> 00:57:53,795
i'm glad you found your way again.

587
00:57:57,232 --> 00:57:57,398
yeah.

588
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:57,965
well, let's hold off on that
until the inquest next week.

589
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:01,469
but no matter what happens...

590
00:58:05,674 --> 00:58:06,307
... i know that they can
be proud of me from now on.

591
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:17,485
hey, danny.

592
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:17,952
is it hard to put them
through what you do every day?

593
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:24,358
you just can't lose
sight of the people you're

594
00:58:26,361 --> 00:58:27,295
trying to protect, you know?

595
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:31,599
it'd be harder not doing it.

596
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:34,802
i do what i do to...

597
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:40,341
just to keep them safe.

598
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:41,842
- you brush your teeth?
- yeah.

599
00:58:45,046 --> 00:58:45,780
what about you, clark?

600
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:46,347
you got someone who
makes it all worth it?

601
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:13,907
if i squint just right,
it's like we're 14 again.

602
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:18,378
you say that like it's a good thing.

603
00:59:24,217 --> 00:59:24,551
what's up?

604
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:26,253
i couldn't sleep so you
came to a coffee shop?

605
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:31,224
not your best plan, mr. kent.

606
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:35,628
lana, i know you had
reasons for coming back.

607
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:42,502
why are you staying?

608
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:43,103
leaving is harder than
i thought it would be.

609
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,041
but, like i said, i don't know
how long i'll be here, so...

610
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:55,181
whether you leave in 10
years or you leave tomorrow,

611
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:57,550
the important thing
is you're here today.

612
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:05,559
clark...

613
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:07,594
... we aren't 14 anymore.

614
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,061
the world will always be
bigger than the both of us.

615
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,030
maybe it doesn't have
to be all or nothing.

616
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:17,937
for the last year, all i've
done is sacrifice myself

617
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:23,610
and everything that i
love for the greater good.

618
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,285
what if the rest of the world
didn't have to come first?

619
01:00:37,057 --> 01:00:37,957
the world needs you, clark.

620
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:18,698
what about what we need?

621
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,098
