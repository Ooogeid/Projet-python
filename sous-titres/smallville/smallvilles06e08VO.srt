4
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,450
does it concern us?

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,400
lana...

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,140
i know you've had your doubts.

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,340

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,950
i'm not sure you do.

13
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,850
you have no idid eahow much you mean to me.

14
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,550
in an ideal worlrl d,i was hoping for some sort of response,but it's okay.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,010
it's late.

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,560
we're both tired.

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,550
lex.

18
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,910
mr.luthor,there's been a breach.

19
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,060

20
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,530
142.

21
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,270
what does that mean?

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,470
everything's gonna be fine.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,310
we're safe.

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,680
miss lang,you've got to come with us.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,410
what's 142?

26
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,000

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,550

29
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,960
lex! lex! where'd he go?

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,100
miss lang,we've got to get in the panic room.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,560
lex!shut that door!

32
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,630

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,670
what the hell is going on?

37
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,960

41
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,060
you said it was urgent.

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,170
it is.

43
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,330
a taiwanese cargo ship was foundoff the coast of alaska with its entire crew dead of unknown causes.

44
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,790
the details are a bit mumu rky,

45
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,180
but the manifest says that its last stop was bellona island.

46
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,530
bellona island?

47
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,800
they gotot hit by a meteorthe same day i escapedfrom the phantom zone.

48
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,780
where's the ship now?

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,470
it's being towed to seattle.

50
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,550
i have to go there.

51
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,260
clark,these guys aren't just meteor freaks.

52
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,560
they're from galaxies far,far away.

53
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,080
and,more importantly,they canan hurt you.

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,260
you can't go unarmed.

55
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,020
i won't.i havethe crystal that r r aya gave me i'll use that against them.

56
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,630
hey,lana.

57
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,710
whoa,slow down.are you all l right?

58
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,860
oh,my god.

59
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,510
yeah,of course.

60
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,980
what happened?

61
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,690
lex just mysteriouslydisappeared.

62
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,820
i have to go to seattle.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,610
well,clark,i know that lex isn't exactly your pick for man of the year,

64
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,880
but you can't just turn your back on him.

65
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,770
there's innocent people in danger.

66
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,360
chloe,i'll be back as soon as i can.

67
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,380
lex's car is garaged.

68
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,970
no movementon any financial accounts.

69
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,080
airline manifests.

70
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,830
all negative.

71
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,140
well,he can't just have dropped of the faceof the earth.

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,830
we have to find him.

73
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,520
lana,please...

74
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,850
come in.

75
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,730
would you excuse usfor a minute?

76
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,220
thank you,george.

77
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,900
lana,this is just devastating.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,790
i've taken a suite for youat the metro seasons hotel.it's for your safety.

79
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,690
for my safety or to distance me from the cover-up?

80
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,540
a conspiracy?

81
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,410
security refusus esto let me see any of the surveillance footage.

82
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,000
they tell me!that i'm seeing things.

83
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,420
tell me.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,610
tell me.

85
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,220
what did you see?

86
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
i don't even know how to begin to explain it,but,um...

87
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,900
lex turned into static.

88
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,740
and then he disappeared.

89
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,240
it was dark.perhaps in the chaos --

90
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,870
i know what i saw.

91
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,680
what else "do you remember?

92
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,060
anything--anything thatcan give me a clue.

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,120
the guards mentioned a number,a code--142.

94
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,730
you know what that means.

95
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,530
no.

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,120
no,but i will find out.

97
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,110
i'm sure you will.

98
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,910
and i'd appreciate it if you let me know when anything else comes up.

99
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,480
of course.i know how important you are to lex.of course i will.

100
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,410
get me dr.chavez ---genome technology.

101
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,710
were all the bodies accounted for?

102
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,640
it's kind of hard "to tell.

103
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,730
you must be the first-year med student i've been waiting for.

104
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,920
don't flatline on me now.

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,550
what gave me away?

106
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,120
the queasy stare that afflicts all newbies their first day !on the job.

107
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,050
do you mind?

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,710
how many are there?

109
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,050
a whole graveyard's worth.

110
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,870
how does a body end up in one of those?

111
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,520
they have no skeletons,although i don't know how that's anatomically possible.

112
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,800
you mean someonecut their bones out?

113
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,880
more like ripped them out.

114
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,410
clean fillets,every one of them.

115
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,830
i've seen some stuffthat would make most people run for the hills,but this -- this is 

116
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,610
seriously freaky.

117
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,380
all these bodies -- they're from the ship?

118
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,150
no,these last t t wo --they were dockworkers.

119
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,100
whatever was on that ship !is on drdr y land now.

120
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,320
oh,kid,are you puking already?

121
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,910
thank godsomeone believes me.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,610
you're the first person !that doesn't think i belong in belle reve.

123
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,910
lana!

124
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,280
a lot stranger thingshave happened in smallville.

125
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,570
don't worry.we'll find him.

126
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,400
lana,thank god you're all right.

127
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,500
so,where exactly was lex when he vaporized?

128
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,930
he was somewherein the middle of the room,like around here.

129
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,450
oh,no.you can't see me.

130
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,350
you said lex backs up all of his security footage on the internal server,right?

131
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,610
yeah,i think so.

132
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,220
okay,we're gonnaneed a password.

133
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,440
you and lex are close.are you password close?

134
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,300
no,i guess nono t.

135
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,120
lana,the password is your birthday.

136
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,500
why don't you try "julian",his brother,or "lillian," his mom.

137
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,430
your birthday.

138
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,950
ixnay.

139
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,450
okay,how about "lana"?

140
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,990
no.

141
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,080
do you #have anythinelse? no,i don't know.

142
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,180
no,i don't know. -damn it!

143
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,060
don't worry,we'll just "upload the whole hard drive,and i'll work on it later.

144
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,840
chloe,the way he disappeared --what if...

145
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,020
what if lex is really gone?

146
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,730
forever.

147
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,860
don't worry.i'll find my way back to you.

148
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,390
you can't think that way,lana.

149
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,710
we're gonna get him back.

150
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,200
i've had so many doubtsabout this relationship,so many suspicions.

151
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,850
but now that he's gone,none of it matters anymore.

152
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,840
i just want to see his face again.

153
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,050
lanana ...

154
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,210
i love you so much.

155
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,840
i'll crack thisback atthe daily planet,

156
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,500
and either we'll geta week's worth of footage of lex sippingng bourbonand diddling on his computer,

157
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,160
or we'll actually hit the jackpot.

158
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,650
lana,wait,don't go.

159
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,130
how does it feel,lex?

160
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,250
to have your whole life ripped from under you?

161
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,740
i know you.

162
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,810
well,you should.

163
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,820
you saw my face through the observation window.

164
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,480
you're the 142.

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,930
i know that lex luthor lost is a juicy headline,

166
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,170
but tell me againwhy we're searchingfor the root of all evil.

167
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,560
i'm not doing this for lex.

168
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,060
after talking to lana,i've got to put my skepticism in check.

169
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,200
women are #such a mystery.

170
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,230
finding lexis a bigger mystery.

171
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,860
where's clark when we need him?

172
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,900
what does clark have to do with anything?

173
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,380
i that you feel sorry for the guy 'cause he's always flying solo,

174
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,370
but honestly,what can that guy dothat i can't?

175
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,490
you know,you're probably right.

176
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,860
he wouldn't brave the rush-hour crunch just to get yourur favoritevending-machine cuisine,

177
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,760
all so that "you can have time to continue the huntfor a man that nobody misses.

178
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,010
well,maybe except -- 

179
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,720
lana! 

180
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,400
the hunt for lex is on.

181
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,760
can i get you anythingfrom the basement buffet?

182
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,040
thank you,but i'm okay.

183
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,150
so,i dohave somom e good news.

184
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,050
i managed to stumbleon the magic password,

185
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,510
and it turns out to be nonene other than the birthday of miss lana lang.

186
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,470
i was able toaccess the surveillance files,and look what i dug up.

187
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,210
there's something there.

188
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,370
can you make itany clearer?

189
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,670
i'm doing my best,but i don'thave a lot to work with.

190
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,370
it's gonna take some time.

191
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,170
hello?

192
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,380
i knowwhat happened to lex luthor.

193
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,410
who is this?

194
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,360
if anyone knows we're talking,we're both in danger.

195
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,540
what's wrong?

196
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,590
ituscuty they want to give me an update.

197
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,850
did anyone follow you here?

198
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,590
no.

199
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,420
please,what happened to lex?

200
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,480
i took him,and if you ever want to see him again,you'll keep your mouou th shut 

201
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,840
and listen to exactlywhat i have to say.

202
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,460
whatever you want.just don't hurt him.

203
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,870
do y y ou know your boyfriend has a secret lab hidden insidee luthorcorp tower called 33.1

204
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,170
why is it t secret?

205
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,260
because they run experimentson the people "who have been infected #by the meteor rocks.

206
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,070
when patients are released from belle reve,instead of freedom,

207
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,820
they get a one-way ticketto a secret laboratory.

208
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,120
how do you know "all this?

209
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,280
cause i was one of them...

210
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,650
till i broke out last night.

211
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,560
why should i believe you?

212
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,540
see,that's the point.

213
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,500
nobody believes me.i'm a former mental patient.

214
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,170
but you ---- you're lex's beloved girlfriend.

215
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,080
once you blow the whistle on this place,people will have to listen,right?

216
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,350
where's the evidence?

217
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,690
you don't have any proof.

218
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,680
of course i do.

219
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,510
i can take you there.

220
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,080
you can see for yourself.

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,360
and then you'll release lex?

222
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,850
hey,this area's off limits.

223
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,150
um,i'm withthe coroner's office.

224
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,420
better you than me.

225
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,870
i heard the bodies are pretty messed up.

226
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,090
anyway,our theory is s the perp was hiding out in this container.

227
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,850
he somehow busted out of this thing with his bare hands and started his killing spree.

228
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,890
it's wild.

229
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,700
we thought it was blood,but the guys are s s aying it's human bone marrow.

230
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,470
it's fricking disgusting.

231
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,530
actually,there are a feww more remains that need removal.

232
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,010
the forensic team is over there waiting for you.

233
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,950
thanks.

234
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,480
who are you?

235
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,320
someone who's hungry.

236
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,660
you said you were infected by the meteors.

237
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,710
whwh at happened to you?

238
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,870
i was an electrician.

239
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,750
i was working upin the radio tower l l ast year when the metet eors hit.

240
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,260
i got thrown off,and somehow i --

241
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,920
you ended up with a a n ability.

242
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,890
what is it?

243
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,340
i can move throuou ghalternate frequencies.

244
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:33,270
i can shiftinto planes of existence that nobody knows exist.

245
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,520
hey,if you thinki'm strange,wait till you see some ofthe other peoplele on this floor.

246
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,640
aren't you afraid they're just gonna grab you the minute those doors open?

247
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,450
if i have to sacrifice myselfto get the truth out...

248
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,190
then so bet it.

249
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,200
the fact is,they're not gonna grab you.

250
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,710
i don't understand.

251
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,710
this is wrong.

252
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,430
it was here.

253
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,420
24 hours ago,it was all here --

254
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,380
the holding cells,the labs.

255
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,600
take me to lex.

256
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,160
what did thaha t bastard do with everyone?

257
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,910
i know that you bebe lievethat something was here,

258
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,910
but clearly nothing has been here for a long time.

259
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,090
i'm telling you,it was here! 

260
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,680
okay.just relax.

261
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
we'll figure out where everything was moved to,

262
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,460
but first i need you to tell me what you've done with lex.

263
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,220
i put him in a placewhere he can't hurt anyone else,but i can hurt him.

264
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,990
no!

265
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,840
what did you do !with 33.1?

266
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,440
i didn't do anything.

267
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,540
i think it's pretty obvious i haven't gone anyny where.

268
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,530
don't lie to me.

269
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,500
it's the truth.

270
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,400
the truth?

271
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:32,020
the truth is you kept melocked up in a concrete bunker just when i was about to go back to a normal life.

272
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,250
a normal life?

273
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,640
you were never gonna be released from belle reve.

274
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,770
that was a figment of your fractured mind.

275
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,250
i was -- i was trying to help you.

276
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,950
where arethe other r patients?

277
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,960
if i knew,don't you think i'd tell you?

278
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,810
i didn't want tohave to resort to violenen ce,lex.

279
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,420
you're not giving me much of a choice here.

280
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,380
okay,calm down.

281
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,600
maybewhen i bring lana here...

282
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,570
we'll see i i f you talk.

283
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,550
i knewyou were a gadget junkie,

284
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,200
but this stuff lookslike it's from the jurassic era.

285
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,040
well,when i heard about mr.frequency jumper,

286
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,250
i decided to dust off my pop'sold ham-radio equipment.

287
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,600
ham radio?

288
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,990
people were communicating "worldwide longng beforethe internet existed.

289
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,880
i used to sneak downstairsinto the late-night airwaves.

290
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,940
my handle --jimmy the infuriator.

291
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,580
why does that "not surprise me?

292
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,320
all right,just listen carefully,girls.

293
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,900
no,i guess not.

294
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,650
right there.did you hear that?

295
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,270
how could you not?

296
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,540
that's a radio frequency.and after scanning all the footot age,

297
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,390
that sound kept coming back.

298
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,270
so,i tried blending thenarrow-band frequency modulation with the uhf modulation.

299
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,510
okay,just,here,check this out.

300
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,000
lex:don't worry.i'll find my way back to you.

301
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,730
it's him.

302
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,370
lex was in the room.you just couldn't hear him.

303
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
or see him. -oh,my god.

304
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,750
i just want tosee his face again.

305
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,490
lala...

306
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,260
i love you so much.

307
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,240
he heard everything i said.

308
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,460
lookok,this may sound absurd,

309
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,210
but i think that lex may be trapped in another frequency.

310
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,960
okay,kind of like a radio -- the way a.m.and f.m.are different frequencies

311
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,750
but they move through the same space.

312
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,260
can we communicate "with him?

313
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,320
there seems to be some sort of frequency loop in the library,

314
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,000
so as long as you'rein that room,i think so.

315
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,860
help! help! somebody help! 

316
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,030
run! go! 

317
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,400
you stole my food! 

318
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,160
nini ce try,krypton man.

319
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,900
you escapedfrom the phantom zone.

320
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,370
m no phantom.

321
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,620
i think it mustbe some kind of a glitch or --

322
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,990
 i don't knowmuch about this stuff,but i do know --

323
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:47,230
excuse m that when you hack into a s s ecure operating system,

324
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,470
you could pick upsome very nasty viruses.

325
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,010
i guess i better take that to heart.

326
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,990
miss sullivan,luthorcorp considers any breach of security a very serious matter.

327
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,150
and you know that.

328
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,160
mr.luthor,i'm trying to find your son.

329
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,420
i appreciate that.

330
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,080
in fact,i was hoping,being the diligent reporter you are,

331
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,590
that youcould provide a clue that would help meto find lex.

332
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,920
well,the only clue i haveis a little lab called 33.1,

333
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,040
otherwise knownas meteor-freak central.

334
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,500
i was alwaysys under the impression --

335
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,920
meteor freaks?

336
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,860
you're not in high schoolanymore,miss sullivan.

337
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,300
this is the real world.

338
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,950
please...grow up.

339
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,950
what's devious daddy warbucks doing here?

340
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,680
lionel luthor just ransackedall of my research,so now we're back to square one.

341
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,810
maybe not square one.more like triangle one.

342
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,650
jimmy,what's up?

343
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,660
triangulation.

344
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,520
i might actually have a way of squeaking lex out of that frequency.

345
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,320
lex,i know you're here.

346
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,150
hopefully,you can hear me

347
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,960
because therer e's somethingthat i --

348
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,850
that i want t to confess.

349
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:30,800
i have been so focused on our problems that i have lost sight of how much you really mean to me.

350
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,340
those times i was reluctant to trust you -- the fact is...

351
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,580
you're more honest with methan anyone's ever been.

i miss you.i miss you so much.

353
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,880

355
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,470
i love you,too,lana.

356
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,170

357
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,320
please don't leave us here.

358
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,360
i don't want to have this baby without you.

359
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,580
i know i should have told you.

360
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,430
stayay away from her!

361
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,290
lex,you arere here.

362
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,800
i'm sorry to have to put youthrough this.

363
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,450
either you tell me where you moved 33.1...

364
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,370
or you can say goodbyeto lana lang.

365
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,390
whatever lex has donein the past,i'll make him stop.he'll listen to me.

366
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,830
you hear that,lex?

367
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,670
even the love of your lifewants you to come clean and tell the world what you've done.

368
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,870
let her go.

369
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,360
"you can see him?

370
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,370
where is 33.1?

371
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,730
i told you,i don't know!

372
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,490
lex!

373
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,400
well,then,let's get t started.

374
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,140
i didn't know you had it in you.

375
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,020
why do you think they call me jimmy the infuriator?

376
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,050
lex is a dead man.

377
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,850
don't let him get away.

378
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,140
he's not going anywhere.

379
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,470
where is lex?

380
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,840
what's the frequency?

381
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,860
lana,what are young?

382
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,280
okay,that can't be a good thing.

383
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,360
we need that radiofrequency jammer now.

384
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,240
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

385
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,850
na.

386
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,690
she wanted to say goodbye !in person.

387
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,130
xxxxxxxxxxx

388
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,370
!whatever frequency !they're in,i have to jam !the exact same one.

389
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,830
so,what's the problem?#do it.

390
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,140
sure,no problem.

391
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,390
only a gazillion

392
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,830
to sort through.

393
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,030
jimmy,hurry.

394
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,390
xxxxxxx

395
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,740
lana.wake up.

396
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,320
lex...

397
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,220
you're okay.

398
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,120
why are you here?

399
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,370
i had to find you.

400
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,310
you shouldn't have done that.

401
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,350
#i think i'm getting something.

402
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,420
is it true?

403
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,410
youdidhear.

404
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,830
everything.

405
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,110
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

406
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,610
xxxxxxxxxxxx

407
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,170
your bloodmust make you strong.

408
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,480
i should taste it.

409
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,630
why are you doing this?

410
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,400
everyone's got to eat.

411
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,550
that was you,wasn't it?

412
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,050
whatever was on this floor wasn't your typicalcubicle farm.

413
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,940
there's enough power pumping in here e to light up metropolis.

414
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,220
something tells me #it wasn't justfor the fluorescent lights.

415
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,020
well,it's just a matter of time till i getto the bottom of it.

416
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,690
you really manned upand got right into this fight.

417
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,970
still wish clark was here to help?

418
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,580
oh,come on.clark kent can't hold a candle to the infuriaia tor.

419
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,430
find anything interesting?

420
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,330
yeah,i've got to say,this all just feels a little strange.

421
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,440
have you ever considered the possibility thth at maybe bronson was telling the truth?

422
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,500
and this wassome secret laboratory?

423
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,650
chloe,i don't think lex would have given us clearance if he had something to hide.

424
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,930
it seems like a lot of hoopsfor someone bent on revenge to jump throughif 33.1 never even existed.

425
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,300
chloe,that guy was delusional.

426
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,000
the meteor exposure #made him sicic k.he spent over a year in belle reve.

427
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,160
there's a lot more to this story than meets the eye.

428
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,640
you don't know the luthors.like i do.

429
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,530
you don't know lex.like i do.

430
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,510
i'm not gonna take the word of a homicidal man lex.i'm sorry.

431
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,110
lana,you can't provethat 33.1 didn't exist.

432
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,050
and you can't provethat it did.

433
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,000
it says on the door out there that this is my office --

434
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,980
my private office.

435
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,090
obviously,that doesn't mean m m uch to you.

436
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,850
you interfered with a project you haveve nothing to do with.

437
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,090
oh,you must be talking about -- what do you call it?33.1?

438
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,180
you should thank me #for coming to the rescue.

439
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,650
i'd hate to think of the legal repercussions if that,uh,clinic was discovered

440
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,880
not to speak of the dirt "that would stick to our corporate image.

441
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,970
you did thisfor selfish reasons.

442
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,480
your fascinationwiwi th the meteor-infected started long before mine.

443
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:41,780
but you have gone farther with this scientific experiment than i ever believedwas possible.

444
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,710
congratulations.

445
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,080
kudos,son.i'm proud of you.

446
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,830
your methodsare a tad disappointing.

447
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:54,610
you've still got a lot to learn #when it comes to the fine e art of,uh...secrecy.

448
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,880
what did you do !with 33.1

449
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,520
moved it -- #the whole shebang -- to a top-security location.

450
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,310
i'm happy to #let you have the coordinatat es.

451
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,090
just,uh...

452
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,300
one e condition.

453
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,280
and what might that be?

454
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,330
make me your full partner.

455
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,220
i want to know everythingabout this project.

456
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,940
it'll give us a chance to spend more quality time together.

457
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,950
so,what,your cellphone doesn't "get reception in seattle?

458
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,740
i was preoccupied.

459
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,570
that's fine,but you were up against an alien from another planet.

460
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,170
i was worried.

461
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,490
i'm sorry.

462
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,740
so,the crystal was a success?

463
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,240
no,it wasn't.

464
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,100
then did the zoner just decide to pack upand leave the solar system?

465
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,370
someone else killed him --

466
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,220
someone who can do things i could only dream of.

467
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,170
so,this someone --he's on our r side,right?

468
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,950
i'm not t sure.

469
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,150
clark,it's me -- your most trusted friend and d secret keeper.

470
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,330
how about a few details?

471
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,410
believe it or not,there are some things you don't need to know.

472
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,950
look,i understandthth at you feel like all these psychopathicspace invaders are your fault,

473
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,860
but you can't keep it all inside.

474
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,030
you feel the need to carrythe wowo rld on your shoulders,and that's noble.

475
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:49,590
but there are other people out there who o want to help youfight the good f f ight,#and you need tolet them in.

476
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,250
because sometimeseven heroes need to be saved.

477
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,340
lana,you should be off your feet.here.

478
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,080
sit down.can i get you something to drink?

479
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,020
lex,i'm pregnant.i'm not an invalid.

480
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,770
i'm sorry.

481
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,130
i just want tomake things perfect for you.

482
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,820
no,i'msorry.

483
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,090
i had no rightto keep this a secret.

484
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,130
i wanted to tell you.i i just...

485
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,080
i wasn't sure.

486
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,960
of how i'd react?

487
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,240
lana...

488
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,730
it's the best news i've ever heard.

489
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,920
really?

490
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,490
the woman i love is carrying my child --

491
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,370
ourchild.

492
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,360
what more could a man want?

493
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,910
listen,lex,um...

494
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,230
about this 33.1 place...

495
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,570
i already told you.

496
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,660
it never existed.

497
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,370
but if it did...

498
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,170
i'd understand why.

499
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,350
these people who havebeen infected by the meteors -- they're dangerouou s.

500
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,610
they've hurt me,and they've hurt people that i care abouou t.

501
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,240
the more we learn about them,the better we can protect ourselves.

502
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,210
and there's something else you need to know.
