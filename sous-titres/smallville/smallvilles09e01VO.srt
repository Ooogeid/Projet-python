00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,959
<i>Previously on Smallville...</i>

2
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:04,335
but what's with
the wardrobe malfunction?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,505
What? Where are you going
all dressed up?

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,195
When a guy likes a girl,
he asks her out.

5
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,970
I'm a true believer in this red-and-blue
superdude.

6
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:16,511
Can i count on you to publish
that letter if anything happens to me?

7
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:18,161
I have to see you.

8
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,795
How do you feel
about phone booths? Let's say midnight.

9
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:25,921
- Acting c. E. o. Of luthorcorp.
- You're my boss?

10
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:29,654
If you don't want to
admit your true identity, that's fine.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,461
But we both know
that davis bloome isn't a man.

12
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:33,991
He's a beast.

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,369
Lex knew that orb
wasn't from this earth.

14
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,437
There's life inside it
that can't be released

15
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:44,724
until the traveler kills the beast.

16
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:47,669
Use the ring.
Send doomsday to the future.

17
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,783
Oliver crossed the line.
He killed lex luthor.

18
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:56,385
You're making a big mistake.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,325
You're not one of us anymore.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,093
Say that clark kent, buttoned up
in a starched shirt and tie,

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,060
but then,
when he's playing the hero,

22
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,575
he steps out of the shadow
into his red and blue, creating 

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,694
two completely separate identities?

24
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,102
I love you.

25
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,938
May henry james olsen rest in peace.

26
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:18,557
Jimmy wanted to know that no
matter where i was in this city,

27
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:20,575
i could look up here
and see this beacon...

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,144
the watchtower.

29
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:23,712
I'm the reason jimmy's dead.

30
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:26,862
- What are you saying?
- Goodbye, chloe.

31
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,630
Clark kent is dead.

32
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:33,400
<i>And now the season premiere
of "smallville."</i>

33
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,225
My cousin has been missing
for three weeks.

34
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:51,040
Yes, i'm the same woman who called
yesterday and the day before that

35
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,108
and pretty much every day
for the last few weeks

36
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:56,269
because i have not been getting
any answers to my question.

37
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,719
Don't worry about the
second cursor on your screen.

38
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,484
I just hacked into
your system because

39
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,659
you have been
so completely unhelpful that i can't...

40
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,172
i wouldn't come any further unless

41
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:35,641
you're interested
in an impromptu nose job.

42
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:39,121
Dr. Hamilton.

43
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:43,250
If you would be so kind
as to lower the 9mm jericho 941.

44
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,495
I prefer "emil."

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,630
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

46
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:51,600
I've just been haunted by
my own share of ghosts lately.

47
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,703
- And the gun?
- After everything's that's happened

48
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:57,946
and being here alone, it's the only
way i can sleep. Did ollie send you?

49
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,808
I've been calling
him nonstop lately.

50
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,243
I know.

51
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:03,379
But you can stop calling.

52
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,481
Obviously he's not gonna answer.

53
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:08,357
They're gone, chloe...
all of them.

54
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:11,090
They're not gone.
Ollie, dinah, bart...

55
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,784
they're just vanished off the grid.

56
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,478
They don't want to be found.

57
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:16,896
Jimmy died because
they turned on each other,

58
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,891
and now they have to live
with that guilt.

59
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm sure that jimmy's death
is haunting clark every day,

60
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,414
but he still does everything he can

61
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,967
to make sure that the streets of
metropolis are still protected.

62
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:29,290
And he seems to be doing
an adequate job without his sidekick.

63
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,114
What the hell?

64
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:19,162
Smallville 901

65
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:26,837
Synchro: Flolo

66
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,744
For seriessub.com

67
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,865
kal-el, my son, you are distracted.

68
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,501
When you decided to return
to your training,

69
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,169
i assumed you were ready.

70
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,738
I've been coming here for weeks.

71
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:39,008
I've done everything you asked.
Why are you questioning me now?

72
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,478
Until today, you had focus.

73
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:43,902
You had cleared your mind and heart

74
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:47,650
of those who had kept you
tethered to the human realm.

75
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,986
If there's anything
that's keeping me tethered,

76
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,457
it's that i still can't fly.

77
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:56,083
Have i not earned
the same powers that kara has?

78
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,619
Your powers lie within you, clark.

79
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,123
Your physical composition is no
different than your cousin's.

80
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,669
You're saying it's all in my head?

81
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:09,789
You still see yourself as a human.

82
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,053
You're wrong.

83
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,323
I gave up everyone i cared about.

84
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:19,205
I gave up everyone
who was important to me.

85
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,552
I wear the symbol of our family
every day

86
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,640
to remind me that i have
a different destiny.

87
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,828
Perhaps you've tried
to move on too quickly.

88
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:27,924
The test of a true hero

89
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,895
is to struggle with feelings
of loss and to overcome them,

90
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,397
not to avoid them.

91
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:38,454
Something or someone
is holding you back.

92
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:40,861
No.

93
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:45,107
I've come this far,
and i'm not looking back.

94
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:46,955
I can do this.

95
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,089
Can i get a doctor over here?

96
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,494
The desk nurse called me.
Where have you been?

97
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,752
What happened to you?

98
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:09,804
Tess was rambling
about some alien orb

99
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,717
and then we threw down in
the middle of the daily planet and

100
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:16,571
wham, i wake up in a monorail
car with some ninja chick after me.

101
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:18,529
Alien orb?

102
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:21,243
I think maybe you just bumped your head
in the accident.

103
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:23,768
Wait.
Where have i been?

104
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:26,082
You were the one who was playing
"thelma & louise"

105
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,150
with the creature
from the black lagoon.

106
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,573
How did you manage to ditch davis?

107
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,681
I didn't exactly ditch davis.

108
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:38,734
It was the red-blue blur, wasn't it?

109
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,898
I knew it.

110
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:44,791
He promised me he'd save you,
and he did.

111
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,104
That means he's still alive.

112
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,406
The train...

113
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,076
he saved the train, too, didn't he?

114
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,235
You've been talking to the blur?

115
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:58,605
Yes, he sort of confides in me.

116
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:01,541
Of course he does.

117
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,534
Holy...
it's almost midnight.

118
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,657
I promised i'd meet him.
I'm gonna be late!

119
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:10,760
You are way beyond late, okay?
You just need to slow down.

120
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,695
There's something
that you need to know.

121
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,244
He is the only one who could help me
escape from the jaws of crouching tigers.

122
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,235
I'm sorry, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

123
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,903
No, you need to wait, okay?

124
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:24,397
I've got kind of a big bomb
i need to drop on you.

125
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,529
You know what?
You're right.

126
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:35,698
I probably just took one
on the noggin, and now i'm flipping out.

127
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,054
I think i could use a sedative.

128
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,023
It's been kind of a long day.

129
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,515
I'll get you two.

130
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,088
Hello?

131
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:07,374
Oh, no, no.

132
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:13,369
Maybe you're not calling
because you're here.

133
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:17,611
Hello?

134
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,362
Look, i know what you did for chloe.

135
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:23,056
At least let me thank you.

136
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,929
Look, i'm sorry i'm late.

137
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,534
I promise you can trust me!

138
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,783
Please?!

139
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,375
I know you're out there somewhere!

140
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,284
Where are you?

141
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:23,559
Isn't it time to move
beyond these mental trials ?

142
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:26,428
Your determination is strong, son,

143
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:29,665
but just as your passion
will be your greatest strength,

144
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,393
so, too, will it be
your greatest obstacle.

145
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:38,146
Jimmy died because of me,
and i can't afford

146
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,374
to let another mistake
like that happen.

147
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:44,798
You sent me here
to fulfill a destiny.

148
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,450
Tell me what you need from me.

149
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,953
Kal-el, you do not need me

150
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,060
to tell you what is standing
in your way. You already know,

151
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:58,618
and you know what you need to do.

152
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,889
I have to say goodbye to her.

153
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,703
I lost their trail.

154
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,429
There must be more of us out there.

155
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:33,471
What about the woman?
Has she spoken yet?

156
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,146
No, sir.

157
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,830
Permission to speak freely.

158
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:49,799
Major, the woman isn't an ally.

159
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:51,964
She's hiding something.

160
00:13:57,573 --> 00:13:59,876
And you think i am, too.

161
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,803
Why don't we have the powers
we should have under yellow sun?

162
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:10,162
My authority is being questioned
by two budding cadets.

163
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,089
We deserve to know what happened to us.
How did we get here?

164
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:16,393
- That is enough!
- Does anybody know we're here?

165
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:19,878
Salute.

166
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:22,990
Kneel!

167
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,795
Kneel before zod.

168
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,717
Oliver, i don't know
where you've disappeared to,

169
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:42,886
but i'm already low
on one superhero today,

170
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,454
chloe thinks i'm crazy,

171
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,357
and i'm low on clues as to why
some she-ninja is after me.

172
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:49,983
Call me.

173
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,026
Man: good find?

174
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,641
Look, on a scale of 1 to 10 of
illegal things i've done in my life,

175
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,916
this doesn't even hit the radar.

176
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,779
Okay, that didn't exactly
come out right.

177
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,948
All i'm saying is you
and your big boys in blue

178
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,117
have bigger fish to fry
than this little guppy.

179
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,909
So, i'm just gonna...

180
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,155
how about a name?

181
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,815
Lois lane, daily planet.

182
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:27,731
You're the reporter that's been
missing for three weeks?

183
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,956
Missing?

184
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:32,335
What the hell are you talking about?

185
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,469
What day is it?

186
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,939
It's friday...
the 25th.

187
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,464
What?

188
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:47,107
Where the hell have i been
for three weeks?

189
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:51,187
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.
You were m. I. a.

190
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:54,323
Until your name came up
on the list of crash victims.

191
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:57,060
Now, do you remember
anything last night

192
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:00,463
that would explain
how a 7-ton skytrain

193
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:04,592
belly flops onto main street
without a single fatality?

194
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:10,898
Guess we just need to chalk it
up to a modern-day miracle.

195
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,244
We could,

196
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:19,373
or we could chalk it up
to a vigilante on an ego trip.

197
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:24,445
Is that what
we call courage these days?

198
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,791
The infamous blur.

199
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,560
You know, the ends
don't always justify the means.

200
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,529
You might want to stick
to your night job, detective.

201
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,265
Graffiti's not exactly
the red-blue blur's style.

202
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,867
You're right.

203
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:39,903
It never used to be,
back when the guy

204
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:41,971
was happy pulling off
a few modest saves,

205
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:45,008
but then suddenly
there was no red or blue.

206
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,043
It was just the blur.

207
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:48,444
Now he feels the need

208
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,914
to leave his mark
all over the city to...

209
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,849
i don't know...
prove something.

210
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,283
Liberty 25.

211
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:58,111
Great, the rest of your posse
to interrogate me j...

212
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:02,692
you two want membership
in the mile-long club,

213
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,106
you might want to try one
that's still on the tracks.

214
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,330
Get out of here.

215
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,599
Okay, officer.

216
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,158
Not bad.

217
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:52,332
Oliver may be awol,
but his funds aren't.

218
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:56,012
Shouldn't you be mothballing a lab

219
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:59,348
or packing up
oliver's pleather collection?

220
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,651
You made a solid argument earlier.

221
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:05,780
Sometimes we try to forget,
but... there are things...

222
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:09,449
there are people worth fighting for.

223
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,099
I don't know what to say.

224
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:20,160
I'd be more comfortable
if we just got down to work.

225
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:24,573
My cousin lois vanished
for three weeks

226
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:26,042
and then suddenly appeared,

227
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,078
claiming that she was being
chased by a ninja-clad assassin.

228
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,613
Where was she?

229
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:32,715
That she has no memory of,

230
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,019
but luckily she did leave
a souvenir from her trip.

231
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:39,022
Now, i know
this may sound crazy to you,

232
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:41,048
but i think i know where she was.

233
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,027
The future.

234
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:47,287
Transversing chrono-anomalies.

235
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:53,428
I ran some scans at the time
of the monorail crash

236
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:57,173
and discovered two rips

237
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:00,533
in the temporal aperture continuum.

238
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,782
Okay, i've never actually
said this before,

239
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,252
but could you dumb that down
just a little bit?

240
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,687
Two rips in the fabric
of our universe.

241
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:15,648
Lois explains
one of them, but the other...

242
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:22,232
maybe she's not delusional.

243
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:26,226
Maybe somebody came back
from the future with her.

244
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,870
Who the hell are you?

245
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,141
Major zod.

246
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,990
I don't understand.

247
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,826
They talked about you
like you were their leader.

248
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,719
Before they lost their faith.

249
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,302
I ordered them
to find out what you know

250
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:29,863
about the circumstances
surrounding our arrival.

251
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,846
No wonder they weren't successful.
They took the wrong approach with you.

252
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:40,216
Let's leave
the getting-to-know-you part

253
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:42,519
- for later.
- It's obvious

254
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:45,221
you've become accustomed
to abuse over the years.

255
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:48,925
It only triggers
an obstinate reaction.

256
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,485
A more emotional approach
would have been my preference...

257
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,093
... preying on your vulnerability.

258
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,446
You're not the same voice
as the orb.

259
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:10,904
Who was that?

260
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:20,648
You don't know, do you?

261
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,717
And you expect me
to fill in the missing pieces?

262
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:27,454
I have no expectations of you.

263
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:35,505
I was told...

264
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,973
that you would come here

265
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:40,610
and save this planet
from its own destruction,

266
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:44,739
that you'd have certain abilities...

267
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,351
but you don't even know
what you're doing here,

268
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:50,376
do you?

269
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:55,750
They think you're holding out.

270
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,126
But when they find

271
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:00,029
that you're just as confused
as they are...

272
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:02,155
they won't need you.

273
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:12,867
I think if we work together,
we can get past the guard...

274
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,412
escape.

275
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,571
You'll be shot
before you reach the yard.

276
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,744
After the last few days...

277
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:32,328
... it'd be a blessing
to be shot to death.

278
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,988
I never said they'd kill you.

279
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:49,202
I, on the other hand,
will not hesitate.

280
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,799
For three weeks i've been trying
to track you down,

281
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,768
and you're completely off the radar.

282
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,235
Lois shows up for one day,

283
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,361
and you're as predictable
as clockwork.

284
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,646
It wasn't that
i didn't want to come by

285
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,671
and see that you were okay.

286
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:27,373
I know.

287
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:34,023
Leaving everyone behind...

288
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:35,758
it's not what i wanted.

289
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,660
It isn't about what we want, clark.

290
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:39,829
It's about what
the rest of the world needs.

291
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:41,230
I get it.

292
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:44,033
I was lucky to be a part
of your life for a little while,

293
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:48,137
but we both know that...
you'd have to move on one day.

294
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:52,266
I started the training
jor-el always planned for me.

295
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:57,246
With everything that i've
learned and he's showed me,

296
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:59,682
my old life seems very far away.

297
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:03,352
You're doing the right thing, clark.

298
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:05,554
You can't look back.

299
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,825
It's the only way
i can stay focused,

300
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,729
stay objective...

301
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:15,031
by letting go
everyone that i care about

302
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:16,766
and cutting every attachment

303
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:19,435
that may influence the choices
that i have to make.

304
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,504
So, what part of that

305
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,633
involves skulking around
a phone booth, looking for lois?

306
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,646
It's not like that.

307
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:32,782
Yes, i came back to find her
but only to say goodbye.

308
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:36,042
Well, let's hope
you still have a chance.

309
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,522
I think lois found your lucky charm

310
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,081
and hitchhiked to the future.

311
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,593
Is she...
she's fine.

312
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:47,630
She doesn't remember anything,
but she didn't come back alone.

313
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:49,465
And it looks like her excess baggage

314
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,391
might be trying to kill her.

315
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,922
Okay, just give me a second,
all right? I'll be back.

316
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,310
Hello, legs.

317
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:35,745
"Legs," really?

318
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,580
Is that a good idea?

319
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,981
You're drunk.

320
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:41,050
What are you doing here?
Where you been?

321
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:43,385
Didn't you get my messages?

322
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,255
Yeah, my phone's been kind of
m. I. a. For awhile now.

323
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,690
Ohh.
How'd you find me?

324
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,058
It wasn't that difficult

325
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:51,493
to track down the tabloid prince
of metropolis.

326
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,329
I just had to follow the paparazzi.

327
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:56,199
But your little, uh,
lame, sexist boy club

328
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,167
wouldn't let me in,
so i had to improvise.

329
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:01,537
I should forewarn you,
i'm not having my best round here...

330
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:03,072
this guy.

331
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:04,640
I noticed.

332
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,944
Look, you may be on
some death-wish fast track,

333
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,904
but i could really use
a little dose of hero about now.

334
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:13,883
Hey, lady...

335
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:15,517
listen to me!

336
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,153
I blacked out three weeks ago,

337
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:19,956
turned up in a monorail car
that's jumped off the tracks,

338
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,991
and now some assassin woman
is after me.

339
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,750
Can you repeat that?

340
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,333
Everybody, down!

341
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:46,282
I knew you'd be watching her.

342
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,684
I was never after lois.

343
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,509
I want you.

344
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:09,972
You followed lois from the
future to come after me... why?!

345
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:11,697
Because you betrayed us.

346
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:19,239
My father's watch.

347
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:32,686
The date is set
one year in the future.

348
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,396
How'd you get this?

349
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:36,056
You gave it to me.

350
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:45,274
How do you know about...

351
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,944
blue kryptonite takes away
my abilities, too.

352
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,703
We're of the same world, kal-el.

353
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,084
Why are you risking your own life?

354
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:58,321
Because it's the only chance
i have to defeat you...

355
00:27:58,446 --> 00:28:00,146
before you destroy our world.

356
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,244
I'm so sorry.

357
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,693
You're a mess.

358
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:26,318
Yeah.

359
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,365
Why don't you just come out
with it, lois?

360
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,822
- I'm disappointed.
- There you go. See?

361
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:34,137
You sound like every other
ex-girlfriend i ever had.

362
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:36,940
Yes, but i'm not like
every other ex you've had.

363
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:38,274
You're not.

364
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,367
I can't seem to get you
back in my bed.

365
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,480
You know what?
You can't fool me.

366
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,616
You risk your life to help strangers

367
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:51,745
so you can plaster that
frat-boy grin across your face.

368
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:55,449
But i know that you're
a real hero underneath.

369
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,196
When are you gonna learn, okay?

370
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:02,531
I'm nothing more
than a shallow playboy.

371
00:30:02,656 --> 00:30:04,800
I got the tabloid covers
to prove it.

372
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:08,929
Then how do you explain
the whole green arrow thing?

373
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:10,539
Yeah, the hero thing

374
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:13,176
kind of distracted me
for a little while.

375
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:14,401
So did you.

376
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:20,340
You're an obnoxious jackass.

377
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,519
There you go. See?

378
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:25,645
Now you're finally starting
to catch on.

379
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:30,693
I'm sorry if you ever thought

380
00:30:30,818 --> 00:30:32,428
i was anything more than that, lois,

381
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:33,720
but it's not my fault.

382
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:39,159
You know what?
That's okay.

383
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:42,238
Really?

384
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:46,367
I guess you'd know yourself
better than anyone, right?

385
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:50,013
You know what?

386
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:52,948
Maybe i don't
really need you, ollie.

387
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,408
I've already found my real hero.

388
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:19,475
At what juncture did you
join forces with major zod?

389
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,024
I never met the major until today.

390
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:25,515
And what about the others?
There should be hundreds of us.

391
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,383
We've only found dozens.
Where are they?

392
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:31,512
I was taking orders...
just like all of you.

393
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:35,358
I thought that i was saving
your civilization.

394
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:36,959
Do you really think

395
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,995
that a civilian
with no super abilities

396
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,899
would team up with one man
instead of an entire army?

397
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:47,703
If you want answers, why don't
you try asking the one man

398
00:31:47,828 --> 00:31:51,740
who has left you in the dark
this entire time?

399
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:53,776
Impressive.

400
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:56,379
Major, the last thing we remember

401
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:59,715
is our blood being taken in camp
before the battle in kandor.

402
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,218
How did we get here?

403
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:04,387
If we're here,

404
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:06,646
there can only be one explanation.

405
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:09,882
Our home has been destroyed.

406
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:14,387
You've taken it upon yourself
to betray us?

407
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:18,949
- Have you killed the others?
- What happened to our power?

408
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:27,100
You dare defy me?

409
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:33,307
I have saved the lives of half
of the soldiers in this room.

410
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:37,878
You know i have risked more
than any of you.

411
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:42,149
Not one of you has sacrificed
what i have for our survival.

412
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:45,751
And you...

413
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:51,434
... do you want a leader
who hides away in his mansion

414
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,460
for weeks on end and complains?

415
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:01,644
Or do you want a leader
who ventured out alone,

416
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:05,272
scouring a hostile world
in search of your loved ones?!

417
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:13,013
I have always been true to my word.

418
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:17,560
And i will find
the answers we are looking for,

419
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:20,820
or i will die in the quest!

420
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:18,153
It's over.

421
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:19,522
Who was she?

422
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:22,157
I don't know.

423
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:24,560
I have a feeling i'm gonna find out.

424
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:26,529
She's from krypton.

425
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:27,796
Krypton?

426
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:30,333
I don't understand.
What was she doing here?

427
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,800
What did she say?

428
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:34,737
She told me that i would cause
the end of the world.

429
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:37,273
It's like i have a ticking
time bomb on me, chloe,

430
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:40,075
and i only have a year
to figure out how to stop it.

431
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,378
You can't believe

432
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:44,247
everything an assassin tells you.

433
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:47,407
What does she know, anyway, right?

434
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,477
The future.

435
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:56,982
Right.

436
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:59,151
The future.

437
00:35:08,128 --> 00:35:09,429
What is it, chloe?

438
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:14,042
I want you to go back
and save jimmy.

439
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,169
Take the ring and stop him
from being killed.

440
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,340
You can't ask me to go...

441
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,354
you said that your sole purpose
for giving everything up

442
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:28,758
is so that you could dedicate
your life to helping people.

443
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:32,887
So, help him, clark.
Save him.

444
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:36,064
That would be changing destiny.

445
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:37,266
Whose destiny?

446
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:39,101
Not jimmy's...
you and i both know that.

447
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:40,869
He didn't deserve to die, clark.

448
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:42,772
He died
because you and i screwed up,

449
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:45,374
because we made a mistake.
Now you have to fix it!

450
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:47,476
I'm not a god!

451
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,712
And the last time
that i tried to rewrite fate,

452
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,037
my own father died.

453
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,443
He died right here in my arms
because of me.

454
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,723
I've given up
so much for you, clark.

455
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:14,260
This is the only thing
i've ever asked from you.

456
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,507
Please?

457
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:22,469
Please do this for me.
Please save jimmy.

458
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,806
I can't.

459
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:33,513
That's good.

460
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:38,084
It's good that you're embracing
your kryptonian side.

461
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:46,660
There isn't really
anything human left in you.

462
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,386
Miss mercer?

463
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:10,620
How are you feeling?

464
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:12,022
You should know.

465
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,825
You had a front-row ticket
to the entire thing.

466
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,051
How the hell
can they just disappear?

467
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:20,397
Where's my video?

468
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:22,966
You told us not to interfere
under any circumstance

469
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:24,968
when they came in
and took you hostage.

470
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:27,420
And i'm sure that you enjoyed
every moment of it. Just tell me

471
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,306
that my plan paid off.

472
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:31,208
Where are they?

473
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,877
We recorded hundreds of hours
of security footage

474
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,245
while they were here.

475
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,681
I've only been able to sift
through some of...

476
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:39,683
the feeds.

477
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,118
Oh, my god.

478
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:42,820
It's all gone.

479
00:37:42,945 --> 00:37:46,949
There's not even a trace
of the video feed files.

480
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,652
They broke through
our highest-security software.

481
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,267
I guess a few encrypted passwords

482
00:37:57,392 --> 00:38:00,928
won't stop someone who traveled
galaxies to get here.

483
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:21,691
There are laws
about stalking people.

484
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:23,050
You should know.

485
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:26,964
I'm not a cop.

486
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:30,200
Detective... whatever.
You guys are so touchy.

487
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:31,668
I don't work for the force.

488
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:33,737
You jumped
to that conclusion yourself,

489
00:38:33,862 --> 00:38:36,597
which i hear you do...
a lot.

490
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,844
Who the hell are you, then?

491
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:43,580
I'm a field reporter.

492
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:46,783
I spent the last few years
in afghanistan.

493
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,912
Hopefully that gave me enough
training to be your desk mate.

494
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:52,389
Don't bet on it.

495
00:38:52,514 --> 00:38:55,125
And don't get comfortable
in that chair.

496
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,593
Clark's coming back.

497
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,095
Really?

498
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,998
I heard he was visiting family
indefinitely.

499
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:02,766
Indefinitely?

500
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:03,991
No.

501
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:05,903
The guy never takes any time off.

502
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:08,896
I'm sure he's just cashing in
on some overdue vacation time.

503
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:12,409
Supposedly you've been fired.

504
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:15,136
Minor technicality.

505
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:18,239
I hope so.

506
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:26,380
I'm john corben.

507
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:31,985
I'll see you in the trenches.

508
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,047
Hello?

509
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,463
Thank you for saving me out there.

510
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:08,932
I was afraid you had
disappeared for good.

511
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:11,392
I should have.

512
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,705
I'm supposed to.

513
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,432
But i can't.

514
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:23,613
Promise me this is just between us.

515
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:26,039
I promise.

516
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:04,545
No!
