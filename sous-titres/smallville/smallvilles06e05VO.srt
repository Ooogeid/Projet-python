1
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,810
Wait,why are warrior angel
and black diamond fighting ?

2
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,770
I mean,they're friends.
It doesn't make any sense.

3
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,660
Didn't you read issue 126 ?

4
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,030
No,I didn't have any money that week.
Why ? What happened ?

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,960
Okay,so,you know how black diamond's
father is this supervillain,right ?

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,890
Well,in 126, he busts out of jail,
and warrior angel has to take him down.

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,780
But there's this accident,and the guy dies.

8
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,200
look who it is,boys...

9
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,780
weirdo angel and his trusty sidekick,
grease spot.

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,890
Give it back,Ollie.

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,980
That's Mr. Queen to you, little man.

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,310
It's okay,Lex. I'll just get another one.

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,850
Yeah,Duncan will just get another one.

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,840
Oh,oh,wait,he can't.

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh,yeah,that's right.
His mommy doesn't have any money.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,160
That's why he's on scholarship.

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,420
Shut up,Geoffrey.  Shut up,Alden.

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,820
Give it back...

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,360
Mr. Queen.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,210
Sure.

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,340
You know what ? Let's make this a two-parter.

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,030
Don't !

23
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,530
Nice haircut,cue ball.

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah. Come on.
These girls aren't even worth it.

25
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,920
One day,I'm gonna get those guys.

26
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,650
We had a stuffed crow at Smallville high.

27
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,190
Two different worlds,huh ?

28
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,850
In this case,I think I prefer yours.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,920
If that's how you feel,why come to this thing ?

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,810
Well,Lana,some of the deepest pockets
the country went to excelsior.

31
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,340
These alumni socials are good for business.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,820
let's be social so we can get the hell out of here.

33
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,370
Lana. Your billionaire drag you to this thing,too ?

34
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,120
Oliver's here ?

35
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,410
I don't get it.  You put a bunch of
pubescent boys in silly jackets

36
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,800
and cram them full of pomp and circumstance.

37
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,600
You're just asking for a round
of "lord of the flies. "

38
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,990
I don't know.  We all turned out all right.

39
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,380
Didn't we ?

40
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,850
I can only speak for myself.

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,320
Geoffrey,alden... how's business ?

42
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,380
Not as good as you, but,hey.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,030
And you guys were all friends ?

44
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,440
Something like that.

45
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,820
Man,after 10 years,gang's all here.

46
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,780
Except for Duncan.

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,490
Who's Duncan ?

48
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,060
Know what ? Maybe you ought to lay off,huh ?

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,060
What ? Like you weren't all thinking about

50
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,770
Alden. go,come on

51
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,100
Yeah,whatever.

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,040
Good to see you,Lex.

53
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,340
You did all right for yourself.

54
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,530
Duncan,if you were here, you'd still be a loser.

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,710
Oh,my god.

56
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,280
You all right ?

57
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,710
Just missed me.

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,450
Must be my lucky day.

Season 6 Episode 5</font>

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,750
I heard what happened.

63
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,240
Are you all right,son ?

64
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,020
Nothing a little dry cleaning won't cure.

65
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,100
That's distasteful,Lex, even for you.

66
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,590
What can I say ?

67
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,230
It's a nice suit.

68
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,840
You weren't alden's close friend,Lex, but still

69
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,530
I should muster up some tears anyway ?

70
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,540
Thanks,but I'll save them for
someone who deserves it.

71
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,260
I know,I know. Your life
at excelsior wasn't easy.

72
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,440
And I know that memories can haunt us.

73
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,090
But the best way to deal with them
is to leave them behind us,

74
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,060
bury them where they belong...in the past.

75
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,590
Along with everything else, right,dad ?

76
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,230
I'm glad you're all right.
If you need anything

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,880
I won't.

78
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,710
Perhaps miss lang will have better
luck comforting you.

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,410
Would you give her my regards,please ?

80
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,450
What are you gonna do when
you get out of here ?

81
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,970
Don't know...college,I guess.

82
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,260
Then what ?

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,280
My dad wants me to learn how
to run his business.

84
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,650
Are you gonna do it ?

85
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,480
Hell,no.  I can't stand that old bastard.

86
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,780
What about you ? What are you gonna do ?

87
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,670
I'm gonna help people, like warrior angel.

88
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,960
You better hit the gym.
Spandex is tough to pull off.

89
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,760
No,no,I don't mean like the cape and stuff.

90
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,890
I'm talking like a doctor or
a lawyer or something.

91
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,640
Lawyer ?

92
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,620
Yeah... working pro bono for the poor.

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,810
Don't let my dad hear you say that.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Why ? What's your dad got against poor people ?

95
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
Everything.

96
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,100
He thinks "poverty" is just
another word for "lazy. "

97
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,320
What do you think ?

98
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,880
I think it would drive my dad nuts
if I got a job working with the poor.

99
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,880
Got room for a partner ?

100
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,470
Allenmeyer and Luthor ?

101
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,650
Luthor and Allenmeyer.

102
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,460
Now all we got to do is graduate in one piece.

103
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,740
We got it. Let's go.

104
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,830
Hurry, You're so cool.

105
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,640
No one saw us.

106
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
What are they doing ?

107
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,940
Stealing answers to the midterms.

108
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,120
You know,you really didn't have to go
to all this trouble,Mrs. Kent.

109
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,290
You can't live on coffee three meals a day,Chloe.

110
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,290
I mix it up with the
occasional Blueberry muffin.

111
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,360
What ? That has a food group in it.

112
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,560
Barely.  Did you find anything new ?

113
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,500
Tons. There have been reports of unusual
occurrences happening all over the world.

114
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,880
It's like the wall of weird gone global.

115
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,870
The worst attack was on a small village
in the Kashmir region of India.

116
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,310
The entire village was nearly destroyed.

117
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,160
Villagers said they saw something
fall from the sky the night before.

118
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,750
That's the same time I escaped
from the phantom zone.

119
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,490
Do you think whatever it was got
out when you escaped ?

120
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,910
Like the park ranger ?

121
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,730
How about a trip to the ice castle ?

122
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,450
Jor-El could help track down the zoners
before they do any more damage.

123
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,950
Zoners ?

124
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,860
"Escaped supercriminals from the phantom zone"
is a little bit of a mouthful.

125
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,460
The fortress is dead.

126
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,930
There's no way to contact Jor-El,ask for his help.

127
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,510
I should have just listened to him.

128
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,080
And done what,Clark ?

129
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,370
Killed Lex to stop zod from
taking over his body ?

130
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,710
You're not a murderer, Clark.

131
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,900
What about all those people
in that village,mom ?

132
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,160
They might have died because of my actions.
I need to know for sure.

133
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,900
Then we need to find more crater impacts.

134
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,150
Like the one you made when you
came out of the phantom zone ?

135
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,490
I think our best bet would be satellite images.

136
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,880
I thought all the satellites
were down on dark thursday.

137
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,950
All except for a few owned by arrow industries.

138
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,890
Now,if we could get the access codes,

139
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,440
I might be able to find an image of whatever it is
that came down before the attack on that village.

140
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,450
Oliver Queen still owes me one.

141
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,540
Maybe it's time to collect.

142
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,820
Seeing somebody you laughed with,
shared so many good times together

143
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,350
seeing him laid out on the table like that...

144
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,860
at least they say he didn't suffer.

145
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,500
Yeah. But I'm guessing it didn't tickle,either.

146
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,710
Alden called me a month ago.
He said he wanted to go out for a drink,

147
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,920
and I...told him I was busy.

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,740
I said I'd catch up with him later.

149
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,570
You couldn't have known something
like this was gonna happen.

150
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,650
All the more reason to live for today.

151
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,750
Keep with touch with old friends ?

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Why don't you all get together
while you're here ?

153
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,590
What about that Duncan guy ?
Does he live in metropolis ?

154
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,050
Not anymore.

155
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,370
I actually have to be getting
back to Gotham,anyway.

156
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,030
Got a great gal there, Ollie.
Don't screw it up.

157
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,880
Smart guy. You should listen to him.

158
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm all ears.

159
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,760
Clark. I was wondering if my security system
would keep someone like you out.

160
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,710
Looks like you need an upgrade.

161
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,470
Or you need to learn how to knock.

162
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,540
It's okay. You know what ? You can keep that arrow.
I've got a new one.

163
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,350
I was thinking about developing
a boxing-glove arrow,and then I thought,

164
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,390
"come up with something a little fancier. "

165
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,480
Contained electromagnetic pulse knocks out
everything electrical within an 8-foot radius

166
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,280
cameras,laser systems, pacemakers.

167
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,390
That last one was a joke,Clark.

168
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,780
I'm laughing on the inside.

169
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,790
Maybe we'll get lucky one day,
and it'll bubble to the surface.

170
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,860
To what do I owe the pleasure ?

171
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,450
I need to talk to you about queen industries,
their satellite grid.

172
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,730
What about it ?

173
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,470
My friend Chloe,she's doing a story
on theglobal effects of dark thursday.

174
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,780
She needs satellite images from that day,
but none of them were working.

175
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,860
Except mine.

176
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,550
How'd you manage that ?

177
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,470
It's a trade secret.

178
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,870
Tell you what...

179
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,710
I'll give your friend Chloe the access codes
to the grid archive if you do one small thing for me.

180
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,530
What would that be ?

181
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,340
Help me figure out how Lex caused the
accidental death of two of my friends.

182
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,970
You think Lex killed them ?

183
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,130
I've known Lex a lot longer than you,Clark.

184
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,470
I've seen who he really is.

185
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm just saying we should think about this.

186
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,330
What's there to think about ?
We tell the headmaster what we saw,

187
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,000
and then queen and those two jerks are out of here.

188
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,910
But we have something on queen now.

189
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,410
No way is he ever gonna try anything again.

190
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,150
We could use this,

191
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,050
force him to act like our friend so we
can have some respect in this place.

192
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,070
You don't pretend to be friends with somebody,Lex.

193
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,880
You either are or you aren't.

194
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,010
I'm gonna turn them in.

195
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,180
I thought you said you were gonna handle this.

196
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,250
You told them ?

197
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,790
This is our chance, duncan.

198
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,280
We don't have to be on the outside anymore.

199
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,940
I...I never felt that way,
not when you were my friend.

200
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,370
Just listen to me.

201
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,900
Get out of my way.

202
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,210
Hey. Where do you think you're going ?

203
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,490
Just keep your mouth shut,
and everything will be okay.

204
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,250
Get off of me !

205
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,190
Yeah ! Get him !

206
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,680
Get on him !

207
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,140
Why do you have to be such a loser ?

208
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,190
Why can't you be like everybody else ?

209
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,490
Are you okay ?

210
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,420
Bad dream.

211
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,900
What was it about ?

212
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,390
I don't remember.

213
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,850
Lex, it's normal to be upset.
Alden died right in front of you.

214
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,980
Yeah,well,maybe he finally
got what he deserved.

215
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,080
How can you say that about your friend ?

216
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,690
I only had one friend at excelsior.
And it sure as hell wasn't him.

217
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,420
Do you want to talk about it ?

218
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,660
Not really.

219
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,040
Lana,I'm all right.

220
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm the last thing you have
to worry about.

221
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,420
The last thing,huh ?

222
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,370
Well,at least it didn't break.

223
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,750
Did you see that ?

224
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about,Lana.

225
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,190
See ?

226
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,450
Lex ?

227
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,870
Lana !

228
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,530
She sustained a fairly serious concussion,
but the cat scans are negative.

229
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,290
Couple of days' rest, she'll be fine.

230
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,830
I'll make sure she gets it.

231
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,290
Where's Lana ?

232
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,040
She'll be fine. That's the only
thing that matters.

233
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,200
I want to talk to her.

234
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,820
You lost your visiting rights
a while back,clark.

235
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,980
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for you,Lex.

236
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,720
Since you've been with her,
she has a funny habit of getting hurt.

237
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,120
And how many times did she wind up in the hospital
when she was dating you ?

238
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,740
Save yourself a trip next time,Clark.
Just send flowers.

239
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,660
That was harsh.

240
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,780
It's not like he's wrong,though.

241
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,260
I've hurt Lana more than anyone else.
She wouldn't even be with Lex if it wasn't for me.

242
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,660
Lana made that questionable choice on her own.

243
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,360
Stop beating yourself up.  That's my job.

244
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,910
And my other one is sniffing out a good story.

245
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,490
That's why you're here ?

246
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,070
I don't think Lana's chandelier run-in
was an accident or that she was the target.

247
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,110
In the past 24 hours,

248
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,620
two of Lex and Oliver's old friends from
boarding school died in violent accidents.

249
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,850
And you think Lex was almost the third.

250
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,560
I think it has something to do with
a kid named Duncan they all knew,

251
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,940
but Oliver won't tell me anything.

252
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,030
Listen,I don't want you to end up
sharing a hospital room with Lana,all right ?

253
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,770
Get some distance between 
you and Oliver just for now.

254
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,740
Or I could man up and get to the bottom
of this like a real reporter --

255
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,850
preferably before the grim reaper drops
something very heavy on my hot boyfriend.

256
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,260
Is Lana gonna be okay ?

257
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,630
I think so.

258
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,590
Looks like you're wrong about Lex being
the one behind the attacks.

259
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,250
Unless he orchestrated this one 
to throw off suspicion.

260
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,190
If Lex was the only one hurt,
then I'd probably think the same thing.

261
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,430
He loves Lana too much to risk her life.

262
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,020
These attacks aren't random.

263
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,910
Lois seems to think it may have something to do with
a kid you went to school with back at excelsior Duncan ?

264
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,320
It's not Duncan.

265
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,420
How can you be sure ?

266
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,400
Because Lex and I killed him 10 years ago.

267
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,930
Why do you have to be such a loser ?

268
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,860
Lex,stop it !

269
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,510
Dude...psycho much ?

270
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,420
There's something seriously wrong with you.

271
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,710
Duncan.

272
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,950
Get away from me !

273
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,870
You want to be one of them so badly,Lex ?

274
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,620
Is that it ? You can't stand 
being a loser like me ?

275
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,410
Well,congratulations,buddy.
Now you're their friend.  And you can all go

276
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,820
Duncan !

277
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,010
Duncan suffered massive brain injuries.

278
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,230
Is there anything else 
that you haven't told me ?

279
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,410
Just the denouement...

280
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,120
Lionel Luthor sweeping in with the best
doctors in the world to save Duncan.

281
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,040
Lionel ?

282
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,320
I thought it was an act of kindness.

283
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,730
Now that I'm older, I realize 
it was just an act.

284
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,620
Lionel was trying to cover up
what happened between Lex and Duncan,

285
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,700
trying to cover up the stink 
off the Luthor name.

286
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,280
How do you know about all this ?

287
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,600
He got the whole story from Lex.

288
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,860
Duncan was on scholarship.

289
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,470
His parents couldn't afford a band-aid,
let alone a team of neurosurgeons.

290
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
So Lionel promised to 
take care of the whole thing.

291
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,960
As long as everyone kept quiet.

292
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,280
Not that it mattered. 
Duncan died two days later.

293
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,940
It was an accident. It just happened.

294
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,780
No. No,I told myself 
that same lie for years.

295
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,920
The truth is all of us might as well have
pushed him out in front of that car.

296
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,810
Alden,geoffrey,Lex,me...

297
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,290
we all killed Duncan Allenmeyer.

298
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,000
What about his family ? If they believe you
killed him,one of them might be behind this.

299
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,060
The only relative I could find was his mother.

300
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,280
Where's she ?

301
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,740
Grandville cemetery.  
She passed away a month ago.

302
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,260
There must be someone else,
someone else you may have missed.

303
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,930
I don't know.

304
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,160
The only one who had contact with 
Duncan's family was lionel.

305
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,200
I'm not exactly high on his buddy list not
a good chance of him talking to me.

306
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:06,250
I was just on my way down the street 
to pastis for lunch.

307
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,140
You hungry ?

308
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,740
No,this isn't a social visit.

309
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,740
Oh,that's a pity.  The owner's wife 
does a souffl ? au fromage

310
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,540
that is,well, it is out of this world.

311
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,740
Duncan Allenmeyer.

312
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,470
How do you know that name ?

313
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,310
Oliver Queen filled me in.

314
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,490
Ah,yes,the queen boy.

315
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,990
He should know better than 
to dig up old skeletons.

316
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,580
I'm not sure he's the only one 
with a shovel in his hand.

317
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,440
These attacks...I think someone who
was close to Duncan is trying to settle a score.

318
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,370
Lex was the only one close to him.

319
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,210
No other family members besides his mother ?

320
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Didn't have any.

321
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,910
There's got to be someone.

322
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,100
What is it you're not telling me ?

323
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,470
Two people are already dead.

324
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,980
Do you want to add Lex to the body count ?

325
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,350
Now please tell me.

326
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,520
It was a tragedy, what happened to Duncan.

327
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,310
I did everything possible to help him.

328
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,100
I have continued to do that 
for the past 10 years.

329
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,850
Duncan's alive ?

330
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,830
My medical team was able 
to keep his heart beating.

331
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,840
But the injuries from his accident have
left him in a permanent vegetative state.

332
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,780
Why did you let everyone believe 
he was still dead ?

333
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,610
Clark...

334
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,180
...I didn't want Lex to be 
crippled by his mistakes.

335
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,090
I decided to make an arrangement 
with Duncan's mother.

336
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,540
In exchange for her silence...
going along with the story

337
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:11,020
I agreed to fund a research program dedicated
to reversing the damage to her son's brain.

338
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,220
This is still going on.

339
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,850
The best research minds in the world have
tried hundreds of different treatments,but

340
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,510
what if one of them worked ?

341
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,830
It's time for your treatment,Duncan.

342
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
Smallville ?

343
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,590
Lois, what are you doing here ?

344
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,030
I'm following a lead.  
I checked out Duncan's mother.

345
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,000
She's dead.

346
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,830
I know that,sherlock.

347
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,300
On a hunch,I dug up all her old phone records.

348
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,280
And every day while she was still kicking,
she placed a call to this facility.

349
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,740
She was checking on her son.

350
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,920
Duncan ? I thought he was dead.

351
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,970
Yeah,so did everyone else. 
I think he's in this room.

352
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,400
How do you know all this ?

353
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,170
You're not the only one with hunches.

354
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,380
Nice work.

355
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,380
Lois.

356
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,850
It's my story. I don't share bylines.

357
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,920
It's locked. You stay here. I'm gonna
flirt us up a set of keys,all right ?

358
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,550
Lois.

359
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,270
Maybe it was just stuck.

360
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,750
Well,ladies first.

361
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,820
Yes ?

362
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,210
He's arriving now, mr.  Queen.

363
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,790
Thank you.

364
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
Lex,I was wondering how long it was
gonna take you to pop up.

365
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,720
I've been busy... at the hospital.

366
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,010
I heard about Lana. Is she gonna be all right ?

367
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,020
She'll be fine... not that you really care.

368
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,730
No,I do care.

369
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,220
I care that a nice girl like that 
ended up with a guy like you.

370
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,410
Ever since you came to metropolis,
I've been kidnapped,my life put in jeopardy,

371
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,300
and now the woman I love is lying 
in a hospital bed.

372
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,420
And you think that's my fault.

373
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,030
Sounds to me more like bad karma.

374
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,830
Go back to star city, Oliver... 
while you still can.

375
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,630
I've seen that look before.

376
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,540
When was it ?

377
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,660
when you almost beat your only friend
to death back at excelsior.

378
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,960
That's good.

379
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,010
First one's free.  Next one's gonna cost you.

380
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,390
Poor little Lex,always blaming everyone
else for all of his problems.

381
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,360
Only when they're the cause.

382
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,930
You never could take responsibility
for what happened to Duncan.

383
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,660
Like your hands were clean.

384
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,940
No,not even close,but since then,
I've been scrubbing them real hard.

385
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,520
Yours just keep getting dirtier.

386
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,260
Look out !

387
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,340
Lex.

388
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,290
I'm not a doctor,but I've seen enough 
discovery channel to know

389
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,560
you don't get the squiggly lines
when you're in a vegetative state.

390
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,770
Guess the new treatments are working.

391
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,370
What new treatment ?

392
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,000
Something called 12-B. It's experimental.

393
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,530
It's derived from refined meteorites.

394
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,630
Clark,they started giving him this stuff two days ago.

395
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,210
Look at the injection times.

396
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,930
They coincide with the attacks.

397
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,200
Maybe we just found our killer.

398
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,170
No,wait a minute --these treatments,

399
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,680
they might stimulate brain activity,
but he's still in a wheelchair.

400
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,470
His body is,yeah,but look at his charts.

401
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,950
His new cocktail is whipping up is
whipping up a hell of an electrical storm.

402
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,110
Now,I read this article in the inquisitor
about brain waves and astral projection

403
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,980
Astral projection ?

404
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,780
Do you have a better explanation ?

405
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,210
No.  When was his last injection ?

406
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,090
20 minutes ago.

407
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,010
Oh,my god.  It's happening again.

408
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,810
Smallville,I...

409
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,110
What happened ?

410
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,120
You went awol while things heated up,as usual.

411
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,280
I went to go find a phone to warn Oliver and Lex.

412
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,490
Did you get ahold of them ? Are they all right ?

413
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,050
A little worse for wear. Oliver said
whatever happened just suddenly stopped.

414
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,420
Well,Duncan went flatline,like he blew a fuse or something.

415
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,140
I wonder what caused it.

416
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,530
You need that for your article.

417
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,180
Well,it would be good if I were
still going to write one.

418
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,620
But you're not ?

419
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,680
It would make a juicy story for the
inquisitor,but considering the outcome,

420
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,280
an exploitation piece on a catatonic patient
astral-projecting his way to revenge might
be in bad taste.

421
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:56,710
Would you still feel the same way
if Oliver wasn't involved ?

422
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,130
We've all done things we're not proud of.

423
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,020
I just wish that Oliver didn't feel
like he had to hide it from me.

424
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,940
You know...

425
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,170
...sometimes in order to protect the people we love,

426
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,510
we keep secrets.

427
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,770
That is... totally retarded.

428
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,960
I wasn't the most popular kid at excelsior

429
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,820
e way I looked,the rumors about
what happened to my brother,julian.

430
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,070
But Duncan didn't care.

431
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,220
He was my only friend.

432
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,060
And I betrayed him.

433
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,780
Lex,you were just a boy.

434
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,970
What matters is the man you've become.

435
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,230
You're early.

436
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,990
It's not often I get invited into the lion's den.

437
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,180
I didn't want you changing your mind.

438
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,320
I'm sure you two have a lot to discuss.

439
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,300
Mr.  Queen.

440
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,390
Miss lang.

441
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,340
You're a lucky man.

442
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,340
In more ways than E.

443
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,780
I should be dead, but here I stand.

444
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,280
You would have done the same thing for me.  Right ?

445
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,110
I wanted to say thank you.

446
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,290
And that's all I wanted to say.

447
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,520
I'm sure you have business to get back to.

448
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,120
Lex.

449
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,790
What happened to Duncan...

450
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,040
...the way I treated both of you...

451
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,670
...it's not something that I'm proud of.

452
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,680
I want you to know how much I regret it.

453
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,010
And I regret... ever thinking 
I needed friends like you.

454
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,150
Why did you lie to me ?

455
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,500
All those years, 
you let me think he was dead

456
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,540
what would you have done 
if you had known the truth,

457
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,570
make daily pilgrimages to 
the poor boy's bedside ?

458
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:14,740
Yes,I let you think he was dead. I was giving
you a chance to move on with your life...

459
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,350
To go forward,not back.

460
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,960
You didn't do this for me.

461
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,090
You convinced Duncan's mother to declare him
dead so you could use him as a guinea pig.

462
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,240
And one of your treatments tapped into a
very powerful part of the human brain.

463
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,100
All right,all right,let's assume that's true.
Would that have made a difference ?

464
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,120
You were responsible for what 
happened to Duncan Allenmeyer.

465
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,730
Nothing is ever gonna change that.

466
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,110
well like you said,dad...

467
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,850
...the only thing I can do is look forward.

468
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,360
I want to see the data on Duncan's 
last treatment.

469
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,640
Have it on my desk first 
thing in the morning.

470
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,670
So,the thing that attacked us,Duncan's astral 
body or whatever you want to call it,

471
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,220
must have been some form 
of electrical manifestation.

472
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:17,130
And it got fried by your electromagnetic
arrow along with what was left of Duncan's brain.

473
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,890
Yeah, I guess you're right.

474
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,850
You know,making the wrong choices and living
with the consequences it's not easy,is it ?

475
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,800
Speaking from experience,huh ?

476
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,540
More than I'd like.

477
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,010
We all make bad choices,clark. All we can do is
hope to make the right ones in the future,right ?

478
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,620
Clark.

479
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,170
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you had company.

480
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,730
Chloe,Oliver Queen.

481
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,450
I feel like I know you already.
Lois talks about you all the time.

482
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,920
I was actually just gonna go see Lois right now.

483
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,950
Maybe it's time I did some talking.

484
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,270
Well,look,I'm looking forward to your article on dark thursday.

485
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,560
I hope my satellite images helped.

486
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,460
Good.  It's good to meet you.

487
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,900
Clark.

488
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,340
In person, he is really...

489
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,990
Chloe,were you able to pull anything off the satellites ?

490
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,110
Oh,yeah,well,I'm still sifting through the images,

491
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,330
but I already found a handful of craters that match the
one u made when u busted out of the phantom zone.

492
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,900
Which means more zoners on earth.

493
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,540
Did you find the one in india ?

494
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,440
That was just a smoking hole,but I
did find another one in australia

495
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,960
that I thought you might want to take a look at.

496
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,220
Is there someone in the crater ?

497
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,320
I blew it up as much as I could.
It's not very clear, but...

498
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,390
what is it ?

499
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,770
Raya.
