1
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:11,007
Good morning, metropolis.
I'm your host.

2
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,370
And i'm your cohost.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,697
And we're here to help make
the start of your day.

4
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:28,672
Just a little bit brighter, right?

5
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,695
Right, a little less brighter.

6
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,825
Could we start over?

7
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,993
No problem. Just, let
me know when you're ready.

8
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,723
Great.

9
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,866
I appreciate you helping me audition.
I'm still angry you didn't tell me

10
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,199
how badly oliver was doing,
but you're here anyway,

11
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,395
so please don't make me
wish you weren't.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,694
It's okay. You don't need to get all
worked up like you usually do.

13
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:54,799
Excuse me, mr. "I'm slow and steady
and know what's best for everyone."

14
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,826
This happens to be important to me.

15
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,893
With newspapers on the
endangered-species list,

16
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,309
news television is my
one and only backup plan.

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,684
Don't you think you can be a little
less dramatic with this whole thing?

18
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,243
You could be a little more passionate
with this whole thing, but not you.

19
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,724
Not mild-mannered clark kent.
Do you even care if i get this job?

20
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,906
Of course i care.
I bought a new tie.

21
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,830
- I bought a whole new outfit.
- Yeah, you look great.

22
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:19,120
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

23
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,583
Don't you dare
reassure me right now.

24
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:26,339
I'm only doing this for you.

25
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,000
How else am i gonna
get that second date?

26
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:35,719
You should have thought about that
before you stood me up the first time.

27
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,745
Thanks, guys. That'll do.

28
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:44,677
I'm sorry, we weren't...

29
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:47,104
really,
one more time would be great.

30
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,814
That's it for today.

31
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,399
What do you say you come in
bright and early monday morning

32
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,206
and give it another whirl?

33
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,863
You got the job. Congratulations.

34
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,542
Great.

35
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:05,276
I guess this means you forgive me.

36
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:08,277
Let's just say i won't forget about you
when i go national.

37
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:11,992
Actually, we want you both.

38
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:14,311
I'm sorry?

39
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:18,492
No. He's just here to help me.

40
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:20,847
I am more of a
behind-the-scenes kind of guy.

41
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,178
That's good. That's real.
That's what people want nowadays.

42
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:26,092
Besides, you two, you
have great chemistry,

43
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,734
like hepburn and tracy,
regis and kelly.

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,902
It's a package deal, guys.
Either you both stay, or you both go.

45
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:50,669
Smallville - 9x06 - Crossfire

46
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,884
Synchro : Flolo

47
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,559
For Seriessub.com

48
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,166
from the look on your face,

49
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,002
i'm guessing "good morning
metropolis" wasn't so good.

50
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,438
- Did lois get the job?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,542
So did i.
They'd only hire us as a team.

52
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,528
How do i get myself
into these things?

53
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:59,580
What's your first story?

54
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:03,450
Online dating.
They want us to tape ourselves on dates,

55
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:07,006
send them to the internet and then
coffee-talk about them on the show.

56
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:11,392
Tackling morning television
to get back into lois' good graces.

57
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,694
This has got to be one
of your bravest moves yet.

58
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,269
As much as i care about lois,
there's nothing more important

59
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,231
than finding the kandorians.

60
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:20,872
You've been galloping
around the globe,

61
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:23,771
tracking down every kryptonian
crop circle we've found.

62
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,182
And every time, the kandorian
who came with it was long gone.

63
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,213
That doesn't mean i'm
gonna stop looking.

64
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:32,102
I think it's time to start
looking a little closer to home.

65
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,607
Tess has been reinforcing
her firewalls,

66
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,377
and she's cut the feed to
all her security cameras.

67
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,780
Now, given her attraction
to all things alien.

68
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,947
You think she's
building her own area 51.

69
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,864
Let me use watchtower to take
a sneak peek at her files.

70
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,411
All right. I'll see what
i can find on my end.

71
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,330
You've done everything you can.

72
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,665
You chose to come back to
your daily planet double life

73
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,228
as a cover.
That's what you need to focus on.

74
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:58,228
Just for today, leave
the kandorians to me.

75
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:17,324
- What are these?
- Release forms from kzxp.

76
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,734
They want us to fill them
out before we go on our dates.

77
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,862
I have to get a date
before i can go on one.

78
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,778
I'm still filling out
my online profile.

79
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,279
If you want these mainframe
matchmakers to pick you a winner,

80
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,555
you really have to be careful
to choose just the right words.

81
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:33,188
I filled mine out in
10 minutes this morning.

82
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:36,376
I guarantee that's the only
10 you're getting out of it.

83
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:39,232
Let's see what you wrote.

84
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,957
Under "likes," you have the theater.

85
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,681
You mean movie theater.

86
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:50,957
Details.

87
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:54,343
Favorite drinks, you have "bubbly."
Yeah, if it comes in a six-pack.

88
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,965
I do like a six-pack.

89
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,949
There's nothing on here
about monster trucks.

90
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,276
- You love monster-truck rallies.
- This is morning television.

91
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,683
Monster trucks are not
gonna guarantee me a guy

92
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,366
who will impress the home viewers.

93
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:13,163
There are a lot of good things about you
that would attract a lot of great guys.

94
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,540
Really? Like what?

95
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,800
You're lois.

96
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,106
Thanks.

97
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,264
But i already filled out my name.
Good luck on your date.

98
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm sure you'll sweep
her off her feet.

99
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:22,607
That's right.

100
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,940
Yeah! All right!

101
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:31,575
Why you got to keep making
me hunt you down?

102
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,928
Besides, how are you
supposed to pay me back

103
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:38,165
if you keep running away?
Now, come on.

104
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,236
We wouldn't want anything to happen
to that pretty little face of yours.

105
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,207
That's your money-maker, baby.

106
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,044
Nice wheels.

107
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:02,312
Nice leather.

108
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,656
Still, nothing compares
to aston martin's original v8 vantage.

109
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,593
You know your cars.

110
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:20,373
Why don't you take it
easy, there, speedy?

111
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:23,061
I'm trying to stay away
from life in the fast lane.

112
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,087
Why are you cruising for company?

113
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,088
I'm not cruising for company,
actually. I was looking for you.

114
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,252
I've seen you fight.

115
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,775
You got speed, strength.
You're talented.

116
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,559
Why do you care?

117
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,687
I'm just, somebody trying
to help you fix your life.

118
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,106
That last guy was twice your size,

119
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,860
kept on beating you down and
you just kept coming back after him.

120
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:51,029
I don't bruise that easily.

121
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,240
Maybe not on the outside.

122
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:55,781
I know what i'm talking about,

123
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:58,435
because i used to fight for
the same reasons that you do.

124
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,267
It never mattered who was
standing across from me,

125
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,674
because the real
battle was with myself.

126
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,879
I can train you...

127
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,693
to teach you how to
overcome your fear,

128
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,800
all that hate in your heart,

129
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,085
and get you off the streets.

130
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,586
My hero.

131
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:29,022
What's this help
gonna cost me... hero?

132
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,861
Just a little time...

133
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,071
time enough for me to prove
to you that you can trust me.

134
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:49,462
I can handle any hacker.
But i think that you should know

135
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,899
someone's trying to get through to us
right now, i think they're pretty good.

136
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,225
Then be better.

137
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:58,438
Fix the situation, stuart,

138
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,098
or i'll have you terminated.

139
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,669
By terminated, though,
you mean fired, right?

140
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,920
Right?

141
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:21,444
Thank you all for coming today. For
years, i've tried to steer luthorcorp

142
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:24,323
towards more environmentally
conscious projects.

143
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:27,145
I just had to prove that going green

144
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,637
also meant going up
on the stock exchange.

145
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:33,075
Because thanks to the
cutting-edge technology

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,977
we've acquired through our new
partnership with r.a.o., inc.,

147
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:40,551
i believe this project
will put luthorcorp on top,

148
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,043
metropolis on the map, and
our planet back on course.

149
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:02,957
I give you the world's first
completely self-sustaining solar tower.

150
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:07,685
This one tower will
generate enough clean energy

151
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,901
to power all of metropolis.

152
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,986
Bravo, tess.

153
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:23,364
Congratulations on an exceptionally
well-realized effort.

154
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,709
Mr. Zod.

155
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,665
I never expected to see you here.

156
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,325
Interesting,

157
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:38,447
seeing as i am now chairman
and c.e.o. Of r.a.o.

158
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,068
Please. Hold your applause and
save it for the real hero.

159
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:48,757
Our stunning hostess, tess mercer.

160
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,943
And by taking on this project,

161
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:55,622
she is making my simple dream

162
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,972
of harnessing the powers
of the sun a reality.

163
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,720
So here's to tess mercer...

164
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,623
our savior.

165
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:14,432
I swear to you all this
tower will change the world.

166
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:31,134
Sound-check time.

167
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,044
Just say, "one, two, three."

168
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,228
One, two, three?

169
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:46,681
Put it in your ear first, big guy.

170
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:51,103
Just tap it once to turn it on.

171
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,572
One, two, three!

172
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,009
<i>Talk about green.</i>

173
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,052
<i>It's like your first day at
the daily planet all over again.</i>

174
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:08,245
Does this mean i'm about to hear
lois lane's rules of online dating?

175
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:11,852
There really is only one rule
when it comes to dating, 

176
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:13,394
show up.

177
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,752
Like after you ask someone
to a monster-truck rally,

178
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:18,323
it's a good idea to
show up to the date.

179
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,260
Maybe we should talk about
this when we're not being taped.

180
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,035
Let's talk about something else.

181
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,837
Like your online-dating profile.

182
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,896
But that was supposed to be private.

183
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:38,286
I'll give you this. You
definitely were honest.

184
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,821
But admitting
that you grew up on a farm

185
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,224
is either going to get you
a date with a country mouse

186
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:46,408
or a cougar looking
for her next meal.

187
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,623
I'm catherine.

188
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:55,893
Or not.

189
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,061
Hello, catherine.

190
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,779
Have a seat.

191
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:09,523
I've seen these blind-date shows
on television before,

192
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,610
but i never actually
thought i would go on one.

193
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,712
This isn't live, is it?

194
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,939
They're taping it to
air at some other time.

195
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,195
If you can't take the heat, sister,
get out of the caf?

196
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:25,668
Sorry. I have this, really
annoying ringing in my ear.

197
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,503
I understand.
I'm nervous, too.

198
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,771
I can barely hear anything
over my own heartbeat.

199
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,039
Please!

200
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,708
Just try to treat this
like any other date.

201
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:40,467
That's the problem. I'm kind of busy
so i don't go

202
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:43,941
- on dates much.
- What is it that keeps you so busy?

203
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,926
Until recently, i was overseas...

204
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,971
skiing in switzerland,
modeling in milan.

205
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,932
Where i was working
in the peace corps.

206
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,477
But then i decided to come
to metropolis to take my phd.

207
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:59,306
I couldn't decide between
sociology or social justice so

208
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,525
i'm doing both.

209
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:03,318
Is she for real?

210
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,206
Congratulations.

211
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:08,658
You're dating mother
teresa in 6-inch heels.

212
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,449
You're welcome.

213
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,468
- I didn't thank you.
- You should,

214
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,183
because while your teams were out
scouring the globe, failing to find us,

215
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,738
i was using our considerably
evolved intelligence to make luthorcorp

216
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:41,273
the most technologically
advanced company on earth.

217
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,002
And the question is what
do you want in return?

218
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:48,173
Someone who betrayed us.

219
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,825
The one you call the blur.

220
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,526
I'm flattered you think,
of all the people on this planet,

221
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:01,217
that i'd know how to
find the blur, but...

222
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:03,622
you disappoint me.

223
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:09,631
But i'll play your game.

224
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,570
The blur's blood was used
as an antidote to a virus

225
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,609
that swept through
metropolis weeks ago.

226
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,919
We were able to get a
sample of that blood.

227
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,978
We took it to the lab to be tested.

228
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:26,776
Instead, every last
drop had been destroyed

229
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,323
at your request.

230
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:33,762
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:37,030
Since you chose to destroy
the blur's blood samples,

232
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,122
i'm guessing you're
trying to protect him,

233
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,250
maybe for some altruistic reasons,

234
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:45,722
or maybe you want to use
him as a bargaining chip.

235
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:52,580
I helped free
your people from that orb

236
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:55,618
because i'd hoped you'd
save humanity from itself.

237
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,809
But the only way i can
make sure that happens

238
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,747
is if we're equal partners.

239
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,929
No human will ever stand

240
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,698
on equal footing with a kandorian.

241
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,837
Make her tell you
where this blur is.

242
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,107
Or kill her.

243
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,349
Yes, major.

244
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:57,492
I need your help.


245
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,828
- It's not a good time.
- You know how clark and i have

246
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:02,440
this side job hosting
"good morning metropolis"?

247
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,811
Clark kent's hosting
morning television?

248
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,214
I can't wait to watch him
show me how to bake a cake.

249
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:13,060
Our first report
does have some heat,

250
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,115
but it's not about baking.

251
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,618
They set us both up on blind dates.

252
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,934
Clark's on a blind date?

253
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,892
Talk about footage of a train wreck.

254
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:25,972
You might want to save
the space on your dvr,

255
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,203
because here's the kicker.

256
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:30,702
He did great.

257
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:34,415
You want to be better.

258
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,550
That's why i'm here.

259
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:39,075
I need you to tell me my red flags.

260
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,731
Red flags?

261
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:43,288
Anything about me
that annoyed you while we were together.

262
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:46,520
I bought a killer dress.
I reserved the entire ace of clubs.

263
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:48,462
But if i don't identify
my deal-breakers,

264
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,831
they're gonna cancel this date
before it even gets to air.

265
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,367
Call it selective memory
or short attention span,

266
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,756
but i only remember the good things.

267
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:59,397
Like how you used to brush your
hair back when you were nervous

268
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,432
or you used to call out
football plays in your sleep.

269
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,439
Thanks for the workout,
ollie, but time's up.

270
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:12,901
Do you think you could
pay me in smaller bills?

271
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,313
Nice towel, honey.

272
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:18,649
Where will she put the money?

273
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,744
See the thing is,
we were just sparring.

274
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:24,852
Don't worry, i'm not here to judge.

275
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,321
I just kind of hoped you'd
spend more than one week clean

276
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,328
before you got back in the gutter.

277
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,431
Sorry i interrupted your sparring.

278
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,114
Finally.

279
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,530
Another firewall?

280
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,371
That's right, my hapless
hacker. You have been served.

281
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,416
What? Already?

282
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,512
Damn. You are fast.

283
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,124
I see your anonymous proxy filter

284
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,360
with your reinforced
protocol encryption,

285
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:23,185
and i raise you one rewritten a.c.l.

286
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,640
Denied.

287
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,930
Now you made me angry.

288
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,601
I thought you said
no strings attached.

289
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,658
I'm not trying to
sleep with you, kid,

290
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,915
but if you think a pebble
in your shoe is painful,

291
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,087
wait till you feel what
a $50,000 watch will do.

292
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:03,838
Thank you.
Why don't you look around?

293
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,472
Why would you want to go
back out on the streets?

294
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,422
You don't get it.

295
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:11,194
If i can finish paying off
what i owe rick, i'm done.

296
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,338
I'm free.

297
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:17,358
How much do you owe rick?
I'll cover it.

298
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,695
And then i'd owe you.
I don't think so.

299
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,781
- I'm not that kind of guy.
- Don't tell me about types, okay?

300
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,260
I know them all,
rick's type, your type,

301
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,662
political types, twisted types.
And i'm sick of all of you.

302
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,917
I'm not gonna trap you here.

303
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,571
I would just like to see you
do something with your life

304
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,855
that you can actually be proud of.

305
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:47,161
Why would you help someone like me?

306
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,050
Because i know what it
feels like to be stuck

307
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,394
in a place that you feel
there's no escape from.

308
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,745
And my friends...

309
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,253
helped me find the way out.

310
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,102
If i stay...

311
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,181
- it's gonna cost you.
- Way ahead of you.

312
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,814
I went ahead and had my
staff buy you some clothes.

313
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:19,310
I'm sure you'll find something
in there that you like.

314
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:26,308
I hope you dress
as fast as you drive,

315
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,790
'cause i'm gonna need you
to drop me off somewhere.

316
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,072
- You got anything stronger?
- Of course.

317
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:49,607
The last thing you need is a drink.

318
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,539
Thanks.
You sound like my mother on prom night.

319
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,244
How do i look?

320
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:03,631
If this were a prom,
you'd be crowned queen.

321
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,052
Your date's a lucky man.

322
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,366
Do i detect a note of jealousy

323
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,892
from the notoriously
nice clark kent?

324
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,520
Careful my date doesn't hear you.

325
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,898
He might just have to take you down.

326
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,601
I'd like to see him try.

327
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:27,278
You know what they say,
all's fair in love and war.

328
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:31,146
And what's it gonna be for us,
love or war?

329
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:35,378
It sounds like you're asking me out
on another date.

330
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,502
If i was, would you say yes?

331
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:45,798
I'll tell you what i'd say.

332
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,854
- What are you doing here?
- You wanted this television tryst

333
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,167
to make an impression, right?

334
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:06,235
My blind date... is with you?

335
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,081
Technically, your blind
date's leaving in the elevator.

336
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,618
I paid him to go seek
his 15 minutes of fame somewhere else.

337
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,606
You tell smiley he shows
up light one more time,

338
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,496
he's gonna go home in a box.
You understand me?

339
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:41,146
I wasn't sure you'd show up,
princess.

340
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:44,172
This should finish
paying off what i owe you.

341
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,761
It belongs to oliver queen.

342
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,036
He's probably got 20 of these things.
The guy's richer than the luthors.

343
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:52,332
A safe bet says he's got a safe

344
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,752
stuffed with cash someplace...

345
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,471
which is why i want you to show us

346
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,919
where you dropped him off tonight.

347
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:03,751
Did you honestly think
i would let you go?

348
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,672
Mia, honey,
you're my top earner, baby.

349
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:11,285
So you remember if you
run, i will find you.

350
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,674
If you move to another city,
my friends will hunt you down.

351
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,802
No second chances.

352
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:42,506
I always kind of took
you for a beer girl.

353
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,845
Only the finer things
in life for lois lane.

354
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:50,324
Yes, right. Of course.

355
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,403
Then a toast.

356
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:54,189
Let's not.

357
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:09,043
It's bad enough that i catch you
dragging yourself through the mud again,

358
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,137
but now you're bound and
determined to ruin my date.

359
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:16,704
Okay, that meeting
that you walked in on, that was

360
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:19,051
someone i was actually helping.

361
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,365
You obviously helped
her out of her clothes.

362
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,105
Very funny. And i'm not
here to sabotage you.

363
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,878
I just thought your audience
might want a date with metropolis'

364
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,864
most eligible billionaire bachelor.

365
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,990
That'd be me.

366
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:36,027
I guess it wouldn't
hurt the ratings.

367
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,808
You got 10 minutes
to explain yourself.

368
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,683
I'm only gonna need one,

369
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,603
because there's really only
one reason why i came here.

370
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,526
I never finished saying what
it is that i loved about you.

371
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:01,827
What's going on?

372
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,080
I don't know.

373
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,164
Let me just skip to the end.

374
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,863
The thing i love
about you the most...

375
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,930
is that you're still in my life...

376
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,634
because you're still in my heart.

377
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,128
Check, please.

378
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,615
Sorry.

379
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,109
Couldn't this heart-to-heart have waited
until the cameras were off?

380
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,995
I'm not hiding my feelings anymore.

381
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,209
And i kind of figured by saying
all that stuff with the cameras on,

382
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,611
i could prove that to you.

383
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:53,279
I had no idea 

384
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,713
you still had such strong feelings.

385
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,668
I went to a really dark place.

386
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,292
And i think

387
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,932
 it took going
there and coming back to realize...

388
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,108
you're the best part of my life.

389
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,802
I love you.

390
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,623
As a dear friend...

391
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:35,880
which is why i have to be
totally honest with you.

392
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,986
Yes.

393
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:55,182
I'm happy you know what you want.

394
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,905
I guess it just hurts
knowing it's not me.

395
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:04,659
I am so sorry.

396
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,252
Good night.

397
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,251
I said i was your
friend, and i meant it.

398
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:52,957
I am not going to let you
wander down any more dark alleys.

399
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,326
Thank you.

400
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,923
But you don't have
to worry about me.

401
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:02,925
I'm all about embracing life right now.
I'm not trying to end it.

402
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,826
You know what i mean? Trying
to take the right kind of chances.

403
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,932
And you, my friend, were definitely
a chance worth taking.

404
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,046
Thank you.

405
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,716
Is towel girl your driver now?

406
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:31,384
- Maybe your plan "b"?
- Very funny. Her name is mia.

407
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:34,665
And come on. I'll introduce
you for real this time.

408
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,386
I'm sorry.

409
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,479
What's your hurry?

410
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,116
Great work today.

411
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,845
Have you seen the new marketing ad?

412
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:23,439
I have high hopes for you, too.

413
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:31,451
So did i.

414
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:40,452
- You said you wouldn't hurt him.
- Back in the car.

415
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:43,606
Tell me you didn't pick prince
charming here over oliver.

416
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:46,330
Shut up and get in your
carriage, cinderella.

417
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,392
Get off of me!

418
00:31:58,105 --> 00:32:00,189
Pretty boy's worth billions,

419
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,503
but you're not worth the headache.

420
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:14,594
- I can't let you do this.
- Check this out.

421
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,472
Streetwalker thinks
she's a street fighter.

422
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,937
What are you gonna do?

423
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:23,090
- Stay where you are.
- You gonna gun me down?

424
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:29,058
You don't have it in you.
You're no hero.

425
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:44,436
Go! Go!

426
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,391
Come on! Let's go!

427
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,488
You will respect me.

428
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:01,265
Leave me alone.

429
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,863
I'm afraid i can't do that.

430
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:07,079
Excuse me?

431
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:17,854
I had to wait until we were
locked down for the night

432
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:20,886
so we won't be interrupted.

433
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,877
You're kandorian.

434
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:33,002
And i have a message from major zod.

435
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:35,610
Tell me where the blur is...

436
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,564
or you die.

437
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:51,342
- Did you find a lead on the kandorian?
- I've run every play in my playbook

438
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:52,844
to try and access tess' files,

439
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:54,912
but she's got one hell
of a defensive line.

440
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:58,946
The good news is that i've
only counted 100 firewalls,

441
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,449
so i think i'm actually
about to score.

442
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,667
<i>Greetings, esteemable
foe, whoever you are.</i>

443
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,732
<i>Now, i'm guessing since
you've made it this far,</i>

444
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:16,801
<i>you probably haven't slept,</i>

445
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,136
<i>and your fingers are
getting really cramped up,</i>

446
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,068
<i>so i thought i would
take it upon myself</i>

447
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:24,305
<i>to do you a big favor
and just say give up.</i>

448
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,438
<i>I can do this all day and all night.</i>

449
00:36:26,563 --> 00:36:29,089
<i>I'm sure you already
get the picture, so</i>

450
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:31,478
<i>talk to the hand.</i>

451
00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:35,868
Hello, hand.

452
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,999
Stuart campbell, graduate of m.i.t.,
talk to these hands.

453
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,043
Nice work.

454
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,133
It looks like stuart campbell
is tess' tech boy wonder,

455
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:00,645
and he has done some
pretty heavyweight hacking of his own.

456
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:04,187
Government databases, corporations.

457
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:07,499
We could do a lot with
this kind of leverage.

458
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:10,601
Maybe even get him to join us.

459
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:14,480
It'll be an even match.

460
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,569
This guy is so good, every time i'd
get close, he'd show up and block me.

461
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,163
I know the feeling.

462
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,660
Lois and oliver.
Seeing him with her.

463
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,069
It's been a long time
since he looked that happy.

464
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:33,152
Just stop, okay? Your willingness to
sacrifice yourself for others

465
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,626
is a great strength, for sure,

466
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,754
but when it comes to your own happiness,
it's definitely a weakness.

467
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,466
But oliver's been through a lot lately
and we're all friends.

468
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:43,551
Lois is not up for auction.

469
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,313
For once, try not to
second-guess things.

470
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,345
All you have to do is ask yourself

471
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:50,322
what do you want?

472
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:52,276
Did you hear?
The brilliant brass over at kzxp

473
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,858
have decided to go with someone
else for their morning show.

474
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:58,057
After everything that happened,
after ollie and i almost got killed,

475
00:40:58,182 --> 00:41:00,122
guess who they've
decided to go with.

476
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:03,371
Apparently blondes test
better with morning viewers.

477
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:06,380
I'm sorry. I never should have tried
out in the first place

478
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,102
or dragged you there
with me, and i just...
