1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,390
don't tell me I missed the special
4:00 A.M.Predawn tour.

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,990
You know,your currentmachinations have forced you
to conduct businessoutside regular business hours.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,290
I supposeI should find it comforting
that you're still checking upon every move I make.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,590
What is it you findso compelling
about these tunnels,abandoned for decades?

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,690
I'm spearheadinga water-purification program.

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,390
A little researchwould have assured you
it's public knowledge.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,790
Please spare me.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,390
How long have you been scouting
the tunnels, huh? Months?

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,590
There's something down hereimportant to you,

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,490
more important than the approval
from a few eco-enthusiasts.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,590
Don't worry, dad.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,390
I still have plenty of land to conquer above
sea levelbefore I take on the underworld.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,190
And what unknown world will behost 
to project ares?

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,190
Hey!

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,490
This is a restricted area.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,490
Mr. Luthor,you're right on time.

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,890
You mind telling me whatthe
hell you're doing here?

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,390
Love to.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,090
In fact, I've already arranged
someplace a little more private.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,290
You need to pack your thingsand leave 
immediately.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,190
I'm calling security.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,190
Invitation only.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,690
Lex!

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,390
Dad!

***

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,690
Mom, what happened?

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,890
They just called and said there
was some kind of explosion.

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,090
Lionel, it's martha and clark.
We're here.

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,090
Lex.

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,390
I left lex a message and said
it was an emergency.

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,590
He's still down there.

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,590
Folks, he has to get into the E.R.

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,690
Clark. Clark.You have to help him.
Lex is being held hostage.

37
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,890
Do the police know
what happened to him?

38
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,590
Yes, but there's no time.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,490
- We need to move.
- One second.

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,590
Where is lex?

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,290
They'll never find him,
even if they get through the debris.

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,190
It's a maze of tunnels.

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,290
You've got to find him, clark.

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,190
He's put something terrible
into motion down there.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,590
Lex is the only one
who can stop it.

46
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,490
Let's go.

47
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,390
Let's go.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,590
Well, welcome back to sub-civilization.

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,090
What happened to my father?

50
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,190
Not my problem.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,090
He was never part of the plan.

52
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,790
What do you want?

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,890
My husband --

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,690
U.S. Special forces weapons 
sergeant wes keenan,

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,890
the soldier you plucked from the battlefield.

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,590
Luthorcorp has many subsidiaries, 
ms. Keenan,

57
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,990
but I'm fairly certain human trafficking
isn't one of them.

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,790
I got notice four months agothat wes died
when his chopper was shot downin afghanistan.

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,990
I knew in my heartit wasn't true.

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,190
It's hard to accept,
but the heartsometimes lies.

61
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,290
When you love somebody,
really love them,

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,290
you knowwhen you've lost them.

63
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,790
I don't doubt your lovefor your husband, 
ms. Keenan.

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,290
There was no chopper crashthat day.

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,490
In fact, there wereno chopper crashes reported
that entire month.

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,790
And then the military failedto produce his body.

67
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,190
Uncuff me.

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,590
I've got some influentialfriends 
at the pentagon.

69
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,890
I could help you find him.

70
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,190
Yeah, nice try.

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,590
You don't leave the service without learning
a thing or twoabout reconnaissance.

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,690
I used every source I haduntil 
they came up with this.

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,090
Tell me, mr. Luthor,

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,790
what does a fortune 500 company
want with a green beret?

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,790
Tell me!

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,290
It's only a matter of time
before my security gets through.

77
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,590
You should know their policy tends to
err on the sideof "shoot now, ask later."

78
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,290
Except schematicsfor these tunnels
don't existin any city blueprints.

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,290
And I've rigged all 5 mileswith c-4.

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,290
You see...

81
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,390
I learned how to beall I could be

82
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,490
in explosives ordnancecontrol...

83
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,890
discharged for havinga short fuse.

84
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,490
If you think I'm lying,
why don't you just kill me?

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,090
Then I'd be backto square one.

86
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,190
Besides,I'm willing to bet
this little projectyou're doing down here,

87
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,490
whatever you're doingwith wes,

88
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,790
is worth more to youthan your life.

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,190
You decide.

90
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,690
If I don't speak to wesin 20 minutes,

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,690
it'll all be gone.

92
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,790
What's wrong, mr. Luthor?

93
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,790
Haven't you ever doneanything 
crazy for love?

94
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,190
Chloe, any news on lex?

95
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,290
No, and the police captainjust nixed the 
rescue efforts until they candebomb the area.

96
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,190
That could take forever.
Lionel said these tunnelsare endless.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,990
Which means lex and ourG.I. Jane will be long
gone before they get throughall that debris.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,590
So lionel was right.

99
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,990
Lex could dieif I don't go down there.

100
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,590
Well, don't look to mefor encouragement.

101
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,090
After what he did to my mom,

102
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,690
I don't mind the idea of himcohabitating
with the rats for all of eternity.

103
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,890
Trust me, chloe.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,590
Lately I've had momentswhere I thought the 
world would be a betterplace without him, but

105
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,390
you don't get to choosewho you're gonna save.

106
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,690
Not if you're clark kent.

107
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,490
Besides,whatever's in those tunnels
may be the first stepin taking lex down.

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,990
Then I suggest you beat
the bomb squad to the entrance

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,890
and human-wrecking-ball your way
in before anyone can see you.

110
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,090
Perfect timing,macgyver.

111
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,590
You're gonna need those pawsto call wes.

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,290
The phones won't work this deep
in the tunnel system.

113
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,690
Mine will.

114
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,090
Take it.

115
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,390
Take it!

116
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,290
Without wes,my life is over.

117
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,790
When you meet someone
that can pull youout of the trenches,

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,490
you don't justgive up on them.

119
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,090
It's not that easy.

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,290
Put him on the phone.

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,790
Please, let mehear his voice.

122
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,590
I can't call your husband.

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,490
Do you want to die down here?
We're running out of time.

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,390
Dial the damn phone.

125
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,190
He's dead!

126
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,490
Wes didn't die in a crash.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,690
He was shot at close rangeby an m60 firearm.

128
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,790
The bullets pierced his lungs,
his liver, and his heart.

129
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,890
Luthercorp tried to save him
with an
experimental procedure,but it was too late.

130
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,490
Look, your husband endured
a prolongedand unsettling death.

131
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,490
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,190
The lie was easierthan the truth.

133
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,790
No.

134
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,390
No.

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,390
Deactivate the explosives.

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,890
Let's bothget out of here alive.

137
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,390
It's preprogrammed.

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,490
I won't stop them,
just likeyou can't stop this.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,890
AMBULANCES ONLY

140
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,190
I'm glad you came, lana.

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,490
Any word on lex?

142
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,190
Not yet.

143
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,790
I can't imagine what's going
through your mind,

144
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,490
but I know it will mean a lotto
lionel that you're here.

145
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,990
Maybe some tea will helpwith the nerves.

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,890
Let me go.I could use some air.

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,290
I want to see him.

148
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm sorry, mrs. Luthor,
but the patient'sbeing prepped for surgery.

149
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,290
You don't understand.

150
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,490
My husband is missing,and lionel is
the last personwho saw him alive.

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,290
I realize this is an incredibly
difficult time for you.

152
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,990
Doctor, if my husbanddoesn't survive...

153
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,690
the man lying in that room
is the only familyI have left.

154
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,890
Please,just one minute.

155
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,390
One minute.

156
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,590
I understandyou're in a lot of pain.

157
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,490
Lana.

158
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,490
Good.

159
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,290
You knew what lexwas doing to me --

160
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,790
orchestratinga fake pregnancy
and making me believethat I lost a baby.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,590
And you still trapped meinto marriage 
with him.

162
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,690
I didn't know thenwhat lex --

163
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,590
Save your oxygen.

164
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,590
I wouldn't wantto jeopardize your surgery.

165
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,790
With lex missing,it turns outthat I'm in 
chargeof your medical decisionstoday.

166
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,590
Looks like I'm notthe only one who's trapped.

167
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,990
Why did you threaten to useclark's weakness
against him if I didn't marry lex?

168
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,590
Tell me.

169
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,090
If I killed you right now,I'd be free.

170
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,490
Give me one reasonwhy I shouldn'T.

171
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,490
I'm protecting clark.

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,390
Mrs. Luthor, we needto take him 
to surgery now.

173
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,890
Captain,lex luthor's porsche
was parkedat the tunnel entrance.

174
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,590
We searched the vehicle
and found this in the trunk.

175
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,990
It might holdsome answers.

176
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,590
Thank you, officer.

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,490
Ma'am, that's partof a crime scene.

178
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,390
We need to take that caseas evidence.

179
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,890
Of course,as soon as I see your warrant
to search my husband's vehicle.

180
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,890
Please call meas soon as you have any news.

181
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,090
Lex.

182
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,590
Lex!

183
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,790
Clark...

184
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,690
what are you doing here?

185
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,690
Your dad sent me.

186
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,690
He's alive?

187
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,990
And you got throughwhen nobody else could.

188
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,690
No one else is trying, lex.

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,990
Police called offthe rescue team

190
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,690
when they found this place
was rigged with explosives.

191
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,990
The entire tunnel system's
scheduled to detonate in 14 minutes.

192
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,590
Is there a wayto deactivate it?

193
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,890
If you're trained in plasticexplosives,
be my guest.

194
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,890
Come on.

195
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,690
Clark.

196
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,090
- Can you see me?
- yeah

197
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,990
- Be sure I'm in the frame.
-***

198
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,090
You got the background, too?

199
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,890
- Yes.
- Great.

200
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,290
Greetings from patagonia,
the most beautiful place on earth.

201
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,690
What is that?

202
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,390
***

203
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,890
You're the last person I ever expected
to bepulling shrapnel out of.

204
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,890
I saw what happened
when I stabbed youwith that chisel, clark.

205
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,490
That thing accordioned like it hit solid rock.

206
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,990
I don't know why I neededso badly to
believe that you're morethan human.

207
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,590
'Cause nothing's evergood 
enough for you, lex.

208
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,590
The truth would have been.

209
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,290
You may be flesh and blood,

210
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,090
but you've been hiding secrets
from me since we met.

211
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,190
You never trusted me.

212
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,390
Would it have mattered?

213
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,390
What are you really doing down here,
anyway,lex?

214
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,290
Trying to find new waysto exploit the people
that have different abilities than you?

215
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,790
There's no gray areawith you, is there?

216
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,490
It's eitherall good or all evil.

217
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,690
Did you even try to seemy humanity
before you decidedI had none?

218
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,690
I did, lex.And look where we are.

219
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,390
Clark, come on.

220
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,090
Clark!

221
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,490
Come on.

222
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,190
What are you waiting for?Let's go.

223
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,390
Clark!

224
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,790
Come on.

225
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,390
Come on.

226
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,690
Get up!

227
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,090
Hey, clark, it's me again.

228
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,290
Where are you?

229
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,790
I feel likeyour stalker ex-girlfriend,
even though I was neveryour girlfriend.

230
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,190
It was just an analogy --a bad one.

231
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,190
I'm sorry.This is awkward.
Okay, call me. Bye.

232
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,190
Hold up.

233
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,590
That second blast dropped
another 10 feet of rubble.

234
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,490
Does that mean you haven'tfound lex luthor?

235
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,390
Have you found anyone yet?

236
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,990
The inner tunnels caved.

237
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,790
After those explosions,
the whole area'scompletely unstable.

238
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,090
There's no way anyone's
getting in there by hand.

239
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,890
What's on your vest?

240
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,290
Dust from meteor rocks.

241
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,990
It's all over the placedown there.

242
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,290
It's another dead end.

243
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,590
We haveto try another tunnel.

244
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,190
Lex, these ceilings aren't
gonna hold out much longer.

245
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,490
We have to go back.

246
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,490
You knowwe don't have time for that.

247
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,590
Something tells me no one else
knows about these tunnels.

248
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,090
By no one, you mean lana.

249
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,890
I'm sorry,but I don't bore her
with the daily minutiaeof my work.

250
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,190
You meanyou don't trust her?

251
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,990
I know that's what you've
always wanted to believe.

252
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,390
But lana's the first person
in my life I actually do trust.

253
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,190
Then why'd you do it, lex?

254
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,290
Do what?

255
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,890
Why did you force herto marry you?

256
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,190
I saw lanathe day of the wedding.

257
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,390
And she was gonna leave you.

258
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,290
What did you do to her?

259
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,990
I don't know.

260
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,390
The answermust have gotten lost
in that dark abysswe call my soul.

261
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,690
And what would I know about holding
my breathbefore a congregation,

262
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,290
praying the love of my life
wouldn't leave meat the altar?

263
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,290
Not being sure on that day was the hardest
thingI've ever had to endure.

264
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,590
You can believe thator not.

265
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,090
I stopped expecting you
to act like a frienda long time ago.

266
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,190
Were we everreally friends, lex?

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,290
I don't know.

268
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,290
I have nothingto compare it to.

269
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,790
You're the only real friend
I've ever had, clark.

270
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,890
And somewhere along the way,
you saw me as your nemesis,

271
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,490
turned your back on me.

272
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,090
Lex, get this off of me.

273
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,290
Don't leave me.

274
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,590
Lex!

275
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,090
Lex!

276
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,990
Lex!

277
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,190
Hey. I've been calling youall morning.

278
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,190
I thought you'd bewith search and rescue.

279
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,390
I thoughtI'd be more useful here.
Any news?

280
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,490
No, that's the problem.

281
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,190
Because I'm not a luthor,
no one will talk to me.

282
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,690
What have they told you?

283
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,690
That they'll tell me
when they know something.

284
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,790
Damn it.

285
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,690
Lana, clark went into those
tunnels a little while ago,

286
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,690
and I haven't heardfrom him since.

287
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,890
Clark's down there?

288
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,190
He went down to help,and now even the
bomb squad can't find a way in.

289
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,590
But he'll be okay, right?

290
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,190
I don't know.

291
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,290
But he'S...

292
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,090
I mean, he's clark.

293
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,990
Lana, whatever it isthat you know
or think you know about clark,

294
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,690
he's not invincible.

295
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,190
- He has a --
- weakness.

296
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,890
Look, lana, he will die
if we don't find a wayin there soon.

297
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,190
I thinkI know another way in.

298
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,790
Exactly when did you learn
how to pole-vaultover lex's firewall?

299
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,890
I figured that if lexwas gonna
look over my shoulder,

300
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,090
it was time for meto start looking over his.

301
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,590
Are those the blueprintsfor the tunnels?

302
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,490
You were sittingon the holy grail all morning,
and you didn't tell anyone?

303
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,090
I thought you saidthere wasn't much time.

304
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,990
Did you really think I was gonna let
you diealone down here, clark?

305
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,690
Guess you never knew meat all.

306
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,490
Come on.

307
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,890
The last cave-inexposed a hatch.Come on.

308
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,390
Go!

309
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,690
Smallville Medical Center

310
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,190
Good book?

311
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,090
I prefer nonfiction --much more exciting.

312
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,190
I hear lex made it out unscathed.

313
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,390
You must be thrilled --

314
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,790
both the luthorsalive and well.

315
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,190
I'm not hereto talk about lex.

316
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,590
What I want right noware answers.

317
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,890
First you tell me that you're gonna 
kill clark if I don't marry lex.

318
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,590
And now you're telling me
that you're protecting him?

319
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,690
What the hell's going on?

320
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,590
You know, clark isa very lucky young man
to have someone that loves himthe way you do.

321
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,790
Your love was the only thing

322
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,490
that I could use to keep clark 
out of harm'sway

323
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,590
and you close to lex.

324
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,790
I don't understand.

325
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,990
What harm?

326
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,690
What's lex doing,and why am I a part of it?

327
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,090
You must trust me, lana,

328
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,390
because clark's lifedepends on it.

329
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,390
I wonder how martha kentwould handle hearing
that you used her sonas a bargaining chip.

330
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,390
Tell me what you know.

331
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,990
Well, I see you'veembraced wholeheartedly
what it meansto be a luthor.

332
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,490
Chloe, I've x-rayed these
tunnels over a dozen times.

333
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,090
They all just seem to lead to reeves dam.

334
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,090
Maybe so,but if lex was willing
to go upagainst tomb raider for them,

335
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,390
I can't retiremy reporter's note
book just yet.

336
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,390
I still don't understand how
you thought to come out here.

337
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,090
Lex said no one knew about
those tunnels, not even --

338
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,790
lana?

339
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,690
She led search and rescue out here?

340
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,490
I guessI had it all wrong.

341
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,690
This whole time,I thought that lex had
forced her into that marriage, but...

342
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,490
now I don't think he did.

343
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,590
Don't give upon your hunch just yet, clark.

344
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,690
Lana knew about the other entrance
to thosetunnels the whole time,

345
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,790
and it wasn't until she heardyou were down
there that she magically produced them.

346
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,190
Lana was gonna let lexdie down there?

347
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,290
I think the luthor mansion
has a lot more secretsthan we realize.

348
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,190
The police found this.

349
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,390
I guess they really wantedto get into it.

350
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,490
I took it away from themas fast as I could.

351
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,090
Thank you.

352
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,190
Well, I'm gonna cuddle upwith a movie.

353
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,190
Any genre preference?

354
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,990
I think I'll pass.

355
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,290
Okay.Well, good night.

356
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,890
Did you see clarkon our wedding day
and tell him you didn't wantto marry me?

357
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,790
Did you?

358
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,890
Yes.

359
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,290
But only because I needed
someone to talk to.

360
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,990
I knew there was something wrong
with the baby.

361
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,290
I could feel it.

362
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,190
I thoughtyou wouldn't love me.

363
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,090
And I didn't want to lie.

364
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,490
I wanted to say something.

365
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,590
I did.

366
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,290
But you lovedour baby so much.

367
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,690
Just one lookat her nursery,

368
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,890
and I knew that you hadan entire life planned --

369
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,690
school...play dates.

370
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,090
We were gonna bethe best parents in the world.

371
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,190
But how could I standat that altar
in front of all of those people

372
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,190
and say that everythingwas going to be okay
when I knew somethingwas seriously wrong?

373
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,790
What kind of a personwould lie like that?

374
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,490
Nothing could have stopped me
from loving you --

375
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,990
nothing.

376
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,090
That's why I married you.

377
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,190
I wish I was that strong.

378
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,490
If someone liedto me like that,
they would losemy love forever.

379
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,590
I don't know what I didto deserve you.

380
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,190
You didn't come infor dinner.

381
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,590
Thoughtyou might be hungry.

382
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,790
Thanks. I didn't realizehow late it was.

383
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,690
Any idea what lex and lionel
were doing in those tunnels?

384
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,190
It just doesn't add up.

385
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,890
I mean, we have budgets,funding,
plans, construction.

386
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,890
It's almost as if lex was...

387
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,290
buildinga water-purification system.

388
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,590
Maybe this is the one time
lex was actuallytelling the truth.

389
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,190
Clark...

390
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,590
what really happeneddown there?

391
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,790
When lex pulled meout of that rubble,

392
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,290
I saw a glimpse
of somethingI hadn't seen in years.

393
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,990
My friend.

394
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,990
I know you twowent through a lot.

395
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,190
But so much has happened.

396
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,990
Sometimes,as hard as it is,
you have to let go.

397
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,290
But you didn'T.

398
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,690
After everythingthat lionel's done,
you stood by him today.

399
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,790
That doesn't meanI trust him.

400
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,490
I wish I could.

401
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,790
And even though I honestly
believe he's made an effort,

402
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,490
no one can completely change who they are.

403
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,690
At leastyou gave him that chance.

404
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,690
Mom, what if partof who lex is...

405
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,890
...is because of me?

406
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,290
What if I gave up on himtoo soon?

407
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,390
You'll never give upon anyone, clark,

408
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,990
because yourgreatest strength
might also beyour greatest weakness --

409
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,790
your hope.

410
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,090
You'll be pleased to hearthe prototype

411
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,690
is just days from reaching its fullest
functioning capacities.

412
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,690
Thanks to your wife,I almost died for you.

413
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,390
Let's hope there's nothing
you can't do for me.
