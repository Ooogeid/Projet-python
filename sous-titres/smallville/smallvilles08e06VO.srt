1
00:00:02,751 --> 00:00:04,545
Santa...

2
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:07,994
Gave me the wrong doll.

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,493
And i was so mad, i sort of
made all the christmas lights

4
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:14,319
On our entire block go out.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,070
That's when my parents
first caught on that i was...

6
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,103
Different.

7
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:26,782
- Jessy?
- What?

8
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:32,894
That was not me.

9
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:46,513
You know, i don't know
why i came back here.

10
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:49,893
So miss goldilocks could put a
bull's-Eye on my freakish head?

11
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:52,026
Putting out cryptic ads
in alternative papers

12
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:55,538
And gathering us all
in one spot...  genius.

13
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,435
Look, you made the choice to
come here on your own, mary,

14
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,417
And i'm guessing it was for a reason.

15
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:06,083
Look, i'm not saying i couldn't
use a few friendly faces

16
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:07,890
When i'm lighting up the town...

17
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:09,644
... literally.

18
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:14,252
But people don't want us to exist,

19
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,150
And turning us into poster
kids isn't gonna change that.

20
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:21,345
I think this group is the best
thing that's ever happened to me.

21
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:24,735
That's because you don't know
any better, pocket protector.

22
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,946
Just wait till they spark up
their torches and come after us.

23
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:32,169
At least if we're not alone,
we're not such easy targets.

24
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:36,275
Okay, everyone who came here
tonight took a really big step,

25
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:39,461
And that is the first step
towards changing the way people

26
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:41,020
Look at your special gifts.

27
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,295
Thank you for coming.

28
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:47,231
And if you forgot to
sign in when you got here,

29
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,943
Can you please do so before you leave?

30
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,708
- And i'll see you next week.
- Great meeting.

31
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,849
Thanks a lot, chloe.

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,404
Great.

33
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:07,787
Smallville 806

34
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:13,235
Synchro : flolo

35
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:51,714
For seriessub.Com

36
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,453
You know, when i suggested we
have "dinner and a movie" night,

37
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:05,726
I didn't exactly think a $3.99
special number 2 combo with cheese

38
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,714
And a droning police blotter
was what i would have in mind.

39
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:14,607
Not to mention the communication
skills of a paperweight.

40
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:16,178
I'm sorry?

41
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,821
Look who decided to
join the conversation.

42
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:24,202
Well... it all happened so
fast, it was like a blur.

43
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:25,348
You know what...

44
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,628
I have paperwork to do, and
you have the world to save,

45
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,100
So... why don't we just call it a night?

46
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:33,443
We'll do this again, all right? Soon.

47
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:35,213
Right.

48
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:38,934
As soon as all the criminals are behind
bars and there are no more accidents.

49
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:41,420
Good night.

50
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,812
Try not to stay up all night.

51
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:48,335
Silent alarm triggered at
the jewelry store on main.

52
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:49,809
Robbery in progress.

53
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,391
Squads 17 and 33, please respond.

54
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,031
There isn't any more.
Please don't hurt me.

55
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,181
We have an alley disturbance
off gregory behind the arcade.

56
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,523
Help!

57
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,244
- What else you got?
- That's all my money!

58
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,312
I swear! Please!

59
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,877
I think he's lying.

60
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:42,148
All cars to the ace of
clubs, 12th and maryland.

61
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,739
Screams heard. No accounts from inside.

62
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,140
I repeat, all cars to 12th and maryland.

63
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:29,280
Davis?

64
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,856
Davis, you probably shouldn't sit up.

65
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,824
What happened?

66
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:59,608
I was hoping you could tell me.

67
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:02,151
There's no sign of a bomb or
any other kind of explosion.

68
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:05,322
- Did something attack these people?
- I don't know.

69
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:08,105
I was walking with take out.

70
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:11,513
You don't remember coming
in here? The screams?

71
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,008
No.

72
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,272
Must have gotten a concussion.

73
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,213
Yeah.

74
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,804
Yeah, i probably took
a pretty good blow.

75
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:25,158
But i'm fine now.

76
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,566
You're not fine.
You're covered in blood.

77
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,766
You're obviously injured. You
need to go to the hospital.

78
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,615
- Let them take care of you.
- I can take care of myself.

79
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,880
It looks like we were both too late.

80
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:46,854
Detective john jones.

81
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:48,610
Metropolis homicide?

82
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,846
I figured it was the best way for
me to help people without my powers.

83
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:55,777
I haven't forgot about them. We're
gonna find a way to get them back.

84
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,390
I found a place for myself here.

85
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,419
How'd you make detective so quickly?

86
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:03,271
We all have our sources.

87
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:05,546
Mine happen to be far-Reaching.

88
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:07,377
And now that you're
working in metropolis

89
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:10,329
And using your contacts at the
daily planet to help more people,

90
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,383
I wanted to be close
by in case you need me.

91
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,458
What i needed was to get here sooner.

92
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,473
I should have been able
to save all these people.

93
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:20,242
According to the mysterious calls
we got at the station tonight,

94
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,073
I'm guessing you saved your share.

95
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,969
You can't save everyone, clark.

96
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:27,218
The moment i believe that
is when i stop trying.

97
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,987
What have you heard about
what happened here tonight?

98
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,585
Well, people are pointing
fingers at everything

99
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:38,466
From a crazed lunatic
to a gang of murderers.

100
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,156
With lightning speed.

101
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:41,793
By the time i arrived here,

102
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:44,769
Whoever or whatever attacked
these people was gone.

103
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,663
Then you don't have any leads, either.

104
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,138
Not yet.

105
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,525
Looks like you picked up the
latest pastime around here.

106
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,390
Oh, i'm just trying to
corroborate my new theory...

107
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,718
Metropolis' very own mystery hero.

108
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,312
See, i've puzzled together
a couple of reports

109
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:25,392
Of a sneaky good samaritan popping up
over the city the past couple weeks.

110
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,614
Is that right?

111
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,520
Sounds like an urban myth.

112
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,305
Well, the truth has
got to start somewhere.

113
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:41,461
If your citizen "x" does exist, he
sure didn't come through tonight.

114
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,618
Well, i wouldn't give him too many
demerits on his hero badge, clark.

115
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,843
You can't get this city's savior title

116
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:50,203
By letting innocent
people die on your shift.

117
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,613
You stealing evidence from
crime scenes much lately?

118
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:00,106
No. I'm gonna return it.

119
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,299
But it may have recorded what
happened inside the club tonight.

120
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,436
Well, let's take a look.

121
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:13,818
Thanks.

122
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:26,259
Happy birthday.

123
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:46,297
Whoever did this is beyond steroids.

124
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:57,006
Hey. You missed sodas and
cookies, but maybe next week,

125
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,776
You can lead the session
with a rousing kent tale.

126
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,553
Thanks, chloe.

127
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:03,160
Sitting around with a bunch of strangers

128
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,782
Singing "kumbaya" isn't
my idea of self-Help.

129
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,331
What's with the 'tude?

130
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,556
There was a brutal attack
at ace of clubs tonight.

131
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:11,819
It was...

132
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,151
Special.

133
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:23,536
So, naturally, that means
it must be someone from here.

134
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:27,386
The metropolis police don't exactly
keep a list of all the crypto-Perps.

135
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:31,028
- Chloe, i need your help.
- Doing what?

136
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,346
Randomly pointing fingers?

137
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,278
Chloe, you've run the stats before.

138
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,245
Chances are they're not all innocent.

139
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,124
I can't believe that you, of all people,

140
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,692
Would throw someone in a lineup
just because they're different.

141
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,963
I let whoever did this
slip through my fingers.

142
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:47,450
I was right there. If this person
attacks again, it'll be on my hands.

143
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:50,542
Clark, i've learned to navigate
your field of guilty land mines

144
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,880
Better than anyone,
but these kids trust me.

145
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:55,418
I don't know what you expect me to say.

146
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,188
Can you tell me where
i can find davis bloome?

147
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,811
Uh, yeah. That's him right there.

148
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,506
- Davis?
- Thanks.

149
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,378
Yeah. That's me. What can i do for you?

150
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,135
- Jimmy olsen.
- As in chloe's jimmy?

151
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,891
She's mentioned you a few times.

152
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,560
I hope you don't mind me
surprising you like this.

153
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:04,285
No. It's no problem.
Uh, is this about chloe?

154
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,080
Yeah, i've just been
going through her pda,

155
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:08,313
Checking up on who she's
been hanging out with.

156
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,295
No, no, no. I'm just...

157
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:13,483
I'm just kidding. I'm not some psycho.

158
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,737
Yeah, you never can tell these days.

159
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,249
So...

160
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:21,229
So, i'm just trying to get a
scoop on this club massacre.

161
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,038
We've heard all sorts of stories
about this killer... the best

162
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,533
That he's a monster with bony eyelids.

163
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:27,763
Yeah, i gave my statement to the police.

164
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,284
I don't know anything.

165
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,332
You know how to drive, don't you?

166
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:35,019
Look, i just want to ride along. I
figure ambulances are first on the scene.

167
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,841
Maybe we'll beat
everyone to the next one.

168
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,639
Trust me...  you do not want
to ride shotgun on my watch.

169
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:44,652
You don't want to be
the first guy there.

170
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,770
It's not something that you
want to see, given the choice.

171
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:51,060
Come on. I mean, can't
you do a favor for a bro?

172
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,159
Okay.

173
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:59,410
Then... how about for chloe?

174
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,072
Meet me downstairs at 8:00.

175
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,440
Thank you.

176
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:18,777
- They all have meteor powers.
- Where'd you get this list?

177
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,645
I memorized it off chloe's desk.

178
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,685
I didn't realize that photographic
memory was among your abilities.

179
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:26,034
It's more like speed-Reading,
but let's not split hairs.

180
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:28,006
She couldn't just give you a copy?

181
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,363
Chloe and i don't exactly
see eye to eye on this one.

182
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,741
Well, what about your mouthy cohort?

183
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,574
She hasn't poked her nose
into this one, either.

184
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,753
She's on assignment, which is code
for "monster-Truck rally in lubbock."

185
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,086
And i assume your emerald
ally and his superfriends

186
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,321
Are still on hiatus, which leaves you.

187
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,728
Solo. I get it. Is there
a point to all this?

188
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:48,982
Obsession.

189
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:51,365
When someone's life is on the
line with every decision you make,

190
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,432
It's hard for anything
else to seem important.

191
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:55,914
- It's because nothing else is.
- Careful, clark.

192
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:58,609
Even when you save someone,
there are consequences.

193
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,973
You know, i thought you'd be happy.

194
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,068
I'm finally embracing my destiny...
out there making a difference.

195
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:06,874
Except for last night,
when i dropped the ball.

196
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,065
We need to find out if anyone on that list
was responsible for the attack at the bar.

197
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,103
It wasn't just one incident.

198
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,748
There have been at least five other
similar murders in the last few months.

199
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:16,050
Yeah, i know. I read up on it.

200
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:18,719
All the victims died the
same way... internal bleeding.

201
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,174
All their bones were crushed.

202
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:22,390
And the killer gets
away without a trace.

203
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,752
I'll look into these.

204
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,930
But i was working on another angle.

205
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,434
One paramedic has been
the first to arrive

206
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,205
On several of the crime scenes.

207
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,525
The driver's name is davis bloome.

208
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,926
Chance meeting in a moldy
basement over a corpse.

209
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,861
Will the romance never end?

210
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,553
What are you doing here?

211
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:11,328
I wanted to see the coroner's
latest report on the victim.

212
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,786
She was a new member of my isis group.

213
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:20,897
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:22,377
Yeah.

215
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,388
I mean, she was afraid of
being targeted, and now...

216
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,155
It wasn't your fault.

217
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:29,258
She was there because of me.

218
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,426
And to top it all off, there
are a few trigger-Happy people

219
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,431
Who are convinced that one of
my kids is behind all of this.

220
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:44,485
And you? Checking for strep throat?

221
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:46,684
Look, you don't have to worry, chloe.

222
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,040
I don't think that one
of your clients did this.

223
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:51,339
I'd like to think so, too.

224
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,111
But i still need to find a suspect.

225
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:03,036
Davis? What is it?

226
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:09,634
I'm afraid that i might be the killer.

227
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,681
Davis, i know that you are not
responsible for these killings, okay?

228
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:26,616
I know you. You save people every day.

229
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,202
What could make you think that
you were a brutal serial killer?

230
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,540
Look, chloe, i've run the
self-Denial mantra for weeks,

231
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,259
But how do you explain the blackouts?

232
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,176
How do you explain that
i was covered in blood?!

233
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,686
None of it was mine.

234
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,762
I want to believe that you're
right more than anyone, but...

235
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:42,348
Then it's just a matter
of finding the real killer.

236
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,417
You really don't believe
that it could be me, do you?

237
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,468
No.

238
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:51,425
Even though we just met?

239
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:57,603
You're really... leaping
out on a limb for me.

240
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,258
Well, if what they say is
true and fools do rush in,

241
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,737
Then i have definitely earned the
mantle of "village idiot" on this one.

242
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,981
And then you just toss it all aside

243
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:08,178
With a healthy dose
of self-Deprecation.

244
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,094
Please don't make me a saint.

245
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,285
What?

246
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:17,105
Luck isn't part of my
daily routine, chloe.

247
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,148
I just... i feel like...

248
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,507
I feel like you were sent to me.

249
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,636
You are not a serial killer.

250
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,335
Look, davis, when did those
blackouts start happening?

251
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:36,526
For as long as i can remember.

252
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,476
When i was a kid,

253
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,780
I would go a couple
months without a blackout,

254
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,398
But they're just...
they're getting so frequent.

255
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:47,229
Is that why you bounced from
foster home to foster home?

256
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:53,734
I've always felt like...

257
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:58,811
Kind of like there was
this darkness inside me...

258
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:02,040
Just fighting to get out.

259
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,228
So you closed yourself off to everyone.

260
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,418
After all these years
of keeping this secret,

261
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,295
Why are you telling me?

262
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,117
I think you know.

263
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,483
I've...  i've never met anyone like you.

264
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:35,761
Chloe, but what if i'm right? What
if you're looking at a murderer?

265
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:40,192
Davis, there are lots of people
who could have done these killings.

266
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:44,320
And we're gonna find who did.

267
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,697
I walked right by here last night.

268
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:12,840
It could have been any of us.

269
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,919
You think somebody's hunting us down?

270
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,003
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

271
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:21,911
But so far, mary's been the
only victim that's been a...

272
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,318
... club member.

273
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:30,812
And after last night, we're all
at the top of their suspect list.

274
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,517
Look, i don't know
what flag you're waving,

275
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:37,357
But making them out to be all bad

276
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,592
Is no better than what
people have done to you.

277
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:41,564
You don't know what it's like.

278
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:44,633
People don't look at you the same
once you tell them you're a freak.

279
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,567
Some of them do.

280
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:50,681
And turning against each other
is not gonna stop all this.

281
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,622
Look, i came here tonight because
i want to help catch mary's killer.

282
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:58,135
I thought that maybe some of
you may have seen something

283
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:01,894
Or you maybe might have known why
someone would have wanted to attack mary.

284
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:03,735
Because you think it's one of us.

285
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,576
- No. It's just that...
- Come on, chloe!

286
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:10,364
Some cop's been showing up at our homes

287
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,903
Asking each of us if we know anything.

288
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:14,707
It's kind of a coincidence.

289
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,967
Unless you gave him our names.

290
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:19,965
No.

291
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:23,044
I would never betray you guys like that.

292
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,469
Well, somebody did.

293
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:43,997
Clark.

294
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:49,343
Chloe told me about the girl in
her group. It's a messed-Up world.

295
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,958
You know, davis, it took a lot to go
into that roomful of screaming people.

296
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,630
Who knows what you could
have been running into.

297
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:57,409
Yeah, well...

298
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,033
I suppose it should
be somewhat comforting

299
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,499
To know that good gossip
spreads just as fast as bad.

300
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,192
- So you didn't save those people.
- Haven't we been over this?

301
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:07,948
I'm not some larger-Than-Life hero. The
truth is, i don't know what happened.

302
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,566
But you do know more than
what you've told me, don't you?

303
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,521
I don't fish much, clark,

304
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:14,709
So why don't you just tell
me what the hell you're after?

305
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,554
What are you doing with a file stuffed
full of morbid pictures of murder victims?

306
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,525
You broke into my locker?

307
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,624
Collecting pictures of all the murder
victims is a pretty strange habit, isn't it?

308
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,310
Do you know how many murders in
this city go unsolved every year?

309
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,343
I show up, i take away the bodies,
case closed. Maybe i want to do

310
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:32,700
More than just clean up the
mess after it's too late.

311
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,112
Now the whole city refers
to you as a hero, huh?

312
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,791
Maybe i'd have an easier
time believing all this

313
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,775
If there was proof that
that's actually what happened.

314
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:42,728
Okay, you know what... i understand

315
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,250
If you don't want to join the
knee-Jerk ticker-Tape parade,

316
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:46,615
But let me ask you a question.
Are you really up in my face

317
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:48,353
Because you're trying to catch a killer,

318
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:50,849
Or is it because you're trying
to hide something yourself?

319
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:52,843
Don't try to turn this around on me.

320
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:55,385
Then why don't you take a
second look at those photos?

321
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:57,449
I'm not the only one that's
hanging out at these crime scenes.

322
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,078
There's another figure
in the background.

323
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:05,016
You seem to be the
city's own peeping tom.

324
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm a reporter. It's my job!

325
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,844
These photos were taken

326
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:13,501
Before any press could
have made it to the scene.

327
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:17,197
So, uh, next time you feel anxious

328
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,349
To shine a light on things
that don't make sense...

329
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:24,008
You might want to stay closer to home.

330
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,893
Sharpening your pitchfork?

331
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:55,120
If you're gonna lead a marauding
posse, you better come prepared.

332
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:58,977
Clark, you gave the police
the names of my isis group?

333
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,623
How could you use your
powers to betray me like that?

334
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:05,063
I didn't mean to go around you,
chloe, but you were so defensive...

335
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:07,331
Like i've been defensive of you?

336
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:11,343
Clark, you don't get how much of my
life i spend protecting your secret.

337
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:13,490
And if you ever had
enough courage to actually

338
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:15,977
Step forward, like the
rest of these kids did,

339
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:18,344
You would be the first one on that pyre.

340
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:22,635
How could you, of all people, be
the ringleader for this witch hunt?

341
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:25,201
Chloe, you're taking the side
of people that you hardly know.

342
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:26,712
I would think after
eight years of friendship,

343
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:28,999
You might be able to give
me the benefit of the doubt.

344
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,153
That works both ways.

345
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,743
And your bonus features

346
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:36,712
Don't give you the right to
trump anyone else's judgment.

347
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:39,702
Fine. We'll let the facts
speak for themselves.

348
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:44,416
These are test results that
davis was trying to hide from me.

349
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,545
Davis?

350
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,003
I was thinking, with
your brainiac ability,

351
00:25:50,004 --> 00:25:52,172
You might be able to
make sense of the results.

352
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,770
Oh, my god.

353
00:25:57,874 --> 00:26:00,992
The skin under the
victim's nails is davis'.

354
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:25,753
Davis?

355
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,132
Ready to catch a killer?

356
00:26:50,595 --> 00:26:51,841
Yeah.

357
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,641
So, how often do you get a dispatch?

358
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:04,642
Depends on the night.

359
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,354
Some nights are busier than others.

360
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:14,486
Well, i bet you see a lot
of horrible things, huh?

361
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:24,985
All units in the area, we have a 4-11
in progress. Corner of liberty and 8th.

362
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,478
Uh, what's a 4-11?

363
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,364
It's the reason you came along tonight.

364
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:15,968
Stay here.

365
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,026
Davis?!

366
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,008
His ambulance number is 17.

367
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:09,756
I'm surprised you haven't
enrolled the services

368
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:11,432
Of our friendly martian on the force.

369
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,770
Jones can't help us unless
we have some hard proof.

370
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:16,239
We need more than a few pieces
of evidence to arrest someone.

371
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,483
Yeah, and the evidence you
have isn't exactly conclusive.

372
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,314
I mean, the victim could
have easily just reached up

373
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,718
And grabbed davis when he
was trying to help them.

374
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:28,433
But i have to admit, davis
would have the perfect setup.

375
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,074
I mean, he attacks the people

376
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:32,670
And then pretends to arrive
at the scene to save them?

377
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,993
I know it isn't easy.

378
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:42,580
What? My perpetual knack for
getting into lose-Lose situations?

379
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,326
Got it.

380
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:48,761
Davis' ambulance just stopped.

381
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:50,752
He answered a call a few minutes ago.

382
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:52,671
Help! I'm at liberty and 8th!

383
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:55,084
Can anybody hear me?
It's some kind of monster!

384
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,619
Clark, that's jimmy.

385
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,241
Clark!

386
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,799
What did you do with jimmy?!

387
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,310
Davis?

388
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:36,484
Jimmy?

389
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:39,533
Davis?

390
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,373
Davis.

391
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:55,841
Davis, you all right?

392
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,849
C.K.!

393
00:31:04,611 --> 00:31:06,292
Jimmy, what's going on?

394
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:09,007
It could be anywhere. It's
some sort of shadow creature.

395
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,105
What?

396
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:22,811
Jimmy.

397
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:06,753
Jimmy?

398
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:08,112
Jimmy?!

399
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:11,603
You okay?

400
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:14,356
Yeah. I'm good.

401
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:12,357
I lost perspective.

402
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:15,801
I can be a little stubborn.

403
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:20,073
And i... hate to admit it,

404
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,987
But there was a part of me
that was really frustrated

405
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:26,553
That you trusted someone
else instead of me.

406
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:31,215
It's funny how that happens when
you go behind someone's back.

407
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,219
My obsession...

408
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,661
Pushed me past the line with you, chloe.

409
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,748
I'm really sorry.

410
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,549
But you were protecting a killer.

411
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,078
Yeah, well, then there's that.

412
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:55,826
I guess i just didn't understand

413
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,743
How you could hand over your trust
so easily to people you didn't know.

414
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:11,016
327.

415
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:15,431
That's how many of the meteor-Infected
i've profiled since ninth grade.

416
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:17,471
And you know how many
i've actually saved?

417
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:18,971
None.

418
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:27,542
I guess i've been so busy
rescuing people from them,

419
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,559
I never looked at it from that angle.

420
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:33,142
It's not just the damsels in
distress that need saving, clark.

421
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:38,651
You know, when i first thought that
you were one of the meteor-Infected,

422
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,979
I would have done
anything to protect you.

423
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:44,081
But i guess that's what scares me.

424
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:49,372
I'm afraid that someday you're gonna
put your trust in the wrong person.

425
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:04,524
Hey.

426
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:08,159
Been waiting long?

427
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:14,500
I don't know how to thank you

428
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:17,495
For believing in me when
i was up against the ropes.

429
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,788
We all need someone to
pitch a seat in our corner.

430
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,668
Yeah, i guess, but most of the time,

431
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:25,256
It's not a possible murder
suspect standing there.

432
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:29,467
Davis, you were scared
and paranoid. That's all.

433
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:34,346
Seriously, backing someone who's actually
innocent isn't much of a sacrifice.

434
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:38,350
Besides, everything with you is so...

435
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:40,376
So easy.

436
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:41,841
Yeah.

437
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:43,130
Easy.

438
00:35:46,907 --> 00:35:49,715
Have you ever felt that
way with anyone before?

439
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:54,874
Once.

440
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,757
With jimmy.

441
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,448
No.

442
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:09,251
Look, chloe, i'm not
trying to get between you

443
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,555
And the rest of your life, but, uh...

444
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:15,964
Davis, i help people. That's what i do.

445
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,295
You know, this doesn't have
to mean any more than that.

446
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:19,926
Yeah, but it does.

447
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:27,132
Did you help me because of
some personal code of ethics,

448
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,301
Or was there more to it than that?

449
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,873
I shouldn't be here right now.

450
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:36,558
Why? Because you feel
guilty about something?

451
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:41,065
No. And i'd like it to stay that way.

452
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,601
I think it's best if i
don't see you for a while.

453
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:48,072
Sorry.

454
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,567
How could i have been
so wrong about davis?

455
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,034
This shadow guy confessed to every
killing in the last few weeks.

456
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:07,019
Sometimes what we
think is a good instinct

457
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,562
Is just our mind trying to convince
ourself of what we want to believe.

458
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,190
Well, he may be in
custody, but that just means

459
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,749
There's another psycho out
there right around the corner.

460
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,815
I've been here working every
night, and i still have to do more.

461
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:20,234
You can't allow yourself to get caught.

462
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,488
Combing through police blotters
at your desk every night,

463
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:27,609
Peeling back the sides of
a bus in broad daylight,

464
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,043
Speeding into a crowded bar.
You're so fixated on being a hero,

465
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:33,065
You're not paying attention
to who might be watching.

466
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,736
Is this your idea of a pep talk?

467
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,721
It's not my identity that's at risk.

468
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:39,622
Every day, i have to run
faster and faster interference

469
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,773
On these mysterious
good-Samaritan reports.

470
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:43,727
Well, that just means i'm doing my job.

471
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:47,619
Just have to make sure
no one sees my face.

472
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,561
Well, you can't be sure of that.

473
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:51,567
Unless you plan to put on a mask.

474
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:53,986
You're joking, right?

475
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:57,231
You are not in
smallville anymore, clark.

476
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,251
Metropolis has millions of
people walking the streets,

477
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:02,542
Every one of them watching for a miracle

478
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:05,220
To change their lives,
to give them hope.

479
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:07,618
You are that miracle.

480
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:11,596
And it's just a matter of time
before someone discovers that.

481
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:15,657
I'll be more careful.

482
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,205
Hey, clark.

483
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:24,389
Perfect. Officer, listen.

484
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,859
None for your fellow comrades... they
don't want to give me the time of day.

485
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,274
But you look like you're a
thinking-Outside- The-Box kind of guy.

486
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:35,493
There's a... there's a mystery hero

487
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:37,324
Roaming the streetsof metropolis

488
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,244
Look, scout's honor... out of nowhere,

489
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:41,312
These tires, they come
floating through the air.

490
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:43,673
And this mr. Shadow guy... he gets
knocked around like a ping-Pong ball.

491
00:38:43,674 --> 00:38:44,787
Slow down.

492
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:47,679
Oh. Olsen, james olsen.
Photographer, daily planet.

493
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,725
Well, james, adrenaline can
play strange games with a person.

494
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,951
No, no. He's...  he's real.

495
00:38:55,998 --> 00:38:57,415
I know it.

496
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:00,075
I hope you're right.
We could use the help.

497
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,872
And when you get some hard evidence,

498
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:06,135
I'll be more than glad to
continue this conversation.

499
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,102
Evening, mr. Olsen.

500
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:11,738
Mr. Kent.

501
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:20,842
I'm gonna prove that
this guy exists, c.K.

502
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,858
He's out there.

503
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:59,357
You look a little uncomfortable.

504
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:01,527
You're not a lawyer.

505
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:03,800
I'll take that as a compliment.

506
00:40:05,058 --> 00:40:07,650
Congratulations on your page 1.

507
00:40:11,336 --> 00:40:13,712
It's nice to have your work recognized

508
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,940
After so many years being the
good little boy in the shadows.

509
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:22,212
You have more admirers than you think.

510
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,056
My boss, miss mercer,

511
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:28,163
Has been gathering a small
group of talent, if you're game.

512
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:30,487
You've read my list of accomplishments.

513
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:33,558
I'm not really interesting
in sharing top billing.

514
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:37,055
Cut the bravado. You didn't
commit all those murders.

515
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:40,539
You're just a copycat
looking for attention.

516
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:43,622
Cops haven't found this yet,

517
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:47,284
But we have security footage of you
at an arcade during one of the crimes.

518
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,952
It's a crime i'm sure you've studied

519
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:52,358
If you were looking to
mimic the real killer.

520
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,933
You remember the nun at st.
Vincent's... crushed to death.

521
00:40:57,419 --> 00:41:01,053
That surveillance timecode must
have been wrong, because that was me.

522
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:02,659
Really?

523
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:07,603
Then i suppose you can tell me
where her missing onyx crucifix is...

524
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,365
The one on the rosary.

525
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,586
You didn't kill her.

526
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,052
