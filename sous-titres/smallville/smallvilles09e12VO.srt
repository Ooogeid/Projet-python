1
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:11,016
There's gonna be a panel
starting in 20 minutes

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,589
Don't touch it, please.

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,391
Awesome.

4
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:52,759
Is it true that
no one's ever read it before?

5
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,952
I read on the internet that no one
in the whole wide world knows

6
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,181
what the Warrior Angel's
secret battle cry is.

7
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,642
You've got to let me
take a look at this!

8
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,304
You know better than that.

9
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,691
Anybody opens that book,
the value drops.

10
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,698
I know,

11
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:12,904
But aren't you at least curious
what's inside?

12
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,991
Of course. I mean, who wouldn't?

13
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:21,321
But if I so much
as breathe at it funny...

14
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,415
my boss would kill me.

15
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:29,448
Besides, there's nothing
in that fantasy world

16
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,931
that's gonna make a lick of difference
out here in the real one, kid.

17
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,053
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Hey!

18
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:50,441
Security! Some kid
stole my comic book!

19
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,198
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:03,037
Sorry. I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

21
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,566
This is not what I had in mind

22
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:10,167
when Randall said I got to be
embedded journalist for the day.

23
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,761
It shouldn't be hard for Lois Lane to
nail down a human-interest piece here.

24
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,052
Save the hammer.
Ma's gonna need a crowbar.

25
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,571
I can't get anything out of these
people. They keep looking at me

26
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:23,363
like I'm from another planet.
Which is saying something.

27
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:27,919
No offense, but that armor doesn't
exactly make you Ms. Approachable.

28
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,743
Look.

29
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,500
Right. No wonder
Clark's been avoiding me.

30
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,612
I am losing touch with fantasy
without even realizing it.

31
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:43,426
The last thing Clark feels
when he thinks about you is boredom.

32
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,279
Maybe I'm doing this to myself.

33
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:49,541
Maybe it's
a deep-rooted fear of intimacy.

34
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,670
Maybe I'm not letting loose because
every time I do, things fall apart.

35
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:57,410
Maybe my therapist was right? She said I
used to have these fantasies about Clark

36
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:00,244
and now not so much
as a dirty limerick.

37
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:04,226
Maybe you just need
to calm down and focus on your work.

38
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:07,135
Oh, sorry.

39
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,700
You're right.

40
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,409
And maybe you should take advantage
of being immersed in your element.

41
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,449
Get your hands off
of the digital world

42
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:23,655
and on to some hunky
human fantasy for a change.

43
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,153
Have a little fun.
One of us should.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,239
- All right.
- Good.

45
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:33,581
Now, I have to go make a phone call.

46
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:36,444
Promise me you're gonna kick
the crackberry to the curb.

47
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,479
I promise.

48
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,582
I can't believe I'm doing this!

49
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,947
"With angels' might!"

50
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,735
Warrior Angel was really just a kid?

51
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:37,896
Are you okay?

52
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:51,616
Smallville 912

53
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,835
Synchro : Flolo

54
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,090
For seriessub.com

55
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:45,970
- Clark, where are you?
- Look, I'm sorry. I'm late.

56
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,625
But I guess I got
caught up with some

57
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,473
chores but I'm in the truck
on the way there now.

58
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:56,602
Oh, good. Can you grab something from
my place while you're at it?

59
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,939
- Check in the closet.
- Sure.

60
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,809
- Like you said, I'm already late so.
- I'm cashing in a rain check.

61
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:05,808
- You cannot renege on a rain check.
- Can I rain check on your rain check?

62
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,281
No. You have been cashing in
so many rain checks lately

63
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:10,674
that I am soaking wet
with disappointment.

64
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,621
Luckily, I'm driving by the Talon
right now.

65
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:19,378
- What do you need?
- What was that whooshing sound?

66
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,962
Nothing. I just had
the truck window open.

67
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:26,733
Okay. This is what I got.
Some red leather thing.

68
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:28,358
Nope.

69
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,308
Salute the flag?

70
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,515
Less gabbin', more grabbin'.

71
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:40,430
French maid outfit?

72
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,874
Need-to-know basis.

73
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,050
- There's a garment bag.
- Finally. There you go.

74
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,225
- Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
- Yeah, piece of cake.

75
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,932
You're my hero.

76
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:15,274
After that heroic hit-and-run,

77
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,711
it would be hard for even the most
distressed damsel not to take offense.

78
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:21,571
What would a hero say?

79
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,801
You're welcome, citizen.

80
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:32,879
And you left a not-so-subtle
trail of bread crumbs

81
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:35,059
on your way over here
for the quick change.

82
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:38,196
I'm sorry.
This is all kind of new to me.

83
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,865
I didn't realize how fast I was.

84
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,994
No sonic boom.
So, not that fast, I guess.

85
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,939
Did you want to...

86
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,564
What?

87
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,404
Not very heroic.

88
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:08,808
Good street look, though.

89
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:14,230
Whether you feel like it or not,
I know a superhero when I see one.

90
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:17,524
I'm sort of in the business
of helping superheroes.

91
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,358
I don't think anyone's dad
talked about that on career day.

92
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:25,297
- Are you for real?
- Yeah, I'm about as real as it gets.

93
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:32,572
Sorry.

94
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,019
Maybe we can talk
about how you fit in

95
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:38,511
among the world's finest
over coffee sometime.

96
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,758
That sounds...

97
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:43,850
pretty cool.

98
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,088
Great.

99
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,390
So...

100
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:55,671
Did you want to get that coffee
now or?

101
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:59,066
Now? Yeah. Okay.

102
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,343
If you're not doing anything.

103
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:02,968
Yeah.

104
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,663
Ladies first.

105
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:21,188
You only get to frown that much

106
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:23,571
when you've been sweating
like a pot roast all afternoon.

107
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,868
Sorry, I just don't get all
this The colors, the costumes.

108
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:29,839
It's like everyone has a popcorn image
of what being a hero's all about.

109
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:31,707
It's called a fantasy,

110
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:35,291
An escape, something, I don't know,

111
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,067
more magical than what we have
in our normal lives.

112
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:42,128
The reality of being a hero,
it's about sacrifice,

113
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,541
responsibility, and accountability.

114
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,072
From what I've heard.

115
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:51,201
Did you and Chloe both
just swear off whimsy? Was there a memo?

116
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:55,721
A costume isn't
just about hiding who you are.

117
00:09:56,068 --> 00:10:00,072
It's about seeing the world in a way
that you haven't before.

118
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:06,143
What's your dream?
Getting swept away in a little fantasy

119
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:08,666
might do you some good
every once in a while.

120
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:14,671
Lady's got a point.
Without a dash of fantasy,

121
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:18,607
life's just life,
and where's the magic in that?

122
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:23,979
- Zatanna, when did you...
- We need to talk, Clark. Alone.

123
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,616
I hope it's okay
that I borrow him for a bit.

124
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,394
Not exactly what I meant
about being swept away.

125
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:51,047
I shouldn't be surprised That you decided
to follow in your father's footsteps.

126
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,755
A lot can change in a year.

127
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,207
Somehow I don't think you detoured
your road show to play catchup.

128
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:01,089
I found out
my late, great father got cocky

129
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:05,218
and went on a cursing spree
in his roaring 20s.

130
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,762
I have been cleaning up his mess,

131
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:11,798
rounding up all of the things
that he cursed.

132
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:14,720
And you think this stolen comic
book was one of his items?

133
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:18,506
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
According to my dad's journal,

134
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:22,635
our thief is bound to be feeling
the effects of true power,

135
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,647
Just like in the comic.
I'm normally a solo act,

136
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:29,983
but these things
never seem to end well,

137
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:33,186
And I can't think of anyone

138
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:36,213
better to help me with this
than you.

139
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:42,119
Lady, let us in!

140
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,288
Would you excuse me one moment?

141
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,405
Back of the line, buddy!

142
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,109
Why are you in the men's bathroom?

143
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:00,236
You obviously haven't seen
the line for the women's room.

144
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:03,820
Just a minute!

145
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:18,463
- Stop gawking and prosper.
- That's what was in your bag?

146
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:22,101
This amazon princess
won't get nerd-walled again.

147
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:26,230
Though I still don't understand how
this qualifies as amazon But whatever.

148
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,834
While I was waiting for you to drag
your heels across the county line

149
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,840
a story finally happened
right under my nose.

150
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,238
- Someone stole.
- The rare "Warrior Angel" comic book.

151
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:42,782
I know. My friend Zatanna told me.
She's... into antiquities.

152
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:46,173
There's a few leads that she wants me to
help her track down.

153
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,328
I'll bet you do.

154
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:51,657
- Lois, it's not like that.
- No. I get it.

155
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:54,376
You mind if I get a picture
with you?

156
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,777
Take a picture?

157
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:09,467
We'll cover more ground
if we split up anyway, right?

158
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,092
You made sure that my decaf, caramel,
java-chip, white-chocolate mocha

159
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,529
Has three shots in it,
right? Thanks.

160
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,174
- And for you, sir?
- A glass of milk would be great.

161
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,128
I mean coffee.

162
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,997
Dark, black, please.

163
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,945
Everything okay?

164
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,290
Yeah. It's just strong, is all.

165
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:57,759
So, if I'm gonna help you get
acclimated, I just need to ask you a few

166
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,267
You really know superheroes?

167
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,858
- Yeah. Now, let's just focus on...
- All of them?

168
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,860
Most of them, I guess. What?

169
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,989
Actual superheroes and you
couldn't sound more bored.

170
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:18,336
- That's amazing is what it is.
- It's a living.

171
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,347
Can you at least tell me
which heroes you know?

172
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:25,317
Wait! Don't! That would compromise their
identities. I can't believe I asked that.

173
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:27,986
Let's just focus on what makes
Stephen Swift so super.

174
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:31,923
Were you exposed to meteor rock? Or
maybe you were actually born this way.

175
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:36,278
That would make you meta-human.
Or maybe you're from space.

176
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:41,568
That last one was a joke.

177
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,570
Kind of.

178
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:47,428
Oh, God. You're not actually from space,
are you?

179
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,053
No just, sorry.

180
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,122
I'm an orphan,

181
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:59,038
and I got sent to Metropolis to
live with my aunt when I was...

182
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,157
little And then a couple weeks ago,
I got caught in a...

183
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:07,393
in a chemical fire,

184
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:10,520
And, well, here we are.

185
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:14,411
It's common to the archetype.

186
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:16,825
Yeah.
I thought I was the expert.

187
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:22,807
Give it back!

188
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:26,800
Come on! I need that to get home!

189
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,449
Excuse me, Ms. Sullivan.

190
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,924
Stop it!

191
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,860
You heard the man!
Leave him be!

192
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,764
What you're doing to this kid
here isn't right and it isn't fair

193
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,906
and he shouldn't let you
get away with it, not ever!

194
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,406
Mind your own business!

195
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,834
I'll give you something
to laugh about.

196
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,016
Apologize!

197
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:09,118
Okay!
I'm sorry!

198
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,584
I'll give it back!
Just put me down!

199
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:17,760
Everybody... home, now!

200
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,857
Thanks, mister!

201
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:32,095
Sorry. I just had to...
Save the day.

202
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,994
So, what's next?

203
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,338
Sorry my locator spell
wasn't more accurate.

204
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,269
Like I said,
I need all the help I can get.

205
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:55,239
He should be... close?

206
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,850
I guess you can't expect magic
to be an exact science.

207
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,164
Was that a clever play on words?

208
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,791
<i>Wonderful wit
and sparkling theatrics.</i>

209
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,480
Mr. Blur's really upped his game.

210
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,786
Found it.

211
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:30,643
I always knew you were packing
some heavy artillery under that tie,

212
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:33,312
but... seeing through walls.

213
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:37,441
- Now, that's a showstopper.
- All in a day's work, I guess.

214
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,030
Wait. With powers like yours,

215
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:44,020
how can you possibly say
"all in a day's work"?

216
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,567
I don't really think about it.

217
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,649
Just being like this
is almost like breathing now.

218
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:53,778
And with a gift like that
comes responsibilities.

219
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,211
Exactly.

220
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:59,698
I've spent so much time
trying to do what's right

221
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,996
That I guess I haven't had any
time for anything but reality.

222
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:05,432
These people

223
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,872
out here with their capes,
I don't know they just don't get it.

224
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:15,677
Right there with you.
Magic, fantasy.

225
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:19,908
It's all in a day's work.
Day in, day out.

226
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,553
What I create
as everyone else's fantasies

227
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:26,105
have become so... normal.

228
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,217
I suppose even the illusionist
can become disillusioned.

229
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,348
But at least you have
that fiery space trooper

230
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:39,473
to stargaze with
at the end of the day.

231
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,146
Based on my last relationship I'm afraid
I'm keeping Lois at arm's length.

232
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,913
You're afraid that
if you let that spark ignite,

233
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,492
you're gonna get burned again.

234
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,546
Right now,
everything's under control.

235
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,827
Fantasy isn't
about being in control,

236
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:04,899
and fire. Doesn't always
have to burn.

237
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:09,787
Maybe what you need is
a tiny moment of true fantasy

238
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:14,461
to remind you
what sparks are all about.

239
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,201
Dumet-tes.

240
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:23,179
I'm good, thanks.

241
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:24,404
No.

242
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,014
No, you're not.

243
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:33,161
Sparks lead to flames and fire

244
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:36,424
is what keeps us alive.

245
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,494
Now...

246
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,345
I can't do this.

247
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:10,650
That's a shame.

248
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,381
I think we found a mouth
more magical than mine.

249
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,358
- See you later.
- Thank you.

250
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:50,173
- Oliver, what's up?
- Me?

251
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:53,374
Just, owed Lois some Sharks tickets.

252
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,199
But you, buddy...

253
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,056
you may be bulletproof but you might
want to duck and cover in there.

254
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:02,681
Good luck.

255
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:15,577
So, your friend Zatanna,

256
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:18,047
what was she dressed up as, anyway?

257
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:23,213
That's just how she dresses some...

258
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:25,273
Of course it is.

259
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:28,151
You don't have
anything to worry about With Zatanna.

260
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:31,888
Of course I don't.
Want to know why?

261
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,926
Jealous women worry.
Me? Not jealous, not even a little.

262
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:39,530
See, I know that I have nothing
to worry about because Clark Kent

263
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,541
he is the most honest man
that I know.

264
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:46,011
So, if anything were
to happen between...

265
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:49,439
the farm boy and lady fishnets,

266
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:52,041
Lois Lane would be the first
to know about it,

267
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,733
not the last, right?

268
00:21:58,337 --> 00:22:02,073
You can tell your supervisor
that I find it highly ironic

269
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:05,946
that I can't find anyone
worth talking to in missing persons.

270
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:16,555
When did we drift from missing
comic to missing persons?

271
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:21,405
We course-corrected when
our thief's aunt filed a report.

272
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,243
Aunt?
How old's our thief?

273
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:28,192
Meet Alec Abrams, our preteen
pre-convict. He's been A.W.O.L.

274
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:31,084
ever since he stole the book,
not that I can blame him.

275
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:34,437
It's worth thousands and thousands of dollars.
The cops are still looking for him.

276
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:38,566
The police are the least of his worries.
We need to find him as soon as we can.

277
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,518
Don't think I haven't been trying.

278
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:45,647
His I.D. Was flagged in the Planet
database as a potential story.

279
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:50,564
He kept sending letters to the post
office addressed to "The Blur."

280
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,358
Your world
is so much better than mine.

281
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:58,412
I wish I could be a hero
so I wouldn't get bullied at school.

282
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:02,541
I wish I could be a hero like you
so I could have saved my parents.

283
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:06,947
I used to think
heroes weren't real until you showed up.

284
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,563
Looks like our little juvy
is in desperate need for a big brother.

285
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:15,888
He's just looking for someone to
understand what he's going through.

286
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:31,290
I don't get why you didn't want
to come up here. This place is awesome.

287
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:34,026
It's way cooler than my room.

288
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:38,155
- I mean my pad.
- I must have gotten my signals mixed.

289
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:40,984
I certainly didn't think
this is what you meant

290
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,537
When you said
you wanted to come upstairs.

291
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:48,210
- Why do you keep doing that?
- Doing what?

292
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:51,005
You keep trying not to smile,
like, the whole night.

293
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,732
We're having fun, right?

294
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:56,424
Sure... I guess.

295
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:59,770
You guess? Come on!
Get up here!

296
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,546
No. I've never even touched
Lois' Xbox. I would look ridiculous.

297
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:06,538
That's the whole point! Maybe you need
to look ridiculous.

298
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,884
When's the last time
you had any fun?

299
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,740
- I have lots of fun.
- Just tell me when,

300
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,868
and you can keep sitting there Watching
me have all the fun you're not having.

301
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:18,012
All right, fine. Look, if I get up,

302
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:20,248
do you promise to answer
all my questions?

303
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,883
Cross my heart.

304
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,096
Ooh, geez.

305
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:34,466
All right. A deal's a deal.
Powers, what's under the hood?

306
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:40,118
Your standard superspeed,
enhanced strength,

307
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,343
augmented hearing. I like to call it
Angel hearing.

308
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:45,759
But I think that's it.

309
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:51,833
- How about flight?
- What? Why would you think I could...

310
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:56,526
holy crap. I can fly?

311
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:02,176
Holy crap! I can fly!

312
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:23,213
Come on.

313
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,877
We have to give this a whirl.

314
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,214
What happens if I fall?

315
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:54,275
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

316
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,543
So, you got caught up in the moment.

317
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:17,998
Under magical duress.

318
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,984
I was just trying to give you
some perspective.

319
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:26,113
Even though we live lives
that everyone else thinks are fantastic

320
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:29,807
Doesn't mean we don't get to take a break
from the real world every now and then.

321
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,561
We don't get to take breaks.

322
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:35,690
Which is why us superfriends
got to stick together.

323
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:39,178
I think I have a spell for that.

324
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:45,273
Am I interrupting something?

325
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:51,016
You certainly seem to be
in good spirits.

326
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:54,944
Yeah, I had a really good night
For the first time in a while...

327
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,927
which is more than I can say
for the two of you.

328
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:05,660
The company that published
the "Warrior Angel" comic book,

329
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:08,010
they stole the idea from
a friend of Zatanna's father.

330
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:10,401
In order to exact
some old-world retribution,

331
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:13,170
my father put a curse
on the original comic

332
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,913
hoping to teach
the publisher a lesson.

333
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,948
But the publisher never opened the comic
book and neither did anyone else

334
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:21,255
not until yesterday.

335
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,623
Stephen Swift?

336
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:36,752
There isn't anything wrong with having
another hero on the street, right?

337
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:41,020
There is when he's just a kid.
And according to Zatanna's research.

338
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:45,636
The curse should have turned
Alec into a full-grown hero.

339
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:51,131
<i>Oh, my God.
He is just a boy.</i>

340
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:53,666
If we can figure out
what he looks like as an adult,

341
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,668
we can use Watchtower
to track him down.

342
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:58,292
And then I can slap him
with a counter curse and

343
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,517
we'll have him home by breakfast.

344
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:04,603
I'm fine. I just have a few things
I need to look in to.

345
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:07,074
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

346
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,244
Remember how you said
magic wasn't an exact science?

347
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,987
There's a catch, too,

348
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,167
And my dad really outdid himself
on this one.

349
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:23,669
There's a monster
at the end of the book.

350
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:30,567
Not surprised your dad's friend
had trouble selling this.

351
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:34,252
This isn't the origins of a superhero.
It's the birth of a villain.

352
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:37,977
In the original story,
Warrior Angel becomes Devilicus.

353
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:42,372
And the moment our hero feels
the slightest bit betrayed...

354
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,294
he becomes a monster.

355
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:02,986
I got a bunch of new games
I think you might like.

356
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:05,689
Or maybe we could order
some pizza. What's wrong?

357
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:09,232
I know your real secret. I know
that you stole a cursed comic book

358
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:13,084
and that's how you got your powers And I
know you're a lot younger than you look.

359
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:17,569
It was just an accident.

360
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,473
I had to look inside and now
I'm finally a hero, and I won't go back.

361
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,775
Look, my friend Zatanna
can reverse this curse, okay?

362
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,311
I just wanted to get to you
first so you wouldn't freak out.

363
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:29,729
- We're gonna get you back to normal.
- Normal?

364
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:33,786
Normal means being whaled on
at school every day.

365
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:36,555
Normal means not having
the power to defend myself.

366
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,558
Do you have any idea
how much my actual life sucked?

367
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:42,194
This is everything I ever wanted!

368
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,202
- No one can ever hurt me again!
- But this isn't real, Alec.

369
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,735
You're gonna find a way
to get through this, okay?

370
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,072
That's what being a kid
is all about. Now, you just calm down.

371
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,208
My name is not Alec.

372
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,159
This is who I am now,
and I won't go back.

373
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:00,260
You can't make me.

374
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:02,796
No one can.

375
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:19,611
I have a feeling no one's gonna
push me around ever again.

376
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:32,782
I think we're a little late to the
party. Can't find my guest of honor yet.

377
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:35,237
The computer's doing
a facial-recognition search

378
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:38,396
based on the age progression
from Alec's photo.

379
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,231
Abracadabra.

380
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:49,854
Why didn't she say something?

381
00:30:51,274 --> 00:30:55,060
If you found out your hero was really a
12-year-old how would you have reacted?

382
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:01,357
If I were Chloe,
I'd try to fix it myself.

383
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:09,412
Let me go, please!
Put me down!

384
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,009
Please tell me your
counter curse is ready to go.

385
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,937
As ready as it's gonna be.

386
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,895
Bring our girl home.

387
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:45,837
Just tell me
where your friend is so I can stop her.

388
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:50,707
I don't want to hurt you, Chloe,
but I will if I need to.

389
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:53,476
Think this through.
You want to be a hero, right?

390
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:55,800
This isn't something
a hero would do.

391
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,816
Lethal enforcers
are way more interesting.

392
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:05,919
- They were big in the'90s.
- You see, that's Alec talking.

393
00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:09,624
You're still in there. Think about your
parents. They would want their little boy.

394
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:13,467
You don't know anything about my parents,
you don't know anything about me!

395
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,594
What is that?

396
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,439
You hear that?!

397
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,515
You all right?

398
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:03,831
It sucks.

399
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,676
Everything's gonna be okay.

400
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,289
How's Chloe?

401
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,880
She's been better.

402
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:49,516
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

403
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,655
I've never felt like a...

404
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,194
Like a bully before?

405
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,699
Yeah.

406
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,800
No one starts out
wanting to be the bad guy.

407
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:09,922
Life can be pretty hard on you
sometimes, huh?

408
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,374
The test of a true hero is not letting
the sadness and the loneliness take over.

409
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:21,569
Especially
when you have superpowers.

410
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:24,023
Especially.

411
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:28,027
Just because you can do something
doesn't mean you should.

412
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:30,208
That sounds hard.

413
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:34,028
- It is.
- So, why do you do it?

414
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,815
I do it
because I want to help people...

415
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,760
Like you.

416
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,874
Not because I have to
but because I choose to.

417
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,123
- What do I do now?
- You...

418
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:55,504
Should go home
and be a kid, remember

419
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:57,466
the next time you run into a bully

420
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:00,930
- that there is some goodness in there.
- 'cause everyone's worth saving.

421
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,812
And a hero's work is never done.

422
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:09,212
Before I go,
I want to give you something.

423
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:16,231
I wrote this when
you were still red and blue,

424
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:20,360
and I didn't really know
what you looked like then so...

425
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:27,608
I like the "S" better.

426
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:30,168
I do, too.

427
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:42,045
Oh, thank God!

428
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:54,818
I could swear there's a twinkle
of magic in your eyes...

429
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:57,805
or is it just pride
in a job well done?

430
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:03,833
I think I always gain a bit of
perspective when you blow through town.

431
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,962
Careful. A girl might just start
to crush on you.

432
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:12,287
Are you sure we can't keep
this team-up rolling?

433
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:14,796
I mean, you've saved me
more than once now,

434
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:17,529
And I'd love to return the favor.

435
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:20,273
As flattered as I am...

436
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:28,769
I think I'm interested in finding
my fantasy somewhere else.

437
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:31,934
It must be love.

438
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,944
Make sure she knows
just how lucky she is, Clark.

439
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,898
I don't know how many wands
she had to wave,

440
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:03,027
but your lady magician managed to
get the charges dropped against Alec.

441
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,438
It helps that she knew the family
of the original author.

442
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:09,217
Listen, about Zatanna,

443
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:12,436
i Let me preface this by saying
that she is just a friend.

444
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:14,599
Spit it out, Clark.

445
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,711
When we were tracking down
a lead for the comic,

446
00:37:20,836 --> 00:37:23,774
which was the truth and totally still is
the truth her and I got to talking about

447
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:26,813
the fact that she was really stressed
out about being on the road for so long,

448
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:29,031
I got caught up
in my own stuff so much

449
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:31,648
that I didn't realize
she'd gotten so close to me.

450
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:36,669
She kissed me But it's not
what I meant to happen. Honest.

451
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:43,114
I was wondering how long
it would take you to fess up.

452
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:47,203
For a guy without a single poker face,
you've got like a million tells

453
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:51,117
and you wouldn't look me in the eye
and you smelled like a magazine insert.

454
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,463
Let me assure you that
this will never happen again.

455
00:37:57,205 --> 00:38:01,209
It's just this whole thing with
us It's new to me right now.

456
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,118
Yeah?
It's new for me, too.

457
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:10,348
Do you think that I like...
Being insecure? I don't.

458
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:14,559
I just have to get used to the reality
that I'm not the only gal

459
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:17,800
that thinks you're fantastic.

460
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:22,820
This isn't the reaction I expected.

461
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:26,120
Expect the unexpected.

462
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,032
That look on your face.
Remember how that feels

463
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:41,959
the next time one of your sexy lady
friends invades your personal space.

464
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:47,520
I'm gonna finish my apology now.

465
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:51,649
At the end of the con every year,
there's a costume ball.

466
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:55,076
- You hate costumes.
- Yes.

467
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:58,816
But I was rethinking
what I said about not understanding...

468
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:03,507
Fantasy And...

469
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:10,664
You asked me what my dream was,
and it's this...

470
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:14,665
with you, Lois.

471
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:24,297
Now, that, my friend...

472
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,613
is an apology.

473
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:32,623
I get to pick out your costume.

474
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,251
Slow night?

475
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:43,657
I just figured I'd squeeze in
some target practice...

476
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,955
and a single malt.

477
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,518
Did you bring enough
for the rest of the class?

478
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:52,952
Help yourself, professor.

479
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,116
Running a little light
on allegory tonight.

480
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:58,691
Bumpy day?

481
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:02,666
Not the smoothest.

482
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,584
Someone asked me When the last time
I had a good time was,

483
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:09,284
and I didn't have an answer.

484
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:19,301
I don't think anyone
can fault you for being on edge, Chloe.

485
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:23,878
If anyone can relate,
it's me. I get it.

486
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,120
Yeah, you can.

487
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:31,573
Sometimes you got to take your fun

488
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:34,643
where you can get it.

489
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,935
And sometimes...

490
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,989
it's right in front of your face.

491
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:43,101
You just have to want to see it.

492
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:48,963
Come on.

493
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:07,090
How do I know when to let go?

494
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,736
It's all about your heart.

495
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:16,548
Just listen,

496
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:19,166
right there in between the beats.

497
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,184
That's when you let go.

498
