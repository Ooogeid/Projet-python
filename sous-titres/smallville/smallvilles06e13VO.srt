1
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,937
Chloe,
what the heck is this?

2
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,876
I thought we were coming in here

3
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:18,017
to get a coffee.
how could you do this|to me?

4
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:21,311
I didn't know. I swear.
I'm sorry, Clark.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,045
No... hey.

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,171
You're not gonna spend the rest of your life
hiding in the barn, either.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,270
Let's go.

8
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:29,817
What is it you always say
about valentine's day?

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,684
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,567
Our annual sneak peek at hell.

11
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:34,947
That must have been
before cupid struck.

12
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,271
Don't you think after being
trapped in a front seat

13
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:38,617
to the clark/lana operetta

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,821
I deserve a good v-day?

15
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:41,834
You're the only person

16
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:43,783
who can make me feel
guilty,

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,473
relieved,
and a little sad

18
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,801
all in one sentence.

19
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:49,249
It's a gift.

20
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,498
Don't worry, Clark.

21
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:53,696
Your achy-breaky heart will
go away, too, one of these days.

22
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:55,254
Can you put that
in writing?

23
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,812
Just give the lana thing
a little more time.

24
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:01,291
You never know when the next love of your
life is right around the corner.

25
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:03,915
Oh.

26
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:08,572
Is it really wrong that I want these
chubby cherubs to burst into flames?

27
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,345
The way I see it, Valentine's day is like
finding out how babies are born.

28
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:12,907
What?

29
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,310
just stay with me.

30
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:18,147
It seems so weird and confusing,
but when that bomb finally hits,

31
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:21,057
It's like everything clicks into place.
it all seems to make sense.

32
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,579
What's wrong with you?

33
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,267
Jimmy...

34
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:33,140
...and Lois.

35
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:35,130
Welcome
to the love fest.

36
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,899
Yeah, and me
without my uzi.

37
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,007
Excuse us
for just one second.

38
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,714
What are you doing?

39
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,476
We were supposed to take Clark
out tonight, rember?

40
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,042
Yeah, well, Lois was all alone,

41
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,732
and...then it hit me.

42
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:55,750
Lois and Clark.

43
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,958
Lois and Clark?

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,405
You got to admit,
they got chemistry.

45
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,366
Yeah, so do nitroglycerin
and peroxide,

46
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,731
and I don't suggest
putting them together.

47
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:08,720
Come on.

48
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,272
Please tell me
we weren't just set up.

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,755
Looks like it.

50
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,160
Us.

51
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,527
That's like hot fudge

52
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:30,722
and halibut.

53
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:33,348
I take it I'm the halibut.

54
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,708
Naturally.

55
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:36,918
Well,

56
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:38,078
I've had my

57
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:40,048
fill of fat babies with arrows.

58
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,272
knock yourself out, Lois.

59
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:44,710
Little down on love?

60
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,632
After my breakup,

61
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,046
Cupid could use me
for target practice,

62
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:51,734
and I still wouldn't feel
anything.

63
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,152
Then maybe you need
a little euphoria elixir

64
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,891
or romance remedy.

65
00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:59,912
Just a nudge
in order to move on.

66
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:01,380
Move on?

67
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:03,597
Honey, you're talking
to somebody

68
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,523
who's still waiting for
acid-wash to come back in style.

69
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:09,033
Try this.

70
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:13,209
it's made with jasmine and a mixture
of aphrodisiac oils.

71
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:17,842
I get the brilliant hue
from red meteor rocks.

72
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:26,329
This is gonna make me fall
in love with someone new?

73
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,887
The first man
you set eyes on.

74
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,386
Hmm...

75
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:35,559
who knows? maybe this color will look
good on me, huh?

76
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,462
Clark.

77

81
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,763
Yes, I will be attending
the engagement party.

82
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:10,492
Martha Kent. Thank you.

83
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,396
Hi! How was
the Valentine's party?

84
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:15,071
I lived to see another day.

85
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:16,013
Clark.

86
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,437
Mom, really,
if it's more love advice,

87
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,937
I got my quota last night,
trust me,

88
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,138
But thank you.

89
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:36,619
Lois.

90
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:41,688
Is Clark here?

91
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,883
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Come in.

92
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,871
Hey, Lois, listen, I'm sorry that Jimmy
pulled you into that last night.

93
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,317
I mean,
after Oliver and...

94
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,682
Oliver's history.

95
00:05:58,613 --> 00:05:59,686
Actually,

96
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:02,029
Mrs. K, can you
give us a couple minutes?

97
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,303
Yeah.
um, I-I'll be upstairs.

98
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:21,100
Here we find ourselves...

99
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,564
all alone.

100
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,148
Wow.

101
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:28,455
How did I never notice

102
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:30,836
what big, strong hands you have?

103
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,306
What's going on, lois?

104
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,785
Well, you know me.

105
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:37,831
I'm not very good
with words, so...

106
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:45,850
People don't think whitesnake
sings power ballads,
but

107
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,251
they do.

108
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,470
you made me a mix cd

109
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,744
Yeah.

110
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,410
I will kill you
if you tell anyone this, but...

111
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:01,528
there is nothing

112
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,142
that I love more

113
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,225
than slow-dancing

114
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,327
with some big,

115
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:10,433
strong arms around me...

116
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:12,659
just like yours,

117
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:17,471
smallville.

118
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:17,767
l- lois, why --

119
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,331
why don't you go put this on?

120
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,239
okay.

121
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,533
I know how you dance,
so...

122
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:34,475
just in case --

123
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,441
clark?

124
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,109
lana.

125
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:52,698
I'm kind of surprised

126
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:53,377
to see you here.

127
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,186
yeah, I know that we left things

128
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,325
in a weird place.

129
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:58,516
come in.

130
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,419
I'll, uh, take credit

131
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:05,032
for the weirdness,

132
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:05,763
but to be honest,

133
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:06,749
you're the one who did

134
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:08,323
the leaving.

135
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:09,232
I was --

136
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,802
I was really frustrated.

137
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,297
chloe, I can't afford

138
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:16,899
to lose you, too.

139
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:22,253
ever since I've been with lex,
I feel like I've lost everyone else in my life.

140
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,765
well, are you sure
it's that you lost them,

141
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,412
or were you being forced
to leave them behind?

142
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:31,298
it seems like you've been

143
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:32,802
walled up in the mansion.

144
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:34,601
it's not like

145
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,295
I'm in captivity.

146
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:36,920
right, well,

147
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,159
not in so many words,

148
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,619
but I know how protective
lex is

149
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,448
over the things

150
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:41,583
he values the most.

151
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,066
chloe, I know that

152
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,757
you're just looking out for me,

153
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:45,482
and you've done your
maid-of-honor duty

154
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,047
and asked the tough questions,

155
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:51,570
but I was hoping that we could
just get past this.

156
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,117
okay.

157
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:55,964
case closed.

158
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,553
did I, uh,

159
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,690
did I miss something?
maid of honor?

160
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,235
yeah. I hope that you're not
allergic to taffeta.

161
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:08,182
that's actually
why I came by.

162
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,818
will you stand up with me?

163
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,003
of course.

164
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,746
so, uh

165
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,088
does this mean
that we just ignore

166
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,191
the huge elephant named clark
in the corner?

167
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,947
whatever he's hiding,

168
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:28,358
he chose to confide in the
people that he trusts the most,

169
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:31,442
and as much as I wish
that I was one of those people,

170
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,879
I can't hold it
against you.

171
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray clark's secret

172
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,637
if you'll stop denying
that he has one.

173
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,227
will this holiday ever end?

174
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:20,088
sorry to be the culprit
of such a felony-sized pda.

175
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:21,412
we were supposed to meet
20 minutes ago.

176
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,127
where have you been?

177
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,911
I just, uh,
got stuck in traffic.

178
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:31,044
I did some digging into our
favorite martian manhunter,

179
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,572
but it's just
coming up empty.

180
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,924
we have another manhunter
to worry about.

181
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,271
Lois.

182
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,018
why does that make me picture
her wielding an ax

183
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,286
at every man
in metropolis?

184
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:43,556
she's only after one man.

185
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:46,794
lois is...

186
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,392
into me.

187
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,893
she's into you?
what, like...

188
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,074
she really pulled out
all the stops.

189
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:07,084
she's not herself, all right?
it's like she...

190
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:09,223
overdosed on love
potion number 9 or something,

191
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,224
and this isn't funny!

192
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,419
pretty funny.

193
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,465
Chloe...

194
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,820
we have to find out
what happened

195
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,419
before she strikes again.

196
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:17,747
too late.

197
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,516
there you are.

198
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:23,381
I have been searching
all over for you.

199
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:26,115
look what I got.

200
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:33,471
maybe you could get one
to match.

201
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,025
I- I think you're right
about that story.

202
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,567
I'm gonna look into it.

203
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:40,987
Ah..Chloe...

204
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:43,791
hi, you.

205
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,039
hi.

206
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:48,874
Lois...

207
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:52,427
Lois...

208
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,763
you can pour on the modesty
all you want, smallville.

209
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:58,044
it only makes you
that much more adorable.

210
00:11:58,295 --> 00:11:59,276
Lois.

211
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,180
what happened to you
when I left last night?

212
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,670
I went home...

213
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,370
alone.

214
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:07,759
but you know where I
wanted to be.

215
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,686
nothing screams romance like
a dusty newspaper office.

216
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:37,004
come on.
you can do better than this.

217
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:39,965
I was planning on it.

218
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:42,432
not that I'm
complaining, but...

219
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:44,638
isn't this a little sudden?

220
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:47,692
all this time, one kiss, and all
of a sudden, you like me?

221
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:50,361
no, I mean it.

222
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:52,342
this is for real, isn't it?

223
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,966
oh, yeah, this couldn't
be more real.

224
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,198
wait. wait.
wait a minute.

225
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,232
wait.

226
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:09,216
I knew I'd kissed you
before --

227
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,117
in the alley.

228
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:16,526
you're green arrow.

229
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:20,139
hardly --I was just pretending to be
so you wouldn't know it was oliver.

230
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:22,539
Oliver?

231
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,413
oh, my god.

232
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,464
all those times
he disappeared.

233
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:36,618
what is my deal with emotionally
unavailable weekend warriors?

234
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,710
thank god I finally
found a normal guy.

235
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:50,110
what do you mean "normal"?

236
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,696
oliver's not even
in the same league as me.

237
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:56,286
you don't have to be macho
just for me.

238
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:02,140
I like the dorky
farm-boy thing.

239
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,904
dorkier than a hood
and a quiver?

240
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,371
just because I don't wear
a costume

241
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:08,948
and splash my face
all over the papers --

242
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:09,756
clark!

243
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:11,756
so what if your signature move

244
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,439
is driving a tractor?

245
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,791
I think it's adorable.

246
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:21,171
you know, lois, I think
that it's time for you,

247
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:22,600
to meet the real clark kent.

248
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:42,372
I have a surprise for you.

249
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:44,916
I thought we said no gifts
for the engagement dinner.

250
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,125
it's not exactly
for the dinner.

251
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,191
so, I have this dilemma.

252
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:12,276
I can't decide between...

253
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,216
stegosaurus

254
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:16,289
or mr. duck.

255
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,017
that's really sweet, lex,

256
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,463
but don't you think
it's kind of...

257
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,582
I know it's kind of early, but

258
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,099
but the doctor said
you're perfectly healthy.

259
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:33,745
I just don't know
if it's a good idea

260
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:34,919
to have all of this stuff
out here.

261
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,634
there's a lot
of people around.

262
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:40,097
nobody knows about this pregnancy
apart from clark and chloe, so --

263
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,662
what if they did?

264
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,400
I was thinking,

265
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,591
what if we announced it
tonight at the party?

266
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,405
I- I don't know
if that's a great idea.

267
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:54,743
I think that tonight should be
about our engagement.

268
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,212
it sort of feels like
you're in denial,

269
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:09,134
like if no one finds out
about the baby, it doesn't exist.

270
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:14,821
lex, do you know how many people
are looking over my shoulder,

271
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:17,191
second-guessing
why I'm marrying you?

272
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:24,024
am I that hard a sell?

273
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,358
I don't want people assuming
that we're getting married

274
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:27,591
because of this baby.

275
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,481
I want them to know
that I'm with you

276
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:32,903
because I love you.

277
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:52,309
this is a beautiful detour,
but what are we doing up here?

278
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,745
that's oliver's balcony
over there, isn't it?

279
00:16:57,425 --> 00:17:00,394
What, that tiny speck
under the clock tower?

280
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:07,165
Clark,

281
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:08,362
this isn't funny,

282
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,872
you can come back down now.

283
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,217
Or you can come up there with me.

284
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,960
I'd like to see Oliver do this.

285
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:55,147
What did you say about a dorky farm boy?

286
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,255
Able to leap tall
buildings in a single bound.

287
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:06,372
I can't wait to see
what else you can do.

288
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,672
Well, I'm fast

289
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:11,252
but not too fast.

290
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,950
You're being very bad.

291
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,927
You know, the last time I was here,
I was with a good friend of yours.

292
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,237
Obviously he wasn't that good.

293
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:36,856
I better make sure you
didn't spell my name wrong.

294
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,951
Sounds like a real rager, doesn't it?

295
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,261
Can't say I'm surprised
I wasn't invited.

296
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,777
I rsvp'ed back before
Oliver, headed for the hills,

297
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:18,498
but now I found a better
way to occupy my night.

298
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,134
What, and disappointing
the future mrs. Luthor?

299
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,204
I don't think so. Besides...

300
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:27,549
it's not a party until
someone crashes it.

301
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,611
Thanks for the roses.

302
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:42,677
Thanks for this.

303
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,077
Yeah, I don't know. it just...

304
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,261
it kind of seemed very you.

305
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:48,081
I love it,

306
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:51,125
but it might sit on the bench
till my next style renaissance

307
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,946
or until...

308
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,745
I'm off the blacklist
at the Luthor mansion.

309
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,151
Aren't you supposed to
be leaving for Smallville

310
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,643
in negative 2 minutes?

311
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,487
Yeah.

312
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:04,752
but I'm gonna have to push the boundaries
of fashionably late on this one,

313
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,883
because I just got a huge lead on
whatever love nip Lois rolled in.

314
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:12,320
You just can't admit that I'm
a natural-born cupid, can you?

315
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,306
Jimmy

316
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,633
I know that you would love to
think that your little nudge,

317
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,847
actually caused this
whole thing, but trust me,

318
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,397
Lois would have to be
shot out of a cannon

319
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,510
to romantically land anywhere,
in the direction of Clark.

320
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,470
Sounds kind of like you're jealous.

321
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:28,997
Of Lois?

322
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:32,188
No, of anyone getting
in between you and Clark.

323
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:36,069
Come on, you spend
all your time with him,

324
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:38,177
and then you make up
all these excuses, why?

325
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:39,417
You know what, Jimmy?

326
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:40,743
On the list of personality quirks,

327
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,029
that I have learned to fall in love with,
paranoia is definitely at the bottom.

328
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:46,940
Translated to "back off"?

329
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,099
Yep.

330
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,682
Got it.

331
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,247
Chloe.

332
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:55,346
Pushing it.

333
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,275
Look, if you're really not jealous,

334
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,444
then why are you bailing on your
best friend's engagement party?

335
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,436
Clark's a big boy, how much
damage can Lois really do?

336
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,042
You know, you're right.

337
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:11,973
I can just delegate.

338
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,711
I've done that...

339
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:15,762
once.

340
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,785
And since I doubt the
rose peddler doused Lois,

341
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:21,139
I'm putting all my money
on the oil essence lady. So,

342
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,569
you can just meet her in an hour.

343
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,515
Here's the address.

344
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:30,477
Thanks.

345
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:32,041
You're my guy.

346
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,859
Looking for a little inspiration?

347
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,120
No. Thanks. I've already got my muse.

348
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,252
So, is this supposed to make you feel...

349
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:03,292
blissful or whatever?

350
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:06,056
Not "supposed to". It does.

351
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:10,239
Oh. That sounds kind of easy.

352
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,185
You're on the rebound,

353
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:12,845
you just rub some sexy goo on,

354
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:14,475
and wham! You're singing
Barry White songs again.

355
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:18,393
Indigenous cultures have used
herbal oils for centuries.

356
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:21,920
We've strayed so far from
nature, we think we're above it.

357
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,894
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, nature, good.

358
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,728
Greenhouse gases, bad. I get it. Look,

359
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,754
my girlfriend thinks that you dosed her
cousin with a love potion last night.

360
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,110
Tall, loud, down on love?

361
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:36,576
That would be Lois.

362
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:37,273
So,

363
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,447
do you have any, like,

364
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:40,154
anti-love exfoliant,

365
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:43,258
or whatever something to take the
vaseline off the lens, so to speak?

366
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:53,407
This will counteract the aphrodisiac.

367
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:56,558
But I usually have a
sixth sense about people.

368
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:02,791
Something tells me Lois
and Clark's destinies

369
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:05,568
are a little more
entwined than they realize.

370
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,743
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

371
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:43,752
I just wanted to thank you
all for joing us to celebrate.

372
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:45,712
Over the years, I'm sure

373
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,621
some of you have placed a few bets

374
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:49,330
on whether I'd settle down.

375
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,855
But this couldn't be
further from settling.

376
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,983
I'd like to toast my beautiful fiancee'

377
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:01,501
for making me happier than
I thought I could ever be.

378
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:10,540
Looks like we missed dinner.

379
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,647
Clark,

380
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,851
what are you doing here?

381
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,968
Come on, Lex. You didn't think
I was gonna miss this, did you?

382
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,164
And look.

383
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:22,239
My own mother would rather raise a glass

384
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:24,150
with the enemy than
stand by her own son.

385
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:25,367
Clark,

386
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,134
You're not yourself.

387
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,299
It's okay, mom.

388
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,297
You're more a Luthor than
a Kent these days anyway.

389
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:32,937
I mean, dad's been, what

390
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,459
dead a year?

391
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,600
But who can blame you for
joing the race with Lana.

392
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:41,208
To see who's gonna add the Luthor
monogram to their name first?

393
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:46,130
Lex, he's obviously on something,
and he wants us to react.

394
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,665
Please don't.

395
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:51,468
Chloe.

396
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,669
I can't say that I'm surprised
that you're celebrating here.

397
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:58,924
After all, once Lana's off the market,
all those years of unrequited pining,

398
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:01,000
may actually pay off.

399
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,845
I can't say I haven't thought about it.

400
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:09,811
And you.

401
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,706
You know, I got to hand it to you.

402
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,630
If you were gonna rebound, why not choose
the one person that i hated the most?

403
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,923
But, I mean, come on, Lana.
The joke's over by now, isn't it?

404
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:26,660
Clark, I think you've
done enough damage.

405
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:28,987
- Why don't you leave?
- I'm not done yet!

406
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,982
Besides, Lex, I haven't
given you my gift yet.

407
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,880
Congratulations on sealing the deal.

408
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,356
To baby Luthor...

409
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,629
The real reason that
Lana's marrying you.

410
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:02,652
Lex!

411
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:08,994
- How dare you?
- Lana, if no one else in this

412
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:11,174
room is gonna save you
from Lex, then I will.

413
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:13,984
I don't think so.

414
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,779
Lana is your past.
I'm your future.

415
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:19,272
This is the present.

416
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,014
Clark was acting like he was
exposed to red kryptonite.

417
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:45,267
I'm guessing it wasn't a coincidence that Lois
went hopelessly to devoted at the same time.

418
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,633
According to Jimmy, I think
we may have found our culprit.

419
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,370
Lipstick?

420
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,516
Infused with a cupid's cocktail.

421
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,902
Lois was hit with an aphrodisiac.

422
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,477
- But that shouldn't affect clark.
- Well, it didn't,

423
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:01,516
but I'm guessing that the lipstick's ruby-red
sheen didn't come from crushed cranberries.

424
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:06,302
If he was infected with a kryptonite kiss, the second
he was away from Lois, he should have been fine.

425
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:09,994
I think Lois' kisses were a
little more than skin deep.

426
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:12,716
I think it's in his system.

427
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:15,858
He wasn't good enough for me anyway.

428
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:21,155
I'll let you handle Lois. Hopefully,
I can find Clark before Lex does.

429
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:25,092
- Hey. You got it?
- Mugwort,

430
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:28,243
a.k.a. a delegating success story.

431
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:32,243
Once this hits her skin,
Lois' pumpkin ride is over.

432
00:27:32,506 --> 00:27:34,887
What does she have that I don't?

433
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,711
So weird to see her acting like a girl.

434
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:47,971
What's that?

435
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,976
Just a little something to help
break the infatuation spell.

436
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:53,922
I think it's time we get
those glass slippers back.

437
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:58,015
You know what? Stop
making fun of my feelings!

438
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:13,037
Just because you never got Clark doesn't
mean you need to take it out on me.

439
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:27,946
Uh...

440
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:33,809
Wow, this is awkward.

441
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,804
Please tell me I was
going to a costume party.

442
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:49,122
You humiliated me in
front of my friends.

443
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:51,581
Come on, Lana. You hardly
knew anyone at that party.

444
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:58,076
- Clark, what do you want from me?
- What I've always wanted --

445
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,978
- For you to be happy.
- I would love to know how that feels,

446
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:06,164
but it seems like every time I get
close, you rip it all away from me.

447
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:07,959
Lana, stop kidding yourself.

448
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,910
You're never gonna
be satisfied with Lex.

449
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:16,354
You can't marry him.

450
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:20,442
I've already made up my mind.

451
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:24,754
Even though you're
still in love with me?

452
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,951
What makes you so sure?

453
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,370
Because I'm still in love with you.

454
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:07,750
Don't marry Lex.
Marry me.

455
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:15,795
I have given you...

456
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,308
Every chance.

457
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:26,886
I have stood in this spot so many times,
just waiting for you to say something,

458
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,805
and you decide to do it now?

459
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:37,297
You don't love me, Clark.

460
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,144
You just can't stand the
idea that I love someone else.

461
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:47,154
Lana!

462
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,402
Lana!

463
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,237
Lex.

464
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,874
Go ahead, Lana, tell him --
that you'd rather be with me.

465
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:12,288
Oh. Well, it didn't seem to bother you
two minutes ago when you were kissing me.

466
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:21,537
What do you really expect
is gonna happen now, Clark?

467
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:23,176
Exactly what you're afraid of.

468
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,337
I'm not a competition.

469
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:27,674
You are to Lex.

470
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,113
He didn't tell you?

471
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,171
He's always wanted
everything I've ever had.

472
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,742
And you were at the top of that list.

473
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,288
You're just a trophy to him.

474
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:42,166
And he's nothing but
your consolation prize.

475
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,625
Tell me you don't love me.

476
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,498
Lana! Tell me you don't --

477
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,547
Stay away from her.

478
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,498
You don't want to do that.

479
00:31:58,591 --> 00:31:59,976
You can't win.

480
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:02,522
You don't even know
the rules of the game.

481
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,758
Clark, stop it!

482
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:17,261
If I'd have known who you
were gonna turn out to be,

483
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:19,617
I never would have
saved you on that bridge.

484
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,622
Clark, you're killing him!

485
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:37,744
Lana, let me handle this.

486
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:39,958
Please, just leave.

487
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:02,391
Clark, are you okay?

488
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:05,123
Oh, sweetie.

489
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,130
If you hadn't shown up in time, I'm not
sure what I would have done to Lex.

490
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:17,413
How'd you know what to do?

491
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,307
The last time you had some
kind of kryptonite in your system,

492
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:21,837
you had to sweat it out.

493
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:24,625
Weakening you seemed to be our only chance.

494
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:27,991
I just can't believe all those things I did.

495
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,159
I can.

496
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,984
I guess I can't blame you for
being mad at me, too.

497
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:37,792
Clark.

498
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:41,080
You've walked around here
for years bottling everything up,

499
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:43,566
basing every decision on what's best for other people.

500
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:46,634
You never stop to think what's best for you.

501
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:51,213
Mom, you don't think I really meant
those things I said about you and Chloe.

502
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,429
I think there was a grain of truth in all of it.

503
00:33:54,536 --> 00:33:56,850
Every time you've been
affected by red kryptonite,

504
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:58,963
it hasn't changed who you are.

505
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,549
It's just stripped away your inhibitions.

506
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:05,163
I think you need to start being
more honest about how you feel.

507
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,310
So...

508
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:09,578
You're saying that I want to kiss Lois

509
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,150
and keep Chloe in my back pocket

510
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,666
while the whole time
I'm still in love with Lana?

511
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:16,793
You're the only one who can sort that out.

512
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:19,919
When I kissed lana, I could
tell that she still felt something.

513
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,646
And, mom...

514
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,825
Mom, I can't let her marry Lex.

515
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,842
This is probably hard to hear,

516
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:34,306
but I think the best thing
you can do is leave her alone.

517
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:40,038
Clark, girl alert!

518
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:44,353
I never know what I'll find in
a grown man's clubhouse.

519
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:47,233
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. Kent.

520
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:55,219
Hey, Lois.

521
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:56,695
Yeah, hi.

522
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,249
Well, I talked to chloe, and

523
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,419
she filled me in on...

524
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:08,185
Lois gone wild.

525
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,955
But I'm just missing a few details

526
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:13,058
about us.

527
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,901
Like this.

528
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:22,270
Wow, Lois, I have no idea.

529
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:23,890
Save it, Smallville.

530
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,291
I was obviously on something.

531
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:29,176
Thank god the ink wears off in a week.

532
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:39,661
Well, I guess it's best that
neither of us rembers.

533
00:35:39,686 --> 00:35:43,157
I mean, I can't even really
picture the two of us...

534
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:52,163
You don't think that we...

535
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,619
Think that we what?

536
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:01,855
You know...

537
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,263
That we...

538
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,936
No, Lois.

539
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,977
I think I'd remember.

540
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,083
Yeah.

541
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:20,623
Of course you would.

542
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:24,115
Highlight of your life.

543
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:26,721
Though I did find something.

544
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:36,615
I think you made it for me.

545
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:43,224
Whitesnake.

546
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:46,649
Wow!

547
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,402
I must have really liked you.

548
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:06,048
Hey!

549
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:08,558
Put another one down
for the j-chlo team.

550
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,613
Thanks to you,

551
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,806
Lois is back to her old
heartbroken, abrasive self.

552
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,867
I'm glad I could help
with that, I guess.

553
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:18,081
And Clark is, well,
back to being Clark.

554
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:21,687
You're kind of brushing a landfill
under the rug, aren't you?

555
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:23,940
What, with Clark?

556
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:29,080
So he took the whole breakup jealousy
way past the drunk-dialing stage.

557
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:30,395
Can't arrest him for it.

558
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,986
He crashed lana's party
and told the world that she's

559
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:34,344
eating for two.

560
00:37:37,365 --> 00:37:38,885
Did I mention that he kidnapped her?

561
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:42,178
I guarantee you Clark is beating
himself up more than anyone right now,

562
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:45,114
so we can just give the clark-bashing a reprieve.

563
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:48,850
No. Not until you admit
that he royally screwed up.

564
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:51,229
You don't know him like I do.

565
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,908
And you remind me of that every day.

566
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,244
You know, if I did the things that he did,

567
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:00,405
you would never even talk to
me again. And don't deny that!

568
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:02,844
So what are you saying,
I'm lying to you now?

569
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:09,201
Can you really tell me

570
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:13,387
that if you had the choice,
you wouldn't rather be with him?

571
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:23,183
Of course not.

572
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:24,992
You're my guy.

573
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:31,534
Now you don't believe me.
Well, I don't know what else to say.

574
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,326
Well, I think that's the point.

575
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,140
Neither of us do.

576
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,489
Maybe we should take a break.

577
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:51,319
Jimmy, I... I have...

578
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:20,401
You're fine, Miss Lang.

579
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,990
Nothing to worry about.

580
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,332
Thank you, doctor.

581
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:25,671
I just wanted to be sure

582
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:27,708
with everything lana went through yesterday.

583
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:38,337
Lex, I'm really sorry about
what happened last night.

584
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:40,214
About Clark.

585
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:42,972
As far as I'm concerned,

586
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:45,693
what we have doesn't have
anything to do with Clark.

587
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,874
But, then, I wasn't the one kissing him.

588
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,716
And I wasn't the one
holding a gun to his head.

589
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,508
Funny how he calls this a game.

590
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:02,328
What were you gonna do, Lex?
Shoot him?

591
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:06,257
If I had to.

592
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:09,529
To save me or to hurt him?

593
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,815
Considering what he did to you, Lana,

594
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:17,114
I had every right to come after Clark.

595
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:20,065
But the thing is, I...

596
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:22,715
I can't blame him.

597
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:28,187
If I ever let you slip through my fingers,

598
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:32,278
I have no idea what I'd be capable of.

599
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:55,111
How is she, really?

600
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,453
You know this isn't the
most typical pregnancy,

601
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:01,778
but everything's on schedule.
