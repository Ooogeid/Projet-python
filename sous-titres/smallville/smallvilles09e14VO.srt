1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,687
Faora?

2
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,966
It's not a good idea to advertise
you're from another planet.

3
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,337
You may feel more human
than Kryptonian.

4
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:24,815
This is who I am.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,372
Just when you're out in public,

6
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:28,602
it's better to keep those tags hidden
and play it safe.

7
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,614
How can you be safe when
someone destroyed our tower?

8
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,525
It could have been
brought down by anyone.

9
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,078
I don't even know
who to trust anymore.

10
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:41,245
I know how much that tower
meant to you, to all of you,

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,216
but you can't change
what happens in the past.

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,560
- Zod told us it was our salvation.
- And he was wrong.

13
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,073
Trust me, the future will be
much brighter without it.

14
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:51,381
Only one thing gives me hope.

15
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:54,872
You found my sister
and brought her back to me.

16
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,252
Kal-El!

17
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:03,565
It's "Clark", remember?

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,743
You both need to call me
by my human name.

19
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:08,943
"Clark", it just sounds so alien.

20
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,003
I came by to check on you both.

21
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:14,626
I understand how difficult it can be,
adjusting to a new home.

22
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:17,270
Without our powers,
adjusting will be even more difficult.

23
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:20,289
Faora, we have nothing
to fear anymore.

24
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:22,831
He'll protect us.

25
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:29,547
Go.
They need you, too.

26
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:37,440
Sister, don't get your hopes up.

27
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,358
He's in love with a human.

28
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,924
Close up and meet me
across the street.

29
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:47,733
You can drown your sorrows
in one of their cappuccinos.

30
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:12,805
Sorry! We're closed!

31
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:29,427
Hello?

32
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:47,908
Smallville - 9x14 - Conspiracy

33
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,866
Synchro : jojimoreau

34
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,252
For SeriesSub.com

35
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,872
Lois.

36
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,957
What are you up to?

37
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:56,306
Just juggling deadlines like
I'm trying out for Cirque du Soleil.

38
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,677
What about you?

39
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,572
You look like you have a few
pins in the air yourself.

40
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:05,210
Just making sure
I don't drop any assignments.

41
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:09,663
Hello.

42
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:16,654
You know, since we started
seeing each other, we never really...

43
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,188
see each other.

44
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:22,776
Maybe we should...
stop and smell the roses.

45
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,223
I know where we can find some...

46
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,327
Across the street, romantic café.

47
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:33,176
I see a table for two in our future.

48
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:38,295
Clark.

49
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,517
Who's the femme fatale?

50
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:47,179
An assignment that I can't put off.

51
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,310
Guess we should just...

52
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:52,051
hit the "pause" button
on our rosy rendezvous.

53
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:54,159
- Thanks. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

54
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,471
No problem, Smallville.

55
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:59,108
Go win a Pulitzer.

56
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:01,870
I thought we agreed
The Daily Planet is off-limits.

57
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,899
I had no choice.
I didn't want to risk

58
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:06,195
Zod finding out
that I was contacting you.

59
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:09,174
He doesn't trust you, Kal-El.

60
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:10,911
But I think...

61
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,764
you're the only person
that can find my sister.

62
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,500
Vala? What happened?

63
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,168
She's been kidnapped.

64
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,795
Judging by the grim look
on your face,

65
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,259
I'd say you're not here
for the peepshow.

66
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:39,765
Who died?

67
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,180
My billion-dollar dream...

68
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,173
for an energy-efficient solar tower.

69
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:48,912
And given what it's cost our company,
I want to know why you're not grieving.

70
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:52,655
Because I think we can come up
with a more fiscally responsible way

71
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,034
to make the future
brighter, greener.

72
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:57,058
- Really?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,347
Or maybe you're not
shedding any tears

74
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,587
because you're happy
that somebody torched that tower.

75
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,780
I hope you're not pointing
the finger at me, because

76
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:06,665
the investigators concluded
that it was a freak accident?

77
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,345
So it's just a coincidence then?

78
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,635
There was a time...

79
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:14,468
when I could stare
into those big brown eyes of yours.

80
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:17,269
And believe anything you told me.

81
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,334
Those days are history.

82
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,648
Believe me or not...

83
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,491
I did what I did because you
were bleeding the company dry.

84
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:35,770
I'm glad to see that you suddenly care
about staying in the black.

85
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:40,194
Because my divisions aren't
the only ones wrecking the bottom line.

86
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,262
I had breakfast this morning
with the CFO,

87
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:44,964
and he revealed that somebody
at one of your subsidiaries

88
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,810
is embezzling funds.

89
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,221
So I suggest that you find
the money drain.

90
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,189
Stop the leak.

91
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,717
You're too late.
I'm taking care of this.

92
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,289
I've made sure the police
know nothing about it

93
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:26,588
and I've cleared up
before the owner arrives.

94
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,873
Why don't you go back
to saving humans, Kal-El?

95
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:32,409
I'm here to find Vala.

96
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:34,414
I don't want your help.

97
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:37,946
If you hadn't demanded we assimilate,
Vala wouldn't be in danger.

98
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,770
- You can't blame me for her abduction.
- You are to blame

99
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,689
for sending everyone away from me.

100
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:50,634
No, you wanted to drive a wedge
between me and my people.

101
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,364
And now Vala
and the others are gone.

102
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:55,868
- "The others"?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:58,271
Two other Kandorians are missing...

104
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,316
taken the same way,

105
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,752
their crest left behind
as a warning to us all.

106
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,641
Someone is hunting us.

107
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,404
And we can't defend ourselves

108
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,228
because you will not give us
our powers.

109
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,480
I told you before,
I can't just give them to you!

110
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,393
And you've made sure
to seal our fate

111
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:28,989
by burning down my tower!

112
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,749
Police may have written this off
as an accident,

113
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,723
but you and I both know the truth.

114
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:50,923
At least have the courage
to admit what you've done.

115
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,926
- What I did was right.
- For the humans!

116
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,377
- For everyone!
- The Kandorians won't see it that way.

117
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:57,671
You'll never tell them,

118
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,321
because you don't know which ones
have turned against you already.

119
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:04,811
And the fact that that tower's down
leaves you weaker than ever.

120
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,496
Think of me what you will,

121
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:12,517
but know that,
because of your actions,

122
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:15,164
our people's blood is on your hands.

123
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,283
Please let me out. Please!

124
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,621
I don't want you
contaminating anything, alien.

125
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,407
I'm not what you think I am.
I'm not.

126
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,777
I know who you are.

127
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,983
I thought all of you had vanished
off the face of the earth.

128
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:13,211
But when I spotted you and
the others living among us,

129
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:16,875
pretending to be humans,
I realized...

130
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:19,886
You want to colonize our planet.

131
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,035
No, you're wrong, you're wrong.

132
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,683
I'm human.
I'm the same as you.

133
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,081
Stop lying.

134
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,668
I'm gathering undeniable proof.

135
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,493
I'm gonna share it
with the rest of the world.

136
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,693
And when they learn the truth,

137
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,786
all of you will be hunted down
and exterminated!

138
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:03,440


139
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,970
Just the interruption
I was hoping for.

140
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,554
I like where this is going, Romeo.

141
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,592
But you might want to
put on some softer music.

142
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,969
This is not a booty call.

143
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,944
I think Tess Mercer
might be listening.

144
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:53,456
She's up to something,
and it involves you.

145
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:58,461
She came by my office today

146
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:02,155
with evidence that someone's
been siphoning money from my company.

147
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:06,743
You're stealing from me.

148
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,986
- It's not like that.
- Right.

149
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:17,191
A lot of women
have used me for my money.

150
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:20,117
- I never expected it from you.
- I wasn't stealing from you, Oliver.

151
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,295
I was borrowing the cash.

152
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:27,431
I'm buying insurance
for the entire planet.

153
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,669
- Have you found my sister?
- Not yet. But I haven't given up.

154
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:43,363
Now, Zod told me that three Kandorians
were abducted. Is that true?

155
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:47,679
What was Vala's connection
to the other two?

156
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,596
They're what you call
cybernetic engineers.

157
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,327
Together they were performing...

158
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,964
tests to get our powers.

159
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:07,777
Perhaps these tests are
to blame for her abduction.

160
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:10,307
You can tell me.

161
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,939
They were experimenting on humans.

162
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,502
Pinot noir. For one.

163
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,978
Miss Lane.

164
00:14:58,604 --> 00:14:59,952
I'm Dr. Bernard Chisholm.

165
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:01,697
Forgive me for being so forward,

166
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,010
but I have a news story
that I think you should hear.

167
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,642
Sorry, doc,
you just got me on a night

168
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:10,091
when work is the last thing
I want to think about.

169
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,238
It'll make your career.

170
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,209
Aliens are living among us.

171
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,258
Tell you what, pal...

172
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,741
The next time that you want
to get a hot tip to a reporter just...

173
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:33,518
try an envelope and a 44-cent stamp.

174
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,695
Okay?

175
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,320
I did.
Dozens of times, in fact.

176
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:45,801
Considering
your story's alien angle,

177
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,455
those letters probably never
made it off the wacko pile.

178
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,259
I can prove my claims.

179
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,846
I've captured some of them.

180
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,042
They're under lock and key
at a safe location outside the city.

181
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:04,098
Come with me, Miss Lane.

182
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:07,204
I'll show you.
Help me spread the word.

183
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,884
Together we'll defend
the human race.

184
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:14,317
You're very convincing.

185
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,551
I just need to call my editor

186
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,894
and let him know that
I'm following a hot lead.

187
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,310
Damn cellphone.

188
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:25,312
Never a signal when you need one.

189
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,347
Just... I'm gonna try out there.

190
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,072
Just stay here, okay?
Don't go anywhere.

191
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,755
911. What's your emergency?

192
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,286
Never mind. False alarm.

193
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:56,099
I'd hoped you'd enlist
to fight our war,

194
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:59,267
but I guess
you'll have to be drafted.

195
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:02,430


196
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,651
This blood confirms my suspicions.

197
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,043
These things are alien.

198
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:18,330
Now, I've kept copious notes
about my findings.

199
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,947
If I try to share them,
they'll be dismissed.

200
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:26,475
If they come from
a legitimate news source,

201
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,010
the public will listen.

202
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,883
And that's where you come in.

203
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,839
Listen, Agent Mulder.

204
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:35,711
I will write your "X-files" exposé.

205
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,670
But I'm telling you...

206
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,501
no one will believe it.

207
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:46,211
They will when they receive
the body parts I've harvested.

208
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,858
I'm sending samples to medical
experts all over the world.

209
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,050
When they see the proof,
they'll come.

210
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,081
Cryogenically preserved specimen
waiting for them.

211
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:08,336
Okay, buddy...

212
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:11,715
You just went from creepy critter
to full-blown nutjob.

213
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,705
You need to get that girl
out of that ziplock

214
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,172
and turn off the deep freeze now.

215
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,568
You're not appreciating the magnitude
of my discovery, Miss Lane.

216
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,166
It's an alien!

217
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,228
Look what they did to me.

218
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,048
My God.

219
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:51,001
The last thing that I remember,
I died of a heart attack.

220
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,608
But they brought me back to life.

221
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,330
Then they...

222
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,869
implanted these...

223
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:01,139
into my brain.

224
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,623
Wait.

225
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:06,770
You are doing this to her
because she saved your life?

226
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,460
You should be thanking her,
not turning her into a Popsicle!

227
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:15,111
That thing didn't save me!

228
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,971
When I died...

229
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,911
I was at peace.

230
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,663
But then, whatever they did,

231
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:28,904
it's like I can't shut off my brain.

232
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:32,519
You know, it...
I can't stop thinking.

233
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:37,195
And I have thoughts
that a person should never have.

234
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:41,848
The invasion has begun, Miss Lane,

235
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,615
and it's our job to save mankind.

236
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,357
The nurse said the medical examiner
will be with us any minute.

237
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,884
How many people did Vala
and the others work on?

238
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,160
All I know is they stole
the cadavers from the morgue

239
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,652
to perform their tests.

240
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,747
When the tests failed,
they left the bodies behind

241
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:02,347
for the authorities to find.

242
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,444
- They didn't kill anyone.
- That doesn't make it right.

243
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:09,030
These people didn't agree to be
guinea pigs in your quest for power.

244
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:11,702
Dead or alive, Zod should
never have allowed it.

245
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:18,042
Zod didn't know.

246
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:20,507
Given the way I've seen him
command his troops,

247
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:21,934
I find that hard to believe.

248
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,847
You've only known the man
a few short weeks.

249
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,748
You have no right
to pass judgment on him.

250
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:27,789
Let's just say I know him
better than you think.

251
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:28,624
Really?

252
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:32,230
Were you by his side in the Argo Valley,
where he almost died defending us all?

253
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,359
He ran behind enemy lines alone

254
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,761
to carry a young cadet to safety...

255
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:41,397
withstood laser scars
and shrapnel wounds

256
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:42,940
to bring her back home.

257
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:47,731
That cadet was me.

258
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:52,549
And if it wasn't for Zod,
I wouldn't be alive today.

259
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,146
He's always been a hero,

260
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,133
ready to give his life
to protect his people.

261
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:02,502
Like the way he protected my father?

262
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:05,486
Regardless of their differences,

263
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,219
I know, in his heart,

264
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:13,104
Zod always considered Jor-El
one of his truest friends.

265
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:17,942
I guess that's a side of Zod
I never knew existed.

266
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:22,640
You may think you have
insight into Zod, Kal-El,

267
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,405
but I assure you...

268
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,369
you don't really know the man.

269
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:26,948
Hey, four eyes.

270
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:33,351
Help out a visually
impaired compadre?

271
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,228
What can I do for you, Magoo?

272
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,061
Well...
I have been writing an article

273
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:41,818
on extraterrestrial
conspiracy theorists...

274
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,112
People who believe
aliens roam the earth,

275
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:45,525
that kind of thing.

276
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,638
And, I've checked with the police,
local FBI and internet groups,

277
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:52,535
and I haven't found
what I'm looking for yet, so...

278
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,354
I figured if anyone wanted

279
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,711
to tell the world
they'd seen little green men,

280
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,295
they might contact us.

281
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,948
Seems the town's full of UFO nuts.

282
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:05,883
- Be right back.
- Ah, why, thank you.

283
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,415
Kryptonite weapons?

284
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,812
This is what you've beenspending
all of my money on...

285
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:08,399
something that could kill Clark?

286
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,635
They're to protect all of us,
including Clark,

287
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,637
from Zod and all those
other Kandorians.

288
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:16,376
I don't understand. I thought you were
helping set them all up

289
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,095
with licenses and passports.

290
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,209
All the I.D.s I gave Clark have
computer tracking chips in them.

291
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,964
I want to keep an eye on the
visitors from another planet.

292
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,971
Welcome to 1984,
The Sullivan edition.

293
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,891
Look, Ollie, I'm sorry, okay?
But I didn't have a choice.

294
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:39,144
Our friend's moral compass
has gotten us lost more than once.

295
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:43,481
I'm not okay with just sitting
back and trusting Clark again.

296
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:02,201
Chisholm, if you're trying
to freak me out,

297
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:03,887
you've already won the scream award.

298
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:05,566
There's no need for an encore!

299
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:10,600
Zod.

300
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:13,489
How did you end up in my
nightmare on psycho street?

301
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:15,917
I'm with the FBI.

302
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:17,842
We've been watching
Chisholm for a while.

303
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,599
Where are the others?

304
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,354
There's only one person left alive.

305
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,483
She's over there.

306
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,140
Here.

307
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:35,473
Vala.

308
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,134
What has this monster done to you?

309
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,301
Chisholm!

310
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,581
Stop wasting time!

311
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,250
I have a deadline to meet.

312
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,770
Agent Zod! Come on!

313
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,777
Wake up!
Listen to my voice.

314
00:26:56,036 --> 00:26:57,065
Come on.

315
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,450
You're alive.

316
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm glad to see
that you are, too, g-man.

317
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:07,520
What do you say we take a look?

318
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,427
We're just gonna
put some pressure on it,

319
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,332
and everything will be as good
as gold in no time, all right?

320
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:22,598
Chisholm will be back.

321
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,851
Don't worry.

322
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:26,696
I won't leave until
your FBI backup gets here.

323
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:30,273
Why would you do that?
You don't know me.

324
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,193
It's what Clark would do.

325
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:39,113
Lois...

326
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:42,159
backup isn't coming.

327
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,241
So you need to help that girl.

328
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:50,030
And you need to get out of here.

329
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,727
You save yourself.

330
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:55,123
Go!

331
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:04,131
I don't think I should be talking
to reporters about hospital business.

332
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:05,566
I need this job.

333
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:07,625
We already know
that the bodies were taken

334
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,436
from the morgue last September.

335
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,771
I just need to know
if they were recovered.

336
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:13,439
Well, all.

337
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:15,659
Except...

338
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,529
This one.

339
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:25,769
- John Corben?
- Now you guys have to go.

340
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:27,682
Are there any witnesses...

341
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,018
Someone who could identify
the people responsible

342
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,853
for stealing the bodies?

343
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:33,974
I have no idea.

344
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,744
You'd have to ask the attending M.E.
who was here at the time.

345
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:38,391
And when does he get in?

346
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:41,460
Dr. Chisholm was forced
to take a leave of absence.

347
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:42,887
Psychiatric reasons.

348
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,430
You're gonna have to be
more specific than that.

349
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:46,891
I've said all I'm gonna say.

350
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:49,432
Fine.

351
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:52,267
Then I'll have to make up the rest
and quote you as the source,

352
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,691
'cause that's what reporters do
when they don't have all the details.

353
00:28:58,883 --> 00:29:00,003
Okay.

354
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:03,947
Chisholm said he caught the body
snatchers here in the morgue,

355
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:05,648
but he was so freaked out by it

356
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,260
that he had a heart attack and died.

357
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,323
Then he claimed that
they brought him back to life

358
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,795
because they were extraterrestrials,

359
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:18,024
Told everybody they experimented
on his brain.

360
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:20,694
Give me a way to get
in touch with him,

361
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:23,103
and I promise I won't mention
you in the article once.

362
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:24,762
Deal.

363
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,332
Here's his contact info.

364
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,980
But if he's talking to aliens,
I doubt he'll want to talk to you.

365
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:48,536
Where'd she go?!

366
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:25,679
You're one of them.

367
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,078
It's worse than I ever thought.

368
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:37,001
You aliens are everywhere.

369
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,948
You've infiltrated our world!

370
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:44,967
But you will not win.

371
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:48,804
You don't belong on this planet.

372
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:53,184
Your invasion stops now.

373
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:17,685
You're gonna be all right.

374
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:25,526
Zod?

375
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,256
You're gonna get what you wanted.

376
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:42,214
I'll never see the sun rise
on your planet again.

377
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:46,338
My father's last wish
was to save your life.

378
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:52,136
That's what I'd expect from Jor-El.

379
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:55,302
Don't speak.

380
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:57,161
We need to get you to a hospital.

381
00:32:58,134 --> 00:32:59,476
Kal-El.

382
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,313
You...

383
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,835
can't save me.

384
00:33:17,052 --> 00:33:18,016
Zod?

385
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,027
Zod?!

386
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:34,019
Welcome back.

387
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,085


388
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:45,844
You said they were in there.

389
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,679
Ms. Mercer,
I showed you the pictures.

390
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:51,349
Those crates were in this container,
hundreds of them.

391
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:52,850
They're not there now.

392
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:55,300
You wanted
a higher pay grade, Lenkov.

393
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,773
Prove to me you're worth it.

394
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,472
Whatever they're spending
that money on, you find it!

395
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:18,206
Figured Tess was up to something
when she gave me the tip

396
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:21,675
about all the money
that you "borrowed",

397
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,432
So I moved your stockpile.

398
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:24,997
What other dirty little tricks

399
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,124
do you think
the amazing Mercer has up her sleeve?

400
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:30,245
It's too soon to tell.

401
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,547
Clark saw a future
that we want to run away from.

402
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:37,801
Said Tess saw the same future.
Maybe she wants to take us there.

403
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,792
Which is why we need those
weapons now more than ever.

404
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,346
- Where'd you put them?
- They're in a safe place.

405
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:47,061
Are you keeping me in the dark
because I lied to you?

406
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,650
Chloe, you can't have
a set of rules for yourself

407
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,899
and then a whole another set
of rules for everyone else.

408
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,192
Clark's in a Kandorian family now,
and I don't want to let his loyalties

409
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:57,703
lead us
into another doomsday scenario.

410
00:35:58,495 --> 00:35:59,454
Neither do I.

411
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:02,367
So do you really think we
should tell Clark everything?

412
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:04,036
Absolutely.

413
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,417
But only when the time is right.

414
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:21,003
Lab, please.

415
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,518
I need a blood sample analyzed.

416
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:35,664
Lois, what are you doing here?

417
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,218
The first thing the doctor said
when you got released from Met Gen

418
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:41,410
- was to take it easy.
- No time, Smallville.

419
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:44,776
I got Randall to let me pen
my "Silence of the Lambs" remake.

420
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:48,372
The bummer is, the support cast
didn't show up to set.

421
00:36:48,754 --> 00:36:52,501
Our icy ingénue refused treatment
at Met Gen and left no contact info.

422
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,628
Maybe she wanted to see
her own physician.

423
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,006
What about Zod?

424
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:58,823
Both the FBI field office
and D.C. Headquarters

425
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:00,468
say they have no record of him.

426
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,290
Of course.

427
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:04,674
It's because Zod works deep cover.

428
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,461
The FBI would never even admit
that he works there.

429
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:10,317
It's top-secret. That's why I didn't
tell you that he was an agent.

430
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:11,831
That's the thing about heroes.

431
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:13,948
No matter how brightly
you shine the light on them,

432
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:15,939
they always want to
stay in the shadows.

433
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,610
But still, something
doesn't quite add up.

434
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:25,210
You're hiding something, Smallville.

435
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,953
Some other earth-shattering
detail about Zod?

436
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,892
You want full disclosure?
Great.

437
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:32,347
It's a two-way street.

438
00:37:32,472 --> 00:37:35,495
You're gonna have to tell me
what you're hiding in your desk drawer.

439
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:39,131
Touché, Mr. Kent.

440
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:42,792
Why don't we both just agree
that a little mystery

441
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,636
is good for the romance?

442
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:50,642
You first.

443
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,447
- Lois, I should...
- Follow up on an assignment?

444
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,907
Yeah.
See you on the front pages.

445
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:42,340
I trust Lois is well.

446
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:44,608
Thanks to you.
She told me what happened.

447
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,287
You saved her.

448
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:55,192
She did a great job
of protecting me, too.

449
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:58,252
I can see why you care for her.

450
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:01,402
How are you feeling?

451
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,049
Like a changed man.

452
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:09,428
When your enemy becomes your savior,

453
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:11,927
your paradigm shifts.

454
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:16,479
Kal-El...

455
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:20,722
How did you know that
your blood would cure me?

456
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,603
I didn't.

457
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,571
It must have healed you because
you're Kryptonian, like me.

458
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,243
You're still in pain?

459
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,282
Even though you healed
my wounds, I was shot.

460
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,750
And unlike you,
I'm not made of steel.

461
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,614
You'll be better
than new in no time.

462
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:50,315
I am better...

463
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:55,231
because I was wrong about you.

464
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,746
You do care about the Kandorians.

465
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,317
And when you saved my life,
I realized that I...

466
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:07,988
I can trust you.

467
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,243
And together we'll make sure

468
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:14,828
that our people can call earth
their new home.
