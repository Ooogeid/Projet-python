1
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,069
What's happening, Jonathan?!

2
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:53,384
Lex! Where are you?!

3
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:04,003
Lionel was too blind to see the truth.

4
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,669
There was another.

5
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:16,594
"Somebody save me"

6
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,820
"Let your warm hands break right through me"

7
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:26,025
"Somebody save me"

8
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,730
"I don't care how you do it"

9
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:35,326
"Just save me, save me"

10
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,084
"Come on"
Venga

11
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,863
"I've been waiting for you"

12
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,821
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

13
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:54,699
"Just save me, save me"

14
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,032
"Come on"

15
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,355
SMALLVILLE 8x18 "ETERNAL"
Subtitles subXpacio

16
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,696
You've done a very thorough job.

17
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,236
I just think that I'll take it from here.

18
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,971
Goodbye.

19
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,601
I think I'm finally ready
for the front page.

20
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,627
An article.

21
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:20,197
I found a stack of missing-persons cases
that no one's talking about.

22
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,172
There are similarities between them all.

23
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:24,801
This city is being attacked,
and no one seems to care.

24
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:29,597
Kind of makes you wish the Red-blue Blur
wasn't sitting down on the job.

25
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:33,408
I think that these people were
attacked by the same criminal.

26
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,888
Now, we can be the first
to break this story.

27
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,235
We can warn the people of Metropolis.

28
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:45,405
- I can't print this.
- You need to print it.

29
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,052
No, they're called facts, Clark,
and you don't have any.

30
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,320
You don't care about these victims?

31
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,492
You're sweeping this under the rug.

32
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:58,694
Great.

33
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,772
Another conspiracy theory,
'cause I love those.

34
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,215
Look closely.

35
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,680
You will not find a web of lies
behind this facade.

36
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,597
That would be your department.

37
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:20,607
A man who's not afraid to cry.

38
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:23,693
A man who's not afraid to cut onions.

39
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,542
You know, you still didn't
have to cook me dinner,

40
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:29,147
Even though I did manage
to override your settings,

41
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,657
Retrieve all of your addresses,
and change your applications

42
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:34,199
so the next time you go fishing for
your phone in your glove compartment,

43
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,955
you won't erase your whole world
with the touch of one button.

44
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,941
Well, well, well...

45
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:41,267
ain't you the most overachieving
teacher's pet know-it-all in the room.

46
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,671
Ah, he's got a sense of humor
and taking cook.

47
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:47,501
Well, the one thing that was on the menu
at the foster homes I grew up at -

48
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,521
mac and cheese.

49
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:56,652
So, have you heard from Jimmy lately?

50
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,880
His last tirade of e-mails included every
single unflattering word in the dictionary,

51
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:08,304
including some that
didn't get past the censors.

52
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,075
I thought he'd be dying
to get back together with you.

53
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:14,447
No.

54
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:18,567
I believe that
the last phrase he used was,

55
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:20,619
"Don't call me, don't come by...

56
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:22,877
and if you e-mail me, I won't open it."

57
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,739
I thought we were best friends, but...

58
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,860
obviously there was some...

59
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,157
stuff brewing beneath
the surface for a while.

60
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:41,718
How can you be so close to someone
and not really know who they are?

61
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,768
Davis!

62
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:52,663
- No, it's fine. Chloe, it's fine, really.
- My god.

63
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,021
Quick reflexes, huh?

64
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,551
Chloe.

65
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:12,064
Call much?

66
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,697
Davis.

67
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,849
Clark.

68
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,020
Well, now that we have that
all worked out...

69
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,298
what's happening?

70
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,925
I was working on a story I thought
you might have some information on.

71
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,724
You know, I forgot something
I'm supposed to do. I should go.

72
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:38,820
What about dinner?

73
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,294
Uh, you know, we'll do it tomorrow.
Call it leftovers.

74
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,295
Okay.

75
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:44,999
Thank you.

76
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:38,321
Forgive me.

77
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,748
Hello?

78
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:55,945
I forget.

79
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,854
what's the prayer
for dismembering a body?

80
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,343
I can't believe this.

81
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,870
There were over a dozen missing
persons last month alone.

82
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,532
You'd think it would be newsworthy.

83
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,398
Since when did "newsworthy" have anything
to do with what was on the front page?

84
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:45,226
You know, Clark, I really hope you have
the safety cocked on your heat vision.

85
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,149
What?

86
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,542
You've been staring at the back
of my head so hard,

87
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,931
I'm afraid my hair's gonna go up in flames.

88
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:56,599
I just didn't know you and Davis
were spending so much time together.

89
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,953
If you don't want to talk about it -

90
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,189
No, please. I love trudging
through stagnant water.

91
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,920
It just seems like
you're moving on kind of fast,

92
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,575
and I don't get what you see in the guy.

93
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,089
First of all, it was dinner.

94
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,690
And secondly, he's kind, supportive,
and a strong shoulder for me to lean on,

95
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,802
which I don't know if you've actually
realized, but I could really use right now.

96
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,544
Look, it's just I have
a bad feeling about the guy.

97
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,450
- I mean, come on, Chloe.
- Don't "Chloe" me, Clark.

98
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,926
What is it with this whole "meet me
out in the back for a duel" mentality?

99
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:27,491
It might have something to do with the fact

100
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,030
that this guy disappears and
can't explain where he went.

101
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,844
He's full of secrets, Chloe. There's
not even a record of his childhood.

102
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,112
Sounds familiar.

103
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,892
I don't collect morbid crime-scene
photos in my locker,

104
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:41,021
and I'm not the first E.M.T. to show up
at every gruesome murder.

105
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,400
What is it?

106
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:48,900
A vehicle was found on fire
just outside of Smallville.

107
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:51,993
It has Davis' license plate.

108
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:06,619
Were you expecting a chorus of angels?

109
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,247
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

110
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:12,204
I wanted to be here when you woke up.

111
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,090
I apologize...

112
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:18,810
for the state that you're in.

113
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:22,846
I didn't expect you to end up like this.

114
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,485
I was trying to kill you.

115
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,617
But...

116
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,540
that seems to be harder than I thought.

117
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,319
Why am I here? Who are you?

118
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:42,903
You're safe with me.

119
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:46,175
Safer than out there.

120
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,022
If the world knew you were a serial killer,

121
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:51,163
you'd be running from torches
for the rest of your life.

122
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,711
You got the wrong idea about me, lady.

123
00:11:56,046 --> 00:12:00,075
It's not your fault that you
were born with a killer instinct.

124
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:05,727
I even admire your altruistic
selection of victims.

125
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:11,458
It's like Keeping bats around to wipe out
the parasites That prey on the city.

126
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:18,838
I can't control myself.

127
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,397
I know you've tried
to absolve yourself, but...

128
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:27,996
even suicide wouldn't really work
for a guy who can't die, would it?

129
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:32,033
I am not who you think I am.

130
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,898
No.

131
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,171
You're not who you think you are.

132
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:49,536
And today, you proved my theory.

133
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,912
After I discovered that you had been...

134
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:56,620
a little unfriendly
to a few Metropolis citizens,

135
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:58,939
I started looking into your background.

136
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,746
The only problem is
you don't have one.

137
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,805
I thought I had hit a dead end
until I inherited this.

138
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,742
Stole it, if I'm being honest.

139
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:17,121
I thought this might jog
your rusty memory.

140
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,972
It was Lionel Luthor's.

141
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,952
It tells a fascinating story
about a boy who fell to earth...

142
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:30,177
the day a meteor shower
destroyed a small Kansas town.

143
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:35,559
I'm beginning to believe the boy
did not come here alone.

144
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,846
Kids just don't
fall out of the sky, Martha.

145
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,168
Then where did he come from?

146
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,355
I don't know.

147
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,060
But he must have parents.

148
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:14,284
Well, if he does, they're
definitely not from Kansas.

149
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,345
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

150
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,837
What are we gonna tell people -
we found him out in a field?

151
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,285
We didn't find him.

152
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,295
He found us.

153
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,161
Over here!
I found him!

154
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,740
No!

155
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,644
Feathers?

156
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,604
Feathers!

157
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,808
Who are you?

158
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:36,053
Are you cold?

159
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,535
Are you him?

160
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,974
Are you a warrior angel?

161
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,081
No.

162
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,050
But I want to be.

163
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:15,279
I'm Alexander.
What's your name?

164
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,202
I don't know.

165
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,532
What are you doing in here?

166
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,314
A man brought me here a few days ago.

167
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,937
He made them put needles in me.

168
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,225
But you don't look sick.

169
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,994
Do you want to play?

170
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:43,633
Nobody will know.
My dad went to some farm.

171
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,271
Come on.

172
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,058
The day the meteor shower
struck Smallville,

173
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,110
Lionel sent out a search party for you.

174
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:09,171
Lionel had you taken from that field, because
he thought You were a prophesied messiah

175
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,411
called "the traveler,"

176
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:15,631
A visitor from another planet
sent to save humankind.

177
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:21,873
But what Lionel didn't realize is that there
were two boys that fell to earth that day.

178
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,285
The traveler...

179
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,269
and you.

180
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,364
Excuse me.

181
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:54,485
- Have the police been here yet?
- Come and gone.

182
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,083
- Did they find a victim?
- The thing was abandoned.

183
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,645
No sign of a driver.

184
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:05,349
Thank you.

185
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,680
Clark. What's going on?

186
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,565
It's weird that Davis
would have stopped here.

187
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,450
Why? What's here?

188
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,589
This is the field where my ship landed.

189
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:30,406
That's a pretty big
coincidence pill to swallow.

190
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:37,456
This place must hold a lot
of memories for you, huh?

191
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:49,057
Chloe, memories aren't the only
thing buried in that field.

192
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,555
What is that?

193
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,893
It's made from the armor of St. George.

194
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:03,897
He slayed dragons with
his sword called "Ascalon."

195
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:08,739
I am St. George, and you are the dragon.

196
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,993
You have been sent To destroy the world,

197
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:15,894
but only I can protect it
from a beast like you.

198
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,981
Fight or die.

199
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:33,672
I have slayed the beast.

200
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:37,988
I am the victor,
and I shall claim my treasure.

201
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:48,268
- What's wrong?
- It hurts!

202
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:50,361
- Are you okay?
- It hurts!

203
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,672
There's a way.

204
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,358
- You think you can keep me here?
- I know.

205
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:17,944
There's nothing that can restrain you.

206
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:23,012
Then what are you gonna do?

207
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,621
I've been asking myself that
question for the last few hours.

208
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:32,587
What do you do when you find
Judas in your midst?

209
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:37,315
Who would Christ have been
if Judas had not betrayed him?

210
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:41,880
Maybe we would remember Jesus
as only a teacher roaming the desert.

211
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:45,544
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

212
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:47,947
Without Judas, Jesus would have
never risen from the dead...

213
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,993
To come back and face
his greatest challenge.

214
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,915
Saving humankind.

215
00:22:57,823 --> 00:23:00,425
There is a savior among us.

216
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,795
You are here to betray him.

217
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,942
I haven't betrayed anyone.

218
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:13,801
I finally realized that until
you fulfill your destiny,

219
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:16,350
He won't have his great
challenge to overcome.

220
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:22,067
He cannot become the world's savior without
triumphing Over the world's destroyer.

221
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:27,337
What savior?

222
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,471
What are you talking about?

223
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:32,188
Clark.

224
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,260
There's a reason that
you two don't get along.

225
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:38,739
You were destined to kill each other.

226
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:55,149
The guy blacks out regularly,
and you chose not to mention it?

227
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,086
I figured he had low
blood sugar or something.

228
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,551
He told you he was hiding
something dark inside, Chloe!

229
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:01,126
That didn't set off any alarms for you?

230
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,540
You know what, I figured "dark" meant
"moody" or "bipolar," at worst.

231
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,758
I don't exactly jump
right to "serial killer."

232
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,131
And all the times that you were
angry at me for doubting him -

233
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,603
I know, okay?!

234
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:14,116
I was in denial. I- you know, I-

235
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:16,834
I couldn't believe that it was this bad.

236
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:20,245
It's not that bad, Chloe. It's worse.

237
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:25,145
I just can't believe
he's the serial killer that -

238
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,417
That Jimmy warned us about.

239
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:35,038
I did some checking
into these missing persons.

240
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,277
They're not exactly Metropolis' finest -

241
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:39,942
Assault charges,
breaking and entering, abuse.

242
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,600
So you think Davis is on some
sort of vigilante mission?

243
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,892
He was until last night.

244
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:47,559
He's not stupid enough to
abandon his car next to a...

245
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,054
a field full of evidence.

246
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:52,302
Chloe, I get the feeling
someone took him.

247
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:54,540
When I was looking into Davis' past,

248
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,134
his county records had already
been checked out by someone.

249
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:03,002
I think it's time to pay a visit
to the widow of LuthorCorp.

250
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:09,346
We tried to stop him.
We opened fire, but he -

251
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,986
Find him, or don't come back.

252
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,110
Tess.

253
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,190
Look, I know you've been
looking into Davis Bloome.

254
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,919
He did this, didn't he?

255
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:29,466
I'm afraid there's not
a short version of that story.

256
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:32,659
I think I missed something.

257
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:35,070
No, you've been at the center
of it the whole time.

258
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,466
I came into possession of
a journal of Lionel Luthor's.

259
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:44,738
The journal talks about a boy who fell from
the stars on the day of a meteor shower.

260
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:47,149
Lionel's obsession with this traveler...

261
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:50,151
was the only reason that
'he was in Smallville that day.

262
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:53,547
He wanted to possess
the traveler for himself.

263
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,318
Why are you telling me all this?

264
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:59,832
Because Lionel and then Lex got
the moral of the story wrong.

265
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:06,059
According to the Kawatche Indians,
this boy is part of a two-headed creature -

266
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,897
Good and evil.

267
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:13,528
The Luthors were too busy feuding over
which one of them was worthy enough...

268
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:17,316
to be your adversary that
they couldn't see the truth...

269
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:23,542
that there was another boy
who came to earth with you.

270
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,913
Davis Bloome.

271
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,590
So you think that Davis Bloome
and I are from another planet?

272
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,467
Lionel found Davis on the day
of the meteor shower.

273
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:38,403
He thought he was the traveler,

274
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:41,109
but then the boy's tests seemed normal.

275
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:44,589
- Lionel was holding Davis.
- Only for five days.

276
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:46,827
And then he threw the boy
out onto the street...

277
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,925
because he got a phone call
from Martha Kent.

278
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:53,882
- Tess, you are reaching.
- Am I?

279
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,967
It's Lionel's own words,

280
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:58,837
And I quote - "I have the wrong boy,

281
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:03,165
but I believe that I have found
the true traveler."

282
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:05,933
Why else would Lionel Luthor
arrange an adoption...

283
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:09,141
for a boy who seemed
to come out of nowhere?

284
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,302
It looks like you're the reason that Davis
was abandoned in the first place.

285
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:29,762
What did the LuthorCorp diva have to say?

286
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,175
I know what you've done.
Jimmy was right.

287
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:42,451
Uh, that guy that I killed, he was a drunk
driver. he was a three-time offender.

288
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:47,299
And what about all the others? Are you
gonna try and justify killing them too?

289
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:50,531
No, I didn't know what else to do!
Chloe, I'm sorry!

290
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:52,289
You lied to me!

291
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,509
I had to! I didn't want
to drag you into all this!

292
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,636
Then why are you here?!

293
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:03,889
I love you.

294
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,597
And I need to know if you care about me.

295
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:11,861
How can you ask me that?

296
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,573
I thought I did.

297
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:22,862
Then I need you to do something for me.

298
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:26,234
I won't do anything for you.

299
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:32,303
I need you to help me die.

300
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:46,569
Chloe!

301
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,325
Dr. Grohl's lab.

302
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:01,270
Chloe.

303
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,303
It's time.

304
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:26,356
I can't.

305
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:29,099
I'm sorry.

306
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,150
I finally found a way out of this.

307
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,724
You don't take that away from me.

308
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:35,477
Please.

309
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,698
Pull the lever, Chloe.

310
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:56,950
I can't kill you, Davis.

311
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,283
Chloe, what are you doing?

312
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:06,549
It's my life, Clark.
I can take it if I choose.

313
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:10,088
- Davis, don't be a martyr.
- That's not what this is, Clark.

314
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,325
I'm not doing this for you.

315
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:16,101
I want this to end.
I can't live with myself.

316
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:18,065
But it's not your fault.

317
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,400
Everything that's happened
to you is because of me.

318
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,584
All right? We should have been brothers.

319
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,581
Davis, you didn't have a home.

320
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:29,239
If that would have happened to me...

321
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,398
I've always wondered
what it would have been like...

322
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:34,290
If the Luthors had found me
in that field.

323
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,623
I could have turned out differently.

324
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,792
But you didn't.

325
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,209
You were destined to have the better life.

326
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:44,303
No matter how hard we try to fight it,

327
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:49,197
we will always return
to our true nature.

328
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:55,265
Chloe, pull the lever! Let me end this!

329
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,649
No, Chloe, you have
to give this another chance.

330
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:59,801
This is not set in stone.

331
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,907
Enough, Clark.

332
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:05,650
You know that you should let me die.

333
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,737
Davis, there has to be
something in your life -

334
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:11,531
Something that is worth
giving it one more try.

335
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:24,029
It isn't always about
where your heart is.

336
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,473
It's about what you've done
and what you're going to do.

337
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:36,312
I was sent here to destroy you, Clark.

338
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,680
Clark.

339
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,691
Davis! Davis!

340
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:51,473
There aren't enough prayers in this world...

341
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,064
to give me redemption!

342
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:56,556
- Clark!
- No, Chloe!

343
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,237
What are we doing here?

344
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:39,569
I was told to drop you off here.

345
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:43,731
But who's gonna meet me?

346
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:59,057
How are you holding up?

347
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,482
I've had better days.

348
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:10,022
Not saying a lot in Smallville.

349
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:15,375
And Davis is...

350
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,473
I spoke to Oliver.
He's taking care of the details.

351
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,686
We need to talk about what happened.

352
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,616
It wouldn't change what I did.

353
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:34,849
But there's always another way.

354
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,233
He could have killed you, Clark.

355
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:42,546
I won't risk the safety of the world
because of your code of ethics...

356
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:46,962
because you refuse to stop
the things that threaten you.

357
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:56,923
Jor-El said he was
the ultimate destroyer.

358
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,304
Didn't turn out to be much of a fight.

359
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,780
When I was a kid,
I used to have this nightmare.

360
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:27,133
My ship landed in a field,
and no one ever found me.

361
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:30,416
That nightmare was Davis' life.

362
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,727
I always felt like it was a burden,

363
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:36,364
knowing that I was destined
to save people.

364
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,770
I can't imagine what It must have
felt like knowing that...

365
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:41,999
no matter how you lived your life,
you were doomed.

366
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,549
The new contemplative Clark Kent.

367
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,990
I like it.

368
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,000
Well, I'm kind of busy.

369
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,882
With what? Farm chores?

370
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:18,208
I'd let you off if you were saving
a busload of children, but...

371
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,361
cleaning the feeding bin?

372
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:22,916
Look, I'm really sorry that
you bought into this...

373
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:25,617
strange obsession that the
Luthors had for me, but -

374
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:27,671
I don't think of it as buying in.

375
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,384
I think of it as believing.

376
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:34,719
If you choose to spend your Saturday nights
reading the journal of a madman,

377
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,751
sounds to me like you have
a few holes in your personal life.

378
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,461
We all look to idols -

379
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:43,898
religion, the rich and the famous -

380
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,279
because we have holes in our lives.

381
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:49,841
But it doesn't mean
that these things aren't real.

382
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,485
What you've made me out
to be is not real.

383
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:56,071
I'll never be that man.

384
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,315
Not until Judas is at your back.

385
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,893
I have this feeling that you'll
never fulfill your great destiny...

386
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:07,929
until you meet Your greatest challenge.

387
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:10,932
You don't know anything about my life.

388
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,000
If this is the way that you lied to Lex,

389
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,046
Then I can see how
it pushed him over the edge.

390
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:22,233
Lex was racing toward that
drop-off way before he met me.

391
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:24,512
Yeah, but betrayal...

392
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:29,509
you know, the more you love
someone, the harder it is.

393
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:31,036
Are you threatening me?

394
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:35,666
I'm not that naive.

395
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:40,294
I am not some problem To be solved.

396
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:43,040
I get it.

397
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,773
It's too early.

398
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:51,161
Just know that I'll wait for you, Clark.

399
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,950
I'll wait for you to come to me.

400
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,005
It's gonna be a long wait.

401
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,566
It'll be shorter than you think, Kal-El.

402
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:52,094
Don't be afraid.

403
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:58,524
You're alive.

404
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,032
The meteor rocks didn't -

405
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,574
They made me stronger.

406
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:08,734
So are you're now invulnerable?

407
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:14,922
I'm immortal.

408
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,717
Then that means Clark's in danger.

409
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:23,451
No matter what you want as Davis, the other
side of you will still try and kill him.

410
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:26,410
I won't kill Clark if I'm with you!

411
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,805
What?

412
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,524
What do I have to do with any of this?

413
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:35,497
There is something about
being around you...

414
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:39,085
that seems to calm
the murderer inside me.

415
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:43,688
But you said so yourself -
it's your true nature.

416
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:50,039
But maybe there's something stronger
out there Than my need to kill.

417
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,034
I want you stay with me.

418
00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:47,277
