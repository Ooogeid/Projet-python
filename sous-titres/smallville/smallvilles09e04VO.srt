1
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:06,454
<i>Isn't it time to move
beyond these mental trials?</i>

2
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:08,822
<i>When you decided to
return to your training,</i>

3
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:10,257
<i>i assumed you were ready.</i>

4
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,900
- Tell me what you need from me.
- <i>The test of a true hero</i>

5
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,227
<i>The test of a true hero</i>

6
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:16,887
<i>is to struggle with feelings
of loss, not to avoid them.</i>

7
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,298
I've come this far, and
i'm not looking back. I can do this.

8
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,370
I need you to pull an address
off of queen industries' database.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,273
It's an engineer that i fired six
years ago. His name's winslow schott.

10
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:28,034
- What happened?
- He snapped.

11
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,611
He started bringing toys to work.

12
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:33,170
Then he started hiding
explosives inside the toys.

13
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,707
What are you doing in enemy camp?

14
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:38,852
I've purchased controlling
interest in luthorcorp.

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,177
Everybody down!

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,725
How does it feel to not
be in control for once?

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,094
- Untie me right now.
- After this little fella

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,230
clangs his cymbals
together 53 times...

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,356
it'll be the last
sound you ever hear.

20
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:56,537
Pieces of a toy bomb were
found in the wreckage.

21
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,152
- Lex deserved to die.
- This is murder.

22
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,601
This is justice.

23
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,777
Oliver crossed the line.
He killed lex luthor.

24
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,712
You're making a big mistake.

25
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,962
What the hell were you so afraid of?

26
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,019
You.

27
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,513
- Maybe we should start over.
- It's too late for that now.

28
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,622
You need help.

29
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:16,590
Not everybody believes
in the second coming.

30
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,527
Is there any part of the person
i used to know still there?

31
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,759
I took a look in the
mirror, and you were right.

32
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:24,011
I've been running away from
myself for a long time now.

33
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:26,004
But now i know who i really am.

34
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,815
Let's set up a perimeter. And somebody
get me a damn sight line.

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,926
We don't know how many
hostages are inside.

36
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:11,700
You, get me a barricade. Last thing
we need is anyone getting in our way.

37
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,958
Let's go! Let's move it!

38
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,069
Don't bother pulling the trigger.

39
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,624
Did i miss him?

40
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,376
If by "him," you mean me, barely.

41
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,675
Not you, the blur.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,523
He was long gone by
the time i got here.

43
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,049
I was just trying to call you.

44
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:58,952
- From a pay phone?
- Apparently.

45
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,855
How'd you get here so fast, anyway?

46
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,958
My guy at met p. D. Didn't leak
this until a few minutes ago.

47
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,518
We all can't be as
fashionably late as lois lane.

48
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:19,183
<i>Hello, sailor.</i>

49
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,661
- What'd you just say?
- Nothing.

50
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,948
You should get your hearing checked.

51
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,327
<i>Hot stuff.</i>

52
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,680
Smallville 904

53
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:46,054

54
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:25,095
For seriessub.com

55
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,656
<i>god, i'm dragging ass today.</i>

56
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,837
<i>I should go for coffee. No, actually,
i should really get a b12 shot.</i>

57
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,406
<i>I have to keep up with clark.</i>

58
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,208
<i>You got to remember what
the general always said.</i>

59
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,477
<i>On certain days, you
wear certain underwear.</i>

60
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,002
<i>And today, of all days,
why you decided to wear.</i>

61
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,254
You're in a good mood today.

62
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,795
Would be in an even better one
if our black-clad hero in hiding

63
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,387
would have stuck around
long enough for a quote.

64
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,631
We'd at least know what the
hell happened back there.

65
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,502
What happened back there is, the blur
saved all those hostages, end of story.

66
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,242
There's always more to the story,
grasshopper. Word on the street is

67
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,944
the bomber isn't the one who
flipped the switch. It was on a timer.

68
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,903
Why would the bomb be on a timer?

69
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,861
I don't know. I'm not a mind reader.

70
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:24,376
Why would you take hostages
and not make any demands?

71
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,237
<i>No voicemails? No e-mails?</i>

72
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:30,517
<i>Just be a big girl and get over the fact
that the blur downgraded you</i>

73
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:33,251
<i>from confidant to
sidekick to nobody.</i>

74
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,005
Computer's frozen again.

75
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,923
<i>Doesn't help that stupid intern jeff</i>

76
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,973
<i>took the last stupid maple bar
rom the stupid doughnut box.</i>

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,682
Here you go.

78
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,714
My eyes are bigger than
my stomach this morning.

79
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,901
No. Okay, i love you.

80
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:00,077
A bump in blood sugar might
help you from punching someone.

81
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,514
True. Give me that.

82
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,380
Whyever whoever did what he did,

83
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:08,829
he couldn't have picked a
less-interesting place to have done it.

84
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,544
- Run-of-the-mill textile factory?
- Run-of-the-mill textile factory

85
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,607
which is a subsidiary
of queen industries.

86
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:16,256
You think it would be enough
to get oliver's attention.

87
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:19,063
<i>That only matters if ollie's
sober enough to give a crap.</i>

88
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:21,128
Yeah, you might be right.

89
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:22,507
What'd you say?

90
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:24,068
What?

91
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:25,970
What?

92
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,591
Thanks for meeting me.
I know you've been busy.

93
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,316
What am i thinking right now?

94
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,290
No clue.
So far, it's only been lois.

95
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,764
I know that my wall of weird
is so three upgrades ago,

96
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,770
but i've spent enough time

97
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,952
digitizing the strange
and unexplained in my life

98
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:53,741
to know that you don't
just catch e. S. p.

99
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,912
So the question is, how do we know

100
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,291
that this isn't just your
superhearing on the fritz?

101
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,115
As loud as lois is, even she can't speak
with her mouth closed.

102
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,951
Good point.

103
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:06,053
Okay, i'll see what i can dig up,

104
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,705
but seriously, unless
your warranty's expired,

105
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,823
why don't you just check
in with dear old dad?

106
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,739
Are you okay?

107
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:17,298
Yeah, i'd just like to
bypass lois' inside voice

108
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,957
from here on out.
I'm fine.

109
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,525
I'll keep you posted.

110
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,336
<i>I can't miss this meeting,
or i'm gonna get fired.</i>

111
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,842
- <i>This isn't the life i wanted.</i>

112
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,340
<i>I'll show them on monday.</i>

113
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,181
<i>Should have listened to janet...</i>

114
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:41,679
<i>once a cheater, always a cheater.</i>

115
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,464
Reading people's thoughts.

116
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,959
You said my trials had
begun. Is this one of them?

117
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,680
<i>I've planted within you
the seeds for this trial,</i>

118
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,106
<i>designed to self-manifest
when most needed.</i>

119
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:12,213
<i>An event must have
happened to trigger it,</i>

120
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,829
<i>some kind of error or
mistake in judgment.</i>

121
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,632
I don't understand.

122
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:19,059
I saved everyone in that factory.

123
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,011
<i>Assumptions are flaws</i>

124
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:23,768
<i>inherent in the human
instincts you have adopted,</i>

125
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:25,889
<i>but they are beneath you.</i>

126
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:29,761
<i>What you have yet to nurture

127
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,831
You shouldn't underestimate humans.

00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,770
<i>Neither should you.</i>

129
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:38,246
<i>Being able to discern
why humans truly behave as they do</i>

130
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,204
<i>will help you to

131
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,102
<i>This ability is only temporary.</i>

132
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:45,959
<i>You must learn to focus, clark.</i>

133
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,376
<i>Perception</i>

134
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,915
<i>can be the difference

135
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,425
I know loose lips sink ships,

136
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,126
but tight ones don't do a
hell of a lot of good, either.

137
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:06,206
Chatty cathy,
we just need one answer.

138
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,273
You were actually a hostage, right?

139
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,737
This one's getting us nowhere.

140
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,039
<i>Do not let them find out.</i>

141
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,527
<i>They can't send me back.</i>

142
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:19,792
<i>My baby needs me.</i>

143
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,013
It's okay. You can talk to us.

144
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:24,219
We're not i. N. s.

145
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:29,263
I am sorry.

146
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,789
I saw a man.

147
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:42,839
Let me get this straight. You're saying
the guy who took you hostage

148
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:45,012
was short and fat

149
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,782
but also... tall.

150
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,275
Way taller
than your boyfriend there.

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,888
Thin...

152
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,680
thin like a rail.

153
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,916
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

154
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,233
<i>I wonder who will talk to me next.</i>

155
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,163
<i>The fbi? Maybe interpol.</i>

156
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,799
It's clear that this is the most
excitement you've had probably ever.

157
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,702
Now, you can mislead us,

158
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,000
but interfering with
a police investigation

159
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,907
to keep yourself in the limelight
will only land you in jail.

160
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,348
Is that understood?

161
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:23,342
Sorry.

162
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,518
I didn't see anything.

163
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,838
<i>I don't care how cute he is.</i>

164
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,048
<i>I'd better not get fired for this.</i>

165
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,658
I haven't seen you
eat a thing all day.

166
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,194
Owed you from earlier,
low blood sugar and all.

167
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,953
Look at this.

168
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,761
- Thanks for taking care of me.
- Wait.

169
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:56,912
Now we're even.

170
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,792
What else did you find out?

171
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:03,290
Mr. Murphy, our mystery man's puppet,
just got out of surgery.

172
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,282
He's still unconscious.

173
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,661
I've hit enough dead ends for today.

174
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:10,054
Really no reason for us to keep
hanging out here, then, huh?

175
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,555
You're absolutely right.

176
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,595
Why don't we just call it a night?

177
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,608
That's good. I have plans.

178
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:24,145
<i>Lifetime and some chunky
monkey or rocky road.</i>

179
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,660
<i>Maybe both.</i>

180
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,695
I was hoping that we could
grab something to eat tonight

181
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,122
once we finished up.
You know...

182
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,525
you said yourself i
hadn't eaten all day.

183
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,885
<i>Is clark kent asking
me out on a date,</i>

184
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:42,344
<i>like a date date?</i>

185
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,491
I'm not saying
we should go on a date.

186
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:47,467
Just something...

187
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,208
<i>like a date.</i>

188
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,183
As sweet as that notion is,
smallville,

189
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:53,440
this is metropolis
on a saturday night.

190
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,243
We ain't getting in anywhere
without a reservation.

191
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,800
<i>Except maybe
the truck rally downtown,</i>

192
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,214
- <i>but there's no way he'd ever.</i>
- We could probably still get tickets

193
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,322
to the monster-truck
rally down at the coliseum.

194
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:06,464
- It doesn't start for a few more hours.
- <i>Shut up!</i>

195
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,527
I'll meet you there.

196
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,278
Standard protocol...

197
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:14,562
two cars at the beginning of the night,
no drama at the end of it.

198
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,332
Barkeep, i'm gonna need...

199
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:19,302
something cold, tall, wet, sexy.

200
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:20,603
Put a...

201
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,631
put one of these in
it, will you, please?

202
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,445
Looks like i got dollar bills.
I got pesos. I got...

203
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:32,382
is that a euro?
I got this purple thing. These are fun.

204
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:36,752
Listen, why don't we just
take the whole thing,

205
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,085
and have a little vacation on me.
How does that sound?

206
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,603
What are you doing with my wife?

207
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:22,504
Really?

208
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:41,351
If you wanted more face time,

209
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,032
all you had to do was ask.

210
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:52,772
This is me asking.

211
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,482
Why so fancy?

212
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:13,949
Monster trucks.

213
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,542
Monster trucks?

214
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,553
I've seen you do
monster trucks before,

215
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,466
and this is definitely more than that.
I would say that this is

216
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:23,326
strictly rhinestone-on-mud-flaps
territory.

217
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,520
Who's the prince charming?

218
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,956
I never thought i'd say
this out loud, but...

219
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,705
i know, right?
It's the weirdest thing.

220
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,508
Of the five things to do in kansas,

221
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,353
clark picked the one thing
i've wanted to do for weeks.

222
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,836
We've been on the same wavelength,
like, all day today.

223
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:47,550
I'll bet.

224
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,019
Sort of like he's
been reading your mind?

225
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:51,521
Like he's hearing things

226
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,889
that you've never
actually said out loud?

227
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,569
Exactly.

228
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,808
That is the weirdest thing.

229
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,264
Me and clark.

230
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,032
I don't know.

231
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:05,801
We certainly kick
all kinds of ass at work, but

232
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:07,456
lately,

233
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,819
 it feels like
we're more than just partners, you know?

234
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:14,701
I think i've gotten so used to
carrying the load all by myself,

235
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,506
what if i don't have
to anymore, you know?

236
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:20,284
Clark and lois versus the world.

237
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,460
Kind of lost myself
in there somewhere?

238
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,213
Don't wait up.

239
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,103
<i>He forced me to do it.</i>

240
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,271
<i>It wasn't me. I'm innocent.</i>

241
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,173
<i>He strapped the bomb on me.</i>

242
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,642
<i>I just work there.</i>

243
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,911
<i>He said toys weren't good enough.</i>

244
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,846
<i>He wants to play a game.</i>

245
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,906
<i>He said queen will pay
for what he's done to him.</i>

246
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,308
Toyman.

247
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,855
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

248
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:12,855
<i>Toy bomber still at large</i>

249
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,423
what the hell were you thinking?

250
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:39,041
- They could have killed you.
- Yeah.

251
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:43,516
You didn't really give
them a chance, did you?

252
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:46,066
And now... we'll never know.

253
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:49,502
Were you even aware that one
of your factories blew up?

254
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:54,527
Do you give a damn
about anything anymore?

255
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,628
Please tell me you didn't
waste all that jet fuel

256
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,655
to come down here and
deliver me a lecture.

257
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,848
Your company's failing.

258
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,005
Your stock is worth less

259
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,852
than you think of
yourself right now.

260
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,860
There's only so much more loss

261
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:11,100
the shareholders will
be willing to accept.

262
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,603
I'm tired of making excuses.

263
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,515
Then, why don't you
stop making excuses?

264
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,486
Tell them the truth about me.

265
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:21,587
Then you can become sole
c. E. o. It'll be great for you.

266
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:23,237
It's what you always wanted, right?

267
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,292
I've seen you go off
the rails before,

268
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,188
but this...

269
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,083
... this vanishing act?

270
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,836
These binges.

271
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,111
You're punishing yourself.

272
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,767
Why?

273
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,051
What did you do?

274
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,180
No matter what this is about...

275
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,825
i understand.

276
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,634
You know that.

277
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:25,844
Just talk to me.

278
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,292
It sounds like you're the one
who needs to do the talking.

279
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,699
So i guess the real question is,

280
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,935
what is it that you want from me?

281
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:55,667
I need your pretty face
addressing our shareholders.

282
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,758
Consider this one of the
many favors you owe me.

283
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,923
Is that all you want?

284
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,530
I've learned not to expect
too much from you.

285
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:21,607
Cheer up.

286
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:24,737
You can fall down drunk in a
gutter as soon as it's done.

287
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,557
Wheels up in 20.

288
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,781
<i>It's a good thing he can't hear</i>

289
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,804
- <i>what i'm thinking or else...</i>
- or else what?

290
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,607
Or else i would have to tell you

291
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:57,042
that i don't want you
breaking my cousin's heart.

292
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,726
How was i supposed to react

293
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,547
when i find out that you've
been rifling through lois' brain

294
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:03,249
like you lost your keys in there?

295
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:05,417
You can't just trick
someone into dating you.

296
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,919
I didn't trick her into
anything, and it's not a date.

297
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:11,120
You didn't see her when she left
my apartment. Believe me, it was a date.

298
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:13,790
And to add insult to injury,
now you're standing her up?

299
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,751
I asked her out not on a date.

300
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,232
Before i knew our bomber
was an innocent man.

301
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,770
- Toyman's back.
- Winslow schott is responsible

302
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:28,240
for the explosion in oliver's building.
That's why i didn't call lois back.

303
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:30,662
The last thing i need
is her showing up here

304
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:32,802
and following me into harm's way.

305
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:36,020
Winslow's trying to smoke
oliver out of hiding. He's insane.

306
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,616
Yeah, he was crazy enough

307
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:40,610
before oliver framed
him for lex's murder.

308
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:43,389
If he's trying to track oliver down,

309
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,702
he won't have a hard
time doing it tonight.

310
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,527
Oliver's addressing his shareholders

311
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:51,703
at your requisite red-carpet,
black-tie a. O. c. Gala.

312
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:55,967
All right,
you head back to watchtower.

313
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:58,093
If winslow strikes again,
we need to move fast.

314
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,602
Mr. Pierson.

315
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,827
Kirkpatrick.

316
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,322
<i>Let's see...</i>

317
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,824
<i>"kendall, kennair...""</i>

318
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,190
<i>there it is... "kirkpatrick."</i>

319
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:24,763
Have a good evening, mr.
Kirkpatrick.

320
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:25,987
Name?

321
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:27,989
Kennair.

322
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,867
You have a plus-one
tonight, mr. Kennair?

323
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,081
I can handle this, smallville.

324
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,850
You've already done enough tonight.

325
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,885
What are you doing here?

326
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,222
<i>Standing in the shadow
of 6 1/2 feet of handsome.</i>

327
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,376
<i>No, he doesn't get off that easy.</i>

328
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,230
<i>Kick his ass!</i>

329
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,368
Do you honestly think that stacked
parking, not having a cocktail dress,

330
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,558
and being three steps behind
you on your mystery-man story

331
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,399
was gonna stand in my way? Did you?

332
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,070
Or that you hid the fact

333
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,696
that oliver returned for
the sake of an article?

334
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:11,042
You can't get rid of me that easily.

335
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,242
I have the internet on my phone.

336
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:15,618
I can explain.

337
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:18,049
I know how the boys' club works.

338
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,766
You wanted to scoop me on a story.

339
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,720
- Prose before hos.
- Now, wait a second.

340
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,054
Good evening.

341
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:24,590
<i>How could you be so stupid?</i>

342
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,424
<i>This was never about
more than a story.</i>

343
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,017
<i>Maybe it never will be.</i>

344
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:32,731
For your sake, there
better be an open bar,

345
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:35,598
because i think that bone
dawg has my purse in his truck.

346
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,714
Now, i don't need
your help on this one.

347
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,524
I can do it on my own.

348
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,519
Maybe you'd like to
think that you can,

349
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,326
but we all know there's no way.

350
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:58,113
This is my headline.

351
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:01,722
<i>Oh, god, why would you let
yourself get attached?</i>

352
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,617
<i>You know better than that.</i>

353
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:06,142
<i>They always leave.</i>

354
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,191
You know what? Maybe you're right.

355
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,805
I'm gonna get some air...

356
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,706
some really private air.

357
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:17,340
I'm out of here.
Good luck flying solo.

358
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:24,981
<i>Maybe i should buy her a drink.</i>

360
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:29,922
<i>Company can't
be in that bad of shape.</i>

361
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,155
<i>Mercer never should have
gotten us all into this.</i>

362
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:34,613
<i>I hope that comes out in the wash.</i>

363
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:36,948
<i>Everyone said it was a
gamble, but i wouldn't listen.</i>

364
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:38,997
<i>This stock was supposed
to put him through college.</i>

365
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,290
<i>She doesn't know this suit
is a rental. She can't.</i>

366
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:44,503
<i>I can't afford to
lose any more money.</i>

367
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,505
<i>He'll follow me if i leave.</i>

368
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,996
<i>So the devil came wearing
a blue dress tonight.</i>

369
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:50,673
Ladies and gentlemen...

370
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:55,589
your fearless leader, oliver queen.

371
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:00,246
<i>Look who decided
to grace us with his presence.</i>

372
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,026
Thank you.

373
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:05,858
Thank you, everyone.

374
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,627
"I know this has been a
trying year for all of you,

375
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:10,996
"and hopefully i can
remain upright long enough

376
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,727
"to say what...

377
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,114
needs to be said."

378
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,027
Obviously, whoever wrote this speech
has a pretty good sense of humor.

379
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,831
<i>Use the earpiece</i>

380
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:27,358
excuse me. It's...

381
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,316
sorry. Technical difficulties here.

382
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:33,049
One moment.

383
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,134
Thanks, dad.

384
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,302
Yes, mr. Queen,

385
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:53,795
it's your old playmate
winslow schott.

386
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,065
I'm sure you remember.

387
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:58,834
You framed me for murder, after all.

388
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,961
And now that i've finally won
your little game of hide-and-seek,

389
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,652
<i>i thought we might play something</i>

390
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:09,120
<i>that i'm a little more
comfortable with...</i>

391
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,756
<i>"toyman says."</i>

392
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,225
Read everything i've
written or you will die.

393
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,251
<i>Toyman says...</i>

394
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:19,230
<i>don't try to run, don't take a step.</i>

395
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:20,666
If you move one muscle,

396
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,807
i will kill everybody in this room.

397
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:27,052
<i>Toyman says you're standing
on a pressure plate.</i>

398
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,742
<i>Toyman says...</i>

399
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:33,169
you're standing on a bomb!

400
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,955
"I've never truly
worked a day in my life,

401
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:49,444
"too busy gagging on
the silver spoon...

402
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:53,648
wedged down my throat."

403
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:58,585
"And even when given a second
chance at life, i was...

404
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:01,709
i was unable to see
past my selfish nature."

405
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,848
<i>Don't stop there, mr. Queen.</i>

406
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,355
We haven't even gotten
to the good part yet.

407
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:14,178
"Time and again,

408
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:15,943
"i've put my own needs

409
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:18,215
"over the needs of
my devoted employees.

410
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,908
"In fact, the only thing i've ever
been selfless enough to part with

411
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:23,378
is the blame..."

412
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,193
"for a heinous act."

413
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:31,128
No. Chloe, the trials aren't over.</i>

414
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,397
I just got my training
wheels taken away.

415
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:36,033
I think jor-el wants me
to use what i've learned.

416
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:38,069
Can you hack the security
feed to the building?

417
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:40,217
- <i>He's got to be in here somewhere.</i>
- I'm on it.

418
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,303
<i>"My name is oliver queen,</i>

419
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,442
"and i am a coward,

420
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,701
"i'm a thief,

421
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:50,119
"and i am..."

422
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,230
<i>MURDERER
Don't forget you're standing on a bomb</i>

423
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,152
too ashamed to admit

424
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:58,270
that you were really responsible
for killing lex luthor.

425
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,616
You didn't think twice
about blaming me for it!

426
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,406
We have to get these
people out of here now.

427
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:17,541
<i>Oliver's standing on a land mine.</i>

428
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,200
Just give me one second.

429
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:23,127
"And i..."

430
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,142
confess!

431
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:37,305
<i>The emergency
alarm has been activated.</i>

432
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,185
<i>Please move in an orderly
fashion to the nearest exit.</i>

433
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,113
<i>Thank you.</i>

434
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,477
I'm not gonna ask. Nice one.

435
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:50,998
<i>The emergency alarm
has been activated.</i>

436
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,083
<i>Please move in an orderly
fashion to the nearest exit.</i>

437
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,710
<i>Thank you.</i>

438
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,350
How do i disarm the bomb?

439
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:03,050
I don't know who you are, but
you're interrupting my game.

440
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,655
I can't just go changing the rules

441
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,690
for someone who isn't even playing.

442
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:08,849
This isn't a game.
It's a man's life!

443
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,312
No.
It is a game.

444
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,927
- And toyman makes the rules now.
- What you're doing is pointless.

445
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:18,125
Oliver would never
let those people die.

446
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:26,935
But you already know that, don't you?
You don't allow for human error.

447
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,349
You have to control who wins.

448
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:32,305
That's why you put a
timer on the factory bomb.

449
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,958
The pressure plate that
oliver is standing on is fake, isn't it?

450
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,740
The bomb is on a timer.

451
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,274
You follow my work.

452
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,851
It's always nice to have a fan.

453
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,355
How long does oliver have?

454
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:50,625
Not long enough.

455
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,092
You know what, toyman,
i might be your biggest fan.

456
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:16,915
And i know
that the real winslow schott

457
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,274
would want to live and
dance on oliver's grave.

458
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:35,213
No one wins the game
if you both lose.

459
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,553
How'd you know the
pressure plate wasn't real?

460
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:01,126
I didn't.

461
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:12,756
I waited till the last
person got out.

462
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,813
I knew the explosion
wouldn't kill you.

463
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,993
At least the real
winslow... has been arrested.

464
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:49,450
Chloe was able to follow
the feed from the earpiece.

465
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,257
He's on the way to
stryker's as we speak.

466
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:00,465
Speak your mind.

467
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,582
I haven't been paying enough
attention to everything.

468
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,709
There's been danger all around
me that i haven't seen...

469
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:14,646
warning signs i haven't noticed.

470
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:20,711
And people in need
that i've neglected.

471
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,656
I didn't realize how bad things are.

472
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:32,124
I haven't been here for you.
I'm sorry.

473
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:35,659
With all due respect,
i'm not sure i'm worth your concern.

474
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,146
When i was reading
that speech in there,

475
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:41,540
when i decided to...

476
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:46,876
that speech wasn't just a
laundry list of all my sins. It was...

477
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,516
it was a fact sheet.

478
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:55,754
Ever tell you how old i
was when my parents died?

479
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:58,861
5.

480
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:02,527
I never really knew them very well.

481
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:06,531
Everything about my
life is not really mine.

482
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:09,935
It's theirs.

483
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,075
I didn't earn it...

484
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,777
and it's all a lie.

485
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:24,415
You of all people know what
it's like to wear a mask, right?

486
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,696
That's all this is...

487
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:31,198
the queen name,

488
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:33,458
green arrow.

489
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,461
Masks.

490
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,766
And i just realized there's
nothing underneath them.

491
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,847
There is something
behind those masks.

492
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:48,039
You're just afraid to face it.

493
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:53,403
You're not running
away from who you are.

494
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:56,025
You're running away from who
you think you're becoming.

495
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:59,863
But you don't have to face it alone.

496
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:05,461
Just because you've given up on
oliver queen doesn't mean i have.

497
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,562
Thank you.

498
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:18,980
Sounds like they're
playing your song.

499
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,792
Go on, get the hell out
of here, go be a hero.

500
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,017
Go.

501
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:38,425
No!

502
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,911
I... want...

503
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:52,328
my... lawyer!

504
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:54,755
Hello?!

505
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:56,761
Hello?!

506
00:35:58,165 --> 00:36:01,287
I want my lawyer!
I know you can hear me out there!

507
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:12,867
Loud and clear, mr. Schott.

508
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:14,693
I know you.

509
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,883
You're oliver queen's
business partner.

510
00:36:18,954 --> 00:36:20,340
Sorry about...

511
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:22,566
trying to kill your boyfriend.

512
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,740
You're not here for revenge,
are you?

513
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,230
Something like that.

514
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,797
Leave oliver...

515
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:45,223
the hell alone.

516
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:52,607
- Pretty please?
- Help! Someone!

517
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:54,193
Help!

518
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:00,481
The guard will be
back here any minute.

519
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:02,049
You're crazy!

520
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:04,652
That guard is going on
administrative leave,

521
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:07,078
and he and i have
a little agreement.

522
00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:11,425
See, you tried to escape,

523
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,629
and he was only defending himself
when he shot you in the knee.

524
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:17,355
No, please.

525
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:20,024
They'll put me in solitary.

526
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,638
No.

527
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,506
Which is exactly where
you'll need to be

528
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:28,299
to spend some quality
time with your new toy.

529
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,695
What new toy?

530
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,024
It's...

531
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,694
it's beautiful.

532
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,448
It is.

533
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:06,125
It's a meteor-rock-powered heart,

534
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:09,174
and you're gonna
tell me how it works.

535
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:51,574
You missed all the
excitement last night.

536
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:56,212
If i remember correctly,
it wasn't my excitement to have missed.

537
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,056
Was it?

538
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,601
I was expecting to
read about the exploits

539
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:04,062
of metropolis' journalistic
savior this morning.

540
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:07,407
That's the thing, i think i may have
bitten off more than i can chew.

541
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:10,227
Really?

542
00:39:11,232 --> 00:39:13,238
What's this?

543
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:17,033
<i>Billionaire bomb defused</i>

544
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:20,046
it's me asking for help.

545
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:26,341
I didn't exactly finish my story
last night and i missed the deadline.

546
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,249
I guess i'm not ready
to fly solo just yet.

547
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,400
The sky is a big place.

548
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:01,273
There.

549
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,423
Looks like you've got one
too many names on there.

550
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:10,843
I just thought you'd want
to have some creative input.

551
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:16,653
I am sorry for letting you down.

552
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:24,151
Is this an olive branch?

553
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:27,030
'cause there better be a
whole tree somewhere in here.

554
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:31,122
And maybe a new pair of jeans, too.

555
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:35,196
It's not every day lois lane
allows herself to be stood up.

556
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:39,290
Then it's a good thing
it was only like a date.

557
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:45,439
I don't even know how someone
would get a second date

558
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:47,598
after messing things up like that.

559
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:52,494
If people were to try that again.

560
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,985
They might want to do it
on a slower news day...

561
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:59,944
hypothetically speaking.

562
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,723
Those don't come along very often.

563
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:03,948
No.

564
00:41:07,772 --> 00:41:10,790
I'm sure people would make sure
they got it right the next time.

565
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:14,276
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

566
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:21,499
My thoughts exactly.
