1
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,509
The world moves so fast today.

2
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:12,711
People forget how much
better they had it as kids...

3
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,601
when hours seemed like days

4
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:20,000
and a favorite toy could
be a child's best friend.

5
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,133
Toys are powerful things, you know.

6
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,230
They are vessels for the
imagination imbued with life...

7
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:39,634
through the simple act of play.

8
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,000
Mercer is taking too many risks.

9
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,883
Lex took a gamble with
her, and it's paying off.

10
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,501
Look at the success she's
had with the daily planet.

11
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,399
Lex didn't know she was funneling
all of luthorcorp's holdings

12
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,057
into one highly experimental bioweapon.
And now she's lost the prototype.

13
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:08,200
I move for a vote of no confidence.

14
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,080
- Yeah, i second the motion.
- All those in favor of making a change.

15
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:13,234
Aye.

16
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,334
That is, i agree it's time for a change,

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,701
but not quite how you mean it.

18
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:21,234
Oliver queen. What are
you doing in enemy camp?

19
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:24,167
I'm actually the one
who called this meeting.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,701
Tess sends her regrets. But

21
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:30,188
she's on her way to dubai, overseeing
some of our international interests.

22
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:32,033
What do you mean "our"?

23
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,840
With tess' cooperation,

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,834
i've purchased controlling
interest in luthorcorp.

25
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,739
If that barracuda went behind our backs
and helped you with a hostile takeover...

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,848
you know, i really don't think that the luthorcorp
board should be lecturing me on ethics, ma'am.

27
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:54,414
After all, you've been using the world as
your own personal playground for way too long.

28
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,100
The world is much better
off because of the luthors,

29
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,200
and no pampered playboy is
going to destroy their legacy.

30
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:06,400
Everybody down!

31
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:18,968
Smallville 814

32
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:29,100
Synchro : Flolo

33
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,767
For seriessub.com

34
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:13,522
please tell me that the
bed was already wobbly.

35
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,133
Lana, it's made of solid oak.

36
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,739
Oh, god.

37
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you say we find
out how strong the floor is?

38
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,367
Where do you get all the energy?

39
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:32,167
How would you like
to see another sunset?

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,767
We could start our night all over again.

41
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:37,834
Head west, find a sandy beach.

42
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:43,066
I love you being so romantic, clark.

43
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:47,419
But there's something that i would love
even more than a trip to the tropics.

44
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,746
Just ask, and it's yours.

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,352
I want to help you when you're
out patrolling metropolis.

46
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,244
Lana, i'm not so sure that ...

47
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:07,579
when i stopped that bullet
and saved dr. Groll's life,

48
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,868
it was the most amazing
feeling i have ever had.

49
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,133
I got to use my new powers
the way i always planned to.

50
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,667
Lana, even with your strength and speed,

51
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,142
it's still dangerous out there.

52
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,934
You've protected me for years.

53
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:25,267
But this is who i am now.

54
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,402
It's the life i want.

55
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,496
And i want to share it with you.

56
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:45,543
All i've ever wanted was
someone to share my life with.

57
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,654
To work with me, side by side...

58
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,461
just like my mom and dad did.

59
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,299
- With my abilities, i never thought...
- clark, stop.

60
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,945
I'm right here.

61
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,774
Hey. There was some sort of
an explosion at luthorcorp.

62
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:24,465
The news was saying it was a bomb.

63
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,400
- Oh, my god.
- Was anyone hurt?

64
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,031
Apparently, everyone on the
board of directors was killed.

65
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:32,044
Oliver was there. He's in the hospital.

66
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,968
Well, if it isn't metropolis'
newest power couple.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,791
How you doing, oliver?

68
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:17,164
I'm all right. Nothing
a dry martini can't cure.

69
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,033
Were there any other survivors?

70
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,451
You were the only one.

71
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,067
They said the table
protected you from the blast.

72
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,400
Oliver, do you have
any idea who did this?

73
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,733
Angry shareholder, maybe?

74
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,898
I just bought a controlling
stake in luthorcorp.

75
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,747
I was meeting with the
board to announce it.

76
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,534
If you're trying to erase
the "luthor" from luthorcorp,

77
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,534
then there's one obvious choice
for who was behind this attack.

78
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:51,057
You know, if he was gonna come after
anyone, lana, i would assume it would be you.

79
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,701
You were the one that
really got under his skin.

80
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:59,192
Or should i say into it. That biotech that
you commandeered, that was his lifeline.

81
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:01,822
It was his last chance at recovery.

82
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:04,903
Thing probably meant more to
him than his entire company.

83
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,133
Do you remember anything
before the blast?

84
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,653
Something that could help us
figure out if lex is behind this?

85
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,300
No.

86
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,534
No, i didn't see anything.

87
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,590
All right. Don't worry, oliver.

88
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,364
I promise we're gonna
find out who did this.

89
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,852
Oliver's lucky to be alive.

90
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,067
Looks like the bomb went off over here.

91
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:07,400
Must be pieces in the walls everywhere.

92
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,711
Clark. Are you okay?

93
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,608
There's kryptonite.

94
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,934
Looks like this silver shard
was part of the bomb, but...

95
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:31,755
why would they use meteor rock?

96
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,388
It's not the first time it's been
used to make a bomb more powerful.

97
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:40,356
What was that?

98
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:44,434
Whatever it was, lana, i don't
feel the kryptonite anymore.

99
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:48,260
Maybe it was treated with something that
lost its charge when i moved the chip.

100
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,868
Queen industries.

101
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:57,251
Clark, i think that oliver
knows more than he's saying.

102
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,103
Lana, it's a big company. They
make thousands of chips a year.

103
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,334
Why would you think oliver
would be responsible?

104
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:06,200
I don't, but doesn't it seem
like he's covering something?

105
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,801
But why would he hide anything from me?

106
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,191
He's done it before, clark.

107
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,620
When i tracked lex to
cuba, oliver showed up.

108
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,234
He was there to kill lex.

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,434
Why didn't you tell me about this?

110
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,929
I thought that i'd talked him down,

111
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,814
but obviously, he still
has his own agenda.

112
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:35,148
I think that you should show him the
chip and give him a chance to explain.

113
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,982
No, we can't trust him anymore.

114
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:40,346
If he's so obsessed with killing
lex that he went behind my back,

115
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:42,488
i don't want to pull him in any deeper.

116
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,749
Whatever oliver is hiding,
we'll figure it out on our own.

117
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,634
The game has begun.

118
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:05,095
Although, even the finest plan
can't guarantee a flawless execution.

119
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,144
Apparently...

120
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,484
miss mercer wasn't in the room.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,778
And oliver queen survived.

122
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,901
But don't you worry.

123
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:31,452
I'll be sure to tie up
any loose ends, mr. Luthor.

124
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:38,744
Meanwhile, we've
already begun round two.

125
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:45,701
Time for our next move.

126
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,071
Your heart rate's a little
higher than normal, mr. Queen.

127
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:20,764
Really?

128
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,820
I'm sure the view has that
effect on all your patients.

129
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,371
Your patients.

130
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,567
Well, with the pain meds you're on,

131
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:31,734
i'm afraid this is the only
view you're getting tonight.

132
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,130
Rest.

133
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,933
Looks like someone's
making a speedy recovery.

134
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,701
Yeah, not quick enough. Trust me.

135
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:43,296
Well, i'm guessing you didn't get me
over here to spoon you chicken soup.

136
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:47,780
No. Listen, i need you to pull an
address off of queen industries' database.

137
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,481
It's an engineer that i fired six
years ago. His name's winslow schott.

138
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,501
And you think this
ex-employee is behind the bomb?

139
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,267
I hired him right out of m.i.t.

140
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,462
Developed explosives ... anything from

141
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:01,100
blowing out tunnels to
breaking up kidney stones.

142
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:04,746
That's pretty high praise for
someone you handed a pink slip to.

143
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:08,170
- What happened? -
High-pressure job.

144
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,868
He snapped.

145
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,701
He started bringing toys to work.

146
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:15,000
Whatever, right?

147
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,792
But then he started...

148
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,167
hiding explosives inside the toys.

149
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,933
And that's when i realized
winslow was thinking

150
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:26,401
a little bit too far
outside the toy box.

151
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,801
Why are you telling
me this when you have

152
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,267
your very own personal bomb
squad in clark and lana?

153
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,359
Look, give me 10 minutes with one of your
satellites, and i'll get them to go and get him.

154
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,868
No, chloe, we can't tell clark.

155
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,847
Winslow could have attacked me any
time he wanted in the past six years.

156
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,917
He chose the night i took
over luthorcorp to do it.

157
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:53,012
The toy boy may have pulled the pin...

158
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,000
but i think he's working for lex.

159
00:12:56,624 --> 00:13:00,167
So, you're not actually interested
in tracking this winslow guy down.

160
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,467
You just want him to lead you to lex.

161
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,200
And you want clark to
stay out of your way.

162
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:11,367
Chloe, you know clark would never agree

163
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,983
to do what needs to be done
to get rid of lex forever.

164
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,634
You're talking about killing a man.

165
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:23,527
I'm talking about ending this reign of
terror that's been consuming us all lately.

166
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,501
No. I can't lie to clark.

167
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:30,259
You want to tell him the truth,
or you want to protect him?

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,501
Lex tried to kill me. You know
he's coming after clark next.

169
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:38,267
Chloe, he knows his secret.

170
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Could you honestly live with yourself
if you let something happen to clark?

171
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,734
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,534
You know oliver.

173
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,651
Even the blast of a bomb
won't rattle his work ethic.

174
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:13,370
He asked me to come in and pull some
of the files from the luthorcorp deal.

175
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,595
That's funny.

176
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:18,788
Because i would think that queen industries
could free up at least one employee

177
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,619
to run his errands for him.

178
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,634
Yeah, well, i'm not exactly
a brink's security truck,

179
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,834
but oliver knows he can trust me.

180
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,943
I thought i could, too.

181
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,602
You're chasing down a lead on
the bombing for him, aren't you?

182
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,280
Sorry, clark.

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,434
Chloe, you don't understand.

184
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:43,200
Lana told me about oliver's
vendetta against lex.

185
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,296
He knows that i would try to stop him.

186
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,266
That's why he would lie, but
i don't know why you would.

187
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,828
Because i don't want to lose you, clark.

188
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:54,300
Lex knows that the meteor rocks
are poisonous to kryptonians.

189
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,100
He knows your weakness.
He could kill you.

190
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:59,834
That doesn't mean i'm supposed
to kill him first, chloe.

191
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,994
No matter what oliver said to you, lex
and i are not in a battle to the death.

192
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,267
Open your eyes, clark.

193
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,134
Lex declared war on you years ago.
He's known your secret for months.

194
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:12,681
- Why have you not done anything yet?
- I'm focused on the future ...

195
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,334
on using my abilities to help people.

196
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,760
I don't want to live in the past.

197
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,900
But that's exactly what you're doing.

198
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:25,444
You think that lex is still that same man
you saved on the bridge eight years ago?

199
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,801
You're not recognizing
the monster he's become.

200
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,732
So because i'm not gonna
kill someone, i'm in denial?

201
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,167
When you were taken over by brainiac,

202
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,620
you could have destroyed
the world, chloe.

203
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,768
But i refused to kill you.

204
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:51,955
Here.

205
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:55,801
It's oliver's top suspect
... winslow schott.

206
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,012
He used to work at s.t.a.r. Labs.

207
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:03,349
Oliver thinks he would lead us to lex.

208
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

209
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,141
Can i help you?

210
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,138
I certainly hope so.

211
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:39,595
Could you direct me to oliver queen's
room? I have a delivery for him.

212
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,739
You found your necklace.

213
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,681
After all the pain i caused you,
i'm surprised you still have it.

214
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:08,191
How could i throw away
something that means so much?

215
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:15,285
I still remember seeing you
wear this in high school.

216
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:19,793
I couldn't get within 5 feet
of you without falling over.

217
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,740
And even after your ship
got rid of the kryptonite,

218
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,849
there always seemed to be
something standing in our way.

219
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:29,231
Not anymore.

220
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,434
We're together now, lana.

221
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:35,812
And i'm not gonna let anyone
take that away from us.

222
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,541
Clark, i talked to dr. Groll about
what happened with the kryptonite.

223
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,234
It wasn't the chip.

224
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,807
It was me.

225
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:53,667
So, besides strength and speed,
you can destroy kryptonite.

226
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:57,980
No Groll says i absorbed
it. But I'm worried, clark.

227
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,467
If lex built this as a weapon,
what if you were the target?

228
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,734
But lex isn't wearing
it, lana ...  you are.

229
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,841
Look, we're gonna figure this out.

230
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:14,260
But we need to stay focused on tracking down
this bomber before he causes any more damage.

231
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:17,935
Did you find anything?

232
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,367
Yeah.

233
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,730
You were right ... oliver
was hiding something.

234
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,334
He thinks the bomber is someone
who used to work for him.

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,827
I went to that address listed there,
but he doesn't live there anymore.

236
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:37,447
According to this, mr. Schott
is a pretty prolific inventor.

237
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,768
He filed a lot of
patents for s.t.a.r. Labs.

238
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:45,032
A guy like this, he wouldn't
just stop registering his research

239
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:46,691
because oliver let him go.

240
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,634
So maybe the patent office
has a current address for him.

241
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,714
If this guy's working for lex, we're dealing
with a lot more than just some toy maker.

242
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:57,746
If lex put things in motion, he
has planned three moves ahead.

243
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,000
And now that he has nothing to lose,

244
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,434
he's more dangerous than ever.

245
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:21,113
What the hell?

246
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,501
How does it feel to not
be in control for once?

247
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,534
Untie me right now.

248
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,677
That wouldn't be very much fun.

249
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,972
I get it. I get it.

250
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:44,011
The children's ward's
two floors up, you know.

251
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,988
-  Excuse me?
- The balloons, the monkey,

252
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,764
the ridiculous costume you're
wearing ... you're a clown, right?

253
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,484
Aren't you a clown?

254
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,394
I am winslow schott.

255
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,474
You called me one of s.t.a.r. Labs'
greatest minds, and then you fired me.

256
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:07,134
Winslow.

257
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,768
Of course, yeah. Yeah,
i remember you now.

258
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:13,995
Well, it's good to see you're
still playing with toys.

259
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:16,401
Come on, man.

260
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:18,550
How much for the ape?

261
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:26,806
I don't need your money
anymore, mr. Queen.

262
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,801
I found someone new to work with...

263
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,824
someone who appreciates my genius.

264
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,100
None other than lex luthor himself.

265
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,434
Well, that's impressive.

266
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,665
I thought he was dead.

267
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,828
You are the one who's
supposed to be dead.

268
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,315
You should have died in that
explosion, like everyone else!

269
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:56,368
You seem like you're getting angry, winslow.
Maybe you should take your toys and go home.

270
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,622
Actually...

271
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,701
...i made a toy just for you.

272
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:16,168
After this little fella langs
his cymbals together 53 times...

273
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:20,047
it'll be the last sound you ever hear.

274
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,817
53, huh?

275
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:27,100
Seems a little arbitrary, doesn't it?

276
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:30,334
I filed 53 patents working for you.

277
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,980
Queen industries made
millions, and i got nothing.

278
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,801
I bet you wish you
appreciated my artistry

279
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,585
just a little bit more now, don't you?

280
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,940
Unlock the other cuff.

281
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:57,407
Come on! 28 and counting! Bobo's
not gonna slow down any time soon.

282
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:09,062
I swear, i'll break every one
of your artistic little fingers.

283
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:12,311
Now, tell me ... where can i find lex?

284
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:27,714
This is the last known address
the patent office had for him.

285
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:31,008
Chloe mentioned this winslow
guy had a thing for toys.

286
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:33,402
I'm guessing he still lives here.

287
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:48,801
There's a wireless
camera inside this doll.

288
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,980
- Someone's watching us.
- I can guess who it is.

289
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,334
Lex likes to keep an eye on
the people that work for him.

290
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:08,900
Lana, look at this.

291
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,367
It's metropolis.

292
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:18,086
Winslow must have played out the
bombing here before the attack.

293
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:21,378
If that's the case, then daily
planet is lex's next target.

294
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,933
Excuse me, mr. Queen?

295
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,701
It's time for your medicine.

296
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,238
Oh, my god!

297
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,467
Where's mr. Queen?

298
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:46,032
Just delivered a balloon-o-gram,
and the guy attacked me.

299
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,801
Here. Let me help you.

300
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,334
Thank you. Thank you so much.

301
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,134
You.

302
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,405
You're winslow schott!
No, don't untie him!

303
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,300
I win.

304
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,741
I just picked chloe up from
the hospital. She's okay.

305
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,697
But this toyman guy got away.

306
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:29,725
Keep looking, lana.

307
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,967
Call me crazy, clark, but isn't
there a bomb you should be finding?

308
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,834
Chasing that camera's signal may
be our only chance to find lex.

309
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,434
And lana's already searching
foror the bomb at the daily planet.

310
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,789
Have you had any luck?

311
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,180
The feed to the camera's been cut, but it was
definitely broadcasting to a single receiver.

312
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,967
You found lex.

313
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:51,253
Well, i managed to sneak past
the latest gaggle of ghost routers

314
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,917
and ping the original i.p. Address
that winslow was sending to.

315
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:55,351
Where is he?

316
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,723
"Where" sort of depends
on "when," clark.

317
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,397
Lex has been on the
move this whole time.

318
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,901
I thought lex was immobilized.

319
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,567
Lex may have been immobilized,

320
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,714
but his i.p. Address is still leaping
tall wireless towers in a single bound.

321
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:13,300
Now, i programmed the signal
into one of oliver's satellites

322
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,233
and synched it with my pda.

323
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:17,623
I made you a lex tracker.

324
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,655
Now, oliver's satellite is
about to pass out of range.

325
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:25,365
You only have 10 minutes before the
signal is gone and lex disappears again.

326
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:36,180
Clark, i searched every room, and
i can't find the bomb anywhere.

327
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,233
Like you said, we're a team.

328
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,207
It's on the roof.

329
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:24,801
Clark, that much kryptonite
could take out half the city.

330
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:32,080
Clark kent and lana lang,
welcome to your destiny.

331
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,097
You've destroyed me in every way,

332
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:39,886
so now i'm going to take
away what matters most to you.

333
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:47,618
Do you know what people remember about
the greatest star-crossed romances?

334
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:50,034
Not how the lovers met,

335
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,560
but the way the
relationship tragically ends.

336
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:59,843
The skin lana's wearing was
designed to absorb enough meteor rock

337
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,277
that you'll never be
able to go near her again.

338
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,500
You're a coward, lex.

339
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:08,419
Come out here. Face us!

340
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,103
No, clark.

341
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:13,324
It's time for you to
face your defining moment.

342
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:15,321
You can walk away,

343
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:18,577
sacrificing innocent
lives to stay together,

344
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:23,574
or defuse the bomb and
sacrifice your love forever.

345
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,368
You have to.

346
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:43,406
You'll never hurt
anyone else ever again.

347
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:52,101
I know how much it
hurts right now, clark,

348
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:55,367
but if you go after lex
like this, you will kill him.

349
00:29:56,934 --> 00:30:00,134
After what he's done to us,
lana, he needs to be stopped.

350
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:05,773
I promise you... i will
help you to punish lex.

351
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,934
But if you kill him,

352
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:14,834
you will lose so much more
than just us being together.

353
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,834
You'll lose yourself.

354
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:19,534
Lex deserved to die, chloe.

355
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:25,800
You certainly made sure
he got what he deserved.

356
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,501
They identified the remains as lex's.

357
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,934
And what does clark think?

358
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,067
That winslow turned on lex.

359
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:40,568
Pieces of a toy bomb were
found in the wreckage.

360
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,401
Yeah, well, that makes sense.

361
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:54,167
Wouldn't be like winslow
to play a game he can't win.

362
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:59,249
Are you seriously gonna let another man

363
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:02,064
take the blame for something you did?

364
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:06,548
Chloe, winslow was already a killer.

365
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:09,293
He blew up all those
people at luthorcorp.

366
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:12,767
He was about ready to take
down the entire daily planet.

367
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,183
One more death's not
gonna make a difference.

368
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:17,800
Are you listening to yourself?

369
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,983
Oliver, you've really
crossed a line here.

370
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,667
Lex is dead.

371
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,696
The world is safer because
of it. Clark is safe again.

372
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:26,334
This is murder.

373
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,344
This is justice.

374
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:31,167
Although clark may not
be able to accept that,

375
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,067
you know what i did was right.

376
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:40,788
And please don't stand
there and look so innocent.

377
00:32:41,134 --> 00:32:44,667
You know, i did a little
video viewing of my own.

378
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,275
Seems a certain meteor
freak named sebastian kane

379
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:51,852
died at the hospital
right after he got a visit

380
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,471
from somebody who looked
an awful lot like you.

381
00:32:56,967 --> 00:33:00,370
That was brainiac... not me.

382
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,475
Was it?

383
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:08,191
Because it seemed like a pretty
natural instinct to protect clark.

384
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,358
Now that lex is gone...

385
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,729
you can't tell me you're not relieved.

386
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:28,149
Ever fiber of my conscience
wants to say that's not true.

387
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,896
- But...
- then...

388
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,934
you can't tell clark what i did.

389
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,148
Lex just ripped the
man's heart out, chloe.

390
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:46,200
He's gonna need his friends around
him right now more than ever.

391
00:36:50,964 --> 00:36:53,145
Clark, please.

392
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:55,427
I don't want to hurt you.

393
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:01,101
Lex already took care of that.

394
00:37:07,254 --> 00:37:09,499
Did you talk to dr. Groll?

395
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:13,398
Can he help us?

396
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:18,568
No.

397
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:29,798
I'm gonna do everything
i can to fix this, lana.

398
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,697
I will find a way for us to be together.

399
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:35,465
Clark, he tried everything.

400
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,033
He can't reverse the process.

401
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:49,476
I love you.

402
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:52,764
I always will.

403
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:57,768
I know what i need to
do with my life now.

404
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,501
Life is...

405
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:05,034
so precious...

406
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,568
so beautiful.

407
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,664
And to be able to protect
that, that's an amazing gift.

408
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,906
I know you feel the same way.

409
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:21,202
What we have is beautiful.

410
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:28,067
Clark, we made our choice on that roof.

411
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:30,767
And i know we would do it again.

412
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,164
Because both of us are driven to do
this, even if we can't do it together.

413
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,334
Don't leave.

414
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:41,166
Don't leave again, lana.

415
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:48,081
Even if we can't be together,
i want you in my life.

416
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,267
That's where you're stronger than me.

417
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,070
To...

418
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,301
to see you...

419
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:00,472
on the street every day...

420
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:04,008
and not be able to touch you...

421
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:07,384
stay.

422
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,434
No.

423
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,724
Clark, don't.

424
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:12,995
Goodbye, clark.

425
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:30,100
That night at the cemetery, when
i introduced you to my mom and dad,

426
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,468
you told me that i
would never be alone...

427
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:36,706
that my mom would always
be watching over me.

428
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:40,809
If we're in each other's hearts, clark,

429
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:43,714
i will always be with you.

430
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,867
No matter what.

431
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:53,167
I love you.

432
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:22,134
I love you.
