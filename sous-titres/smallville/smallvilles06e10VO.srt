1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,229
I need 11 copies of each
by torrow morning,

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,769
and before my macchiato
goes arctic.

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,429
Assistants just don't have
the stamina they used to have.

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,699
Uh,excuse me,
miss lake,

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,139
with all due respect,
I'm not an assistant.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,639
I'm a reporter.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,159
Of course you are.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,569
Unfortunately...

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,479
...sullivan,

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,719
what matters is that I can see
gotham from my new office,

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,469
and you - oh,well,you,hon,

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,369
you work below sea level.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,269
At the risk of heresy,

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,259
I would rather be snorkeling
for the rest of my life

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,269
than destroy a man's career
based on rumor.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,429
DAILY DISH WITH LINDA
LAKE ALLION ON STETLIDS

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,429
I only print the truth,
and if you haven't noticed,

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,589
I print it on page 1,section b
every week.

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,099
Ron,I know for a fact
this guy is on steroids.

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,549
He's a juicer.

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,299
I can smell the slow-roasting
ink of tomorrow's headline.

22
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,649
Well,you said you wanted someone with
their finger on the pulse of the city.

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,389
Well,I just hit an artery.

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,229
Well,if it isn't
the steroid stallion.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,369
What?

26
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,559
Don't you have some
muscle-cocktail mixing to do?

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,779
You ruined my life!

28
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,059
And you don't even care,
do you?

29
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,829
Oh,please.

30
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,709
If you didn't want to get
red-rovered by the meteor's lineup,

31
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,749
maybe you should have reconsidered
jamming that needle into your tush.

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,999
You're pretty quick
to get high and mighty.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,199
I think those aminos
are going to your head.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,179
And I think you've destroyed
enough lives.

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,299
I'm not gonna let you
destroy any more.

39
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,129
So I'm guessing you didn't ditch
prime time on your social calendar

40
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,059
to come and help me research
the dwindling pigeon population.

41
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,229
Chloe,lex proposed.

42
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,539
And?

43
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,849
And I haven't given him
an answer yet.

44
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,269
I'm sure
that's going over well.

45
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,169
Lex and I are in
a really great place right now,

46
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,579
but when I actually heard
those words,

47
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,229
there was something
that wouldn't let me say yes.

48
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,129
Something like clark?

49
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,399
When I was with clark,

50
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,239
I would have said yes
without hesitating.

51
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,039
I thought that chapter
of my life was over.

52
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,109
Lana...

53
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,279
I think that you need to stop
reading between the lines

54
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,899
and actually talk to clark

55
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,039
before you're going to be able
to close this book on him forever.

56
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,129
Let's go.

57
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,359
Scoop girl?

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,379
Hotshot 485?

59
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,559
You've got to be
kidding me.

60
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,569
I'm not the one up all night tooling
the internet for green arrow pics.

61
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,409
Don't you have a boyfriend?

62
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,899
Do you have the photos?

63
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,949
You got the cash?

64
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,589
I don't get it. Of all the
photographers in metropolis,

65
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,789
how is it that you end up with the
first shots of our merry archer?

66
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,379
I have my connections.

67
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,149
No. Really.

68
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,649
Oh,well,guy doesn't get out
of the suicide slums much,

69
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,569
so I just hung out there
for a few weeks...

70
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,259
in my car with my pepper spray
and the doors locked.

71
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,929
This is it?

72
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,379
Nice work,hotshot.

73
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,719
I mean,you didn't even manage
to catch one shot of his face.

74
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,429
All these tell me about green
arrow is that he needs a band-aid.

75
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,189
Well,at least you got
a good look at that.

76
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,999
Thanks.

77
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,119
IUTHOR PROPRSAL ON HOLD FOR EX-FLAME

78
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,619
Hey,chloe.

79
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,649
Have you seen the daily planet
this morning?

80
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,909
No.

81
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,039
Okay.

82
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,289
God,I can't let you read this
in the paper.

83
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,179
Lex proposed to lana.

84
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,109
Whid she say?

85
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,769
She hasn't given him
an answer.

86
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,869
WHEN I WAS WITH CLARK I WOULD
HAVE SAID YES WIHTOUT HESITATING

87
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,039
It says here
it's because of me.

88
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,179
Is this true?

89
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,729
Chloe?

90
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,029
I know better -

91
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,509
look,I know better.

92
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,989
You know,I've tried so hard
to let lana go that...

93
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,209
if she marries lex,
there's no going back.

94
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,489
Is it true?

95
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,209
I would double down on the fact
that lana's still in love with you.

96
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,919
I can't let her do this.

97
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,069
Whoa,clark.
Wait a minute.

98
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,189
I- it's a lot more
complicated now.

99
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,069
What could be more complicated
than living your life with regrets?

100
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,099
You didn't have to do that.

101
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,099
I was feeling alone
waiting for your answer.

102
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,959
I didn't realize
I had so much company.

103
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,669
I don't know what to say.

104
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,149
Then let me.

105
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,779
"When I was with clark,

106
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,569
I would have said yes
without hesitating. "

107
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,439
You know,
the worst part of waiting...

108
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,669
was dwelling on all the reasons
why you might be stalling.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,859
At least now I know.

110
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,419
Lex,I'm sorry.

111
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,239
Mr. Luthor,

112
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,589
- you have a guest.
- * INCOMNG CALL CHLOE*

113
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,449
SENDING TO VOICEMAIL

114
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,299
You said lana was here.

115
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,799
She was.

116
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,039
I'm afraid
you just missed her.

117
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,289
I'll come back later.

118
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,839
So you really think
you can convince her?

119
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,879
You think you can talk her out of making the
biggest mistake of her life by marrying me?

120
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,819
We both know
that you swept in after -

121
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,879
after you crushed her?

122
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,029
You knew she was vulnerable,

123
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,459
and you played her until she
thought she was in love with you.

124
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,309
If you really see lana
as that naive,

125
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,269
you obviously don't think
as much of her as I do.

126
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,979
It must be eating at you
that she's hesitating -

127
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,739
wondering why she hasn't
given you an answer.

128
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,699
I guess it would...

129
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,009
if I didn't know what the answer
was going to be.

130
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,829
You see,I highly doubt
she'll say no,clark...

131
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,549
...now that she's carrying
my child.

132
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,449
BASEBALL LEGEND DAWSON DIES!

133
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,759
So you're telling me you think that metropolis'
most worshiped meathead was murdered?

134
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,929
Hey,now,that's my childhood
hero y're talking smack about,

135
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,519
and the one baseball card
I still can't manage to snag.

136
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,889
Still?

137
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,939
Yeah.
It's an investment.

138
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,199
So,why the homicide hunch
on this guy?

139
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,449
The obit writer left me
dawson's file to scan his photo.

140
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,889
Preliminary investigation
is calling it suicide,

141
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,089
but how's a guy who's larger than
life drown in 2 feet of water?

142
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,259
Well,
his career was over.

143
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,339
And lake was right -

144
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,859
the coroner's report says that
dawson was juiced up on muscle mixers.

145
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,189
Chloe,you're going to tell me
that someone on a 'roid rage

146
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,019
is going to lie down in
a koi pond and call it a day?

147
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,609
You said you'd have it ready
by today.

148
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,299
Well,that was before you added
the zen waterfall.

149
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,759
I have to get approval.

150
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,109
Approval?

151
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,039
Oh,please. This pulp rag
lives or dies by my column.

152
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,289
Now,you get it done
by today,

153
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,299
or you're going to be decorating
bathrooms in strip malls.

154
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,899
Ugh!

155
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,509
Get out!

156
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,419
Mr. Luthor.

157
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,619
Now,there's only one reason a
celebrity pays me a house call.

158
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,529
Right to the point.

159
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,129
Since you have a unique way of exhuming
even the most carefully buried secrets,

160
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,259
I have a little freelance
assignment for you.

161
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,099
I quit doing freelance
when I quit fetching lattes

162
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,019
for pudgy-fingered
newsroom vultures.

163
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,239
Well,I'll let you decide
what it's worth to you.

164
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,879
Fill in whatever number
you want.

165
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,519
Just get me anything you can
on clark kent and lana lang.

166
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,869
Ahh. Okay,how long
do I have to do this for?

167
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,079
What was it
that you said,h?

168
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,499
Yoga is glorified stretching
with chants.

169
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,539
Little bit different perspective
from down here.

170
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,279
Well,this is a good way to
strengthen your core,trust me.

171
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,589
I didn't realize that my core
was in question.

172
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,549
You really want to
keep talking?

173
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,679
No.

174
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,559
Hey.

175
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,599
Oh,it's a scratch.
Don't worry about it.

176
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,879
A scratch,huh?

177
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,409
How did that happen?

178
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,949
Um,it was
a fencing accident.

179
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,059
With a real blade?

180
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,949
Uh,you know,the tip
snapped off and caught me.

181
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,639
Trust me,it looks worse
than it feels,okay?

182
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,659
I promise.

183
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,289
Thank you for all
of the chakra reorganizing,

184
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,509
but I have to go.

185
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,709
Well,I mean,uh...

186
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,679
bye.

187
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,359
Smallville,
sorry about the article.

188
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,679
It's bad enough
to have a broken heart,

189
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,899
but to have it splashed
all over the newspapers...

190
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,609
I guess that's what
reporters do,don't they?

191
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,039
Okay,I think that little zinger just
ricocheted off of linda lake and hit me.

192
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,289
Look,I'm sorry.

193
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,379
People keep secrets
for a reason.

194
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,849
I don't know.

195
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,369
If you ask me,I think a secret
is just a big loophole

196
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,769
in the whole
"thou shall not lie" clause.

197
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,829
There's just no gray area
with you,is there?

198
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,359
Not when someone I thought I knew better than
anyone has been keeping the biggest secret of all.

199
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,609
What are you
talking about?

200
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,809
What would you do if one day
you realized someone close to you

201
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,079
had a serious hero complex?

202
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,789
Hero complex?

203
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,899
Hiding his true identity from
everyone he supposedly cares about.

204
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,619
You can't tell me you wouldn't
find somethi wrong with that.

205
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,999
Who exactly
are we talking about?

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,599
Green arrow,
A.K.A. Oliver queen.

207
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,709
Oliver.

208
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,519
Jimmy snapped photos
of green arrow

209
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,489
getting slashed in the arm
exactly where ollie's arm is cut.

210
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,439
Plus,the time printed on the
photos is exactly the same time

211
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,639
ollie disappeared on me
that same night.

212
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,499
When are you planning to unload
this theory on oliver?

213
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,919
I need proof first -
definitive proof.

214
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,949
That's where I thought
you might come in handy.

215
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,239
I swear I'm losing
my scare reflex because of you.

216
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,189
Lois asked me to -

217
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,729
oh,please,clark.

218
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,549
Are you going to tell me why you're
digging in lois' purse,snoop dogg?

219
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,169
Wait.
Let me guess.

220
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,569
You're covering for the new
pledge of your hero fraternity.

221
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,649
Last time lois said she had a lead on
the green arrow, she was just bluffing.

222
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,679
Now she says jimmy has shots
that will help I.D. Him.

223
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,199
Jimmy?

224
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,419
He's moonlighting for lois?

225
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,549
I guess we all have secrets
to keep.

226
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,909
You should know that
better than anyone right now.

227
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,869
You knew that lana was pregnant,
didn't you?

228
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,589
Clark,before you unload
your anger on me,

229
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,709
can I just say that I think
it is incredibly unfair

230
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,669
that everyone trusts me
to keep their secrets,

231
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,029
and then they turn around and they throw me
attitude for keeping someone else's secret?

232
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,859
Look,I'm sorry that I had to
take a two-second breather

233
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,789
from hiding the fact that you
are an alien from another planet

234
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,349
to protect someone else
for a change.

235
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,479
God!

236
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,969
You had that coming,
you know?

237
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,509
For the record...

238
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,609
I prefer "intergalactic traveler"
over "alien from another planet. "

239
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,019
Hey!

240
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,859
Hey.

241
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,559
Thanks for finally returning
one of my phone calls.

242
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,839
How much does lana lang's personal
life boost newspaper sales these days?

243
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,539
Okay.

244
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,159
I was expecting that.

245
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,489
But to be honest, I was kind of hoping
you'd give me the benefit of the doubt.

246
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,239
I guess there's a shortage
of those today.

247
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,289
That article recites
our conversation verbatim.

248
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,409
Do you honestly think
I would betray you like that?

249
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,549
What other explanation
is there?

250
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,639
I'm not sure,

251
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,719
but the lana lang I know would at
least give me a chance to find one.

252
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,949
After clark,
I guess I'm so jaded,

253
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,409
I don't even know what to expect
from my friends anymore.

254
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,629
So I take it the conversation
didn't go so well.

255
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,339
Conversation?

256
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,379
Clark left the talon
to go talk to you.

257
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,339
About what?

258
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,719
Well...

259
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,109
I don'T...

260
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,179
I should just put a bag
over my head that says,

261
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,499
"if you want to keep a secret,
don't tell me. "

262
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,939
What did he want to say?

263
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,079
You two need to O.K. Corral it
on your own,

264
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,519
because I've been blamed for putting words
in people's mouths enough for one day.

265
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,019
I'm sorry
I didn't trust you.

266
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,849
I just -

267
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,559
I don't understand how
every intimate detail of my life

268
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,229
is being leaked
into linda lake's column.

269
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,109
From what I found out,

270
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,729
her reconnaissance techniques aren't
exactly from the journalist's code of ethics.

271
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,549
I think it's time we turn the
tables on our little resident voyeur.

272
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,309
Hey,I got your call.
What's the 911?

273
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,679
I've been thinking.

274
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,909
Maybe your oliver theory
isn't so far out there.

275
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,459
And if he is the green arrow,
you deserve to know the truth.

276
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,719
Really?

277
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,939
Because I've been doing
some thinking of my own,and...

278
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,069
maybe I don't want to know.

279
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,049
I went through all the articles
on green arrow's crimes,

280
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,819
and what if we just got off
on the wrong foot?

281
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,989
The whole "rob from the rich
to give to the poor" thing,

282
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,719
that wins him some points,
right?

283
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,769
Are you feeling okay?

284
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,519
No!
I'm not all right,clark.

285
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,819
I think I'm in love
with oliver.

286
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,399
I don't know how you ever let
lana go if you felt this way.

287
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,119
Because I swear, the guy could
tell me he was from mars right now,

288
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,749
and I would find a way to
dismiss it as an endearing quirk.

289
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,119
Lois,you're like a pit bull
on a pant leg.

290
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,929
You're never going to let this
go until you know for sure.

291
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,439
I hate that you know me
like that.

292
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,639
But I can't just pull a lois
and ambush him.

293
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,759
What if I'm wrong?

294
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,899
What if you never need to
confront him?

295
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,089
Isn't this exciting?

296
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,009
Our first group movie night.

297
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,169
I mean,don't you just love
spontaneity?

298
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,309
Let me get it.

299
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,189
Clark,come on in.

300
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,859
Let me get your jacket.

301
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,469
Thanks for having me over.

302
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,089
Lois,looks like
you went all out.

303
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,409
Well,it's not a party
until you -

304
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,129
oh,no.

305
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,749
I can't believe I did that.

306
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,439
You can't have cocktails
without ice.

307
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,009
Don't worry.
Yours will be virgin.

308
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,669
I'll run to the corner.
I can grab it.

309
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,739
No,no,I got it!
My party,my bad.

310
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,589
Think she suspects
anything?

311
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,699
I think she's
a little preoccupied.

312
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,229
Then it's showtime.

313
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,859
Oliver,they're chasing me.

314
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,329
I don't know how many there are.

315
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,629
10,maybe.

316
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,569
I shouldn't have
cut down the alley.

317
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,439
Oh,my god!

318
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,469
Oliver!
Help me!

319
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,449
Good one,lois.

320
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,359
YOU ***** HLEP ?

321
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,289
You didn't tell me they were
going to be real thugs!

322
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,439
Well,they kind of made
an impromptu appearance.

323
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,979
Get off!

324
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,739
Get off of me!

325
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,069
Your secret's safe with me,
oliver.

326
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,139
You're,uh...

327
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,849
That's a hell of a thank-you.

328
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,379
Did you just call him
"oliver"?

329
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,309
It was just a hunch.

330
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,089
All right,lana. Are you ready
for your close-up?

331
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,289
I can't believe
this is so easy.

332
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,459
Okay. How are my pearly
megapixels looking?

333
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,649
Crystal clear.

334
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,489
Since we're eavesdropping, can you find
out what else she has on lex and me?

335
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,539
Yeah,sure. Do a little
recon while we're at it.

336
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,849
Chloe,what is it?

337
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,969
Oh,clark.

338
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,809
FARNBOY FROM ANOTHER PLANET

339
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,739
Like tomorrow's headline?

340
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,469
And here I thought your hatred
was just professional jealousy.

341
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,519
Who knew you were covering
such a scandalous secret?

342
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,429
You're actually going to
stake your reputation

343
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,019
on this tabloid garbage that's
not even fit for the inquisitor?

344
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,979
Nobody's going to
believe you.

345
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,669
Oh,of course they will.

346
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,369
I have a very trustworthy
source - you.

347
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,479
And no doubt,if anyone
goes looking for proof,

348
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,059
well,I think
they're going to find it.

349
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,549
But I must say,

350
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,369
I am impressed.

351
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,359
Here you were, sitting on a story that
could have earned you a major headline,

352
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,629
and you chose to protect
your friend instead.

353
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,799
Not a hard decision to make when
you actually care about someone.

354
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,129
It's values like that that keep
your career in the basement.

355
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,869
Don't you just love
the internet?

356
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,409
Do you know

357
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,219
I can be
on every major talk show?

358
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,789
And everyone at youtube will know
that your farm-boy friend is really...

359
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,609
...Alien.

360
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,479
I have a feeling your
credibility might be at stake

361
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,679
when you're locked up
for mike dawson's murder.

362
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,839
Mike dawson drowned.
Do your homework.

363
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,649
It's in every police report.

364
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,659
Most police
aren't from smallville.

365
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,419
You remember smallville,
don't you?

366
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,399
You were a rookie reporter for kscw
who went for the second meteor shower.

367
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,059
Moth got a little too close
to the flame,

368
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,919
and your news van took
a nosedive into crater lake.

369
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,369
My guess is you walked out with
some sort of special ability.

370
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,279
From what I found out, mike dawson
wasn't your first victim,was he?

371
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,749
Nobody likes
an overachiever.

372
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,789
Hey,sullivan!

373
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,309
You want to rise
above sea level,

374
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,189
you better sharpen
those teeth!

375
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,869
Oh,my god!

376
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,429
She came out of nowhere!

377
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,039
It's okay.
She's gone now.

378
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,419
Whoo! Yes!

379
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,959
Hey,how are the secret
adventures of lois and jimmy?

380
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,889
Busted,huh?

381
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,699
Oh,my god.

382
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,639
What happened to your face?

383
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,929
Oh,you should see
the other guy.

384
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,429
Who did that to you?

385
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,779
You can put
your dueling pistol away.

386
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,779
It was just
a workplace scuffle.

387
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,179
You were right about lake.

388
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,019
Looks like we're 2 for 2
tonight,huh?

389
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,479
I want you to be the first one
to take a look at this.

390
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,559
Check it out -

391
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,699
green arrow.

392
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,459
I got real pictures of him -

393
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,779
face and all.

394
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,959
And this one's
not yet rated.

395
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,539
I feel dirty.

396
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,609
Think about
how oliver feels.

397
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,319
Lois and clark put
this whole scheme together

398
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,969
because they thought oliver was
green arrow.

399
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,879
Pow- poor sucker comes around the corner,
catches her sucking lip with leather daddy.

400
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,819
This - this is
the real money shot.

401
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,199
Get ready to meet
the green arrow.

402
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,959
No.
No,no,no,no.

403
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,179
This is not happening.

404
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,599
I had his face
in the cross hairs!

405
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,819
How could he be there one second,
and then just gone like the '90s?

406
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,019
Gone as in faster than a
thousandth-of-a-second shutter speed?

407
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,869
Yeah. Weird.

408
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,889
Always thought he was supercool.
I didn't realize he was superhuman.

409
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,089
Clark.

410
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,419
What's going on?

411
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,249
Uh,lois was just telling me about
her exciting night last night.

412
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,119
I don't know where you
disappeared to last night,

413
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,479
but it turns out
I was wrong about oliver.

414
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,139
He's not the green arrow!
Can you believe that?

415
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,949
Luckily,oliver showed up
when our hero was still around,

416
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,029
but it looks like you were
way off base about him.

417
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:48,169
And the craziest part is he
chucked a guy across an alley,right?

418
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,939
Oh,yeah.

419
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,359
And then supersped away.

420
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,949
I mean,who does that?

421
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,419
It's a good thing oliver showed up
when he did. Then you know for sure.

422
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,519
Oh,she knew
before he showed up.

423
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,509
You did?

424
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,999
Ask her how.

425
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,619
How?

426
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,919
I kissed him.

427
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,009
Isn't that romantic?

428
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,779
Oh,I'm sorry,lois.
Finish the story.

429
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,289
This is the best part.

430
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,319
Well,he was holding me
in his arms.

431
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,439
And ollie's a good kisser -
don't get me wrong -

432
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,429
but that green arrow,he could
teach ollie a thing or two.

433
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,109
Hey.

434
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,379
You took off early
last night.

435
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,969
You okay?

436
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,389
I just keep running
what happened through my head.

437
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,489
Lana,
you can't blame yourself.

438
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,489
It wasn't your fault.

439
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,139
That part
I'm pretty clear on.

440
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,199
Look,nobody wanted to
see her die,

441
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,039
but if you hadn't come when you did, it
would have been my obit on the front page.

442
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,119
Maybe.

443
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,519
Of section D.

444
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,059
Anyway,um,
thank you again.

445
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,169
How do you do that?

446
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,409
Just brush it under the rug
as if nothing happened?

447
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,259
Lana,linda wasn't the first
freak of nature who went psycho.

448
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,439
No.

449
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,379
I mean whatever it is
you're protecting about clark.

450
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,759
I don't know
what you're talking about.

451
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,069
Yes,you do.

452
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,419
Some secret about a farm boy

453
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,699
made you take a hammer to her
computer before I could hear the rest.

454
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,729
Come on,chloe.
I'm not that naive.

455
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,459
Whatever it is you two
have been hiding,

456
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,539
do you really expect me
to keep looking the other way?

457
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,689
Linda was grasping
at straws.

458
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,689
She's always desperate for her next
story. You know that better than anyone.

459
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,309
Lana...

460
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,319
...I would never do anything
to hurt you.

461
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,199
That's what clark
always says.

462
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,669
Sorry that you had to find out
like this.

463
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,289
It's okay.

464
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,109
You don't have to tell me every
little detail of your life anymore.

465
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,589
Clark,we both know that a
proposal is more than a little ...

466
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,679
detail.

467
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,229
And as messed up
as it is...

468
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,929
...you were the first person
that I wanted to tell.

469
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,779
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

470
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,059
Clark,you said that you
didn't love me anymore,

471
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,859
and I tried to cut everything
off, but I'm not made that way.

472
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,039
Even if we're not talking,

473
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,159
you are still a part
of my life,

474
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,749
and I'm not trying to
deny it anymore.

475
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,789
I'm trying to put it
into perspective.

476
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,469
I guess we both
need to do that.

477
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,229
Chloe said that you came by
to talk to me.

478
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,549
What was it about?

479
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,829
Whatever secret chloe is helping
you to protect,clark...

480
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,089
...please,just once...

481
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,619
...just trust me.

482
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,899
It doesn't matter now.

483
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,939
Clark,don't do that.

484
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,759
I know about the baby.

485
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,939
Lex told me.

486
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,259
Everything's changed.

487
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,459
Even the fact that you told me
that you look back at the past

488
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,729
and regret it every day?

489
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,829
Has that changed,too?

490
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,999
I guess that I can't ask you
to see me the same way.

491
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,299
Lana.

492
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,899
I hope lex makes you
very happy.

493
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,029
A million dollars
for your thoughts.

494
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,089
Sorry.

495
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,589
My comic timing is the first
to go after my nerves.

496
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,759
You know,in all my life,
I've...

497
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,599
I've never made an offer
when I was afraid of the answer.

498
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,869
Till now.

499
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,619
You've been so patient.

500
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,699
Doesn't feel like it.

501
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,579
I went to see clark.

502
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,539
And?

503
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,029
And I love him.

504
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,979
I love both of you.

505
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,189
And maybe I always will.

506
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,599
Lex,I couldn't say yes to you knowing
that I might look back with regrets.

507
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,199
You deserve better
than that.

508
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,409
Lana,with the life
I've led,

509
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,769
I go to bed praying every night
that I don't get what I deserve.

510
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,999
You get bitter...

511
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,469
and vengeful.

512
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,059
And then you meet someone

513
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,109
who's so good...

514
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,589
...that she might be the one
person who could learn to love you.

515
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,679
I would wait forever
for that.

516
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,189
You don't have to.

00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,359
I'm done looking back.

518
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,479
I have someone
right in front of me

519
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,079
who I know trusts me...

520
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,979
...and who lets me see sides
of him no one else does.

521
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,429
So just
for clarification...

522
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,699
yes,lex luthor.

523
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,659
