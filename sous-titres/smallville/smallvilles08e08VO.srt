1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,785
Previously on smallville...

2
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:04,319
clark, i'm happy you're in my life.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,523
Well, i'm happy to
be in your life, kara.

4
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:09,897
Kara never came back
from krypton, did she?

5
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:12,743
- you'll never see her again.
- you killed her.

6
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:15,668
Oh, no, something much worse.

7
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:19,048
We all have some part of us that
we hold underneath the surface.

8
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,354
Even i do.

9
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,757
If this is because of brainiac,
then we don't know what can happen!

10
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:26,184
This is my life. I'm
choosing to look at this as a gift.

11
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,958
It was stolen.

12
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:30,590
Only a handful of people
knew about that device.

13
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:33,163
When i find out who has
it, i'm taking it back.

14
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:40,249
Where did you go?

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,298
A place i never want to go again.

16
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,231
Lois.

17
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:56,812
Handle with care, smallville.

18
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,123
I've had those albums since i was 10.

19
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:01,714
What could i possibly want
with your def leppard anthology?

20
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:03,130
I'm taking you up on your offer.

21
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,468
Just like old times... you,
me, "guitar hero" weekends.

22
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,136
I'm moving in.

23
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,123
Really?

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,516
Uh, you didn't like it here. Remember?

25
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:16,452
The rooster woke you up every morning.

26
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:19,146
Yeah, but at least the
rooster only crows once.

27
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,924
You try sharing walls with
pre-wedding chloe and jimmy.

28
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,018
I didn't need to know that.

29
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:26,799
But you think it's a good idea
that we live and work together?

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,770
Carpooler's dream.

31
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:32,458
Come on. What's the worst
thing that could happen...

32
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,767
i'd see you in your snoopy boxers?

33
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,240
Oh, i, uh, found this on your doorstep.

34
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:41,624
Guess ma kent is still gonna
make you, uh, care packages.

35
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,527
I think she put lead in the cookies.

36
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,239
There's no return address. That's weird.

37
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,060
What's the funky paperweight for?

38
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,066
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,911
At least it came with batteries.

40
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,351
Lois, get away!

41
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,828
Run! Get out!

42
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,359
Smallville, just drop it!

43
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:41,263
Smallville 808

44
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:46,447
Synchro : Flolo

45
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,447
For seriessub.com

46
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:30,382
hello? Lois?

47
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:34,434
Can you remind me again why
we're moving stuff you never use?

48
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,393
Not exactly the bachelor
pad i had imagined.

49
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:09,199
Is clark expecting you, or is this
another one of your daily break-ins?

50
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,179
You keep holding on tight
to that grudge, chloe.

51
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,445
What's with all the broken glass?

52
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,982
Is everything okay?

53
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,721
Everything except for the
bird that flew into the window.

54
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,118
Bird?

55
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:31,834
All that brainpower, and
that's what you come up with.

56
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,430
It was a large bird.

57
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:41,120
In fact, lois and clark are out
buying a new pane as we speak.

58
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:47,142
Where's the crystal?

59
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:49,480
You're still looking for that thing?

60
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,583
Because i can assure you
that no nasa-caliber rock

61
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,754
is just gonna pop up in
some innocuous cornfield.

62
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,310
Actually, that's exactly what it did.

63
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,955
My frequency generator
recorded an energy surge

64
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,546
about two inches from
where you're standing.

65
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:12,558
Well, i can't speak on behalf
of your "frequency generator,"

66
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:17,990
but on behalf of logic, clark's
the copyboy in your newspaper.

67
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:20,954
What would he would want
with some supercomputer?

68
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,994
More appropriately, what do
you want with clark kent, hmm?

69
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,031
Look at you.

70
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,221
So eager to cover his tracks.

71
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,364
Blind loyalty can be dangerous, chloe.

72
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:43,595
That means a lot coming from
the protege of lex luthor.

73
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,352
Lois.

74
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,326
Lois!

75
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,014
Are you okay?

76
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:44,444
Where are we?

77
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:48,077
Let's get you up.

78
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,533
What the hell?

79
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:56,399
Look, i'm no astronomy major, but i thought
there was only supposed to be one sun in the sky.

80
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,670
Come on. We got to keep moving.

81
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,624
Clark, i don't think you understand.

82
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,500
- we're not on earth.
- that's impossible, lois.

83
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,653
How many spaceships does
a girl need to stumble upon

84
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,062
to convince you that
there are aliens among us?

85
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,362
Clark, we've been abducted!

86
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,712
Venezuela? When does he land?

87
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,067
Okay, can you have oliver
call me immediately?

88
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,117
It's urgent. Thanks.

89
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,786
Um, this a bad time?

90
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,880
It's just one of those days

91
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,977
when i feel like my friends
have left the planet.

92
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:42,147
Um, can i actually
call you a little later?

93
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,962
I, uh, remember what you said.

94
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,420
I don't mean to violate
your no-fly zone, but...

95
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,006
my blackouts are getting worse.

96
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:51,949
Are you okay?

97
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,048
I thought if i could
find my birth parents,

98
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:58,519
they'd answer some questions, but i'm starting
to feel like i just fell out of the sky.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,591
I highly doubt that. Here,
let me see what you brought me.

100
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:05,173
That is my life story. That's a list
of all known schools and foster homes.

101
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,833
Jones, webber, pearson,
vogal, mcbride, moss.

102
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,760
I mean, i know you
leapfrogged homes as a kid,

103
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,472
but your family tree is
more like the redwood forest.

104
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:20,265
The problem is i can't find anything
on the first three years of my life.

105
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:22,590
That is weird.

106
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,858
Yeah, so, um...

107
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:28,439
how about it, chloe? Do you want
to dust off your reporter's hat

108
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,017
and help a guy out?

109
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,990
Come on, lois. You're
doing great. Keep moving.

110
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,103
At least somebody thinks so.

111
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,952
We've been hoofing it for hours.
My legs feel like two-ton barbells.

112
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:46,797
Something tells me that
standing still isn't a good idea.

113
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,187
Right, because you've been here before?

114
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,020
Let's move.

115
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:52,770
Lois!

116
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,198
Come on!

117
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:57,827
Lois!

118
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,875
What is that thing?!

119
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,836
Stay back.

120
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:10,471
Zoners.

121
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:15,150
I don't want to die here, clark!

122
00:09:15,243 --> 00:09:17,958
All we have to do is keep an
eye out for each other, okay?

123
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,370
- we'll be fine.
- we're not fine.

124
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,810
We're standing on our graves!

125
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:25,555
We're gonna die, us together.

126
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,438
- no more farmhouse, no more daily planet!
- listen to me!

127
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:29,945
Listen to me.

128
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:34,163
No one's gonna mess with
lois and clark, right?

129
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,667
They better not.

130
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,049
- let's keep moving.
- okay.

131
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,804
Lois!

132
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,744
Kara?

133
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,872
It's me.

134
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:07,196
Kal-el.

135
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:23,607
I should have known that
brainiac put you here.

136
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:29,842
Kara, are you okay?

137
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,645
I thought you were zoners.

138
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,383
Zoners kill.

139
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,340
For the blood.

140
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:46,754
They can smell it.

141
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,818
What were you thinking
bringing lois here?

142
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,256
Lois was there when
i touched the crystal.

143
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:02,043
We need to find a portal back.

144
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,885
I did.

145
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,449
Zor-el built me an escape hatch.

146
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,325
If you know a way out,
then why are you still here?

147
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,000
I didn't want to make the
same mistake that you did.

148
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,363
Zoners got out when you left.

149
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,084
They're just waiting for
me to open the portal again.

150
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:25,343
So you stayed here all this time,

151
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,065
fending for your life to protect earth?

152
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,560
Your lifeline.

153
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,393
You lose it, you die.

154
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,261
She better be able to fight.

155
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,625
She won't have to.
We're sending her back.

156
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,716
How many innocent lives
is she worth to you?

157
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,032
Why are you acting like this?

158
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:53,797
What happened to you, kara?

159
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:57,585
The same thing that would have happened to
you had you been here for more than a day.

160
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:01,028
The portal stays closed.

161
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,935
She doesn't belong here!

162
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,307
She's not one of us, kara.

163
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,691
I'll guard the gate,
but she's going home!

164
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:11,255
Oh, my god.

165
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:12,820
Kara.

166
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,874
They've abducted you, too?

167
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:45,419
You know, oliver, for a
guy with three cellphones,

168
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,158
you sure are hard to get ahold of.

169
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:49,864
Chloe, hey. You know, the
captain hasn't even turned off

170
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,639
the "fasten seat belt" sign yet.

171
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,221
What warrants this visit
out to the tarmac, huh?

172
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,529
Clark and lois disappeared this morning.

173
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,013
Did you check the planet?

174
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,984
I'm sure they're just out
chasing fire trucks again.

175
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,609
Yeah, i checked everywhere.

176
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,023
I think it has something
to do with this.

177
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:11,984
It's clark's crystal.

178
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,369
It's his link to his
kryptonian heritage.

179
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,611
Yeah.

180
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,606
Look, uh, when it
comes to clark's...that,

181
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,200
i, uh...  i steer clear.

182
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:25,213
I need you to steal a
piece of equipment, oliver.

183
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:29,321
It powers this crystal. Now, i
think that if i can gain access

184
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,540
to the crystal's database, i may
be able to reverse its effects.

185
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:37,264
That's your plan, chloe? You're
gonna hack in to alien technology?

186
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,725
Come on. That's a bit ambitious,
isn't it, even for you?

187
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,862
There is no door number
two. This is my only option.

188
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,937
Well, look, even if that thing is
responsible for their disappearance,

189
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,623
i don't think clark would want you messing
with it, chloe. That stuff is dangerous.

190
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,566
I'm not messing with anything.

191
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,976
I know what i'm doing.

192
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,886
What are you not telling me, huh?

193
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:02,438
I don't have time to explain. Are
you gonna steal the generator or not?

194
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:10,631
All right, who does this fancy
piece of equipment belong to?

195
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,190
Tess mercer.

196
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,118
Mercy?

197
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,215
Well, why didn't you just say so?

198
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,492
So, first kara, then clark and i.

199
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:35,877
It's like the kent farm's
ground zero for alien abductions.

200
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,224
The important thing
is we get out of here.

201
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:43,224
You go ahead with kara.

202
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:46,892
Actually, i think i'll stick
by you and your right hook.

203
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,113
You can't!

204
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:50,602
He's guarding the entrance
so we can open the portal.

205
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,113
It's okay, lois.

206
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:53,984
I'll be right behind you.

207
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,906
You better be!

208
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:24,581
The altar's this way.

209
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,633
This is our delorean?

210
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,663
We just have to touch it.

211
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,394
- clark! He needs us!
- no! He'll be fine.

212
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,017
You have to go.

213
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:15,950
We can't leave yet, kara.
We have to wait for clark.

214
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,853
Lois, there's no time!

215
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,148
Go!

216
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,574
Clark?

217
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,389
Clark.

218
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,909
This'll do.

219
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,179
Well, look who decided
to show up to work today.

220
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,317
Oh, i'm sorry. Am i bothering you?

221
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:56,250
I need to find my son.

222
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:58,922
Your son?

223
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,428
I have to admit, it's difficult to
imagine a mini lois running around.

224
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,372
You mind me asking who the father is?

225
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,744
A great leader... general zod.

226
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:23,785
Our creation arrived here attached
to the kryptonian spacecraft

227
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,747
housing the baby kal-el.

228
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,747
A kryptonian spacecraft.

229
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,047
Well, that makes perfect sense.

230
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:36,385
You know about it?

231
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:37,936
Absolutely.

232
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,337
I can connect you with your son.

233
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,881
Tell me what you know.

234
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,470
A crystal was stolen from me,

235
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:57,078
- diamond-shaped, and i think...
- you want to exploit me?

236
00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,961
Of course not.

237
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,482
We'd be partners.

238
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:05,551
We could combine our resources.

239
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:08,990
You're lying.

240
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,039
You're worthless to me.

241
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,486
Kal-el.

242
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,110
No.

243
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,168
I thought you got out!

244
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:34,070
A wraith escaped.

245
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:39,087
I'll get you out of here.

246
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,256
Open the portal.

247
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:45,566
Get out before more prisoners come.

248
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,983
No, kara. They'll kill you.

249
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:50,263
Kal-el, look at me.

250
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:55,734
It was my destiny to find you and
protect you, not the other way around.

251
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,044
Go.

252
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,021
I'm not going anywhere.

253
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,875
Lois!

254
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:21,801
Are you okay?

255
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,317
I read your articles, chloe sullivan.

256
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:28,635
What do you know about the kryptonian
spacecraft that landed in smallville?

257
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,206
Where's clark?

258
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,065
The man you call clark

259
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,053
will die in the prison
his father created.

260
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,843
What did you do with lois?

261
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,756
I needed her vessel.

262
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:49,932
Not my first choice, but
surprisingly flexible.

263
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:53,213
And you would be...

264
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,016
faora...

265
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:58,126
wife of zod.

266
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,761
Where's my son?

267
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:11,526
Tell me where he is or
suffer the consequences.

268
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,452
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please let me go.

269
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:18,107
You must know more.

270
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:21,361
I can't breathe.

271
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:33,009
Thank you.

272
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,530
So not the night to mess with me.

273
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:20,621
No "hello"? No "how are ya?"

274
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:22,945
What do you know about the crystal?

275
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:25,976
That depends. How good is your shot?

276
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:29,623
- who do you work for?
- i'm self-employed.

277
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,013
It's sort of an
occupational safety hazard.

278
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,672
Well, then you know that getting blood

279
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:37,355
out of leather can be a total bitch.

280
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,297
Don't worry. You can't move
now, but in a couple of minutes,

281
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,767
you'll be back to your
normal, cuddly, charming self.

282
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,908
Excuse me, miss? This
area is restricted.

283
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:29,791
Please.

284
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,523
That's my son.

285
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:37,187
There you go, and now all your
friends are gonna be envious.

286
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:39,103
High five. Yeah!

287
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:42,130
Okay. Now she's gonna have
to find your dad, okay?

288
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:45,112
You helped him.

289
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:48,005
Hey. What are you doing here, lois?

290
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,979
I might ask you that question.

291
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:56,008
Is everything okay?

292
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,408
I don't understand.

293
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,264
All that human carnage.

294
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,008
Is that not your doing?

295
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:08,192
Maybe we need to find you a doctor.

296
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:12,271
All i need is you, my son.

297
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:18,344
Mother's here.

298
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:24,889
Phantom zone, huh?

299
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,109
Seriously, who names these things?

300
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,378
Picture an alien alcatraz,
and if i don't bail clark out soon,

301
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,571
who knows what kind of havoc
lo-bot will leave in her wake.

302
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:34,717
Yeah.

303
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:38,131
That still doesn't explain how you're
hacking in to that crystal,

304
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:40,323
chloe, it's not hooked up to anything.
There's no computer here.

305
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:42,347
Do i tell you how to shoot your arrows?

306
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,765
I don't think so. Stay back.

307
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,043
Chloe?

308
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,199
Chloe, you're bleeding.

309
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,852
All right, you know what?
Chloe, we're done here!

310
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,044
Kara? You have to stay strong.

311
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:41,817
Look.

312
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,894
- take my blood.
- no.

313
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:51,186
It'll open the portal
and take you home, okay?

314
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,722
You are my home.

315
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:56,396
Do you hear me?

316
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,929
You're my family.

317
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,528
You make me feel like i actually belong.

318
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:15,947
Kara, grab my hand!

319
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,652
Please.

320
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:20,653
Kara, i can't let you die here!

321
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,693
You're meant for more than to rot away
in the phantom zone.

322
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,869
Please.

323
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:00,565
Chloe.

324
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:02,944
Are you okay?

325
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:04,704
I'm fine.

326
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,557
- chloe, what did you do?
- it doesn't matter.

327
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:11,640
You're safe now, and i see you
snuck something through customs.

328
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:14,028
Where's lois? Have you
seen her? Is she all right?

329
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:17,349
Far from it. She was
infected by something.

330
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,606
Does the name faora ring any bells?

331
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:22,440
Strong, quick, hater of man?

332
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,801
Zod's wife.

333
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:25,064
Yeah.

334
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,867
The wraith that escaped.

335
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:31,124
I need you to go to metropolis
police department. Find john jones.

336
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:33,364
Ask him for his crystal.
He'll know what you mean.

337
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:34,758
Hey, clark, just a heads-up...

338
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,545
lois has all of your abilities
without any of your inhibitions.

339
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,956
Don't worry.

340
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,111
I can handle lois.

341
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,918
Here...  this won't sober you up,

342
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:59,407
but it'll help clear away the cobwebs.

343
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,194
You don't recognize me...

344
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:07,408
but you are the spitting
image of your father.

345
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:10,046
Okay.

346
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:13,994
Lois, you got to reason with me.
What kind of drugs did you take...

347
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:17,525
pills, powder, paste?
Don't tell me you injected anything.

348
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:20,918
You don't know who you are.

349
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:23,450
You experience blackouts?

350
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:26,943
Hours of your life mysteriously lost?

351
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,614
Your body's still evolving.

352
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,478
Okay, um...

353
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,722
how do you know that?

354
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:38,628
Before we were phantoms,

355
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,675
zod and i were unable to have children.

356
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,653
So we created you.

357
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,486
You, uh, created me...

358
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:52,064
you arrived here as genetic matter,

359
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,503
containing our planet's
most powerful life-forms...

360
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,145
so that, in time,

361
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:02,945
you would evolve to become
earth's ultimate destroyer.

362
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,668
I drive an ambulance.

363
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,896
The duty of a child

364
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,576
is to continue the legacy

365
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:19,509
his parents began.

366
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,721
Our family is meant to
take this planet as our own.

367
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:30,235
And after seeing you with these humans,

368
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:34,076
i realize that you are still
too weak to fulfill your destiny.

369
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:04,490
Trust me, my son.

370
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:08,444
That which kills you makes you stronger.

371
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:16,555
I'll be back when you're ready.

372
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,375
I've been looking for you.

373
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:40,784
You're too late, kal-el.

374
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:49,687
Zod may be gone, but our
creation will destroy your world.

375
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,078
Lois, i know you're in there.

376
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:55,600
Remind me, kal-el...

377
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:59,404
did jor-el and lara
come looking for you?

378
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:02,294
Of course not.

379
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:05,395
They didn't love you like i love my son.

380
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,701
This is all my fault, lois.

381
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:10,905
I'm sorry.

382
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:15,341
You have feelings for
this creature i inhabit.

383
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,128
Like father, like son.

384
00:31:38,086 --> 00:31:39,589
Lois, stop.

385
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,589
Lois can't hear you.

386
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:09,534
Does that mean she's okay?

387
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:11,224
I don't know.

388
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,273
I hope so.

389
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:42,679
I just came from tess.

390
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:44,594
I got a raise.

391
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,039
Why would she give you a raise?

392
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,123
Because i'm me. Hello.

393
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,460
Right, but...

394
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:57,330
it feels kind of random, doesn't it?

395
00:32:57,331 --> 00:32:59,010
Aw, hang in there, smallville.

396
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,018
You just have to pay your
dues until the boss sees

397
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,280
that you can photocopy
like the best of them.

398
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:06,093
- did you see tess yesterday?
- beats me.

399
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:09,858
All i remember is touching that rock,
having some "arabian nights" acid trip,

400
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,464
and waking up very confused.

401
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:13,593
It was pretty intense
hallucination, even for you.

402
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:16,607
- so i passed out, just like that?
- it was probably a blood-sugar thing.

403
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:20,036
Lois, the best part about you living
at the farm is i can keep an eye on you.

404
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,772
Yeah, about that...

405
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:26,192
change of plans.

406
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:29,541
Nothing against you. It's just this
raise means i can afford a place,

407
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,531
you know, without farm animals.

408
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:36,026
Does this have anything to
dowith the hallucination you had?

409
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:38,680
Yeah, right. It was a dream.

410
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,538
It's called make-believe.

411
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:43,618
What other reality stars you
as my knight in shining armor?

412
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,517
I was your knight in shining armor?

413
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,715
Like i said, "crazy."

414
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:52,805
Kent.

415
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:55,776
Miss mercer wants to see you.

416
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:18,377
I shouldn't have underestimated lois.

417
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,868
She really blew me away yesterday.

418
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:25,843
- so you did see her.
- you know, just when i thought

419
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,796
she couldn't get an
interesting bone in her body,

420
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,775
she starts going on about
a kryptonian spacecraft

421
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:33,451
carrying someone called kal-el?

422
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,487
Well, she hit her head.
She was hallucinating.

423
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:45,080
I'm sure chloe told you
that i stopped by your farm?

424
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:55,004
It's a hell of a muddy
driveway you got there.

425
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:01,466
You were the last one to
see lex alive, weren't you?

426
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:12,533
This was taken in the arctic.

427
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,389
If the boot fits...

428
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,133
a lot of people have work boots.

429
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,076
You don't think i was in the
arctic based on these pictures.

430
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,830
I think there's a lot more to clark kent

431
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,113
that even clark kent
doesn't want to admit.

432
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:32,823
A farmer turned journalist...
not a very interesting story

433
00:35:32,824 --> 00:35:35,854
i know that you're hiding
something about his disappearance.

434
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:39,771
And i can't wait for the day when you
realize that you and i are on the same side

435
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:43,038
and that maybe it's not in your
best interests to lie to your boss.

436
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,999
If you want to fire me,
miss mercer, go ahead.

437
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,175
I have nothing more
to tell you about this.

438
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,396
Clark, i don't want to fire you.

439
00:35:57,928 --> 00:35:59,890
I want to trust you.

440
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:05,526
And i want to know why lex didn't.

441
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:13,113
In time, i'm sure the
truth will reveal itself.

442
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:34,094
Hallmark didn't have any, uh,
"welcome back to earth" cards, so...

443
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:35,588
oliver.

444
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,334
It's nice to see everyone
has a key to this place.

445
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:40,559
I spoke to chloe.

446
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,648
She said if it wasn't for you, i
probably wouldn't be here right now.

447
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:46,026
Thanks.

448
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:53,914
Actually, uh, if it wasn't for
chloe tweaking into a supercomputer,

449
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,581
you wouldn't be here right now.

450
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,155
Her eyes turned white,

451
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:00,812
and then she, uh... with
one hand, mind you...

452
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,812
pushed me into the other room.

453
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:05,894
So, uh, what happened to her?

454
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:09,286
It's brainiac... he
infected her somehow.

455
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:12,080
- what are you doing about this?
- everything i can.

456
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:15,699
I've tried to talk to her,
but i can't control her life.

457
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,281
Her life? It's not her
life anymore, clark.

458
00:37:18,282 --> 00:37:20,018
She's living yours.

459
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:23,856
Chloe's knee-deep in
these situations that...

460
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:27,928
pardon the expression, but
humans just don't understand.

461
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,157
As her best friend...

462
00:37:33,278 --> 00:37:35,541
make her stop before she gets hurt.

463
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:00,284
Looks like someone's got cold feet.

464
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,352
He's not even at the frozen tundra yet.

465
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:07,461
After what this crystal
did to lois and i,

466
00:38:07,462 --> 00:38:10,059
there's no way i can trust
it to rebuild the fortress.

467
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:17,354
So, did your adventure with loisend
with you telling her your secret?

468
00:38:17,744 --> 00:38:19,322
Not exactly.

469
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,513
All i ever wanted was to
keep lois away from my secret.

470
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:27,180
But yesterday, that
nearly got her killed.

471
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,438
You want your cousin's two cents?

472
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,807
Lois can handle it.

473
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:38,749
She's tough...

474
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:40,765
and strong.

475
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:45,606
You wouldn't have let her get so
close if you didn't think so, too.

476
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:53,413
I was beginning to miss
these family lectures.

477
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:05,108
I'm leaving smallville.

478
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:07,885
Kara, you just got back.

479
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:10,894
When i was in that hellhole,

480
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,246
i heard rumors that kandor still exists.

481
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:18,452
Kal-el, i think that a
part of our civilization

482
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:20,350
may have survived before the explosion.

483
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:24,201
If i can find that city,
i can save our bloodline.

484
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:28,943
Then i'll go with you.

485
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:32,035
Kal-el, there is a reason
that you were sent to earth

486
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,626
and raised as a member
of the kent family.

487
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:37,001
Your path is on earth,

488
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:40,614
living amongst the humans
and inspiring mankind.

489
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:42,492
Kara, we can do all of this together.

490
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:43,851
We can't.

491
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:46,011
I don't fit in here.

492
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:49,216
My journey is somewhere else.

493
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:00,613
I'm gonna miss you.

494
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,140
See?

495
00:40:14,902 --> 00:40:16,761
You're always with me,

496
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,606
close to my heart.

497
