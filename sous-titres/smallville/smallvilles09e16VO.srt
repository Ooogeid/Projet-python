1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,018
Previously on smallville.

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:04,770
<i>Just listen.
That's when you let go.</i>

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:10,660
Doctor fate's final act was to restore
my martian abilities.

4
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:13,982
So I will continue to protect
and serve using every tool I've got.

5
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:17,685
This blood confirms my suspicions.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,459
These things are alien.

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,718
I need a blood sample analyzed.

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,110
- You're the one they call watchtower.
- Who are you?

9
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,448
They came after us. They'll come after
all of you.

10
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,469
- Check.
- Check what?!

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,417
Agent mercer.
We have a lot to catch up on.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,763
There's an army of heroes growing.

13
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:45,502
Someone's collecting them.

14
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,664
It's just a question of who.

15
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:50,859
Welcome to the suicide squad.

16
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:22,462
You could use
some conflict resolution.

17
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,142
Rule number one...
You don't shoot your date.

18
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,791
Rule number two. Think
about your wardrobe choices.

19
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,021
You're one to talk.

20
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:33,382
Don't get me wrong. I love black on
black. It's really hard to pull off.

21
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:34,959
It's easier than you think.

22
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,481
And rule number three...

23
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,515
You got to know
when to say good night.

24
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,686
Checkmate.

25
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,923
Smallville - 9x16 - Checkmate

26
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:18,218
Synchro: Flolo

00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,880
SeriesSub.com/Sous-Titres. eu

28
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:13,351
- did you try the power switch?
- Didn't you see my texts? 

29
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,373
I lost oliver. He was tracking
some armed men,

30
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,942
followed them under the monorail,

31
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,268
then it was like
a massive mute button went on...

32
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,713
- No radio, no beacon, nothing.
- I'm sure it's fine.

33
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:23,712
Just because he doesn't check in...

34
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,551
unlike some people, oliver actually
follows protocol.

35
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:29,156
- What protocol?
- Exactly.

36
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,357
He and everyone else dial in
with watchtower while they're on patrol.

37
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,613
You spend so much time
watching everybody else's back,

38
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,087
you forget that we need to watch
each other's backs, too.

39
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,925
This isn't about us. Did you
check the local security cameras?

40
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,239
Every surveillance feed is down. Atms,
traffic lights, convenience stores.

41
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:49,635
It's like someone threw a big
blanket over the whole area.

42
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:57,649
You fixed it.

43
00:07:57,774 --> 00:08:00,343
Or whoever did this
finished what they started.

44
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:06,828
- Where is that?
- That's where I saw oliver last.

45
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,740
Your buddy system works.

46
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:18,121
I didn't call him.

47
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,587
What are you doing here?

48
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,653
Looking for any sign of oliver.

49
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,345
You didn't know he was missing?

50
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:48,694
He was here on patrol
when watchtower lost contact.

51
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,170
I'm here on police business.

52
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:52,905
But I'll keep an eye out.

53
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,805
It'll be faster if we work together.

54
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,735
Unless you've already
found something.

55
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,040
You need to trust me, clark.

56
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,420
You first.

57
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:18,599
What do you know, john?

58
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,992
You shouldn't have done that, clark.

59
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,574
Radio ahead.

60
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,735
We're 20 minutes to the airfield.

61
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,918
Stand down, agent mercer.

62
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,132
You know the rules.

63
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,647
You don't have clearance
to peek under the hood.

64
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,884
I was just making sure that our
acquisition was still secure.

65
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,186
I'm sure you were.

66
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,083
Congratulations.

67
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,901
You were able to re-engage
so quickly after being dormant

68
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,488
so long.

69
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,880
Dismissed.

70
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:56,613
Green arrow, welcome to checkmate.

71
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,865
I think you've got
the wrong green arrow.

72
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,459
I don't remember signing up
for any chess club.

73
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,704
You are a guest
of the u. s. Government.

74
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:10,032
And the time has come for you
to do your patriotic duty.

75
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,213
Yeah, I didn't know uncle sam
was into drugs and bondage.

76
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,181
Kind of gives a whole new meaning to
the "i want you" posters, doesn't it?

77
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,510
I'm sorry you think
these tactics are crude.

78
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,644
But I fear
for our country's security.

79
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,022
That's why I'm recruiting
capable people like you.

80
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:26,798
Recruitment?

81
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,952
I got to tell you, t feels more like
kidnapping than a booth at a job fair.

82
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,997
Call it what you want.

83
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:35,033
But it's time you elevated
your service to your country.

84
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:38,127
You have a long plane ride
coming to think it over.

85
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:58,247
What do you want?

86
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:01,041
I'm afraid
you've made a critical error.

87
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,199
I believe this is yours.

88
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,532
Tell me the location
of checkmate's headquarters.

89
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:17,200
The place you call the castle.

90
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:18,672
Who are you working for?

91
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:22,591
Someone who will not hesitate
to expose your double life.

92
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:28,679
Clearly, you are rusty.

93
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,912
You think I didn't know
the second we lost him?

94
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:37,533
Did you properly secure
the detainee?

95
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,297
He had a hidden lock pick.

96
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,128
The correct answer is

97
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:49,257
"no, I did not properly secure
the detainee"!

98
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,288
I'm disappointed, tess.

99
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,359
Green arrow
may not have been the endgame,

100
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,927
but he was our opening move.

101
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,945
I can get him back.

102
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,488
I'll set a new net myself.

103
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:14,772
You skipped...
A few check-ins...

104
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:17,196
The last few years.

105
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,668
Maybe your loyalties lie
with someone else.

106
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,866
I swear...

107
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,698
I am fully committed to checkmate.

108
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:31,570
You better be.

109
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,293
Or you're out.

110
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,269
And we both know
there is only one way out.

111
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:57,304
Seems to be taking longer than normal
to find an earwig serial number.

112
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,944
That's because someone's hidden it

113
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,254
but after cross-referencing
those last four digits,

114
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,331
I think that the earpiece
in john's pocket was government-issued.

115
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,936
Why would the government
take green arrow?

116
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:10,302
Considering what I pay out every year,
it better not be for tax evasion.

117
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:13,566
Oh, my god.
You're safe.

118
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,807
Of course I'm safe.

119
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,283
I'm glad you're safe, too.

120
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,278
You want to fill us in
on what happened?

121
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:29,013
- Definitely.
- Absolutely. So, let's see.

122
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,360
One minute, I am
saving someone's bacon.

123
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:33,963
Next thing I know, I'm the
only pig on a pork-chop express.

124
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:35,832
Some harpy gets on a monitor.

125
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:38,388
She starts telling me
this is the welcome wagon

126
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:40,603
and she's recruiting heroes
for the u. s. Of a.

127
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,477
- I'm guessing you didn't get the evite.
- No, Someone else did.

128
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,190
And that explains why john jones
was covering for them.

129
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,401
Did this woman give you her name?

130
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,866
No name.

131
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:54,110
Wait a minute...
Check... Mate?

132
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,186
When sylvester pemberton
from the justice society

133
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,779
was murdered, he warned me that,

134
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:00,837
<i>"they came after us,
and they'll come after you."</i>

135
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,811
His dying word was "check."

136
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:06,183
If he meant "checkmate," these are
the same people who took down the jsa.

137
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,492
I searched
the archived security footage

138
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:10,967
that was taken from the cameras
across the city.

139
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,026
This was taken a few hours ago.

140
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,745
That was right after
I confronted him. Who's he talking to?

141
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,546
We got a hit
from the passport agency.

142
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,414
Edward lott.

143
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,254
He's the c. e.o. Of a
consumer manufacturing company.

144
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,653
He seems pretty high-profile
for a secret-agent man.

145
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:33,718
Maybe they recruit people that are
established in the private sector.

146
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:35,498
Or plant them there.

147
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:40,329
You're not gonna be happy
where he was planted next.

148
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,766
Within an hour
after this footage was taken,

149
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,604
he was on the list
of metropolis general morgue.

150
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:52,955
Slow down, guys. You can't think
john murdered this guy. Come on, now.

151
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,812
Clark, I'll come with you.
I can...

152
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:58,195
support onsite.

153
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:00,913
Looks like you got benched.

154
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:05,228
Sylvester pemberton came
to warn me about checkmate

155
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,090
the moment
that he was attacked by...

156
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,782
Icicle.

157
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:13,362
Either that's quaintly coincidental
or he's working for the same lovely lady

158
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,677
whose gaze
wilts small trees. What do you think?

159
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,924
Last I heard, he was
in the psych ward at met gen.

160
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:19,836
Let's go.

161
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,803
You know, oliver...

162
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,641
Now that green arrow is
officially on checkmate's radar,

163
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,710
I think it might be a good idea for you
to just hang your tights for one night.

164
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,123
Go civilian.

165
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:32,902
They're not tights.

166
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:35,293
They're not tights.

167
00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:38,420
But I see your point.
Yeah.

168
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:39,822
Unfortunately for me,

169
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:43,282
that means attending a luthorcorp
shareholder dinner, which...

170
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,118
Yeah, i'd rather be shot at.

171
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,384
I was just gonna say
be careful out there, 'cause it...

172
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,947
There's checkmate agents
everywhere, so...

173
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,846
Be careful.

174
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:17,717
You're late.

175
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:22,660
If you know what's good for you,
don't start.

176
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,768
<i>Whatever kind of day
you think you've had,</i>

177
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,667
trust me, I've had it in spades.

178
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,920
What happened?
The jet late leaving paris?

179
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:35,496
- The beluga not the right temperature?
- That's very, very funny.

180
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,686
You might want to save
the song-and-dance routine

181
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,298
for the shareholders
when you try to explain to them,

182
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:43,181
the sketchy deal
with china. It's terrible.

183
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,030
So that's what got you out
of bed before the dinner bell.

184
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:50,309
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Barely had time to change clothes.

185
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:51,922
I can tell.

186
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,538
Black on black.

187
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,654
That's hard to pull off.

188
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,692
It's easier than you think.

189
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:12,906
Green arrow.

190
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:32,081
Thank you for coming,
detective jones.

191
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,834
You know who I am.

192
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:38,444
Don't be so naive.

193
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,747
Where's the rest of your team?

194
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,900
I came alone.

195
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:45,808
All for the better.

196
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,435
I was hoping I would get
the chance to enlist you.

197
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:53,640
But I have the feeling
somebody already has...

198
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:57,877
Somebody with
a very high level of intel.

199
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,576
You came for what's in there,
didn't you?

200
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:09,285
That doesn't belong to you.

201
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:13,590
That blood traveled light-years
to get here.

202
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,338
And it's foreshadowing a threat

203
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,665
we will not take lightly.

204
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:23,546
Your preparations for war
are unnecessary.

205
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,648
You're simply reacting out of fear.

206
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,273
Fear?

207
00:22:28,396 --> 00:22:30,874
Fear is what prompts us
to protect ourselves.

208
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:36,133
And studying fear gives us
insight to others' phobias.

209
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,191
A police detective
who won't go near fire.

210
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:50,076
Makes it hard to protect
and serve, doesn't it?

211
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,838
Excuse me.
Those are my charts.

212
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:05,615
Dr. Brenner.
I was looking for you.

213
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,005
You were the evaluating doctor
on several patients

214
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,821
who came through
the psych ward in met gen who were

215
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:12,721
- Special.
- Unless you are

216
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:15,616
directly related, i'm afraid
I can't discuss patient information.

217
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:17,967
None of them
actually made it to belle reve

218
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,369
<i>after you signed off
on their transfer,</i>

219
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:22,104
including cameron mahkent.

220
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:23,694
Once I sign off,

221
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,688
those people belong to belle reve.
Why don't you take it up with them?

222
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:30,212
That's the thing. Belle reve was never
even notified that they were coming.

223
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,473
Look, young lady,

224
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:35,841
if you don't leave immediately,
I will call security.

225
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,584
No. That's not necessary. I was
just trying to get some answers.

226
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:53,404
I'm sorry.
Perhaps I was a bit abrasive.

227
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,837
It's been a really long day.

228
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,654
I'll tell you what.

229
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,896
Why don't I walk you
down to archives,

230
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,898
and we'll see
if we can't clear this up?

231
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:05,485
That's the bedside manner
they say has been missing.

232
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,252
Please follow me this way
to the dining room.

233
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,300
The only way you'd get me
back in here is by force.

234
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:39,714
Don't flatter yourself.

235
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,450
The best thing I ever did in
this bed was kick you out of it.

236
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:44,552
That's something out of
your mouth I can believe.

237
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:46,454
So it's you...

238
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:49,488
Parading around
in tacky green leather.

239
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,594
It was me.

240
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,633
I can't believe you wear tights.

241
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:57,125
<i>They're not tights.</i>

242
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,866
They're not tights.

243
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,301
<i>They look like tights.</i>

244
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:13,948
You've been keeping more secrets
than lex ever had. Isn't that right?

245
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:17,676
Who knows how many deals
were sealed right here?

246
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,711
You buried an arrow into my chest.

247
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,146
Actually...
It was a taser.

248
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,550
Well, it bruised.

249
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,501
Better bruised than dead.

250
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,503
What, are you crazy?
This isn't a cartoon.

251
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:37,072
You're gonna hurt somebody.

252
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,741
- That's the basic idea.
- All right, then.

253
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,998
- Don't you come near me.
- Stop.

254
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:44,636
Stay out of this, clark.

255
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,712
Our little lady here
is a checkmate agent.

256
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:50,756
- She knows my identity.
- Not just yours.

257
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:53,021
Tess, I need some answers.

258
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,080
<i>I'm not telling you anything.</i>

259
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:57,597
Maybe the view
will change your mind.

260
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,622
Let me down from here!

261
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:07,807
Tell me about checkmate. No lies.

262
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:16,144
A month after I started
working at luthorcorp,

263
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:18,504
I was approached by the white queen.

264
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,414
It's waller's code name.

265
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,878
She wanted information about
lex's alien investigations.

266
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,647
At first, I thought she was crazy.

267
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:26,709
But then lex's files
changed your mind.

268
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,490
After I took over luthorcorp,

269
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:32,360
<i>I saw she knew
a lot more than I did.</i>

270
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:35,563
But I swear. I never told her
the kryptonians were here.

271
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,678
I never told her about you.

272
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,059
I wouldn't believe
your dying breath.

273
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:44,837
None of this should have happened.

274
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,188
Oliver wasn't even the real target.

275
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,857
- <i>Then who was?</i>
- I don't know.

276
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,569
Something they called "watchtower."

277
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:17,444
What the hell do you want?
Round 2?

278
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,262
Oliver, clark's in trouble.

279
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:24,795
If you wanted a rematch,
all you had to do was ask.

280
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,233
I'm serious.

281
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:31,668
He made me tell him where
checkmate's headquarters are

282
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:34,818
after he found out they captured
something called "watchtower."

283
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:44,883
Somebody get in here!
Soldiers! I need your help!

284
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:47,540
Get me out of here!

285
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:49,749
The prisoner overpowered me!

286
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,281
No alarms have been reported yet.

287
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,520
There's no sign of jones.

288
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,074
That's because i'm still here.

289
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,069
I must say, I liked your colors
better when they were more Patriotic.

290
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,429
Kidnapping is illegal...
Even for the government.

291
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:49,097
I don't have time
for polite requests.

292
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:52,139
I have reason to believe
there are aliens among us.

293
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:56,911
They have designs much bigger
than just getting green cards.

294
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:01,140
I need your help.

295
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:02,644
To do what?

296
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,994
Chase down rumors
and u. f.o. Stories?

297
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,373
What if I have proof...
Actual alien blood?

298
00:29:10,993 --> 00:29:13,999
The keystone to world war iii?

299
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,540
Maybe these aliens aren't here
to start a war.

300
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:20,875
<i>If you don't stand with us,
you stand against us.</i>

301
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,750
It's time for you to pick a side.

302
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,935
Maybe this will help
your indecisiveness.

303
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:34,272
Stand ready for immediate orders.

304
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:37,687
Let her go.

305
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:39,915
I'm not being unreasonable.

306
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:43,662
If you step forward,
out of the shadows,

307
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,074
I will let watchtower go.

308
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:55,378
Release her now.

309
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,872
You sure are nice to look at.

310
00:29:58,788 --> 00:30:01,742
But I like to have my cake
and eat it, too.

311
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:07,513
I want your loyalty to checkmate.

312
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,443
Anything happens to me,
and bye-bye, blondie.

313
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,665
I know you're fast.

314
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,162
But you can't stop a bullet when
you don't know where she is.

315
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,035
That would be murder.

316
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,808
It's not murder.
It's strategy.

317
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:27,310
Something you could have used
more of before coming here.

318
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:28,825
What more do you want?

319
00:30:30,922 --> 00:30:34,926
The location of watchtower's
central database.

320
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:39,827
You're after everyone
who's ever worked at watchtower.

321
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:41,986
Names, faces, addresses.

322
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:45,790
The black canary, impulse,
aquaman, cyborg.

323
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:48,331
I need people with the abilities

324
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:50,757
to end the war
quickly and decisively.

325
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:54,809
It's your move.

326
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:10,520
Even if I gave you
watchtower's database,

327
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:12,243
you know i'll come after you.

328
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,257
The blur.

329
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:17,828
He patrols the streets of metropolis,
protecting every citizen he can.

330
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:21,957
But He lets the most valuable ally

331
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,755
fend for herself.

332
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,131
I did not abandon her.

333
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,952
Didn't you?

334
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:30,297
You left your greatest asset
vulnerable.

335
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:35,378
All you have to do to save her life

336
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:37,769
is give one simple address.

337
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,028
Come in, white queen.

338
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:48,696
Come in, white queen.

339
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,119
Showing external power breach.

340
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,357
Am I clear to shoot?
Over.

341
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,768
Boy, am I glad
to see your friendly face.

342
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:58,371
Did you...

343
00:32:58,496 --> 00:32:59,968
No. I didn't tell her anything.

344
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:01,769
At least we have that.

345
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm sorry, chloe.

346
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,870
I'm sorry for everything.

347
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,227
I think we're both a day late
and a dollar short in that department.

348
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,720
But I abandoned you.

349
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:18,224
I keep seeing you on the sidelines
but the truth is, with watchtower,

350
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:20,190
you're right in the middle
of the game.

351
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:22,862
You didn't abandon me.

352
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:25,031
You pushed me out of the way.

353
00:33:25,156 --> 00:33:27,066
Maybe I thought
you'd be safer there.

354
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:29,005
Maybe you just didn't trust me.

355
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:32,538
I've broken your confidence in me.

356
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:35,319
You saw watchtower
as big brother and you turned away.

357
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:38,361
The less you confided in me,
the less you have to depend on me.

358
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:42,238
It's smart... Probably.

359
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:46,355
I didn't give you enough credit.

360
00:33:47,578 --> 00:33:49,588
You're the one
who brought us together.

361
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:52,015
You're the one
who saw our potential.

362
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:59,224
That potential's
gonna be short-lived.

363
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,092
Waller saw our faces and she's
not gonna stop coming after us.

364
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,287
Tell me you caught them.

365
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:23,809
I can't wait to see
the defeat on their faces.

366
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,610
I didn't think you were gonna show.

367
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,260
I figure it's a public place.

368
00:35:01,385 --> 00:35:03,659
There's only so many weapons
you can throw at me.

369
00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:06,780
I'm sorry.

370
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:12,025
For everything I've done
that's destroyed your trust.

371
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,803
I don't think there's enough
stationery for that, tess.

372
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,881
I told you how to shut down
the castle's power grid.

373
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:28,124
That's worth something, isn't it?

374
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:33,862
What am I supposed to do here?
You want me to do,

375
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:37,196
handstands because you helped solve
a problem that you created?

376
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:39,050
I never would have gone after you

377
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:41,597
<i>if I had known
that you were the green arrow.</i>

378
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,056
<i>So, it's back on me?</i>

379
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:48,409
This might be the last time
that I ever see you.

380
00:35:50,663 --> 00:35:53,164
When I joined checkmate,
I took an oath.

381
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:57,626
An oath I want to break.

382
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:00,967
But there's only one way
to leave checkmate.

383
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:20,616
What are you gonna do?

384
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:25,234
I'm gonna go awol.

385
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:28,558
I'm gonna go underground.

386
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:36,873
That's good. I got to ask you
a question, though.

387
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:39,402
Did it hurt to do something
moral for once?

388
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:41,203
Did it hurt you?

389
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,580
I'm taking a chance just being
out here with you in the open.

390
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,736
I understand that.
We've gotten that far.

391
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:53,844
What is it that you want? You're asking
me for something. What do you want?

392
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,311
Forgive me, oliver.

393
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:08,016
Oliver, I need your help.

394
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:13,515
Please.

395
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:23,551
There are times
when I wish I could go back...

396
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,056
Those santorini sunsets...

397
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,408
Your freckles...

398
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:32,332
And your big dreams
of changing the world.

399
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,048
Back When I could trust you.

400
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:40,424
Then you betrayed me, tess.

401
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:47,389
You, of all people.

402
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:02,445
And if you ever...

403
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:06,372
<i>Come near me or my friends
ever again...</i>

404
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:11,068
I will expose you
to the world. Do you understand?

405
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:35,675
Thanks for keeping my seat warm
at watchtower.

406
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,677
You're welcome.
Don't get used to it.

407
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:39,457
But your timing is so good.

408
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:42,479
If you hadn't flipped that castle's
electric switch when you did,

409
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:46,010
But, I kind of liked
being out in the field,

410
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:48,220
knowing I had a warm bed
to come home to.

411
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,212
That's very, very funny.

412
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,740
It scared the life out of me.

413
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,502
You better be careful, ollie.

414
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:02,292
I'm gonna start to think
you're falling for me.

415
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,693
Your identity's safe...
For now.

416
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,539
She's not wrong, you know... Waller.

417
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,596
How so?

418
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,166
When I saw the future,

419
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,979
zod and his people had
already started world war iii,

420
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,625
and we weren't winning.

421
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:43,021
She was right about being prepared.

422
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,078
Because as much as I want to believe

423
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:48,635
that I've stopped that day
from happening, it still might.

424
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:51,971
You don't have to join her.

425
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,290
No.

426
00:39:56,216 --> 00:39:58,424
But, like she said, eventually
I have to choose sides.

427
00:39:58,549 --> 00:39:59,810
You can't.

428
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,992
You are here for something
far greater.

429
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:09,292
You will be the ambassador

430
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,326
who bridges all the sides together.

431
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:20,119
What were you doing, john?
Why not include the rest of us?

432
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:26,545
I would have told the team
what was going on.

433
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:30,290
But I wanted
you and the rest of them

434
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,842
to stay off checkmate's radar.

435
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,431
But you're not in this alone.

436
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,911
Who are you working for?

437
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:44,052
Let's just say that...

438
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:48,659
There are more players
on the board than you think.

439
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:52,401
And when it comes
to choosing sides...

440
00:40:54,314 --> 00:40:56,536
things aren't always
black and white.

441
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:05,858
I want the report
of agent mercer's last physical.

442
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:07,620
When our system's back up,

443
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,093
do you want to move forward
with our operation?

444
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,973
- Who's been in here?
- No one. We're secured.

445
00:41:22,951 --> 00:41:25,944
We won't be renewing the operation.

446
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:29,361
We've been blocked by a new player.

447
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,450
It's time for a new game.

448
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:39,231
Synchro: Flolo
