1
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:08,800
Unbelievable.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,900
Immaculate.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
The gears, the complications i...

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,400
I have never seen
anything quite like it.

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,406
What does it do?

6
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:27,100
Well, i am sorry to say
i don't know.

7
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:30,600
I didn't come
to the most renowned expert

8
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:33,849
In antiquities in north america
for more ambiguity.

9
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:37,235
Well i just need more time

10
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:40,600
I need to take it to
my workshop and take it apart

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,783
No.

12
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:44,462
The cryptograph
isn't leaving this room.

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,900
It holds
great sentimental value for me.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,716
It's priceless.

15
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:57,674
Well, if there is no way
to decipher the meaning,

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,400
It seems your priceless heirloom
has no value at all.

17
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,600
I want a security detail
on him 24/7.

18
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,900
Oh, my god.
Mr. Luthor.

19
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,400
Security breach!

20
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:33,300
Call an ambulance!

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,700

For SeriesSub.com

24
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,200
Sir, don't try to get up.

25
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,243
I got everythin
taken care of.

26
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,454
Clearly that wasn't the case
earlier this evening, was it?

27
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:56,816
Police...
What do they know?

28
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,174
Nothing.

29
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,199
I knew you wouldn't
want us to cooperate.

30
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,131
I have a private team
tracking your assailant, but...

31
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:04,700
we don't have
many leads.

32
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,700
It was the manager...

33
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,475
From the bank in zurich.

34
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,134
He must have been stationed
at the bank,

35
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:17,317
Waiting for someone
to open the safe-Deposit box.

36
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:21,500
Apparently i'm not the only one
interested in its contents.

37
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,400
Sir.

38
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:29,216
He was trying to kill me.

39
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,116
He was trying
to do more than that.

40
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,300
Symbols.

41
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,900
He knows.

42
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,230
He's after a cryptograph.

43
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,970
i wont ask you where you've been
or why you stood me up...

44
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
... as long as you picked up some
cheesecake to say "i'm sorry."

45
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,500
Oh yeah.

46
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:32,731
Well, the hospital cafeteria
isn't known fos dessert list.

47
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,329
Hospital? Are you all right?

48
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,583
Me?

49
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,700
Yeah, i'm... I'm great.
I'm making page two.

50
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,770
Lex is the one who's not doing so hot.

51
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,400
Was there an accident?

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,704
Well, not unless tripping
can cause multiple stab wounds.

53
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,600
Look,
i know it sounds sleazy,

54
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,600
But it turns out
that ambulance-Chasing pays off.

55
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
I got a candid shot of lex
being admitted to the hospital.

56
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,061
I think i'll pass early peep show.
But, um, you know, jimmy,

57
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,100
There are ways other than
cheesecake make up for being late.

58
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:05,730
As far as I could tell, Lex's security is
not exactly cooperating with the police

59
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,872
In thelet's find out
what happe department.

60
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,700
Don't you find this
a little suspicious?

61
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:20,231
Well, given the large number
of dead bodies rolling around lately,

62
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,200
I, uh, thought that lex had
eliminated all of his enemies.

63
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
Why would someone
attack him?

64
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,500
Well, the why...

65
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,600
Isn't as interesting
as the how.

66
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,099
Along with the stab wounds,

67
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,400
The attacker chiseled a calling card
into lex's chest.

68
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,742
Like a name?

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,600
No, it's like
some freaky symbols.

70
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,400
Sorry i couldn't
get here faster,

71
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,400
But, you know,
i have to drive.

72
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,299
You dragged me out of bed
because someone hurt lex.

73
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,200
They did more
than just hurt, clark.

74
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,800
Jimmy snapped a photo.

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,900
That was carved
onto lex's chest.

76
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,700
What does it say?

77
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,100
They're symbols...

78
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,400
One for traveler
and the other for savior.

79
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,800
There's only one group that appointed
themselves the savior of the traveler.

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,600
Veritas.

81
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:29,400
But queen, teague,
swann, lionel...

82
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,395
All the members
of veritas are dead.

83
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,500
So, who else could know
about the traveler?

84
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,100
Or, more importantly,
how to control him?

85
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I mean, lionel said
whoever had the two keys

86
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,292
Would find the device to control you.
Now, what if lex was attacked

87
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:46,271
Because he has both keys
and he used them?

88
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:47,499
While you were away,

89
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,800
I tracked lex and the keys to
a safety-Deposit box in zurich.

90
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,400
Then we're too late?

91
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:55,442
Well, as far as i can tell, you're still
steering your own ship,

92
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,399
Which means that
whatever was in that box

93
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,700
Hasn't taken the wheel...
yet.

94
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:01,900
Well, that's comforting.

95
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:05,300
Well, maybe it's because lex
doesn't know who you are.

96
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:08,120
There's only one way
to find out.

97
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,754
You're not serious.

98
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:18,300
Looks like your q&a
will have to wait.

99
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,200
I found it.

100
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
It can't be.

101
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:07,400
I should have
seen that before.

102
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,700
Magnificent.

103
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,400
Do you want
to take a look?

104
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,164
I think i'll pass.

105
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:17,800
Do you want a look?

106
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:24,000
You are missing a treat,
a real treat.

107
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,800
No, no, no, no.

108
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,352
Here, take it.
Take it, please. No.

109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,661
Savior.

110
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:12,800
- Traveler.
- I guess skywriting is pass?

111
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,168
Chloe, the person who did this
may have kidnapped lex.

112
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:20,999
- If they did, they only did it to save you.
- That's the last thing i need...

113
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,100
Someone going around
killing people in my name.

114
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,331
That's probably how god felt
about the crusades.

115
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:32,176
Why carve kryptonian symbols
into lex's chest?

116
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:34,149
Lex got himself into this.

117
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,570
Yeah, but i let him.

118
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,500
Wait. Go back.

119
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,030
Right there,
where the symbols overlap.

120
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:47,800
Chloe, it creates
a third symbol... Sanctuary.

121
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,600
Like this?

122
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:51,900
Yeah.

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,100
There's no kryptonian word that
translates directly to church.

124
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,555
Sanctuary would be
the closest match.

125
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,362
And if you look at it that way,
then savior could be...

126
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,300
Angel or... saint.

127
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,500
The patron saint
of travelers is...

128
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,229
St. Christopher.

129
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,800
Hand me your phone.

130
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:22,000
Perfect. Everything you need
at your fingertips.

131
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,399
That'll take you
where you need to go.

132
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay, there's only one
st. Christopher's cathedral

133
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,255
On this continent,
and it's in montreal.

134
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,300
That man
was going to kill me.

135
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:39,000
He was
after the cryptograph.

136
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,500
Well, i guess
i underestimated its value.

137
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I am not surprised,

138
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,800
Considering what i found.

139
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,100
Go on.

140
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Every artist
leaves his mark...

141
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,000
His individual signature,
if you like.

142
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:03,400
This piece was designed

143
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,100
By a renowned german watchmaker
named dietrich brauer.

144
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:10,300
A watchmaker?

145
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,600
Brauer catered
to european noble families,

146
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,300
Making hundreds
of timepieces.

147
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:21,200
And then, one day,
he just went into seclusion.

148
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:24,100
Rumors swirled
that an unknown patron

149
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,500
Had commissioned him
to make not... Not a watch

150
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,100
But a magnificent clock.

151
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,983
Brauer's standard

152
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
His masterpiece.

153
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,400
So, what does this masterpiece
have to do with the cryptograph?

154
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Only one sketch
existed of the clock

155
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,900
After it dpeared
during the second world war.

156
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,500
The gears on that sketch
match this exactly.

157
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,500
So nobody knows
where the clock is now?

158
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,400
It was lost for decades.

159
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:00,000
But recently, it resurfaced

160
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:03,900
As a donation
from a wealthy philanthropist.

161
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,800
What was
the philanthropist's name?

162
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:12,700
I believe the donor's name
was dr. Swann.

163
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,300
Virgil swann.

164
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,100
Swann posthumously donated
this standard to a church.

165
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,200
St. Christopher's cathedral
in montreal, quebec.

166
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,400
"Cast your eye
beneath the surface."

167
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,800
It appears you've found
what you were seeking.

168
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,700
I've been expecting you.

169
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,100
There are few
who can read the inscription

170
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,600
And only one with ability
to follow the instructions.

171
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,600
Who are you?

172
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm edward teague,

173
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,000
The last surviving member
of veritas.

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Teague.

175
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,800
I've waited a life time for this moment...

176
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,200
To serve...

177
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:11,100
The traveler.

178
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,900
I suppose you know what it feels like

179
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,400
To be worshipped.

180
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:31,500
I didn't ask
to be worshipped.

181
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,971
Putting me on a pedestal...
That was something veritas did,

182
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,200
not me.

183
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:42,200
All the members of veritas
are dead.

184
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Lionel luthor
wanted you all to himself.

185
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,600
He killed the queens,
swann.

186
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,000
I went into hiding
after i...

187
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,100
Lost my wife... my son.

188
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,020
They all died
because of me.

189
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,600
No.

190
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,600
They died for you.

191
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Why?

192
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,700
They didn't even know me.

193
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,662
It was a sacrifice
they were happy to make.

194
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:16,800
That the difference between
believers and nonbelievers.

195
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,383
We believed
you would be the next savior.

196
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:23,000
We took an oath under swann
to protect you.

197
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:25,800
And your way of protecting me
was attacking lex?

198
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,111
Lex is a nonbeliever.

199
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,600
He cannot be trusted,
and his intentions are harmful.

200
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,299
Once he'd reached the
safety-Deposit box in zurich,

201
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I knew he was too close.

202
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Lionel said there was something out there
that could control me.

203
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,000
What is it that lex
was so close to finding?

204
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Swann kept that secret
to himself.

205
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,600
He scattered clues
around the world

206
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,200
In the hopes
that whatever controls you

207
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,599
Wouldn't wind up
in the wrong hands.

208
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,300
One of those clues...

209
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,200
Is here...

210
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:02,600
In this church.

211
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:05,900
I don't know where,

212
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:08,700
But i was afraid lex did.

213
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:11,700
So you tried to kill him.

214
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,400
But why carve my name
into his chest?

215
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,892
Lionel kept your identity hidden.
It was my only chance.

216
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,500
I hoped you would see it
and come find me.

217
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,500
I had to warn you.

218
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Please, you must believe
how evil lex is.

219
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,977
I know who lex is.

220
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,100
I know what he's done.

221
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,800
Then... why?

222
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:40,646
Why didn't you
take care of him before?

223
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:50,421
We have
sacrificed everything...

224
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Years of our lives,
our families...

225
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,300
For you.

226
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,800
You don't want
to fill your destiny.

227
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
You don't even want
to save yourself!

228
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:14,399
People want to see you
as their savior,

229
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,500
But you can't be so naive.

230
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,300
For every beacon of light
in the universe,

231
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,299
There is a pit of darkness.
We must fight

232
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,800
To keep that darkness
from overwhelming us all.

233
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,500
Lex luthor cannot be allowed
to control you.

234
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,300
No one can...

235
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,400
... no matter the cost.

236
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,200
We land in three hours.

237
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,000
I hope that gives you
enough time.

238
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:08,554
Those guards are dead,

239
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:10,500
I was almost killed,

240
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,100
And i have told you everything
that i know.

241
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,700
And still you have
practically abducted me.

242
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,283
What have you got me into?

243
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,900
It's better you don't
concern yourself with it.

244
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:25,100
You have put my life
in danger,

245
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,400
And now you refuse
to let me go.

246
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:30,000
I have a right to know
what is the truth,

247
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:33,799
Considering there's a decent chance
that you are going to kill me

248
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,300
Before i even get off
of this plane.

249
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,700
So... why should i help you?

250
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:41,900
If you remember right,

251
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,900
I saved your life back there.

252
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
That was because
you still needed me.

253
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:51,000
And i... And i think
you are still needing me now.

254
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,400
Mr. Luthor, in antiquities,
providence is everything.

255
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,199
The history of an object,
the reason why it was made...

256
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,700
That is a true value.

257
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:06,099
There was a rumor

258
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,200
That brauer was commissioned
to make the clock

259
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,600
By a secret society
of wealthy patrons.

260
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

261
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,000
My father was one of them.

262
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:30,884
My father was...

263
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:33,800
Fixated.

264
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,701
Everything he did,

265
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:42,200
Every act he made,
was all aimed at one goal...

266
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:47,600
... finding the truth,
no matter what the cost.

267
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,667
My father's obsession...

268
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:57,400
Made me an orphan
long before he died.

269
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:05,361
I've always wondered why.

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,500
That cryptograph...

271
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,600
That cryptograph is gonna
give me the answer.

272
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:37,700
Hey, clark, it's me.

273
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
So, the luthorcorp jet just left
smallville for montreal,

274
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,011
So whatever you can find up there,
I suggest you find it fast.

275
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,800
You are not gonna believe
what i found.

276
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,100
Uh, i take it you're over
the whole sleep thing.

277
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,599
The symbols
like the one hacked into lex

278
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,830
Have been appearing
around smallville for years,

279
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Uh, on cave walls,
burned into barn doors,

280
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:58,299
Even drawn in the fields
like crop circles.

281
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,500
- It's incredible.
- No, jimmy, it's a hoax,

282
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,577
Just like those crop circles
in england.

283
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,700
Well, hey,
the jury's still out.

284
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:07,900
Those crop circles
could have been made by aliens.

285
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,300
People have been playing with the
kawatche cave paintings for years,

286
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,739
Just trying
to get on the 6:00 news.

287
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,200
Get a little competition
in the story department

288
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,508
And suddenly
you go all scully on me.

289
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:22,600
It's not that.

290
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,717
It's just i don't think smallville
Is destined to be the next stonehenge.

291
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,300
Even iit turns out it's a site
of ritualistic killings?

292
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,800
I pulled this from some research
on the cave.

293
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,400
It's an exact match
to the carving on lex's chest.

294
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,800
And it's above a drawing.

295
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:39,300
Yeah, i've seen this before.

296
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:41,500
It just looks like a guy
in a doorway to me.

297
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,100
Well, sure,
it looks that way.

298
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
But according to the number-One
website on primitive pictography,

299
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
It's actually
a human sacrifice.

300
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:54,400
Oh, my god.

301
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,248
Why are you doing this?

302
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,000
I thought
you were supposed to protect me.

303
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,800
Because it is my duty.

304
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,600
You let the secret of veritas
fall into the wrong hands.

305
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:18,000
This is the only way
to guarantee

306
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,200
You don't come under
someone else's control.

307
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,900
It won't happen.
I can stop it.

308
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:28,000
I will now bestow
upon you...

309
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,200
An ancient kryptonian ritual.

310
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,942
Before your race

311
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:37,100
Were a people of science...

312
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:41,689
... they were warriors.

313
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,100
This ceremony
was a sign of respect

314
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
For the mightiest
of their enemies.

315
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,700
You don't know anything
about krypton!

316
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,300
I was swann's disciple.
He taught me everything.

317
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He must have taught you
that i was good...

318
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,373
That i'm not a threat.

319
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:02,900
He wouldn't want you
to kill me.

320
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
Swann was an idealist.

321
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,300
He said you would rule us
with strength.

322
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:10,400
But for every passage
swann quoted

323
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Of the traveler
coming to save earth,

324
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,800
There was another interpretation
that cast you...

325
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:17,700
As our destroyer.

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,939
If lex takes control of you,
That's exactly what will happen...

327
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:28,200
... something your father

328
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:31,100
Couldn't have foreseen.

329
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,300
What does this
have to do with jor-El?

330
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,000
He had high hopes for you
when he sent you to this planet.

331
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,300
But your father
understood the risk

332
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,658
Of setting a god among men.

333
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,600
If you were ever to turn
against humanity,

334
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,100
We wouldn't stand
a chance.

335
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,200
That's why
he sent the device.

336
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:09,200
He never would have
sent something to control me.

337
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,100
His only other option
would have been to destroy you,

338
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,600
But he couldn't bear
the thought of his son's death.

339
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,000
I pray that you find peace
in this act of selflessness.

340
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,400
You're too late.

341
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,000
So strange to see you without those

342
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,100
warrior-angel figurines clutched
in your little hands.

343
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:08,600
Mr. Teague.

344
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,670
Alive and well...

345
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:13,100
No thanks to your father.

346
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:15,500
Seems we all have
a score to settle with him.

347
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,900
I believe you already have.

348
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,100
I'm just sorry to see that you've
inherited your father's obsession.

349
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,400
Obsession?

350
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:26,854
You're the one
who did this.

351
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,100
You tried to kill me.

352
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Why?

353
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:33,100
The prophecies state

354
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,700
That the traveller
would have a powerful adversary.

355
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I could never have foreseen

356
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,700
That it would be
little alexander.

357
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,100
You know who he is.

358
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,100
The traveler's identity
is no longer relevant.

359
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
Maybe not you,

360
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,700
But it's everything to me.

361
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,800
You have no idea what it's like
to live every day of your life

362
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,700
Feeling like an afterthought.

363
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:59,804
- I've sacrificed too much.
- No.

364
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,200
Your sacrifice
has just begun.

365
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,700
The world can exist
only in balance.

366
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,200
If there is no traveler,
there can be no destroyer.

367
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,500
Oh, my god, clark.

368
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:14,781
How did you...

369
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:17,300
Oliver's jet...
Fringe benefit of being a hero.

370
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,800
How'd you do that?

371
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,400
I didn't.

372
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,700
The traveller

373
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh my goodness

374
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,700
What happened here?

375
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,300
I assume milash
is safely back on u.S. Soil.

376
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:56,800
I put him on the first
commercial flight to metropolis.

377
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,400
I take it we won't be
ing him in scotland?

378
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:01,500
Not if you did
your homework.

379
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,300
The library had
one book on st. Kilda,

380
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:07,300
But i think
you'll be pleased.

381
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:11,216
You mind if i ask
what's so compelling about

382
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:13,800
a small island
off the west coast of scotland?

383
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:15,700
The clock.

384
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,500
It played a melody from
an old scottish folk song...

385
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:23,300
"Birks of st. Kilda."

386
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:25,800
When i was learning
to play the piano,

387
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,100
My father made me
play it over and over.

388
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:32,000
"Birks" means birches.

389
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:35,200
Well, there might be birches,
but that's about it.

390
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:38,000
The island's
a bird sanctuary now.

391
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:40,300
According to the literature,

392
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,900
There was a small town
built up around a castle,

393
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:46,100
until some wealthy american
bought the castle...

394
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:49,014
Hauled it back to the u.S.

395
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,500
My father brought that castle
to smallville, stone by stone,

396
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:03,800
But obviously never found
what he was looking for.

397
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:07,042
It must still be there.

398
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,700
Tell the pilot to change cours

399
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,026
We're not going to scotland.

400
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:16,100
We're going home.

401
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:32,300
And I was only gone
for 24 hours.

402
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,902
Remind me to stay away
for a week next time.

403
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,200
Well, i'm actually
sort of celebrating myself.

404
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,100
I just sol
my first article.

405
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,500
That fantastic, jimmy!
How?

406
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,599
Look, I know that you said that the symbols
in the kawatche caves are old news,

407
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,195
But i kept digging anyways.

408
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,267
And it turns out that
i'm not the only one interested.

409
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,700
Apparently lex is pretty taken
with the symbols, too...

410
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:58,500
Not surprisingly, since
he's wearing one on his chest.

411
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,500
So, tell me exactly
what the article is about.

412
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,858
Well, it's all very
joseph campbell...

413
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,633
Hero's journey and all that.

414
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:08,400
- Cheers
- cheers.

415
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,630
See most of the stories
on the cave walls

416
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:14,000
Are about good vs evils

417
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,700
They tell of naman,
the savior of the people,

418
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,100
Warring against sageeth,
the bringer of darkness.

419
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,100
Yeah,
the story sounds familiar.

420
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,500
I think clark wrote paper
about it in high school

421
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,398
Well, in the beginning,

422
00:35:26,473 --> 00:35:29,500
Naman and sageeth each have
their own distinct symbol.

423
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,800
Well, then, why does this one
look like a combination of the two?

424
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,423
Well, i was wondering
that myself,

425
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:39,100
So i called
the professor at met you.

426
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,599
Who specializes
in hieroglyphics. According to him,

427
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,800
the symbol of good versus evil
is common in primitive cultures.

428
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,695
It embodies The push,
the puthe two sides. A yin and yang.

429
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,500
The hero-Antihero conflict.

430
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,700
Exactly.

431
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,500
But here's what got lex
all jazzed.

432
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,600
This particular image portrays
a resolution of that conflict.

433
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,500
Remind me
how you resolve a conflict

434
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,400
That has existed
since the beginning of mankind.

435
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,514
Well, in the kawatche legend,

436
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,727
The hero's journey ends
in a final battle.

437
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,100
So, according to your professor,
who's supposed to win?

438
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:30,100
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news, clark,

439
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,100
But the writing
t1 literally on the wall.

440
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:36,400
You're buying into this
whole naman-Sageeth mythology?

441
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,900
After seeing you
strapped down

442
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,500
Exactly like the human sacrifice
in the cave drawings?

443
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,900
In a word Yes.

444
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,607
It wasn't a myth that tried to kill me, chloe.
It was a man.

445
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,900
And thanks to you saving him,
that man is still out there.

446
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,180
Chloe, when teague
was performing that ritual,

447
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,217
I realized
that on some twisted level,

448
00:36:53,218 --> 00:36:55,302
He actually thought
he was doing the right thing.

449
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:58,200
He thought he was
protecting everyone...

450
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:01,000
From me.

451
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,699
Last time i checked,

452
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
The world was doing just fine
with you in it.

453
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:08,614
As long as there's something
out there that can control me,

454
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:10,080
I'm still a threat.

455
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,962
And teague reminded me
how dangerous my abilities are.

456
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:16,451
In the wrong hands, chloe,
they could destroy everything.

457
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,900
Which is
a really good reason

458
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,471
Why you can't let lex
just walk away.

459
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:22,928
It's not about lex, chloe.

460
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:25,144
I x-Rayed him.
He didn't him anything on him.

461
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:26,899
He didn't even find
what he was looking for.

462
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,700
Maybe not this time, clark,
but every battle has its victor.

463
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:32,600
I know you don't want
to take lex out,

464
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,400
but lex will not hesitate to destroy
you When he gets the chance.

465
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:40,473
What do you want me to do,
chloe?

466
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:41,600
Kill him?

467
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:49,200
If i do that,

468
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:51,700
I'd just be
turning into him myself.

469
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,799
Whether you like being
on this pedestal or not,

470
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,689
You were put
in this position.

471
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,400
And someday,
you're gonna have to play god.

472
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:10,200
It's been almost 24 hours.
Why haven't they found anything?

473
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,470
It takes time to cover a structure this
size Inch by inch, mr. Luthor.

474
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,900
I got every available body
working on the job.

475
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:17,967
And it's only been
20 hours.

476
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,500
I don't want excuses.
I want results.

477
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,700
Yes, sir.
I understand.

478
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,300
I'll bring in more men,
increase the shifts.

479
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,582
You do that.

480
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:46,400
On the shores of st. Kilda,

481
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,889
The birks sway in the wind

482
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,623
From the left
to the right again.

483
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,400
You said the castle was
in the west coast of st. Kilda?

484
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,142
Yes, sir.

485
00:38:58,496 --> 00:38:59,900
Facing west?

486
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:03,900
No.
The castle itself faced south.

487
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,000
So if i'm facing south...

488
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,200
To see the shore,
i turn right.

489
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,900
Above the heart of home
shines the north star.

490
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,400
Of course.

491
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:27,492
Get out.

492
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
Everyone out now!

493
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,400
Yes sir.

494
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:35,795
Everybody out.
Let's go.

495
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,600
