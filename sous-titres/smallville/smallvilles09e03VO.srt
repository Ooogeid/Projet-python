1
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,712
<i>I lost her.</i>

2
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,812
Lois, are you okay?

3
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:21,322
Smallville 903

4
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:29,296
synchro : Flolo

5
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,603
For seriessub.com

6
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:38,166
you can put away the pepper spray.

7
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,558
- It's only me.
- I wasn't hiding.

8
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:49,044
Looks like another
thrilling friday night...

9
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,676
just you and me flying the red
eye on this paper airplane.

10
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,042
Almost like you never left
the cockpit.

11
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,138
It's nice to have my copilot here.

12
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,853
- What's with the bag?
- All-nighter survival kit.

13
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:07,562
Comfort food...
comfort footwear...

14
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:11,389
and comfort music...
chicken soup for my soul.

15
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,295
Everything okay?

16
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,453
- You just seem a little off.
- The only thing i'm off

17
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:19,774
is a certain blurry
butt-kicker's to-do list.

18
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,657
A little over a week,
and not so much as a,

19
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:24,465
"sorry, i've been busy saving
the world, but got to run."

20
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,148
I didn't realizethe two of you wer
actually seeing each other now.

21
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,299
At this point, it's not really
seeing so much as still looking,

22
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:34,899
so much as still looking,
but a girl's got to hope.

23
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,659
Okay, get your engines going.

24
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:41,313
Looks like there's a major fire
on east brunswick.

25
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,865
If we're gonna be here all night,
i'll get some coffee.

26
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,081
That's what i love about you,
smallville...

27
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:49,525
i say "fire," you say "food."
I'll take mine black.

28
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,125
That was quick.

29
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,875
Do you smell smoke?

30
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,369
No.

31
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,121
The fire just got put out...
by the blur.

32
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:09,213
He is so amazing. Here you and i are
just having a coffee

33
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:12,396
while he's out squelching
five-alarm fires in three seconds flat.

34
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,319
Two seconds.

35
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,566
- Not that anyone's counting.
- Yeah.

36
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,902
There's a high-speed
motorcycle chase out near the bypass.

37
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:23,575
<i>At least somebody's
getting a little action tonight.</i>

38
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,543
Clark, this is ice-cold.

39
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,938
Never mind.
I'll get it myself.

40
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:07,116
Is this your idea of fun now
that you've hung up your bow?

41
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,551
Should have known it was you.
Clark kent, the king of buzz kill.

42
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,321
You and your pet rock put on
a hell of a barbecue.

43
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,089
But i had my money on doomsday...

44
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,891
you can try to play it off
as a joke,

45
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:20,281
but i know that the loss
of jimmy affected us both.

46
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:22,586
I guess god's got
a sick sense of humor.

47
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,934
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be taking
your name in vain.

48
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,385
What, you need to hear me say it?

49
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,931
I should have listened to you.

50
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,641
I should have gotten rid
of davis instead of believing in him.

51
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:39,835
It's a little late.

52
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:44,152
I'm trying to make up for what happened
not add myself to the casualty list.

53
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,172
Yeah, i can't get my thrills

54
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:48,637
leaping tall buildings
or outrunning speeding bullets.

55
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:50,448
We mere mortals, we have to rely

56
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,419
on a tweaked-out ducati
and the open road.

57
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,548
You know that you're meant
for more than this. This isn't you.

58
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:56,548
Who are you?

59
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,067
What's all this?
What's the "s" stand for?

60
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,702
- What is that,"superstar"?
- It gives people hope.

61
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,726
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you, go ahead

62
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:07,233
and plaster your symbol
of superiority all over the city

63
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:09,844
so people can worship you
like some kind of modern jesus.

64
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,806
That's what you want, right?
That's why you're here.

65
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:15,449
- Here to save us?
- You need help.

66
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,214
Yeah, maybe. But i hate to break it
to you.

67
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,578
Not everybody believes
in the second coming.

68
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,029
Have you found them?

69
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,614
They should have reported in by now.

70
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:06,024
They may have run into trouble.

71
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:12,943
They didn't send out an S.O.S.

72
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:14,943
And i should like to think

73
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:18,070
that 12 ex-navy S. E.A. L.S
could hold their own.

74
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:24,986
The longer it takes for us
to locate these kryptonians,

75
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:27,579
the more they'll blend in
and disappear.

76
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,365
It's okay.
It's just...

77
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,739
<i>That is not a many sense.</i>

78
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:54,743
<i>Tess is not
the nervous-breakdown type.</i>

79
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:57,057
But she is the lying,
cheating, scheming type.

80
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,755
You keep enough secrets,
they start to back up on your brain.

81
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,992
Seriously, alien orbs?
Now she's rambling about zombies?

82
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:04,794
It all adds up to "c" for "crazy."

83
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,397
Just trust me. There's got to be more
to the story than that.

84
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,899
I respect how quickly you managed
to get the lowdown

85
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,897
on little miss lithium's mental break but
sometimes you can be a little gullible.

86
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,357
Really? Why don't you call
your new best friend

87
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:18,482
- and get him to weigh in on it?
- I'm not gonna cry wolf

88
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:21,130
just to get a pity call
from studly do-right.

89
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:23,737
<i>Something tells me he'd side
with me on this one, anyway.</i>

90
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,907
Why, because you have
so much in common?

91
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:31,954
Dr. Coats. Maybe it's psychological.

92
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,723
We could go with a thorazine drip.

93
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,159
No, the delusions are most
likely caused by the virus.

94
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:38,847
But we can't identify it,
and she's not responding to antivirus.

95
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:42,485
I want her isolated. I'm sending all
samples to the disease control lab.

96
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,691
I get the sample ready to transport

97
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,738
come on, lois. At least wait till
she's awake to get your comment.

98
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:58,599
Don't you want to find out
what made cruella snap?

99
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,389
What happened to you?

100
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:07,748
Care to comment?

101
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,715
It's me, clark!

102
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:23,029
Doctor!
Please, do something!

103
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,533
Do something to help her now!

104
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:39,122
Lois, are you okay?

105
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:44,560
I've thrown down with tess before
but not quite like that.

106
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:48,188
Looks like there may be some
truth in her story after all.

107
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,032
Which is why i'm heading back

108
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,258
to the office right now to write it.

109
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,489
Care for a little lo mein?

110
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,495
I just came from that
korean macrobiotic place.

111
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,499
They do an exquisite cobb salad.
I couldn't help but noticing

112
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:26,542
that you practically jumped
out of your chair when i came in here.

113
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,739
I'd prefer if there were
no secrets between us.

114
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:31,965
Then you're in the wrong business.

115
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:38,489
I need your help.
Can you run a blood test on this?

116
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:41,951
It belongs to tess mercer.
She's infected with something.

117
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,977
Lois and i went to go see her at
met gen. She attacked us both.

118
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:47,624
That's different than the way
she is on every other day how?

119
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,509
- <i>We'll get right on it.</i>
- I'm already in there.

120
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,109
It looks like
she had some visitors this evening.

121
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:02,872
<i>And not the friendly kind.</i>

122
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:04,707
Viral rage...

123
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:08,210
can be traced to a dysfunctional
interior singular cortex.

124
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,179
The part of the brain that controls

125
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:12,448
the primitive
fight-or-flight instinct...

126
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:14,808
leaving the victims vulnerable
to hyper-aggression.

127
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:19,188
- The dca site's pretty impenetrable.
- That's okay.

128
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,557
The disease control agency
sent in a specialist today.

129
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,368
Do you think you can get
something out of him?

130
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:26,441
I could try. It'll take me at least
a half-hour to cross town.

131
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,166
Do you get motion sickness?

132
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,160
Not really.
Why do you ask?

133
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,862
Really?

134
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:53,413
Dr. Coats.

135
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:58,079
- Has her condition changed at all?
- <i>I'm afraid not.</i>

136
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,230
Now the virus has spread
to 31 people and counting.

137
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:04,545
Any idea how the virus metastasized
so quickly throughout her body?

138
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,203
Generally something
spreading this fast is airborne.

139
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:09,403
We're about to quarantine
the hospital,

140
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:11,374
and they've sent a team
over to miss mercer's office.

141
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:13,196
The daily planet?

142
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:16,319
I thought miss mercer called
an ambulance from the luthor mansion.

143
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:20,143
No, she arrived at work experiencing
some type of a mental trauma.

144
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,809
Paramedics picked her up
at the daily planet.

145
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,330
Randall?

146
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,824
Randall.

147
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,101
Still sleeping on the job, i see.

148
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,748
Rise and shine, randall.
I've got a major news flash for you.

149
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:29,964
I'm gonna get you out of here.

150
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,950
You have no idea
what you're up against.

151
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,113
<i>I'll get us through this.</i>

152
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:14,866
Are you okay?

153
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:19,746
- That was close.
- Yeah.

154
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,422
- You're hurt.
- I'm okay.

155
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,042
Let's get you someplace safe.

156
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,412
I know i was supposed to
give this back to you

157
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:48,877
after i checked your license, but
i couldn't help myself.

158
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,850
A lot of platinum cards in here.

159
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,810
But i bet this is
the most valuable one of all.

160
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,495
Who's she?

161
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,128
It's...

162
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,487
she's just someone i used to know.

163
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,576
Watch it.

164
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,411
Just because i let
that speeding ticket slide

165
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,845
doesn't mean you can speed in here.

166
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,306
I apologize, officer.
Don't shoot.

167
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:31,285
But i've been up since...

168
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,664
since like 4:00, yeah, on tuesday.

169
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,598
So those pills right now are the only
thing keeping me vertical right now.

170
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,864
It's fine. Just leave it.

171
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:57,066
- Is this a camera?
- A what?

172
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,825
It's some kind of spyware.

173
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,191
It's not mine.
I've never seen this.

174
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,593
Right.

175
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,660
And it just accidentally got
caught on your belt buckle?

176
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,149
So you could, what?
Plaster my butt all over

177
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:19,923
youtube like pamela anderson?

178
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,309
Okay, first of all, no one's 

179
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,851
on youtube looking
at pamela anderson's butt.

180
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,683
Don't call or e-mail.

181
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,870
Don't worry.
I never do.

182
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,354
Mercy.

183
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,670
I've isolated a suspect enzyme
from tess' blood,

184
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,546
but i still haven't
been able to find a match.

185
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,948
Anything new from the dca?

186
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,917
No, just they think
the virus is airborne

187
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,352
and might have been deliberately
released by someone.

188
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,843
As you can see, i created
a model of the virus path.

189
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,609
Dr. Coats said
the virus induces sleep

190
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:26,601
- so that it can germinate.
- If we could just mimic the enzyme.

191
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,327
We can create
an antidote. We just need

192
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:30,963
to find the right blood match.

193
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:36,735
I've only ever seen an enzyme
like that once before.

194
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,287
In davis bloome.

195
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,081
Do you think
they've quarantined the city?

196
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,616
Probably.

197
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,140
They found out it was
an airborne virus.

198
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,292
You realize that means
we could both have it.

199
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,666
We can't think like that.

200
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:31,265
I'm just saying once we go out there,
we might not make it.

201
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,383
I'm serious. Those things
are everywhere.

202
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,074
It would just suck to go out
without any...

203
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,866
closure.

204
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:46,265
Do you have any deep, dark secrets?

205
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,332
Do you?

206
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:57,419
Last year, when i was talking
with the red-blue blur...

207
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,762
for the first time in my life,
i was doing something that mattered.

208
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,035
And i wanted to work
with him because 

209
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,202
we did such good things together.

210
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,707
But then i started
to realize that...

211
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:18,763
i wasn't just doing it
to save people.

212
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:25,735
I was doing it for me.

213
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:33,777
I just wanted to be with him.

214
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,739
We all get crushes.
It doesn't make you a bad person.

215
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:45,589
You don't understand.

216
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,827
I had never had this connection
with someone before.

217
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,048
Now that i have this connection,

218
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,819
i don't want to go back
to the way things were.

219
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,213
This is embarrassing to admit.

220
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,754
I don't want to be alone anymore.

221
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,327
We got to go.

222
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:43,757
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking for tess

223
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,632
when the whole building
went "resident evil."

224
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:49,570
Come on.

225
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,941
Got any idea what triggered this
sudden appetite for human carpaccio?

226
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,909
All i know is, one minute,
my copy editor's dozing,

227
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,811
the next,
he's trying to bite my face off.

228
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,746
Same thing happened to tess.
She was asleep.

229
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,514
When she woke up
she became one of them.

230
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,502
You think this thing incubates
when people are sleeping.

231
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:04,280
Let's hope not. We only have a few hours


232
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:06,454
till 4 million people
get up to go to work.

233
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,639
That's one hell of a rush hour.

234
00:24:09,444 --> 00:24:11,755
Get in here.
You'll be safe.

235
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,989
Someone's got to go for help.

236
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,192
Please, be careful.

237
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,159
Everything's gonna be all right.

238
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:28,809
Okay.
Good luck, clark.

239
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:31,746
She's in your hands now.

240
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,905
Don't let her fall asleep.

241
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,458
I found the antidote, but we're running
out of time.

242
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,872
Where's this mystery,
extraterrestrial specimen

243
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,935
with davis bloome's blood type?

244
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,056
You're looking at him.

245
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:54,098
That explains a lot.

246
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:55,636
How do you expect to draw my blood?

247
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,305
There's no needle
that can puncture my skin.

248
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,747
Dr. Emil has a contact
at luthorcorp labs

249
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,254
who sent over
some liquid kryptonite.

250
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:05,155
We dip the needle in this,
and it'll penetrate your skin.

251
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,422
Here we go.

252
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,791
You were right. The allergic
reaction's quite intense.

253
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,921
- Get it out of him.
- No, we need more blood.

254
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,907
- No!
- Almost there.

255
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,808
It's killing him!

256
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,363
Good.
He's gonna be okay.

257
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,925
His vitals are within range.

258
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,385
We need to get on
that jet right now.

259
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,269
I'm not leaving him here.

260
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:48,989
I don't have time to prep
all the antidotes by myself.

261
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,792
Thousands, if not millions,
may be unknowingly affected.

262
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,019
We have to get this into
the water supply immediately.

263
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,597
The sooner we do,
the more people we can reach.

264
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,490
God, ollie...

265
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,462
you're a mess.

266
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:24,342
Yeah, i know.

267
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:39,557
I'm sorry you have to see me
like this... lois.

268
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,420
Why don't you...

269
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,023
why don't you go ahead and tell
me i'm full of it,

270
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,216
like you always used to?

271
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,919
God, i miss you.

272
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,206
I miss our days together.

273
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:15,351
Deep down in your heart,
i know you do, too.

274
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:23,885
Come on. Lois?
Wake up.

275
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,587
All right, the antidote's
permeated the water supply

276
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,689
and achieved
its target concentration.

277
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:36,658
That's great for the people
who are taking a shower this morning,

278
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,672
but what about the rest of us?

279
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:42,428
That's why we're seeding
the atmosphere to release moisture.

280
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,499
Deliver the virus
in a knockout blow.

281
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:47,886
We should be able to create a curative
precipitation to blanket the city.

282
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:50,271
<i>We've reached
our target coordinates.</i>

283
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,164
<i>Prepare to launch.</i>

284
00:29:10,653 --> 00:29:12,995
In the event something goes
wrong, i want you to know

285
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,474
your contributions
have been appreciated.

286
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:19,395
Nothing's going wrong.

287
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,894
Now i know why oliver
had such faith in you.

288
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,705
He finally met someone who was
a match for his confidence.

289
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:30,940
Probably no surprise that you
were the one to betray him.

290
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:33,949
Are you gonna explain
that not-so-subtle barb?

291
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,854
You've been tracking oliver and the
rest of his league, haven't you?

292
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:44,035
Apparently you've made yourself more
at home at watchtower than i thought.

293
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:48,053
May i ask why you're spying on him?

294
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:51,867
The longer they stay separated,
the more vulnerable they are.

295
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,103
- So you're protecting them?
- Yes. Someone has to.

296
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,188
I'm not sure if you've noticed,

297
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,523
but the people who are the worst
at taking care of themselves

298
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:02,527
are the ones the world
actually needs the most.

299
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:05,794
I assume
that no one else knows this.

300
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:10,167
No, it's my secret.

301
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:14,013
Now, the real question is
will you keep it?

302
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:18,566
I guess you'll just
have to trust me.

303
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,443
Lois, are you okay?

304
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:15,507
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

305
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:13,820
Clark, what happened?

306
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,194
We made it.

307
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,233
There we go.

308
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:09,311
You only had to do one thing.

309
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:11,755
Keep her awake.

310
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:14,747
But lois almost died!

311
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:19,829
You've spiraled down so far
you couldn't even protect her.

312
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,983
Is there any part of the person
i used to know still there?

313
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:30,490
Maybe not.

314
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:36,806
I understand
that it's hard trying to figure out

315
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,980
how to come back from what happened.

316
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:41,772
Maybe you need help.

317
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:46,565
Actually, i thought about
what you said, and...

318
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:53,080
i took a look in the mirror,
and you were right.

319
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:58,157
I've been running away from
myself for a long time now.

320
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,293
But now i know who i really am.

321
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:10,039
All right, then you know
what you have to do.

322
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,197
Yeah.

323
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:23,051
Thank you, clark.

324
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:04,119
I just came by to say thanks...

325
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:06,195
and to apologize

326
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,620
if i tried to rip your head off
or anything.

327
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:13,770
You know, you have
a pretty mean left hook.

328
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,662
I don't remember any of that.

329
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:21,801
But i do remember seeing
a whole new side of clark kent.

330
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,894
Which side was that?

331
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,964
I'll give you a hint.

332
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,509
It starts with "h"
and ends with "ero."

333
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:34,151
And i wasn't even
wearing red or blue.

334
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:37,867
You've got a long ways
to go before you can do that.

335
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,074
Still, i think we make
a pretty good team.

336
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:44,523
Yeah, we do.

337
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,290
You never did tell me your secret.

338
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:54,422
Relax, smallville.

339
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,136
Keep some mystery.

340
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:08,756
You need to work every last drop
of it you've got.

341
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:14,257
Three things
cannot be long hidden...

342
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:17,219
the sun...

343
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,872
the moon...

344
00:38:20,554 --> 00:38:22,054
and the truth.

345
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:30,682
That's from a sacred human text
from a prophet they call buddha.

346
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:33,332
- Major zod.
- No.

347
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:43,094
And the truth is...

348
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:47,165
you've become reckless, haven't you?

349
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:51,374
Unleashing a hostile virus
to humanity.

350
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:02,656
Have you lost your foresight?

351
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,931
I did it all for our survival.

352
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,399
Our cloak of anonymity
is the only thing

353
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:11,764
keeping our presence
from this world.

354
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,418
They will hunt us

355
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:19,484
when they discover
the virus' true origin.

356
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,849
They won't have the chance, sir.

357
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:28,563
I found the secret
to our abilities that was promised us.

358
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:31,272
While you were rounding up our
people i discovered one of us right here

359
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:34,331
in metropolis, under our noses.

360
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,940
- He survived.
- Major...

361
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:05,709
he didn't just survive. According
to the news reports

362
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:07,636
of miraculous saves around the city,

363
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:10,171
he has the power
from the yellow sun.

364
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,665
And yet we have none?

365
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:16,791
He has chosen to harness
the powers for himself

366
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,979
and left us defenseless.

367
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:22,055
Jor-el betrayed us.

368
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,759
Releasing the virus was the
most effective way to uncover him.

369
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:34,017
Were you successful?

370
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:38,390
His blood was used to create
the antidote to the virus.

371
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,627
Track it. He's ours.

372
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:51,115
I trust you see the risk
was worth it.

373
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:53,715
It takes a certain kind of man

374
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,341
to step outside the boundaries
of his station.

375
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:01,319
Kneel.
