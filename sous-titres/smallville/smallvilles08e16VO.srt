1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,491
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:03,953
- We'll always be there for each other.
- Forever.

3
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:07,338
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

4
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,500
That thing that did this, what was it?

5
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:18,233
Jor-El warned me
about an ultimate destroyer.

6
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:23,133
There is some sort of connection
between us. I know that you feel it, too.

7
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,390
Okay, stop.

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,501
I'm gonna relieve Lois
of her nurse's duties.

9
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:30,801
From what I hear, he was lucky
to make it past that creature alive.

10
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:33,233
You will eradicate
the other Kryptonian.

11
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,797
I am not going to hurt anyone.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,068
You have no free will.

13
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,467
Say that Clark Kent,
the unassuming journalist...

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,101
Steps out of the shadow
into his red-and-blue,

15
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:44,234
creating two completely
separate identities?

16
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:47,467
I think there's a lot more to Clark Kent
that even Clark Kent doesn't want to admit.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,200
If you want to fire me,
Ms. Mercer, go ahead.

18
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:53,300
Clark, I don't want to fire you. In time,
I'm sure the truth will reveal itself.

19
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,371
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

20
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:16,149
I... have hurt many people.

21
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:18,440
People that I care about.

22
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,434
I'm here, my son.
Go on.

23
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:28,400
Something... takes over...

24
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,138
without warning.

25
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:38,378
It's a beast inside of me,

26
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,901
fighting to get out.

27
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:45,500
We all have our inner demons,

28
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,587
but we must learn to control them.

29
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:53,898
I'm trying, father,
the best way I know how. But...

30
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,200
I... I drive through Metropolis at night,

31
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,734
searching for a way
to save myself.

32
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:06,965
Perps, thieves, drug dealers.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,082
There's so much...

34
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:13,074
sin committed on those streets.

35
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:27,772
And when I find someone who's
lost their way, I reach out.

36
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,134
Go home!

37
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:48,359
And w-when I come across...

38
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,568
evil...

39
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:54,231
You're not even a cop.

40
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:59,534
I do everything in my power...

41
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,845
to put it to an end.

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,401
When I stop the wickedness
that I see...

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,467
it keeps the beast from coming out.

44
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,850
It makes me feel...

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,300
human.

46
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,967
Stay on your righteous path,
my son.

47
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,151
Be not overcome of evil.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,273
But overcome evil...

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,574
with good.

50
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:51,034
"Somebody save me"

51
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,198
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

52
00:03:56,226 --> 00:04:01,068
"Somebody save me"

53
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:06,578
"I don't care how you do it"

54
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:11,534
"Just save me, save me"

55
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,219
"Come on"

56
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:17,210
"I've been waiting for you"

57
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:27,420
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

58
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:31,501
"Just save me, save me"

59
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:34,277
"Come on"

60
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,147
SMALLVILLE 8x16 "TURBULENCE"
Subtitles SubXpacio

61
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,670
I haven't seen you this pumped
since you threw the touchdown pass...

62
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:52,053
that made the crows state champs.

63
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:54,933
That is a tough one to top, Chloe,
but last night, I think I did.

64
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:58,135
I heard. It was quite
the coming-out party.

65
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:01,792
Media outlets report that the red-blue
blur made more saves last night...

66
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,106
than a Billy Graham revival meeting.

67
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,077
I thought you'd be happy.

68
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:09,010
I mean, you're the one who convinced me
to embrace my double identity...

69
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,134
and inspire the world.

70
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,201
Yeah, but, Clark, did you have
to make a guest appearance...

71
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,780
on every single traffic cam in town?

72
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,500
Hey, slowing my super speed down
enough to appear on video is not easy.

73
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,114
I wasn't even sure it worked
the first few times.

74
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:24,094
Look, I'm all about your streak
of primary colors making a splash,

75
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,812
but this is more like a tsunami.

76
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,662
If it means giving people hope,
Chloe,

77
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:29,937
I'll take that chance.

78
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,491
I just want to make sure that
your rush to inspire Joe six-pack...

79
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,459
doesn't unmask Clark Kent.

80
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,742
Chloe, working at the Daily Planet
is a perfect cover.

81
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:38,601
Right.

82
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:41,395
So what, you're gonna pull a quick costume
change in the middle of the bullpen?

83
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,999
I'm getting really good at it.

84
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:44,369
Watch.

85
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:55,525
Not to pre-empt your episode
of "America's next top model," but...

86
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,185
you've got a little bit of a...
wardrobe malfunction.

87
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:04,487
Clark, you're not exactly inspiring
much confidence,

88
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,897
especially after what happened
last night.

89
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:10,267
After Lex died, all of his personal
files were transferred into LuthorCorp.

90
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,992
What happens when Tess Mercer
gets her hands on those?

91
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,501
You don't have to worry
about Tess Mercer or me.

92
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:18,048
All your attention
should be on Jimmy.

93
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,037
I saw him last night, Chloe.
He's still pretty shaken up.

94
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,051
I should've been able
to protect him.

95
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,074
Clark, you did everything you could.

96
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:30,643
And thankfully, now that Jimmy's
been transferred to Met Gen,

97
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,513
he's that much closer
to home.

98
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:36,092
I really think that the future
looks a whole lot brighter for him.

99
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:53,200
Jimmy, you know that that machine's
already locked into a set dosage.

100
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:57,099
It's not gonna give you more no matter
how many times you hit the pump.

101
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,573
Well, you need to tell my doctor
my pain is hummer-sized, not hybrid.

102
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:07,988
Being in a hospital bed for five
weeks really does a job on you.

103
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,899
But, you know, maybe what you're
going through isn't all physical.

104
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:20,451
Maybe you should talk to a psychologist.

105
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,971
I don't need a shrink, Chloe.
I need to go home.

106
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,939
Look, if you're doing fine...

107
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:30,786
I will be, too.

108
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:35,154
Jimmy, I wasn't the one that
was practically mauled to death.

109
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,772
And that, uh...

110
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,367
that thing...

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,958
it hasn't shown up again?

112
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,700
The villagers already put away
their pitchforks.

113
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,078
I think he's gone forever.

114
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,074
You don't know that for sure.

115
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,279
We would've heard about it.

116
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,521
I know.

117
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,551
It's hard to believe that he just
dropped in to destroy our wedding.

118
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:11,553
Just one of the pitfalls of getting hitched
in the meteor-freak capital of the world.

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,132
I guess it's just another sign
that we were meant for each other.

120
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,853
Because if the King Kong of meteor
freaks couldn't take you away from me...

121
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,934
then we're gonna be together forever.

122
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:02,102
Jimmy, help me!

123
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:04,549
Chloe...

124
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,368
Nurse!

125
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,574
I'm in a lot of pain here!

126
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,976
Nurse!

127
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:47,034
Hello?

128
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,434
Can I get some more
pain medicine, please?

129
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,098
Got to help me.

130
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,751
Oh. How much have you had to drink, man?

131
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,624
Wait!

132
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,061
ALERT!
MAIN AND 5TH

133
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:46,741
ALERT!
MAIN AND 5TH

134
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:50,274
Nifty knapsack, Kent.
Are you on your way to p. e.?

135
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,159
I just got back from the gym.

136
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,500
If you want to graduate from
the bullpen to the corner office,

137
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:58,569
- ... you need to look the part.
- Yeah. Well, thanks for the tip.

138
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,915
I think we can find something a
little less "high school musical"

139
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,492
and a little more Louis Vuitton
to carry around...

140
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,500
whatever it is that
you're hiding in here.

141
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,267
Well, it really is just my gym stuff,

142
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,934
and I don't think I want my boss
going through my underwear.

143
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:12,034
It's okay. I'll take you
shopping when we get back.

144
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,975
Get back?
Where are we going?

145
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,036
L. A.

146
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:20,481
I'm announcing the new Mercer
Media Group at a press conference,

147
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,008
and I need a friendly reporter
to lob softballs.

148
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:24,334
And you want me to go with you?

149
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,500
Every cub reporter gets his big break.

150
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:28,805
This just happens to be yours.

151
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,609
Don't underestimate your talents, Kent.

152
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:34,666
There's no telling
where they'll take you.

153
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,817
The sky is the limit.

154
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,567
Do you have more important
things to do?

155
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,001
No. Of course not.

156
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,534
Good.

157
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,548
Because the only reporters
I want working for the Planet...

158
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,157
are those who take
their jobs seriously.

159
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:11,438
Jimmy, hey.

160
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,234
Are you all right? I came
right after the police called.

161
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,900
Considering a man was murdered in this
hospital last night, I'm doing pretty good.

162
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,811
I'm sorry I can't say
the same thing for Davis Bloome.

163
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:23,521
What happened to Davis?
Was he hurt?

164
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,834
Hurt?

165
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:30,610
No. No, Chloe, he was the killer. I saw
him murder someone right in front of me.

166
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:38,077
What the hell are you doing here?

167
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:42,083
Well, thanks to you, I got cuffed,
thrown into a squad car last night,

168
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:45,274
and then I spent the next six lovely hours
getting grilled by a homicide detective...

169
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,136
with the world's worst coffee breath.

170
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,467
- They let you out on bail?
- Jimmy, they let me go.

171
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,434
Since when does Metropolis P.D.
let people get away with murder?

172
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,034
- Look, I saw you...
- Jimmy, calm down.

173
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,171
Yeah, you did see me.
You did.

174
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,938
But I didn't murder anyone.

175
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,872
I was up here looking for a patient
that I brought into the E. R...

176
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,305
Some drunk driver, fatal accident.

177
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,037
We called the cops.
He ran.

178
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,147
We had the entire night staff
scattered around the hospital, looking.

179
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,566
And we didn't find him,
but... I found you,

180
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,233
wandering around the hall,
completely out of it.

181
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,601
I know what I saw, Chloe.

182
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:23,467
Okay, normally your eyes could
be trusted, but not last night.

183
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,534
Your PCA pump, it was faulty.

184
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,185
It gave you a double dose
every time you hit the trigger.

185
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:30,534
Now, if I had that much morphine in
my system, I'd see some things, too.

186
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,177
Davis, I was with Jimmy yesterday when
he tried to give himself an extra dose,

187
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,334
and the machine wouldn't allow it.

188
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,634
Well, somehow it malfunctioned.

189
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,677
Did you do anything to it?

190
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
What?

191
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:51,167
Jimmy, hey, no one is gonna blame you
if you did. You were in a lot of pain.

192
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,401
Nice try, pal, but there is
nothing wrong with that pump!

193
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,434
Well okay, ask the doctors,
or ask one of the nurses.

194
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,739
They'll say the same thing.

195
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,834
Look, I'm... okay.
I'm, uh...

196
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,788
I'll get out of your way. Jimmy,

197
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:08,343
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

198
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,046
Davis, hey, I feel terrible.

199
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,934
I know the tricks that pain-killers
can play on a person's head.

200
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,761
He's on some pretty heavy stuff.

201
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:35,639
Still, you don't deserve to be cast as
the madman in Jimmy's psycho thriller.

202
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:40,576
Uh, the truth is, I'm not surprised
he thinks of me that way. I...

203
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,172
I did kiss his bride.

204
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,867
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

205
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:53,100
Oh, well, I... I just assumed...

206
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,767
I didn't, um, I didn't tell him.

207
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,521
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

208
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:03,077
No need to.
Yeah, that was way off base.

209
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:09,037
Well, if I said anything
or did anything

210
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:12,646
to give him reason to hate me,
I- I hope we can get past it.

211
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,701
I accept...

212
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,476
that he got the girl.

213
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:20,164
And, like I told you before,
I'm... I'm moving on.

214
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,134
- I think that's a good idea.
- Oh, yeah.

215
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,204
And if Jimmy needs anything,
um, I'm here.

216
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,407
What is it?

217
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:41,238
Hey, Chloe.

218
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,034
You can talk to me.

219
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,961
I just can't help but wonder that if...

220
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,463
he had never met me, maybe
this wouldn't have happened to him.

221
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,343
It was nice of Oliver
to let you use his private jet.

222
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:52,607
Well, LuthorCorp and Queen industries
are one big happy conglomerate now.

223
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:54,786
We share all of our toys.

224
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,167
Welcome aboard, Ms. Mercer.

225
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,767
We may have to reroute
and land in Santa Barbara.

226
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,633
Tower's informed me
there's a storm coming into L.A.

227
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,892
Thank you, Captain Nichols.

228
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:10,067
From what I understand, you've been racking
up a lot of frequent-flyer miles lately.

229
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,700
Yeah, well, there are a lot
of foreign titans to charm...

230
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,215
when you're starting
a global endeavor.

231
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,568
Plus, I had to make a pit stop in
Geneva to see a plastic surgeon.

232
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,367
Oh, it wasn't a Nip/Tuck.

233
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,534
Lex Luthor lojacked me
with some bio-tech hardware,

234
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,901
and I had to have it sliced out.

235
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:34,001
Lana told me
what Lex put you through.

236
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,818
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,872
What about what Lex
put you through?

238
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,428
He pretended to be your friend
for how many years?

239
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:51,224
I'd like to think that there was a time
when Lex and I had a real friendship.

240
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,260
That wasn't a friendship.

241
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,935
Clark, you were his obsession.

242
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,909
Lex wanted so much to be like you.

243
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:07,862
But he knew... he knew
in his heart he never could.

244
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:14,534
Did Lex talk to you about me?

245
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,347
He kept a journal.

246
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,607
What'd it say?

247
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,501
I'm sworn to secrecy.

248
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:32,636
Are you thirsty?

249
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,261
What?

250
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,104
I am.

251
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,426
I'm sure that Oliver keeps a bottle of
the good stuff around here somewhere.

252
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:33,084
Jimmy, what are you doing here? Have you
been searching for more pain meds?

253
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,691
Look, I know what you did.

254
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:38,224
You stashed the body here
till you could get rid of it.

255
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,640
What body?

256
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,849
The guy, the...
the drunk driver... he's dead!

257
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:53,309
And maybe that isn't
such a bad thing.

258
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:58,852
He ran a red light last night.
He killed a young mother...

259
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,605
and her little girl on the way back
from a ballet recital.

260
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,798
So you murdered him?

261
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,875
I didn't murder anyone.

262
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,005
The body...

263
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,172
it's right there, Davis.

264
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:24,059
Jimmy,

265
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,513
you don't know what
you're seeing anymore.

266
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,528
It's those damn drugs.

267
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,265
POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
ANXIETY DISORDER.

268
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,607
Jimmy!

269
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,283
Chloe?

270
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:12,128
Chloe!

271
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,885
- Jimmy! It's after me again!
- Come with me. I'll save you.

272
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,200
No, get back in your room!
It'll hurt you!

273
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:33,436
Chloe, wait!

274
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,831
Jimmy, go back to your room...
please!

275
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:01,375
No! No!
Stop! Stop!

276
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,828
Chloe!

277
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:06,334
No! No!

278
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,507
Let go of me!
It's attacking!

279
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:13,042
Chloe, no! No!
No! Chloe!

280
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:15,094
Mr. Olsen, what did you take?

281
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,623
Jimmy.

282
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:20,005
Hey! Get away from me!

283
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
We need a shot of Haldol-Ativan.

284
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,501
That thing's killing Chloe!
I need to save her!

285
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:35,213
Jimmy!

286
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,900
Jimmy?

287
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,691
Don't worry. We'll take care of him.

288
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,528
I don't think Oliver Queen
would appreciate us finishing off...

289
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:13,332
his private reserve of 1990 Cristal.

290
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,854
It's a long flight. I'm sure he wouldn't
mind us drinking a few more glasses.

291
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:19,408
About Lex's journal...

292
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:21,248
he's gone now,
so you can tell me...

293
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:24,634
Enough about
Lex's journal, okay?

294
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:27,230
I want to talk about you.

295
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,668
We've had two bottles
of champagne.

296
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,464
You seem to have this inhuman ability
to withstand the effects of alcohol.

297
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,281
I have a strong metabolism.

298
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,801
Me too.

299
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:45,226
I can hold my liquor
like no other.

300
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,114
It's in the Mercer genes.

301
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:53,536
Daddy dearest used to be able
to finish off a fifth

302
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:56,150
before the lunch whistle blew
at the mill.

303
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:58,618
That sounds tough.

304
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:03,333
Let's just say it wasn't
the Norman Rockwell childhood...

305
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,675
that you had at the Kent farm.

306
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:08,771
Nobody's childhood is perfect.

307
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:12,402
Yeah, but I bet you were read
fairy tales at bedtime...

308
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,831
not like what my dad did.

309
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:22,205
I'm sorry. You don't...
you don't need to hear that.

310
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:25,633
That's okay.

311
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:32,338
I had these blue sheets...

312
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:34,851
that I used to pull up
over my head...

313
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:38,756
and it made me feel like
I was underneath the ocean.

314
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,672
And I would hide in there and, uh,

315
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:45,469
pretend to be the little mermaid,

316
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:49,446
waiting, dreaming of my prince
to come rescue me.

317
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:52,568
Then my dad would come in.

318
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,478
The bastard shattered
my eardrum.

319
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,964
And he broke my arm...

320
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,933
three times.

321
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,733
I bet you didn't expect
the in-flight entertainment...

322
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,000
to include my true
Hollywood story, huh?

323
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:23,200
I'm just glad it has a happy ending.

324
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,574
Look at you now.

325
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,700
I think I'm just good
at covering my tracks.

326
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,868
Kind of like you, Clark.

327
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,000
Why would I cover my tracks?

328
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:42,334
I don't know.

329
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,685
Why would Lex have an entire
room devoted to you?

330
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,002
I've seen the photographs...

331
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,166
the crushed Porsche,
t- the mushroomed bullets.

332
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,501
I can't explain to you
Lex Luthor's delusions.

333
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:01,218
Lex was a lot of things,
but he was not delusional.

334
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,661
Clark...

335
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,545
we all have our deepest,
darkest secrets.

336
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:10,886
I just told you mine.

337
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:14,867
Now tell me yours.

338
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:29,734
There's nothing to tell.

339
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:35,165
With me, it's what you see
is what you get.

340
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,258
How's the weather look in L.A.?

341
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,334
Skies are all clear.

342
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,812
What's happening?

343
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,474
There's a hole in the cockpit,
and the pilot's gone!

344
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,673
I looked everywhere,
and I can't find the parachutes!

345
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:02,167
You're gonna be okay!

346
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:05,733
Clark, do something.

347
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,342
Here.

348
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,383
Put this on!

349
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:15,790
Just breathe!

350
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,572
Keep breathing!

351
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:30,401
You're gonna be okay!

352
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,055
So I wasn't hallucinating.

353
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,522
I got this cut in your ambulance
when I saw the dead body.

354
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,304
You murdered that man.

355
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,084
Jimmy... get away from me.

356
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:19,394
No.

357
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,538
No. Not until you tell Chloe what
you did. She's on her way right now.

358
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:25,634
You don't know what you're doing.
You're not yourself.

359
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,620
That's what you want everyone
to believe, isn't it?

360
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,754
See, I thought it was just
to cover up the murder.

361
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:36,339
But then I saw you holding Chloe
outside my room.

362
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:40,593
You want me out of the way so you
can have her all for herself, don't you?

363
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:46,104
Jimmy, please, for your own good,
get out of here now!

364
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,367
I am not going anywhere
until you confess what you did.

365
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:07,378
Chloe, please, go.
Get out of here!

366
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,752
Davis, it's okay.

367
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:14,671
He can't hurt you, Davis.

368
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,234
You saved me.

369
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:01,079
Well, there he is... the prince
who came to my rescue.

370
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,938
I would think parachuting out of a jet
and landing in the Arizona desert...

371
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,967
would've slowed you down, but...

372
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,883
you seem to be doing just fine.

373
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,099
I knew I was fine the moment that
I woke up in that Phoenix emergency room,

374
00:33:13,134 --> 00:33:16,548
to see you standing by my side.

375
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:21,648
Did you figure out
what brought down Oliver's jet?

376
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:23,601
Someone may have been
trying to kill you.

377
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,001
It is a dangerous world
we live in.

378
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:30,967
The NTSB is still
investigating the explosion.

379
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,861
- Have they found the pilot's body?
- No.

380
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,399
And I feel terrible.

381
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,292
Why is it that he's dead
and we're still alive?

382
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:45,933
I guess I'm just lucky that you were
in the right place at the right time.

383
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:52,829
RED-BLUE BLUR TO THE RESCUE

384
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:56,193
I guess the lucky part
was finding that parachute.

385
00:33:57,414 --> 00:34:01,267
Yeah, about the parachute...
where was that?

386
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,555
I looked everywhere.

387
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:07,568
You must've missed it. I found
it stashed in the cabin locker.

388
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,741
Just one?

389
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:15,530
Yeah, I was able to, uh,
strap it around both of us.

390
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:19,100
Well, as terrible
as it all was,

391
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:22,967
I hope that this experience
has brought us closer.

392
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:28,342
I don't usually open up
about myself to...

393
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,067
well, to anyone, really.

394
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:38,323
I understand that what you told me was a
part of your past you'd like to keep private.

395
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:43,663
If you're worried that I'm gonna
tell someone your secret...

396
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,001
I promise you I won't.

397
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:52,363
Lex was right about you, Clark.

398
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:56,167
There's not a bad bone in your body.

399
00:34:56,701 --> 00:35:00,153
My whole life, I've had to deal
with abusive people,

400
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,064
people who took away my hope.

401
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,794
But when I'm around you...

402
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:10,259
somehow I feel safe.

403
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,867
I'm just glad you're okay.

404
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,616
I'd better get back to the Planet.

405
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,267
I wouldn't want you to think
I'm not taking my job seriously.

406
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,095
Clark...

407
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,615
I may run his company...

408
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:40,634
and I may live in his mansion...

409
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,233
but I'm not Lex.

410
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:45,901
You can trust me.

411
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:06,174
- You think she knows your secret?
- Well,

412
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:08,037
she didn't exactly
just come out and admit it.

413
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:09,201
Well, does she have to?

414
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,577
I mean, you saved her
by flying out of a falling jet.

415
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:13,233
First of all, we didn't fly.
We sort of jumped.

416
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,000
And she was unconscious the whole time.

417
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:18,462
Well, whatever the case, she knows too much,
and she's getting closer by the minute.

418
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:20,633
So it's time to take extreme measures.

419
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:24,268
You need to quit the Daily Planet and put
the red-blue blur back into the closet.

420
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:27,673
I'm not changing my life because
Tess Mercer might know my secret.

421
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:31,365
But she's beyond dangerous,
Clark. She tried to kill Lana.

422
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:34,734
Only because she was trying to destroy the
power suit. She was desperate to stop Lex.

423
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,133
I can't believe you're defending her.

424
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:40,031
I'm not sure she's like Lex.

425
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:45,763
Your ability to trust others and
always see the good in people is...

426
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:49,941
what makes you so special, but it's also
what keeps getting you into trouble.

427
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,417
You need to be careful.

428
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:56,301
And I have to go.

429
00:36:56,734 --> 00:37:01,283
Jimmy's battle is finally over at Met Gen,
and I get to pick up my wounded soldier.

430
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:05,045
I didn't know he was coming home today.
How's he doing?

431
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,967
Great.

432
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:10,870
Jimmy and I made it out
of the dark forest, and...

433
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:14,918
from now on, it's gonna be
one long happily ever after.

434
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,397
No more than three tablets a day.

435
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:29,519
They can be highly addictive.

436
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:31,656
Good luck.

437
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,672
Hey.

438
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:38,718
You're not in this alone,
you know.

439
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:41,716
I know how much you enjoy
playing Florence Nightingale,

440
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:44,522
but I can take care of myself.

441
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,851
Jimmy, I know you're upset, but trust me,

442
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:54,096
I just stopped you from doing something you
would've regretted the rest of your life.

443
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,368
Davis came after me,
and I was protecting myself.

444
00:37:56,501 --> 00:38:00,334
But you don't believe me. You'd
rather believe anyone else but me.

445
00:38:00,568 --> 00:38:03,101
People are watching us.
Can we talk about this at home?

446
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,201
Home?

447
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:07,467
We have no home, Chloe.

448
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:11,734
Okay, you still have a lot
of drugs in your system, and...

449
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:15,167
No. No, no, no.
My mind has never been so clear.

450
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,542
I have put up with years of your
taking someone else's side over mine...

451
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,104
first Clark and then Davis?

452
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:24,487
Look, I realize now...

453
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,847
that you just don't trust me.

454
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,848
You never have.

455
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,800
Of course I trust you, Jimmy. I trust
you with my whole heart. I'm your wife.

456
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:40,100
And that's what I don't understand,
why the hell did you even marry me?!

457
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:41,867
- Sir, settle down.
- I'm fine!

458
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,733
We were just leaving.

459
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,180
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Come on, Jimmy.

460
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:48,813
We can work through this.

461
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:52,632
I am done trying to make this work.

462
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,730
Marrying you...

463
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:00,260
was the biggest mistake of my life.

464
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,201
Mr. Olsen, Ms. Mercer is not in.

465
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:29,900
I cannot let you in here!
I'm calling security!

466
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,134
Don't bother. I quit.

467
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,421
And if she really wants to move
more papers, tell her to put this...

468
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:35,768
at the top of her to-do list.
