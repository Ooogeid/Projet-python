Take your squad.
Sweep the perimeter. Go.

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,090
What's our status?

4
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,590
Security breach --northeast sector.

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,090
What have the surveillance
cameras picked up?

6
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,290
Not a damn thing.

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,190
Anything comes down this tunnel, kill it.
-Got it.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,390
Contact?
-Tunnel 7.

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,890
Wait.

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,190
Section "f" compromised.

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,490
Lock it down.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,590
Section "D."compromised

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,990
That's only 30 meters from here.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,590

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,290
Maybe this wasn'tsuch a good idea.
-Section "A."compromised

19
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,990
Mission accomplished.

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,590
Standing by for further instructions.

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,490
Vitals are steady.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,990
He didn't even break a sweat.

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,090
2 minutes, 18 seconds to
infiltrate a secured facility,

24
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,990
disable my best men,
and eliminate the target.

25
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,890
Not a bad test run.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,590
Get some fresh guards.

27
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,790
I want to see him do it again.

We have about a dozen people
that could do that for you.

32
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,290
Next thing you know,
they'll be brushing my teeth for me.

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,590
There are some things
I'd rather do on my own.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,790
Independent and not afraid
to get her hands dirty --

35
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,390
two of the billion or so reasons
I fell in love with you.

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,990
The shoulder's just still
a little bit sore.

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,190
Maybe we should have the doctor
look at it again.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,890
No, it's okay.

39
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,490
Lana, you were shot.

40
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,090
Takes more than a bullet
to stop a luthor.

41
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,690
Sir, senator burke has arrived.

42
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,390
Show him in.

43
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,390
You've been seeing a lot
of the senator recently.

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,390
The price of doing business
with the government.

45
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,290
But this will just take a minute.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,090
I'll be in the garden.

47
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,790
Mrs. Luthor.
-Senator

48
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,790
I hope I didn't interrupt a tender moment.

49
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,890
If you had, you'd still
be waiting outside.

50
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,590
I'm not gonna keep you
from your pretty lady.

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,590
I just, uh...swung by
for an update on ares.

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,190
The prototype is in the final
stages of testing.

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,090
Everything's on schedule.

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,790
Really?

55
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,690
I heard everything
was ahead of schedule --

56
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,190
way ahead.

57
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,890
I stuck my neck out
to get the armed services committee

58
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,290
to allow you access to military resources

59
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,290
and personnel to "r" and "d"
a single prototype,

60
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,990
but you've started gearing up
for mass production.

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,890
Just looking towards the future, senator.

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,490
I assumed a visionary like you
would understand that.

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,890
How long do you think
you're gonna be able

64
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,890
to keep what you've really
got going on here a secret?

65
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,290
See...

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,590
one of my own men believed he uncovered
a mole right in your backyard.

67
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,190
Who?

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,790
Well, I wish I could tell you,

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,890
but my boy doesn't talk too good
with a bullet through his heart.

70
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,390
Senator, if there are leaks in my security,

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,690
I assure you,
I will have them taken care of.

72
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,390
Well, doesn't that just fill me
with the warm fuzzies?

73
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,890
Do you know what'll happen to me

74
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,990
if the senate ever got wind
of what you're up to now?

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,590
I assume
they wouldn't care for it...

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,990
just like they wouldn't care
for all the money

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,190
I've transferred into your cayman
account over the last year.

78
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,290
Project ares is over.

79
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm shutting it down.

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,590
That would be ill-advised.

81
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,490
No.

82
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,790
What's ill-advised is you ever opening
your mouth about our arrangement.

83
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,090
I so much as hear a peep out of you,

84
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,690
I'll make sure the committee
reviews every business deal

85
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,090
luthorcorp has made
in the last 20 years,

86
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,890
and u'll be lucky to keep
that fancy shirt on your back.

87
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,990
Do we understand each other...

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,190
luthor?

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,990
Perfectly.

LUTHORCORP

91
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,990
***
-Yes

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,490
Greetings from patagonia,
the most beautiful place on earth.

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,190
What is that?

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,490
We have to talk.

95
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,790
Clark, you should, uh,
try picking up the phone occasionally --

96
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,090
might be quicker.

97
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,790
Oh, but maybe not.

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,090
What do you know about lana?

99
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,690
Letting go --

100
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,790
never been one of your strong points, was it?

101
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,190
Telling the truth was never one of yours.

102
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,190
And you're accusing me of what,
exactly, this time?

103
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,890
Lana came to me the day of the wedding

104
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,390
to tell me she wasn't going through with it,

105
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,490
that she was leaving lex.

106
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,890
Apparently, she changed her mind.

107
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,890
Or someone changed it for her.

108
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,090
So, you think I had something
to do with her decision?

109
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,790
If lana was so unhappy with lex,
why go through with the marriage?

110
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,690
It's surprising, clark,
what people will do when they, uh,

111
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,790
feel they have no other options.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,890
If I find out that you had anything to do
with lana marrying lex,

113
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,290
the gloves will come off.

114
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,690
How do you like that option?

115
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,290
Triple espresso mocha cappu latte --
my own invention,

116
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,490
guaranteed to put the zip-a-dee
back in your doo-dah.

117
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,590
Thanks.

118
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,490
Come on.It's not that bad.

119
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,490
Jimmy is coming back one day...

120
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,890
maybe.

121
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,590
You know, besides, distance
is good for the relationship.

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,290
That is what all the guys who've
moved away from me have said.

123
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,990
Lois, you should really stick
to investigative reporting

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,190
and out of the advice column.

125
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,790
That's the plan.

126
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,490
Hey, smallville.

127
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,090
Love to hear about the cows and the corn,

128
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,990
but I got a lead on a dirty senator
that needs to be hosed down.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,590
See you on the front page.

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,090
She going after a senator?

131
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,590
I guess so.
She hasn't told me much about it.

132
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,290
Lot of that going around lately.

133
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,890
Was that jab directed at my chin?

134
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,290
I went to lionel to ask about lana.

135
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,390
What did he say?

136
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,090
Nothing, just like you.

137
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,090
Did you forget what he did to you,
what he did to your mother?

138
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,590
No, I haven't forgotten.

139
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,690
I don't want anything to happen to lana.

140
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,190
Neither do I.

141
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,290
But if she's staying in that marriage,

142
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,790
all I can say is, she must have
a damn good reason.

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,490
Are you sure about this?

144
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,890
Got the reservation.

145
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,790
Eats here every time he's in town.

146
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,990
Voil?

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,490
Thanks for the tip.

148
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,190
Senator burke.

149
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,390
How do you do?

150
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,590
Lois lane, reporter.

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,290
I was hoping to ask a few questions.

152
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,190
Sure. Schedule an interview with my office.

153
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,190
You know, I tried to,
but no one returned my calls.

154
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,490
Well, that ought to tell you
something, sweet cakes.

155
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,890
Senator, last year,
your salary was $150,000.

156
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,590
Can you tell me how you managed to deposit
over $5 million in a cayman account?

157
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,290
What paper did you say
you work for, uh, miss...

158
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,890
lane -- lois lane.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm a reporter for the inquisitor.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,390
The inquisitor?

161
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,190
That's not a newspaper.That's a --

162
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,590
that's a cat-box liner.

163
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,190
Now get her out of here.

164
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,390
Hey, get your hands off me,you fascist!

165
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,790
I'm warning you!If you don't --

166
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,590
Oh, my god.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,990
Wes?

168
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,590
Chloe, what's going on?

169
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,490
You haven't heard?
Senator burke was murdered.

170
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,190
What?

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,090
It looks like burke was in bed with la famiglia.

172
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,490
He crossed them.
They gave him the fredo treatment.

173
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,390
It's a mob hit.

174
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,690
Well, all evidence points to that,

175
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,290
but there is one witness
who doesn't think so.

176
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,890
Lois?
-Thanks.

177
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,890
What happened to you?

178
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,090
well, one minute, I was
harassing a public official,

179
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,590
and the next, he came
out of nowhere, like a ghost.

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,690
Burke and his men never had a chance.

181
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,690
Y-you saw who did this?

182
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,790
Yeah, I did more than see him,
clark -- I know him.

183
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,790
His name's wes keenan.

184
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,590
We were army brats together
when we were kids.

185
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,390
I'm running a check on his name.

186
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,690
Looks like he works for the mob now.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,290
Wes? No way.

188
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,590
He's career military.

189
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,890
He's been decorated more than a christmas tree.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,190
Even my dad loved him,
and the general hates everybody.

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,690
Lois, are you sure
the man you saw is wes keenan?

192
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,790
I haven't seen him for years,

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,890
but he has this little scar
above his right eye, and --

194
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,090
trust me.It was wes.

195
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,490
Not according to the U.S. Government.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,690
He was in a helicopter crash
in afghanistan four months ago.

197
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,690
He was killed in action.

198
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,490
No, that is not possible.

199
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,390
I know what I saw.

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,090
What else does it say?
-Nothing.

201
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,990
I mean, his military records
have been classified.

202
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,990
What is that?

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,390
His alpha wave just spiked for a second.

204
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,690
It's probably just feedback
from the implants in his cortex.

205
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,790
Probably?

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,290
It's nothing to worry about.

207
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,790
Everything's still holding
within operational parameters.

208
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,490
Make sure it stays that way.

209
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,790
Sir.

210
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,890
Just received information
that burke's been eliminated.

211
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,490
Evidence trail?

212
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,790
Leads straight back to the mob,
per your instructions.

213
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,490
There's been a complication.

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,890
There was a witness.

215
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,890
Nothing can get in the way
of completing this project --

216
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,490
nothing.

217
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,090
Take care of it.

218
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,090
You heard the man.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,090
Prep him.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,090
Lois, quit being stubborn.

221
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,290
You're gonna stay here
until we get this cleared up.

222
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,590
Thanks, but I can take care of myself.

223
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,390
Nobody's doubting that,
but you'd be safer here at the farm.

224
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,190
It'll be like old times,
like when you first got to smallville.

225
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,390
Oh, you're just hoping
to catch me in the shower again.

226
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,990
I-I mean, um, thank you.

227
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,890
I-I really appreciate it.

228
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,690
You're always welcome here, lois.

229
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,590
You're practically family.

230
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,290
well,since I'm being a burden,
can I just ask one more favor?

231
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,590
What do you need?

232
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,890
Your mom's political influence.

233
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,290
Look, do you think that

234
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,990
you could use your connections to get a look
at wes' military jacket?

235
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,390
I thought you said
that file was classified.

236
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,690
It is.

237
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,390
I contacted the general,but, uh,

238
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,290
he went all cold war on me
and said that I should drop it.

239
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,690
He might have a point.

240
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,990
Three men are already dead.

241
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,490
Which is why I have to get
my hands on that file.

242
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,590
It might explain why wes is doing this.

243
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,890
Well, I've made a few friends in washington.

244
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,290
I don't know if they can help,
but I'll see what I can do.

245
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,490
Thanks, mrs. Kent.

246
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,590
I know that look,

247
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,890
and it's usually followed by you almost
getting yourself killed.

248
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,990
This isn't just another story, clark --

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,490
not this time.

250
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,190
Wes and I --

251
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,390
we were close.

252
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,590
I know it was him.

253
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,390
Stay here.

254
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,790
See?It was just the wind.

255
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,490
Clark, watch out!

256
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,590
Wes?

257
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,190
How could lois have been kidnapped
with you standing right there?

258
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,890
She just vanished, chloe,literally.

259
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,090
So, he could teleport, like alicia?

260
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,390
But something's different.

261
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,090
It's more like what graham garrett could do.

262
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,790
So, he can turn himself invisible?

263
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,590
Not just himself --
he took lois with him.

264
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,190
And it's not his only ability.

265
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,890
When he hit me --

266
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,390
chloe, I haven't felt anything like that
since I went up against titan.

267
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,590
Clark, we need to find lois before wes --

268
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,990
we will.

269
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,490
Were you able to uncover
anything about wes

270
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,490
that might be able to help us
figure out where he took her?

271
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,190
I haven't been able to retrieve any
information from the military files,

272
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,690
but I did run a cross-check on his name,
and I found one hit --

273
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,990
jodi keenan.

274
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,590
Jodi keenan?

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,890
Isn't that the woman who tried
to kill lex in the tunnels?

276
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,290
Guess who she's married to.
-Wes?

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,090
Looks like jodi found out that wes
wasn't killed in afghanistan.

278
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,990
She followed the trail
all the way back here to lex.

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,090
Okay, so, wes is exhibiting
multiple krypto-abilities.

280
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,390
And according to lois,

281
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,290
he's also on the receiving end
of some sort of mind control.

282
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,590
How much do you want to bet that all of
this plays into lex's 33.1 experiments?

283
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,890
Chloe, I need you to contact
oliver and his team.

284
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,990
They've been taking out 33.1 facilities
all around the world.

285
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,090
Don't you think that's
a hero-to-hero phone call?

286
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,590
I'm gonna talk to lex.

287
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,990
Clark, come on.

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,390
We both know that lex
isn't gonna tell you anything.

289
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,890
Then I'll find somebody who will.

290
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,390
Too much?

291
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,690
No, it'S...

292
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,190
I thought maybe if I set the mood...

293
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,190
or maybe not.

294
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,390
Lex...

295
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,790
Sorry to bother you, sir.

296
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,590
The asset failed to return.

297
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,990
I'll be right back.

298
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,290
Lana.

299
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,990
You shouldn't be here.
Lex is just outside.

300
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,390
I had to see you.

301
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,190
Clark...

302
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,190
it's not about you and me.

303
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,290
Lois is in trouble.

304
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,090
And what makes you think I can help?

305
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,290
'Cause it seems there's a connection to lex.

306
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,190
Lana, if you've seen
or heard anything --

307
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,190
maybe something about the military...

308
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,790
ares.

309
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,490
That's the god of war.

310
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,290
Lex has been talking to senator burke
about this military project called "ares."

311
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,790
Yesterday, he threatened to shut it down.

312
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,390
Maybe you should talk with him.

313
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,790
I can'T.

314
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,990
Senator burke is dead.

315
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,490
He was murdered by the same man
who has lois.

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,690
Lana, is there anything else --

317
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,990
maybe something that lex let slip?

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,690
One of his men was just saying something
about an asset that failed to return.

319
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,190
An asset?

320
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,190
That's what the military
calls its soldiers.

321
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,090
Lex is connected to this.

322
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,290
Lana, whatever reason you had
to go through with the wedding,

323
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,490
it was the wrong choice.

324
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,990
You have no idea what he's capable of.

325
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,590
You'd be surprised what I know.

326
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,290
Then why are you still here?

327
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,590
We all have our secrets,clark.

328
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,790
Sometimes,we have to keep them to protect
the people that we care about.

329
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,290
Lana...

330
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,790
I know.

331
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,290
Lana?

332
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,790
You okay?

333
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,090
Yeah, yeah.I'm just a little chilly.

334
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,490
Look,something's come up.

335
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,690
I need to go in to the office.

336
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,390
Don't wait up.

337
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,690
Wes.

338
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,890
Designation incorrect.

339
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,390
Call sign "ares,"prototype mark iv.

340
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,690
You don't remember me,do you?

341
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,790
It's lois -- lois lane.

342
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,090
My father is general sam lane.

343
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,790
When I was a kid,

344
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,890
he used to drag me around to all the bases
that he was stationed at.

345
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,390
One of them was fort addleson,
where I met you.

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,890
Do you remember how you got that scar?

347
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,390
You used to tell everybody that you got it
falling off your dirt bike.

348
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,090
But that's not how it happened.

349
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,590
We got into the general's whiskey.

350
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,790
Then we broke into the storage warehouse.

351
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,790
We were wrestling around, being stupid.

352
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,690
And I kissed you...

353
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,390
...the first timeI ever kissed anybody.

354
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,890
And you smiled your crooked smile.

355
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,490
And then you puked and passed out and
cracked your head open on the floor.

356
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,690
Never could handle your liquor, wes.

357
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,390
Mission incomplete.
-No.

358
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,290
Eliminate target.

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,290
Why did you bring me here?

360
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,290
Think.Wes.

361
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,990
This is fort addleson, okay?

362
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,890
This is the warehouse.

363
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,590
This is where I kissed you that night.

364
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,890
Remember me!

365
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,090
Mr. Luthor.

366
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,190
Three years and a billion
dollars spent on ares,

367
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,690
and you're telling me you lost him?

368
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,090
Well, we're in unchartered
territory here, mr. Luthor.

369
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,090
Synthesizing multiple meteor
abilities is difficult enough,

370
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,490
but stringing together the molecular chain

371
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,090
with peptides extracted from that creature
that bartlett recovered --

372
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,890
the only thing that allows all these
abilities to exist in one subject.

373
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,590
Titan's genetic material was the key
to making this project viable.

374
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,190
Yes, which makes the results

375
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,290
as unpredictable as the substances
I'm being asked to work with.

376
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,390
What you're being asked to do
is help protect the world, doctor.

377
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,690
Unstable criminals with dangerous
powers are becoming more and more common.

378
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,390
Humanity's only chance of surviving
the onslaught is this project.

379
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,590
So, kick that big brain of yours
into high gear

380
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,690
and figure out what the hell went wrong!

381
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,490
It's possible something might have
triggered a decay in his memory blocks --

382
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,390
a familiar place or person.

383
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,290
Can't you get a fix on him?

384
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,890
The field he generates makes it impossible
to track him electronically.

385
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,190
It's part of his design.

386
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,690
I want our dog back on his leash, doctor,

387
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,990
or you'll be my next experiment.

388
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,190
Maybe I could reposition
the luthorcorp satellites...

389
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,190
...generate a broad-spectrum
pulse that will, hopefully,

390
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,790
re-initiate his command directives,
but there's no guarantee.

391
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,990
I'm not asking for guarantees.

392
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,190
I'm asking for results.

393
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,690
I want ares back online
and his mission complete.

394
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,090
Start the pulse.

395
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,590
I killed a united states senator?

396
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,190
What happened?

397
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,990
How did you end up like this?

398
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,390
I was stationed in afghanistan.

399
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,590
Our convoy hit an I.E.D.

400
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,490
And then I woke up in the military hospital.

401
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,890
That's when luthor showed up.

402
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,790
Lex.

403
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,690
I should have known.

404
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,590
He forced you into this, didn't he?

405
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,990
He offered me a way
to keep serving my country.

406
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,590
By turning you into a brain-dead assassin?

407
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,590
You think this is what I signed on for?

408
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,290
He told me project ares was gonna
help soldiers protect themselves on the field,

409
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,390
so they wouldn't end up like I did.

410
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,290
We won't let him get away
with this, I promise you.

411
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,190
Okay, we will expose lex and project ares.

412
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,090
What? What?What is it? What?

413
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,790
Them --

414
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,690
they're trying
to get back into my head.

415
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,890
Well, fight it, wes.
Look at me. Look at me!

416
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,990
Run. Run!Run!

417
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,890
I think lex was experimenting on wes,

418
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,790
trying to make him into a supersoldier.

419
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,990
With pick-and-choose meteor powers --

420
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,790
oliver told me pretty much the same thing.

421
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,790
Oliver knew about wes?

422
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,790
No. He found an earlier model
in the utah desert.

423
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,390
It looks like this isn't the first time

424
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,690
one of lex's souped-up rambos has gone awol.

425
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,590
Was he able to stop him?
-Barely.

426
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,190
It took the equivalent of a mini-nuk
to break through his force field.

427
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,790
Clark, even if you find him,
I'm not sure --

428
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,390
maybe this will help --

429
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,290
wes' military jacket.

430
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,590
How did you get that?

431
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,590
Called in a few favors and had to promise
a couple dozen of my own.

432
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,790
Lois is right.Wes was a hero.

433
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,790
He took her instead of killing her.

434
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,390
you know If whatever programming
they're using to control wes is failing,

435
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,390
maybe he'll go back to a place he remembers.

436
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,590
Somewhere he lived or --or was stationed.

437
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,590
The military base that wes grew up on
was decommissioned a few years ago --

438
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,290
fort addleson,just outside of metropolis.

439
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,490
Sam lane was stationed there
when lois was in junior high.

440
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,590
Maybe that's where --

441
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,590
Do you ever get used to that?
-Not really.

442
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,190
Wes?

443
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,790
You have to fight this.

444
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,090
Don't let them do this to you again.

445
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,690
You are not a murderer.

446
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,590
Please.

447
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,190
Wes.

448
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,290
Wes.

449
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,390
System...damaged.

450
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,790
Turn protocol 38529532...

451
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,190
wes.

452
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,790
...38.

453
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,590
Lois.

454
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,290
You're gonna be fine.

455
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,290
Do you understand me?
You're gonna be okay.

456
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,690
I'm gonna go get help,all right?

457
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,490
No.

458
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,690
Better this way.

459
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,090
They'll never...

460
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,390
stop trying...

461
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,490
to control me.

462
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,290
You have to stay with me.
Do you hear me?

463
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,890
Don'T...

464
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,190
let them do this...

465
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,890
to anyone else.

466
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,390
Okay?
-Okay.

467
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,390
I promise, but you just
stay with me, okay?

468
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,190
Don't leave me.

469
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,490
Wes?

470
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,890
wes?

471
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,390
No, no, no.No.

472
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,290
Wes?

473
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,590
Wes!

474
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,190
Come on!

475
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,690
Don't leave me!

476
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,990
kent farm

477
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,590
How does this happen?

478
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,690
All wes wanted to do
was serve his country,

479
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,490
and he wound up being used as a pawn.

480
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,590
It happens more than I'd like to think.

481
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,390
Well, now that senator burke is gone --

482
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,090
oh, burke isn't the only one
on the hill lining his pockets.

483
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,490
Wherever there's power,
there will be men like lex to exploit it.

484
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,590
Maybe you can do something,
maybe open an investigation.

485
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,590
Clark, I'm a little fish in a tiny pond.

486
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,190
My influence doesn't reach
nearly that far up.

487
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,790
Then perhaps it's time
to extend that influence.

488
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,890
I just got off the phone
with the governor.

489
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,490
We were talking about your
filling burke's senatorial seat

490
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,090
until the next election.

491
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,090
Me?

492
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,190
Kansas needs to be represented
by someone of unassailable character

493
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,790
who can restore the faith
that burke has tarnished.

494
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,390
The governor agreed.

495
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,490
You are the perfect choice
for the U.S. Senate.

496
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,690
Clark...

497
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,590
you agree?

498
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,090
You should do it, mom.

499
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,990
I think you should do it.

500
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,090
And I think dad would have wanted you to.

501
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,790
I-I can't move to washington.

502
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,790
We're barely keeping the farm
running as it is.

503
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,290
Clark can take care of that.
Can't you, clark?

504
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,890
I could lease out the back 40
to ben hubbard.

505
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,890
He's been wanting
to work that land for years.

506
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,590
Oh, clark.

507
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,290
You and dad always taught me
to put other people first,

508
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,490
to use my abilities
to help those in need.

509
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,790
You have the chance
to affect so many people,

510
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,990
to change so many lives
if you go to washington.

511
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,690
That's where you need to be if
you really want to make a difference, mom.

512
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,790
And it's where people like wes
need you to be.

513
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,890
I don't care what it takes.

514
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,090
I want the body transported
to the lab immediately.

515
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,990
Make it happen.

516
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,090
Hey, you're up.

517
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,090
For a while now.

518
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,090
You never came home last night.

519
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,590
There was an unforeseen
complication with project ares.

520
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,390
Ares?

521
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,690
The secret military project I was discussing
with senator burke yesterday...

522
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,290
when you were listening outside the door.

523
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,390
Lex, I'm sorry.

524
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,890
There is no excuse.

525
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,690
My curiosity got the best of me.

526
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,490
You're not a cat, lana.

527
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,890
Don't skulk around like one.

528
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,690
It won't happen again.

529
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,090
Every time I've opened my heart
to someone I care about,

530
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,890
I've ended up being very disappointed.

531
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,190
If --

532
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,490
if you ever betrayed me...

533
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,490
I don't know what I'd do.

534
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,790
I'd never hurt the man I love.

535
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,090
Of course not.

536
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,790
But if there's anything you ever want to know
about my business dealings...

537
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,690
just ask.

538
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,290
No secrets?

539
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,090
No secrets.

540
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,290
Mrs. Kent goes to washington.

541
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,490
Well, if anyone can give jimmy stewart
a run for his money...

542
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,590
I just wish lionel wasn't helping her.

543
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,190
What, you think the king of ulterior motives

544
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,790
may have something up his armani sleeve?

545
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,190
When doesn't he?

546
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,190
Just, right now,
his son's a bigger problem.

547
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,190
That's the understatement of the century.

548
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,990
I mean, we've always known
lex has a dark side,

549
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,790
but with what he's been doing recently,

550
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,690
we're headed towards pitch black.

551
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,290
I want to make sure that lana's nowhere
near him when the lights go out.

552
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,090
Hopefully, he'll be behind bars
long before that.

553
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,990
I mean, lois is meeting the feds
at the morgue.

554
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,590
And once they connect wes' body with lex
and then burke's murder.

555
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,290
Don't hold your breath.

556
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,890
Wes' body's gone.

557
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,890
What about the feds?

558
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,490
What did they say when you
told them what happened?

559
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,090
I work at the inquisitor --

560
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,090
you know, aliens,bigfoot, elvis.

561
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,190
What do you think they said?

562
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,590
As far as they're concerned,wes keenan
died in action four months ago.

563
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,190
Just like it said in his file.

564
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,390
He deserved better than this.

565
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,390
Lois, I'm sorry.

566
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,790
Don't be sorry for me.

567
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,890
Be sorry for lex.

568
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,190
He's gonna pay for what he did to wes,

569
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,490
and I'm gonna make damn sure that
he doesn't do this to anyone else.

570
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,490
You were almost perfect.

571
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,090
Take him apart.

572
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,890
I want to know exactly what went wrong

573
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,490
so we don't make the same mistake next time.

574
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,490
Quantitating the abnormality
won't do us any good,mr. Luthor.

575
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,790
We used up nearly everything
we harvested from titan.

576
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,890
There aren't enough alien peptide
sequences to continue the project.

577
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,890
I'm already working
on procuring a replacement.

578
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,090
I promise you, doctor,

579
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,390
this isn't the end of project ares.

580
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,390
This is just the beginning.
