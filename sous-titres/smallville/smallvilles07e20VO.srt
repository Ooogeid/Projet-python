1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,676
Previously on smallville

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,479
I know you killed lionel.

3
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:07,300
Two lockets exist.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,100
These keys unlock the secret
of controlling you.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
I tried to be
your friend, lex.

6
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:14,900
What happened to you?

7
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:16,700
I'm a meteor freak.

8
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,447
You're my cousin, kara.
I care about you.

9
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,000
"The traveler will bring
great change to the earth."

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,400
I just hope i can live up to what
everyone thinks i'm supposed to be.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,100
I love you, clark kent.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,100
What happened?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,000
It's brainiac.
He's done something.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,400
You're too late, kal-El.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,350
- What is he after now?
- Me.

16
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm edward teague,

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,500
the last surving
member of veritas.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
You're so caught up in your own
delusions, you've lost track of reality.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,548
Someone has to protect
the world.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,453
If lex knows that you're
the traveler, game over.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,400
And now the season finale
of "smallville."

22
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,600
Another secret identity,
mr. Teague?

23
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,679
Excuse me?

24
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,700
Why is it that
when people are in trouble,

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,700
They run to south america?

26
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,600
Young lady,

27
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,000
When i chartered this jet,
i was promised a discreet journey.

28
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm not interested
in having a conversation.

29
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm not big
on small talk, either.

30
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,400
I'd rather hear about veritas.

31
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:38,900
Who are you?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Someone that knows the traveler

33
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,900
And that you tried
to destroy him.

34
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:49,300
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
You know...

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For the last surving member
of a secret society,

37
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:02,500
You're not a very good liar.

38
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,700
The device
that controls the traveler...

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,485
- Where is it?
- Let me go.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,061
20,000 feet up, mr. Teague.
Tell me where the device is,

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Or you'll be starting your
descent earlier than expected.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,665
What the hell are you doing

43
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,800
One last chance.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Tell me where the device is.

45
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,300
Lex luthor.

46
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,885
He might have the answers
you're looking for.

47
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,600
Enjoy the rest
of your live.

48
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,990
Smallville 720 : final season

49
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,603
Synchro : flolo
transcript : swsub.Com

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
For seriessub.Com

51
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,025
Mr. Luthor?

52
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,966
Has the team
reached the target?

53
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,307
We lost contact an hour ago.

54
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:16,568
They may have run into a bad patch of
weather, some kind of interference.

55
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,300
The satellite shows clear skies
over the arctic

56
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,900
They were less than 10 miles
away when the signal cut out.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,775
We tried to get a visual, but...

58
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,401
There's no sign of them,
just like the last team.

59
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,700
I thought the bermuda triangle
was somewhere a little more tropical

60
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,400
People don't just vanish
off the face of the planet.

61
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,015
Find them.

62
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:43,496
Sorry. Hey, boss.

63
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:46,000
If this is about my article
proposal, i got a great idea...

64
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:49,000
Two-Page spread, color glossies
from the kawatche caves.

65
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,870
It'll make national geographic look
like a 10-Cent travel brochure.

66
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,171
We'll talk
about your proposal later.

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, okay.

68
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:59,600
Jimmy, my phone call to the
department of domestic security

69
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Kept chloe
out of federal prison.

70
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,400
Now i need your help.

71
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:07,697
What do you need?

72
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,300
Lois lane off my back.

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,300
She's been asking too many
people too many questions.

74
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:18,298
What can i do? I mean, lois
isn't exactly a pushover.

75
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,500
It's impossible to break her
full-Court power of the press.

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,803
I'm well aware
of your limitations.

77
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,800
Just help her
find some information.

78
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,570
Is any of this true?

79
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,439
What matters is
you make her believe it's true.

80
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,997
So you want me to lie?

81
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,016
I want you to do
whatever it takes.

82
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,100
It would be tragic
if the dds decided chloe

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Was a threat
to national security after all.

84
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,700
Hey, get the lead out, smallville.
Opportunity is knocking on your door.

85
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,599
Come on in, lois.

86
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,900
Big news. An intern just got
promoted to chloe's old desk.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Am i supposed to be happy
that someone took my best friend's job?

88
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,911
Absolutely.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,700
'Cause it opens upa spot and guess
whose name is written all over it.

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,125
Got your application
right here.

91
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,757
That's never gonna happen.

92
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:36,788
Now, if you would excuse me,
i have chores to do.

93
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,900
Seriously, clark,
don't you think you're destined

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,794
For greater things in life
than working on a farm?

95
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,561
Even if i wanted the job,
lois, i'd never work for lex luthor.

96
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:52,300
Okay, then, why were you such
great friends with the guy?

97
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:56,600
Looking into lex's past, i found out
just how far you two go back.

98
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,006
You're nothing alike.

99
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,900
Why were you so close
for so long?

100
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:08,381
Sometimes people don't turn out to be
what you thought they were.

101
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,700
Lois, if you're gonna continue
working for lex,

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,693
Promise me you'll be careful.

103
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,800
You know, if i didn't
know any better, smallville,

104
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,711
I'd think
you were worried about me.

105
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,700
Can i talk to clark
for a second?

106
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:32,279
Yeah, i think we're done here.

107
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,380
Just think about
your future, okay?

108
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,200
So, a private jet just went down
over unetate new york.

109
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,859
Three bodies were recovered,
and one was identified as

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,800
Edward teague.

111
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:56,499
I had to use every skill
in my hacking arsenal,

112
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,499
But once i found out
about this plane crash,

113
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,399
I made my way into the ntsb mainframe.
Now, according to the flight plan,

114
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,200
They were on their way
to buenos aires.

115
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,156
They were only in the air
for about an hour

116
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:08,600
When something shot out
of the cabin like a missile.

117
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:12,129
- What do you mean, "shot out"?
- Well the copilot went to the back

118
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Find out what was going on,
and he was knocked unconscious.

119
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,299
Do they have any idea
what it was?

120
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,200
No.
They found the black box,

121
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
And i was able
to download this audio.

122
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,400
Something's wrong.

123
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,757
Felt like some kind of
collision in the cabin.

124
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,462
We're losing air pressure.
I'm going back to take a look.

125
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,400
What the hell are you doing?

126
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,800
After that, it's all garbled.

127
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,500
I tried running it through
the filter about a dozen times, but...

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,571
I could only come up
with noise.

129
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:44,038
Play it again.

130
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,800
Tell me where the device is,

131
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Or you'll be starting your
descent earlier than expected.

132
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:07,021
What's she doing
with edward teague?

133
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:08,784
I don't know.

134
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,267
But i just heard her threaten
to bring the plane down.

135
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,100
Well, we both know how reckless
she can when she's angry.

136
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,762
Maybe she found out that teague
was after you again.

137
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:22,097
There must be some other explanation,
chloe. She's not a killer.

138
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,143
Look, clark,

139
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm a fan of kara's, as well,
but unless you're hearing things,

140
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,899
It sounds like
she caused that accident.

141
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,121
Remember what you said
when she first got here?

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Just about every kryptonian
you've ever met

143
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,500
Turned out to be
a cold-Blooded killer.

144
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,906
I know her.

145
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,829
She's my cousin.

146
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:42,400
She's not a killer.

147
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,197
I just need to find her.

148
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,529
Is there any more audio?

149
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,748
There's a little more noise.

150
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,797
What is it?

151
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,000
She's going after lex.

152
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,800
What are you doing here,
kara?

153
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,843
Trying to protect you.

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,121
By threatening
to kill edward teague?

155
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,512
I heard the recording.
Those men are dead.

156
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,989
Tell me you're not responsible
for their plane going down.

157
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,225
It's teague's fault.

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
If he hadn't gone after the
traveler, he'd still be alive.

159
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,900
We need to talk.

160
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,048
- Let go of me.
- Kara, i've been worried about you.

161
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,639
But i guess i should've been
worried about everyone else.

162
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,048
Have you come into contact
with red kryptonite

163
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,000
-  A ring, a necklace?
- I stopped wearing jewelry.

164
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,723
Well, then, something must have
happened when you went back to krypton.

165
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,900
Do you remember
anything strange?

166
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm fine, kal-El.

167
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:47,100
Look, three people are dead
because of you.

168
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,400
And if someone figured out
how to control you,

169
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,430
A lot more would die.

170
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:53,900
You would most powerful
weapon on the planet

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,276
No one is gonna control me
anytime soon.

172
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:00,262
Lex didn't find
what he was looking for.

173
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:04,308
You think that's gonna stop
a man like him ?

174
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,399
- Get your head out of the clouds, clark.
- Something's wrong with you, kara.

175
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,890
You need to stay here
till we figure out what it is.

176
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,307
You can turn a blind eye.

177
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:19,931
But i'm gonna do
whatever it takes to save earth.

178
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,500
I know the daily planet's
not half as hip,

179
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,400
But last i checked, your desk
is still in the bullpen,

180
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,416
You know,
across the street.

181
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,200
Well, i doubt lex
would be thrilled

182
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,200
If i spilled all his secret in the
same place he signs my checks.

183
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,717
Plus, this place
has an epic happy hour.

184
00:13:57,848 --> 00:13:59,884
Well, speaking of secrets,

185
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:02,200
I found something out
about those mystery expeditions

186
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,098
He's been sending
to the north pole.

187
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:11,500
Either he's planning a hostile
takeover of santa's workshop,

188
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Or he's doing
something illegal.

189
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,800
And since i'm sure lex isn't
into the christmas spirit,

190
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,470
- What's the scoop?
- Well, i'm sorry to say it.

191
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,400
He's just scouting
for new places to drill oil.

192
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,956
What? Where did you find that out?

193
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:27,246
I... heard a reporter talking
about it on the third floor.

194
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,497
Who?

195
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:34,500
You know, i don't know.
I just kind of overheard it.

196
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,908
I mean, you've been up there.
It's crowded.

197
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,611
Would you just take a look?

198
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,400
Surveyor photos
of potential drilling sites.

199
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:01,900
How did jimmy olsen manage
to score such top-Secret stuff?

200
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:05,667
Lex was having them sorted
and scanned in the photo lab. I...

201
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:08,317
I saw my opportunity,
and i took it.

202
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,557
Just like you taught me.

203
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,300
Guess i'v been focus on lex i' been

204
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,500
Looking for a villain
in everyone, even you.

205
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,060
Sorry.

206
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,000
Hey, it's...
it's no big deal. Really.

207
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,600
Got more game
than i thought.

208
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,200
Thanks.

209
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:56,300
The little "v" with the stars...

210
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,366
Something to do
with veritas, right?

211
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,571
I don't know
what you're talking about.

212
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:10,000
Why is it that every time
i bring up veritas,

213
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,867
People seem to suffer
from sudden amnesia?

214
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:22,900
A secret society formed to control
a powerful alien from another planet?

215
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:32,600
"Veritas" also means "truth."

216
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:36,825
So, what do you say
we have some right now?

217
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:40,600
Look, i don't know
who you've been talking to...

218
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,500
I know about the transmissions
sent to virgil swann,

219
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:47,772
The ones telling him where to find
the device to control the traveler.

220
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,711
How did you hear about that?

221
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
The traveler and i...

222
00:16:57,815 --> 00:17:00,029
We're from the same planet.

223
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,100
You don't believe me.

224
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:24,000
The dam.

225
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:27,000
You are the one
who saved me.

226
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:31,200
You kept denying it. Why?

227
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:33,779
Why tell me now?

228
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,773
You didn't know it then, but
i saved you for a reason, lex.

229
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,200
It is your destiny
to defeat the traveler.

230
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,800
I know you have the device.

231
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,798
Now all of the pieces
are in place.

232
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,439
Now it's up to you.

233
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:03,100
If you really believe
i have this thing,

234
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,900
Why don't you just take it
and do it yourself?

235
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,500
Apparently, the orb was built
to protect the human race.

236
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:14,221
So only a human can use it.

237
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:21,000
It showed me
a set of coordinates

238
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,100
Somewhere in the arctic.

239
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,200
Directions to his fortress.

240
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:29,400
You need to take it there
to control the traveler.

241
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,754
Two of my advance teams, they...
they disappeared trying to get there.

242
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,512
Maybe they didn't have a kryptonian
to help them.

243
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,900
Well, you're talking about
destroying one of your own kind.

244
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,900
I'd always thought
the traveler was meant for good.

245
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,200
Even he thinks he is.

246
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,738
When i went home to krypton,
i learned the truth about his fate.

247
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,600
He won't save man kind.

248
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,000
He'll destroy it.

249
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,100
Who is it?

250
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,800
Don't you already know?

251
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:46,342
Breaking out
the heavy artillery.

252
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,900
It's not every day that you see clark
kent clutching a box of kryptonite.

253
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:53,102
It's the only way
to stop her.

254
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:56,800
So, i'm guessing face time
with kara didn't go so well.

255
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,800
Kara's convinced that someone
will try to use me as a weapon.

256
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,400
She thinks
i'm not doing enough to stop it.

257
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:15,765
What if she's right?

258
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,400
Clark, kara's a lot of things.

259
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,700
Reckless, headstrong,
possibly psychotic but

260
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
She's wrong about you.

261
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:27,788
You've done everything you can
to stop veritas and more. You know that.

262
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,352
Obviously she doesn't.

263
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:42,200
Chloe, you're the only one
who can help me.

264
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm always here for you, clark.

265
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:53,300
Look, you...
you won't be doing it alone.

266
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,200
We'll get her here together,
and i'll stand right by your side.

267
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,500
Clark, if we're gonna wield
this kind of weaponry,

268
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,992
Don't shoot yourself
in the foot. This little green rock

269
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Ll knock down every kryptonian
in the room.

270
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,630
You can't be around
when we lift the lid.

271
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,200
Let me do this.

272
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:22,304
Your jet's fueled
and waiting, sir.

273
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,200
Tell them one more passenger
is coming.

274
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,000
Where are we going?

275
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,457
You're not going anywhere,
jimmy.

276
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,900
Look, i know
that you're busy, lex

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,943
I just wanted you to know
that i did what you told me to do.

278
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:40,353
Lois thinks that you're
all about the oil up north now.

279
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,600
Well done.

280
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:49,200
So, i guess wax on, wax off,
we're even now, right?

281
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,589
I believe our arrangement
has just begun.

282
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:54,400
I want regular reports
ons lane's activities.

283
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,324
Hey, i did what you said. I shouldn't
have to spy for you, too.

284
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,879
- That's not fair.
- Life is rarely fair, jimmy.

285
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,500
Look, lex,

286
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:05,720
I would really like to help, but...
lying, it's just, uh,

287
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:08,299
You know, it's not my thing.
I mean, it's eating me up.

288
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,900
It actually...
it's making my stomach hurt.

289
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,635
Well, it's never too late
to learn a new skill.

290
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,043
Look...

291
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm sorry, i just...

292
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,279
I can't do it.

293
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:25,900
But trust me, i'm not gonna say a
single word to anyone about your...

294
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:27,900
Oil drilling.

295
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:31,416
Please, you got to understand.

296
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:35,025
I can't spy on my friend.

297
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,900
I respect your integrity, jimmy.

298
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:48,300
It took a lot to come here
and lay your cards on the table.

299
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,100
Thanks.

300
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:57,730
Now, if you'll step aside,
i have a plane to catch

301
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:00,501
You bet.

302
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:05,500
Have a great trip, lex.

303
00:23:14,856 --> 00:23:16,900
Kara, there's something wrong
with clark.

304
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
He's convinced that
if he destroys the fortress

305
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,166
That no one
will be able to control him.

306
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,503
We're at my apartment.
I need your help.

307
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,434
Where's clark?

308
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,671
He's, uh, right back here.

309
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,271
- Why isn't it working?
- Check the expiration date?

310
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,200
Kara, there's something
seriously wrong with you.

311
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,503
- It was the only way...
- You lied to me.

312
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,200
Clark's not here.

313
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,124
Oh, god.

314
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:58,193
I'm impressed.

315
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:01,900
I wouldn't have thought a member
of your weak-Willed species,

316
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,900
Especially a friend
of kal-El's,

317
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,876
Could ever use kryptonite
against his cousin.

318
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,500
Let me go.

319
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:11,600
I remember you.

320
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:17,100
Always sticking
your pretty little head

321
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,700
Where it doesn't belong.

322
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,900
What the hell are you?

323
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:55,800
Sir?

324
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,800
Tell the pilot
to start the engines.

325
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:01,239
I thought we were waiting
for your guide.

326
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,572
I don't need her.

327
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,800
Not sure i should even trust her.

328
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:08,200
But, sir, the last few teams
have all disappeared.

329
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,500
I believe i have everything
i need to reach my destination.

330
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,500
This is meant
to protect all humanity.

331
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:21,414
- It should protect me, as well.
- You don't know that for sure, sir.

332
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,355
It seems
extremely dangerous.

333
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,400
It's worth the risk.

334
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,400
We leave now.

335
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,500
I'm so sorry.

336
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:08,700
Kara never came backfrom krypton, did she?

337
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,600
It was, uh... quite an impersonation,
wasn't it?

338
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:19,800
It was the only way
i could return to earth

339
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,000
Without you damaging me.

340
00:28:24,242 --> 00:28:25,500
You killed her.

341
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,900
Oh, no.
Something much worse.

342
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,400
You'll never see her again.

343
00:28:34,186 --> 00:28:35,400
Where is she?

344
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:37,217
I warned you.

345
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,199
If we had done things
my way

346
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,955
No one would have
gotten hurt...

347
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,529
No one but you.

348
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,200
So this is all about revenge?

349
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:48,100
This is a simple matter
of self-Preservation.

350
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,723
When i couldn't kill you,

351
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,500
I knew i had to control you.

352
00:28:51,602 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm in control now.

353
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:57,000
And you will release chloe!
You'll release lana!

354
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,600
The only way to save them

355
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,800
Would be to kill me now,

356
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,411
In cold blood,

357
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:05,800
Which goes against
everything you stand for.

358
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:09,300
You could never deliberately
take another man's life.

359
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,300
You're not a man.

360
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:15,000
You're a machine.

361
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,400
You can kill me, kal-El...

362
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,900
But your end is near.

363
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,600
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

364
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:37,000
You'll never hurt anyone else
ever again.

365
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:16,700
That's great news, chloe.
I'm glad you're okay.

366
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,661
I'll call you
after i check on lana.

367
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:32,936
What happened?

368
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:34,288
Is she okay?

369
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,100
Miss lang
had a full recovery.

370
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:39,136
It's something
of a miracle.

371
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,800
Where is she?
Can i see her?

372
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,400
Oh, she's already
checked out,

373
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:45,200
But she wanted me
to give you this.

374
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:04,200
I was going to wait,

375
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
To talk to you in person.

376
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,048
But i knew that if i looked
into your eyes,

377
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,800
I'd never be able to say it.

378
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,200
We thought that ht were
meant to be together, clark.

379
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,600
But the truth is,
we were fooling ourselves.

380
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,000
I need you...

381
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:31,800
But the world needs you more.

382
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:35,700
And as long as i'm in your life,
i am holding you back.

383
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:41,200
Please, don't come after me.

384
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,700
I love you, clark...

385
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,400
More than
you will ever know.

386
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:58,598
You just got out of the hospital,
chloe, so take it slow, okay?

387
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,600
You know what?
Maybe i should...

388
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,200
Yeah, i'll carry you
up the stairs.

389
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,500
Jimmy, we're climbing
the stairs to the talon,

390
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,600
Not scaling
the mountains of tibet. I'm fine.

391
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:10,200
Some water...or some tea.
I've pretty much mastered the...

392
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:15,200
Uh, or maybe, you know what?
You're maybe not supposed to have caffeine,

393
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,800
So maybe we'll just
get you some, uh,

394
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:18,843
Some bottled water
or some tap water.

395
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,070
I know, some sparkling,

396
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:26,100
Because, you know,
it matches your smile.

397
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,100
Jimmy, i realize that i was the one
that was just in the i.C.U.,

398
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,600
But you seem to be the one
with marred motor skills.

399
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
Are you okay?

400
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:37,100
Yeah.

401
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,300
Until tonight...

402
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:55,436
I never thought
that i would lose you.

403
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,200
I mean, i know
that we've been

404
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:01,700
On again and off again
and on again.

405
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:03,300
But...

406
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,600
I figured even if we
didn't end up together...

407
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:13,000
I could be happy just knowing
you're in the world.

408
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,600
Today, i...

409
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:21,100
I realized that
that's not true.

410
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,500
No i mean... mean,

411
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Of course i'm happy
that you're in the world, but...

412
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:34,400
You mean so much to me, chloe.

413
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,900
Spend the rest
of our time in it together.

414
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,000
It's all they had at
the hospital gift shop, but...

415
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,400
I didn't want to wait.

416
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:04,002
We can have "breakfast
at tiffany's" in the morning.

417
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,600
Will you marry me?

418
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:12,723
Don't move!

419
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,300
Hey, whoa, hey, hold on.
This isn't right.

420
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:16,500
What's going on?

421
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:19,100
Hey! Who do you guys
think that you are?!

422
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:21,626
Department
of domestic security.

423
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,000
Chloe sullivan,
you are under arrest.

424
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:25,557
Jimmy, call clark.

425
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,000
Get clark!

426
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:42,442
Clark, are you here?!

427
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,620
Chloe was just arrested.

428
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:52,300
What?

429
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:55,600
Her habitual hacking caught
uncle sam's eye, so i...

430
00:35:57,279 --> 00:36:00,454
I kind of went to lex for help,
and now he's holding it over my head.

431
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:01,900
You made a deal
with lex luthor?

432
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
Look, i told him
to get another lapdog, clark.

433
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:06,600
Then he just...

434
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,700
He put her back
wanted list.

435
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,000
She went from life support
to life without parole in less than a day.

436
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,084
- Where's lex now?
- Look, i don't know.

437
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
I tried to get
in contact with him,

438
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
But he's off jet-Setting
around the arctic circle.

439
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,900
And i know it's not drilling oil,

440
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,500
Se he's gone way out of his way
to cover his tracks in the snow.

441
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,600
I must admit, clark.

442
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,200
This is a big step up from the barn.

443
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:27,892
It's not what you think, lex.

444
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:30,514
You don't understand.

445
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,300
For the first time, i think i do.

446
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:45,500
You see, you live among us
as a mild-Mannered farm boy.

447
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:49,300
But secretly, you're a strange visitor
from another planet,

448
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,600
plotting our demise.

449
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:51,992
That's not what i'm doing at all.

450
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,200
It's a brilliant disguise, clark.

451
00:38:54,736 --> 00:38:56,633
You don't even need a mask.

452
00:38:58,164 --> 00:38:59,995
I'm not your enemy, lex.

453
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,661
I've never done
anything to hurt you.

454
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:05,700
You didn't trust

455
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,300
With everything you had,
with everything you could do,

456
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:13,000
Did you ever think about what we
could have accomplished together?

457
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:15,800
I would have helped you become a hero.

458
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:18,900
When have you ever thought
of anyone but yourself?

459
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,326
Right now.

460
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,400
I'm doing this for the world.

461
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:25,000
I have to protect the human race.

462
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,900
This is my life.

463
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,400
You have no right to control it!

464
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,000
It's my birthright!

465
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,900
After all my sacrifices,

466
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,300
After all the pain,

467
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:36,900
I finally understand.

468
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:41,300
I was being prepared
for a much greater destiny.

469
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,400
Everything led me to this moment.

470
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:47,900
And we're both here.
We're in that moment.

471
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,500
And what happens next is your choice.

472
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:53,598
But no one
is controlling you, lex.

473
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:55,800
No one is forcing you do this.

474
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,000
Who am i to turn my back
on my fellow man?

475
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,200
Especially after
you turned your back on me?

476
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm sorry, clark.

477
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:10,200
But you are the traveler.

478
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,500
You hold the future of
the entire planet in your hands.

479
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm here to take it back.

480
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:24,500
You'll never threaten
the world again...

481
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:30,500
Lex, don't!

482
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,900
I loved you like a brother, clark.

483
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:01,300
But it has to end this way.

484
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,700
I'm sorry.
