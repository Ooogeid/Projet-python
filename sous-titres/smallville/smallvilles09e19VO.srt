1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,805
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,128
<i>There are aliens among us.</i>

3
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:07,465
If you don't stand with us,
you stand against us

4
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,510
it's time for you to pick a side.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,928
There's only one way
to leave Checkmate.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,973
I finished tracing the
nber of our rogue blur.

7
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,724
It was Zod.

8
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,170
You lied about having powers.
How'd you get them?

9
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:23,772
From your blood.

10
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,908
Your father left the book
of Rau on this Earth.

11
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:31,037
And what with all of this there is
no limit to what we can achieve.

12
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:34,281
Don't act like there isn't some
agenda you're not telling me about.

13
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,369
If it wasn't for Zod,
I wouldn't be alive today.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,622
Let's just say I know him
better than you think.

15
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,540
A group of your people are
looking to a new leader ...

16
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,243
The time has come to
share in your birthright.

17
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,581
I know what I have to do.

18
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,764
Don't tell me you forgot
about your favorite customer.

19
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:06,648
<i>I thought you forgot about me.</i>

20
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,114
You're late.

21
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,054
I'll have the usual, please?

22
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:13,173
- All I got left is strong and burnt.
- As long as it's hot.

23
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:18,394
I've been meaning to ask what kind
of a job has a pretty young lady

24
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,026
working all night, every night?

25
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:24,096
Actually, I work for a
nonprofit organization.

26
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:26,208
We help people in need.

27
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,901
Trying to save the world?

28
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,695
All night, every night.

29
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,993
<i>Verify.</i>

30
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:55,590
Chloe Sullivan. Password 051409.

31
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:01,036
<i>Vocal and bio analysis confirmed.</i>

32
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:15,084
<i>Welcome to Watchtower, ms. Sullivan.</i>

33
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:17,647
Ready to save the world from itself?

34
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,201
How did you find out my sceret?

35
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,234
Oliver's voice wavered

36
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:45,581
when I told him that
Watchtower had been kidnapped.

37
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:48,310
And I've seen the
way he looks at you.

38
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,881
<i>It's the little things a
girl tends to notice.</i>

39
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,468
And yet you somehow
missed an unloaded gun.

40
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,897
<i>Watchtower safety compromised.</i>

41
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,873
<i>Initiating lockdown.</i>

42
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:27,463
<i>It's in your best interest to
get these doors open now.</i>

43
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,781
<i>Securise breach. Access denied.</i>

44
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,208
We're not going anywhere.

45
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,266
Watchtower's in control now.

46
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,173
Smallville - 9x19 - Sacrifice

47
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,685
Synchro: Flolo

48
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,547
SeriesSub.com/Sous-Titres. Eu

49
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,108
I let myself in.

50
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:50,796
Terrific. You hop up to the helipad

51
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,499
or just superspeed past security?

52
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,418
I used the elevator.

53
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,268
How human of you.

54
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:58,637
You're obviously not
on patrol tonight. What's going on?

55
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,530
I need to find Zod.

56
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,635
Chloe, she's got this
really big building

57
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,273
filled with a lot of expensive
stuff I paid a lot of money for.

58
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:09,971
- She could help you out with that.
- The last thing that we need 

59
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,845
is to have a weapon like Watchtower
fall into the wrong hands.

60
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,971
I want to keep Chloe out
of the line of fire.

61
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:16,746
I figured you'd agree with that.

62
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,152
"Keep Chloe out of the line of
fire." What the hell's going on?

63
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,922
He went after Lois.

64
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:28,691
He pretended to be The Blur,
and he put her in danger.

65
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:30,955
I think it's time we
take off the gloves.

66
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,517
I need you on this but I can't have you
starting a fight with Zod

67
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:36,100
- if I'm trying to keep the peace.
- You like to see the goodness

68
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:38,347
in everyone but you know what this
guy's capable of?

69
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,536
<i>And I know what you're capable of.</i>

70
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:44,065
I understand how you feel.

71
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,276
Don't think I'm not angry, too.

72
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:50,405
I can't have you firing off the first shot
and threatening everything I've worked for.

73
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,368
<i>These are my people that
we're talking about.</i>

74
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:57,181
My first real chance to
have a kryptonian family here on Earth.

75
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:00,442
<i>And we need to find Zod and
confront him my way.</i>

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,465
Yeah, all right, man,
I got your back.

77
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,638
Let's suit up. Check the mansion.

78
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:12,034
Before Tess went off the grid,
she got close to Zod.

79
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,570
She may have left behind some intel.

80
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:17,178
I have another lead I want
to run down on my own.

81
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,621
You know, those Kandorians...

82
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,263
they're not the only
family you have here.

83
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:46,271
In the event that I die of starvation
or say a ricocheting bullet

84
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,706
do you mind telling me
how you got in here?

85
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,284
You're sloppy.

86
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,960
I've got thousands of
samples of your DNA

87
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,011
from all the times
you've spied on me.

88
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,805
It's called a DNA cloak.

89
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,813
<i>Aren't you fancy?</i>

90
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:04,936
Getting in doesn't really seem to
be our issue right now.

91
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:08,599
- How the hell do we get out of here?
- Short answer. It's impossible.

92
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:12,057
When Checkmate kidnapped me,
I upgraded Watchtower's security

93
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,173
to contain intruders like you.

94
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:16,877
The only problem is,
I was supposed to be on the outside.

95
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,440
Seriously?

96
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:24,942
The lockdown prevents any
signals from getting in or out.

97
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:29,784
<i>Treat confirmation still active.</i>

98
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,897
Watchtower didn't react
because you attacked me.

99
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:37,026
We're on lockdown because some hacking
transmitter was detected.

100
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:41,099
The initial signal managed to pirate some
data before my firewall blocked it and

101
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:44,396
the thing is still alive. It's trying
to break through another firewall.

102
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,050
It's trying to give away our location.
What did you bring in here?

103
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,936
Nothing. All I wanted to do
was erase any info

104
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,301
you had on the Kandorians,
not reroute it.

105
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:54,313
You were the Kandorians' lapdog,

106
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:57,746
but I didn't realize you were Zod's
little bitch, too. All right, look.

107
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:00,597
If you're not behind this, there's
only one other group I can think of

108
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:02,978
that wants Watchtower this badly.

109
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:12,455
The signal's scrambled,
Agent Campbell.

110
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,889
Watchtower threw up some
kind of halo of interference

111
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:17,362
as soon as the tracker went live.

112
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:20,311
<i>Waller coming online.</i>

113
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,764
We're trying to sort out the data we siphoned
from Watchtower before they blocked us.

114
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:27,870
<i>What is your status?</i>

115
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:34,037
We've narrowed the location
within a 20-block radius.

116
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,409
Good. We can't afford to
make a mistake

117
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,616
<i>with the red queen so close.</i>

118
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:42,055
Don't make me regret putting
my little white knight back in play.

119
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,859
There's no need to worry.

120
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:46,907
We're gonna have Watchtower
in Checkmate's hands by dawn.

121
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,969
<i>Godspeed, Agent Campbell.</i>

122
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,197
<i>Waller out.</i>

123
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,409
You heard the wall, gentlemen.

124
00:08:57,534 --> 00:09:01,486
Let's show Mercer how we feel about
a little thing called treason.

125
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,036
If I was hiding a
transmitting tracking device,

126
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,947
I would want to make it
as unassuming as possible.

127
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,266
<i>Which means I can probably
count this out.</i>

128
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:14,550
Fever-colored lipstick? Really?

129
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,915
I was gonna go with plain Jane but you
seem to have that market cornered.

130
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,502
Really, how much could have been
leaked in the blink of an eye?

131
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,315
Watchtower downloads what amounts to the
Library of Congress

132
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,312
every three seconds, which mean half
that time Checkmate could have attained

133
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,774
my entire team's database.

134
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:32,096
And all of your files
on the Kandorians.

135
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,824
<i>Firewall breach.</i>

136
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:39,740
<i>Cluster 4458.</i>

137
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,411
Now, if it wasn't planted in
your things, it must be on you.

138
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:43,874
What?

139
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,749
This is ridiculous, okay?

140
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,719
It's in your body,
just beneath your skin.

141
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:56,786
Get it out of me, now.

142
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,023
Oh, my God.

143
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:09,733
It moved.

144
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:16,573
When it feels threatened,
it burrows deeper into the host.

145
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:19,680
We'll never get it out now.

146
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:21,744
How did you know that?

147
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,886
It's a Checkmate device.

148
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:27,199
A mechanical parasite powered
by the host's biorhythms.

149
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,424
You know what they say.

150
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,969
You lie down with dogs,
you end up with fleas.

151
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:41,723
Laugh it up but when Checkmate finds us,
we'll both be dead.

152
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:05,474
I'm glad you found a way to preserve our
culture here on earth.

153
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:09,460
I wish everyone saw it that way.

154
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:13,253
Zod disappeared and took the
rest of our people with him.

155
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:17,569
I don't understand. I thought all of
you had found a new life here on Earth.

156
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:21,444
We were wrong to follow you, Kal-El.

157
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,475
When we did what you asked
and tried to assimilate with the humans,

158
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,679
we were left behind.

159
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:31,853
We're gathered here waiting for
Zod's return to ask his forgiveness.

160
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,469
I'm sorry, Faora.
I never meant to divide our people,

161
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:37,803
- but you cannot realign with Zod.
- You've never trusted him.

162
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,464
All Zod wanted was to give us power
so we could protect ourselves.

163
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,630
Zod already has powers.

164
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,900
He's had them for weeks.

165
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:49,851
Faora, there's something
you need to see.

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,147
You are unmistakably the one
they call Green Arrow...

167
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,463
<i>A rebel with many causes.</i>

168
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,305
I'm glad to know my reputation
still precedes me. You must be Zod.

169
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,969
Soldier with no army.

170
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:28,098
I see my reputation
precedes me, too.

171
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,490
<i>I'm guessing by the looks of him,</i>

172
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,916
we're not the only
ones waiting for Tess.

173
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,118
Oh, yeah, "him."

174
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:43,250
I find it disgusting how quickly
you humans can betray your own.

175
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,329
Now, that one...

176
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,828
he ave up all sorts
of useful information before he died,

177
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:56,084
about something your
government called Checkmate...

178
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,218
and about who they're after.

179
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:03,175
Not too long ago, a gift-wrapped me
was at the top of that wish list.

180
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,785
And now Tess is.

181
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,305
Checkmate is using her to get to us,
hunting us to the death.

182
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,145
Having been on the receiving end
of their terrorist schemes...

183
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,778
why don't you join me
against our common enemy?

184
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,263
I'm flattered but if I let you
go after Checkmate,

185
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:25,135
you'll start world war III.

186
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,343
It's not an option.

187
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:30,043
Your conviction is admirable.

188
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:34,997
But you can't possibly think
you're faster than me.

189
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,946
I've always been taught to
favor accuracy over speed.

190
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,907
Bull's-eye.

191
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,580
<i>Air supply terminated.</i>

192
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,270
We got three minutes of air left.

193
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,197
You think Checkmate will
find us before then?

194
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,367
Asphyxiation or a firing squad.

195
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:37,702
Damned if we do, damned if we don't.

196
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:41,049
Just damned.

197
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,572
I just wanted to save the world.

198
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,617
That's funny.

199
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,441
Last time I checked, you were just
trying to get rid of everyone in it.

200
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:02,515
Paint my ideals however you want,

201
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,672
but you and yours don't trust
people any more than I do.

202
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,511
This entire building was programmed

203
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,871
to prevent anyone from
getting close to you.

204
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,547
Yeah, I guess I lost
my faith in people a long time ago, too.

205
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,778
That's why you won't let
Oliver get close to you.

206
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:36,136
And why I can't blame him
when he eventually leaves.

207
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,459
He's not gonna leave you.

208
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,605
With you, he has a purpose

209
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,758
I wish I could have given him that.

210
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,065
And it kills me...

211
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,675
'cause you have everything
right in front of you...

212
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,759
and you can't even see it.

213
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,569
<i>Final breach imminent.</i>

214
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,577
They broke through
the final firewall.

215
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:15,909
Checkmate's gonna
be here any minute.

216
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:20,743
As long as they torture
us with the A.C. on, I'll die happy.

217
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,052
Cold.

218
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,462
Watchtower's cooling system
uses a special mix of

219
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,563
liquid helium and nitrogen.

220
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,815
Cold enough to shatter steel.

221
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,446
What are you waiting for?

222
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,504
If I pull these tanks,
then the mainframe melts.

223
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:01,705
All my work, Watchtower is gone.

224
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,617
<i>If you don't, we die.</i>

225
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:07,327
<i>Critical oxygen level.</i>

226
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:16,005
<i>Warning... temperature variation
detected.</i>

227
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,923
<i>System failure imminent.</i>

228
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,103
They're back on the grid.

229
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:10,586
Safeties off, gentlemen.
Shoot to kill.

230
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,342
He destroyed Krypton.

231
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:29,959
My father sent those
messages here to Earth

232
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,194
to help me stop history
from repeating itself.

233
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,150
I trusted Zod, too. That's why
I didn't tell you any of this sooner.

234
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,067
The circumstances may be different
but Zod cannot be trusted.

235
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,409
On Krypton, he destroyed
that planet to prove a point.

236
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:51,654
<i>We can't let hm do the
same thing here.</i>

237
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,327
I'd hoped what Zod had given
me would reunite our people.

238
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:06,204
What he gave you?

239
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,124
At the ceremony,
your sister was protecting you.

240
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,596
You're pregnant.

241
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,976
And Zod's the father?

242
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:35,895
This baby is proof that you
can still have a life here...

243
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,326
Apart from Zod, without powers.

244
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,199
Faora...

245
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:46,995
Krypton lives on through you.

246
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,776
Why don't you just murder me now?

247
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:03,114
Isn't that what your race does?

248
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,068
Sometimes.
And I would love to, believe me.

249
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:10,692
But, although inconvenient
and a lot less fun.

250
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,607
I made a commitment to Clark to
help save the world peacefully.

251
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,132
Now, that said,

252
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:21,337
you bulldoze me again,
I might have a change of heart.

253
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,289
Zod's been looking for something
ever since we arrived.

254
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,961
The book of Rau.

255
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:40,736
Zod said the book of Rau
was some sort of kryptonian bible.

256
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,995
It's so much more than that.
It wields great power.

257
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,684
And if Zod were to get
his hands on it...

258
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,224
then who knows what he would do?

259
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,704
Oliver, what's wrong?

260
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:59,221
I found what we're looking for.
I'll give you a little hint.

261
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,152
- It's bigger than a breadbox.
- Zod?

262
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:04,113
I'll be right there.

263
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:07,706
Why don't you take your sweet time?
Because I have everything under...

264
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,828
control.

265
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,342
No.

266
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:52,286
<i>- Change of plans, agent Campbell.
- Change of plans?</i>

267
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,579
We just made contact
with Mercer's tracker.

268
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:56,682
<i>I don't care about Mercer
or Watchtower.</i>

269
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:00,072
<i>We decrypted the data.
We found the aliens.</i>

270
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:02,869
<i>Checkmate is going to
stop this war before it gets started.</i>

271
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,905
<i>Waller out.</i>

272
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:13,689
We've got our 20.
Now lock her down. I'm not losing her.

273
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:16,165
Sir, you heard Waller.
We have our orders.

274
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,700
I just spent the last
five months in recovery

275
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:21,821
from what Mercer did to me.
Now, this op

276
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:24,569
is over when I
say it's over, understood?

277
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,177
I don't get it.
You're in the clear.

278
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:37,199
We escape before Checkmate got
a hit on Watchtower's address.

279
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,439
That doesn't make you any
less of a liability.

280
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:42,482
You still know the secret identities
of all my most valuable players.

281
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,883
There's no sense in both
of us getting captured.

282
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:50,410
I'm not letting you out of my sight

283
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:52,385
until we get rid of
your little friend.

284
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:03,998
I know how much I am asking of
you in standing against Zod.

285
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:09,148
I will not let my child be
raised under a tyrant's rule.

286
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:13,615
We cannot let our future be
guided by a tyrant's hand.

287
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,822
Our past ended in war.

288
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,170
Let our future begin with peace.

289
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:46,488
Enough!

290
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:47,868
You heard her.

291
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:50,249
Enough's enough.

292
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,576
The leader comes with me.

293
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,914
We have a few things to discuss.

294
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:12,638
Dispose of the rest.

295
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:21,347
I'll have Dr.
Hamilton check in with you

296
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:23,783
once we get him into surgery
and assess the damage.

297
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,421
Checkmate's after the Kandorians.

298
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,103
Only you can save your people.

299
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,101
Please.

300
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:44,012
Our people have done nothing.

301
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:45,910
Where are you taking us?

302
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,488
- Vala, where's your sister?
- They took her.

303
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,161
Atropine?

304
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,420
What the hell are you
gonna do with that?

305
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,232
There's no time. Look.

306
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:28,048
If you're right and that transmitter's
powered by your biorhythms,

307
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:31,348
then the only way that I can turn
it off is to stop your heart.

308
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,387
I have to kill you, Tess.

309
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,181
And this is the only way
I'm gonna bring you back.

310
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:45,539
You're asking for a pretty
big leap of faith here.

311
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:47,396
You're gonna have to trust me.

312
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,806
You ready?

313
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,279
Do it.

314
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:44,967
The signal just went dead.

315
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,187
Let's move.

316
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:58,896
Keep looking.

317
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,140
You bitch.

318
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,393
I really didn't think you'd do it.

319
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,313
Bring me back.

320
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,146
Neither dd I.

321
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:47,614
Just for the record,
I just saved your ass.

322
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:50,937
You say anything about
me or mine to anyone,

323
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:53,518
<i>next time you won't wake up.</i>

324
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:55,334
You understand?

325
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:59,088
Guess you'll have to trust me.

326
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:23,965
Our field offices were just leveled

327
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,365
by the one you call Zod.

328
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,972
We knew nothing about this.
Zod is acting alone.

329
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,144
We stand part. We only want peace.

330
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,679
Dozens of my agents are dead.

331
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:36,663
We are way past peace.

332
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:39,795
Then we will help you stop him.

333
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,548
Defecting means
betraying your own kind.

334
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:45,217
I'm only betraying one.

335
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,201
Checkmate's actions demands justice.

336
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,369
Murder isn't justice.

337
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:46,230
Seems like a lifetime ago when I...

338
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:49,073
pulled you out of that rubble,
doesn't it.

339
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:53,002
The Siege of Argo.
There were many losses that day.

340
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,128
Not for me.

341
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:06,954
Because I found a young and...

342
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:11,845
beautiful cadet who would
become my trusted right hand.

343
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:17,354
You were so brave
in the face of death

344
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,357
I knew then that you
would be a true partner.

345
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:25,884
I've trusted you...

346
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:28,065
for so very long.

347
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:32,469
Depended on you...

348
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:36,696
across time and space.

349
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:43,199
But in your eyes,
I just see contempt.

350
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:46,717
I see betrayal.

351
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:58,134
Now, why would you
turn your back on me?

352
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,687
I shared my bed with you.

353
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,210
<i>I didn't turn my back on you.</i>

354
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:06,737
<i>You turned your back on us</i>

355
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:10,294
when our only crime was trying to forge
a life for ourselves on this planet.

356
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:14,552
If I ever learned...

357
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,368
that insurrection had
spread across my ranks,

358
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:20,166
if I ever discovered that my men

359
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:23,997
had aligned themselves against me,
I would raze this planet.

360
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:26,457
I would burn it to the ground

361
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:29,543
till the last ember went
cold beneath my boot!

362
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:35,006
Now only

363
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:38,110
i will lead us to the next age.

364
00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:40,726
All will follow Zod.

365
00:33:42,864 --> 00:33:45,731
You already sacrificed
one world for your ego.

366
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,381
You know nothing of sacrifice.

367
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:02,405
I know more than you ever will.

368
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,401
Kneel.

369
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,941
Never.

370
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:01,666
I think I found a way to
prioritize our satellites

371
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:04,380
to get a location on Mercer
when she left the hospital.

372
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:09,700
Zod destroyed the Metropolis field
office and six more went dark.

373
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:13,128
The black king is still missing,
and we're at war. Contact the U.N.

374
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,797
We have to regroup
before they strike again.

375
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,365
Run.

376
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:20,725
Please tell me you found
that z-branding bastard

377
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,740
so we can slap him back
across the universe.

378
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,658
Zod's on the move, there's no sign of
Faora or the Kandorians.

379
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,418
Maybe if I can reach the others,
I can talk some sense into them.

380
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,876
We may be too late for that.
That's the Castle.

381
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,794
Oh, God.

382
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:38,422
Zod's attacked Checkmate.

383
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,568
Oliver was personal.

384
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:46,009
With this, Zod just declared war.

385
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:52,273
You're not gonna like where
he's gathering his troops.

386
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:56,996
My eye in the sky above
the fortress is picking up movement.

387
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:38,129
What was to be the first
son of Kandor is no more.

388
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:43,822
Now we, the last sons and
daughters of Krypton,

389
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,742
have no choice but to
preserve our birthright.

390
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:05,224
The humans killed the
mother of my unborn child...

391
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,317
the mother of your future!

392
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:11,890
That's a lie.

393
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:27,445
The last time that I saw Faora,
she was alive.

394
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:32,202
And she was alone...

395
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,724
with Zod.

396
00:39:35,798 --> 00:39:38,220
Why should they believe you?

397
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,097
This traitor...

398
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:46,221
saved the life of the woman
who held you hostage,

399
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,194
the woman who wanted to dissect you,

400
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:52,823
who wanted to torture you...

401
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,729
murder you.

402
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:58,809
Vala...

403
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:02,047
If there's anyone who really
knows what your sister wanted, it's you.

404
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:07,154
It was peace, Vala.
She wanted peace.

405
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,633
No.

406
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,951
Zod's right.

407
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:17,343
The humans will never
allow Kandor peace.

408
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,212
They will hunt us to the last man.

409
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,548
But they will fail,

410
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,371
<i>for we shall never be defeated.</i>

411
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,104
We will follow general Zod
to the ends of this earth.

412
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:49,321
<i>Krypton will rise again.</i>

413
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,558
And all humankind
will kneel before Zod.

414
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:56,620
I'll never let that happen!

415
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:12,287
You won't be able to stop us.

416
