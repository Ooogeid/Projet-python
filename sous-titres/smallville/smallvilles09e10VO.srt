1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:02,082
Previously on Smallville.

2
00:00:02,162 --> 00:00:04,631
Why don't we have the powers
we should have under yellow sun?

3
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:06,753
Kneel before Zod.

4
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:09,256
I have always been true to my word,

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,494
and I will find the answers we are
looking for, or I will die in the quest!

6
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,631
My brother and sister Kandorian's,
he has come.

7
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:21,001
Kneel before Kal-El.

8
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:24,741
When you told me you could
help me find my father,

9
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,373
I didn't know it was because
you wired my house.

10
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:28,809
Clark, I wanted to keep an eye
on your place until you came home.

11
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:30,611
I've been home for weeks.
You didn't tell me anything about them.

12
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:30,987
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,447
Is there any part of the person
that I used to know still there?

14
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,999
Maybe not. I took a look in
the mirror, and you were right.

15
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,283
I've been running away
from myself for a long time,

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,846
but now I know who I really am.

17
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:41,522
You were living like you had
a death wish.

18
00:00:41,556 --> 00:00:44,157
I had to push you over the ledge
in order to pull you back.

19
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:47,722
Even with your face in the gutter,
you still had the hero in your heart.

20
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:48,786
Thank you.

21
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:50,054
I know what I'm talking about, Mia,

22
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:52,287
because I used to fight for
the same reasons that you do.

23
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:54,801
I can train you, to teach you
how to overcome your fear...

24
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:56,191
and get you off the streets.

25
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:57,765
My hero.

26
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:59,188
What's easier to believe?

27
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:03,043
That there was some phone glitch or
that the farm guy is a super powered hero?

28
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:06,782
I must have been crazy to look at
Clark through blur-colored glasses.

29
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:08,802
You said I had a secret.
You're right.

30
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:10,880
Let's see what you got.

31
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:14,061
It's just sometimes I feel like
I see a whole other side of you.

32
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,609
I was hoping that we could grab
something to eat tonight.

33
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,274
I'll meet you there.

34
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,175
See, that party wasn't so bad.

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,436
Plus, all the money from
the bar goes to charity.

36
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,263
So somewhere, a kid is getting a new pair
of shoes, all because I drank a Crantini.

37
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:43,984
I'm sure there's more than
a few kids getting shoes,

38
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:46,843
compliments of Lois Lane...
not that I was keeping track.

39
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:50,190
Hey, mister, that was two hours
and five cups of coffee ago.

40
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,126
And, okay, I was just...
a little nervous.

41
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:57,189
It was our first public outing
as kind of like... a couple.

42
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,739
Emphasis on "kind of. "

43
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:00,823
You wouldn't even let me
help you with your coat.

44
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,757
I held your hand.

45
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,652
Only when you were taking
hors d'oeuvres out of it.

46
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:10,204
Tess seemed okay when she found out
her top basement reporters are dating...

47
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,258
although not everyone was doing the
happy dance when they saw us together.

48
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:16,283
Ollie didn't have much to say.
He left right after we got there.

49
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:19,738
Oliver's gotten over bigger hurdles
in his life than his friends dating.

50
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,558
Well, it is a lot to get your head
around, Clark Kent and Lois Lane.

51
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,695
Who knew?

52
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,811
I did.

53
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,807
You know, Lois, we could go back
to the farm and take a walk.

54
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,606
I could give you Clark Kent's
tour of the galaxy.

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,342
Smallville...

56
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:47,981
The only planet you know about is the
one that you read at the breakfast table.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,598
Okay, then.

58
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:04,391
That was PDA number four
on date number five.

59
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,441
I'm just keeping track,

60
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:10,704
Trying not to rush into this
relationship, like I've done before.

61
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,075
Lois, there's nothing we'll be doing
in five weeks that we can't do tonight.

62
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:17,850
I know.

63
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,346
It's just...

64
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,147
This is the one.

65
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:24,170
You're the one that I want
to get it right with, okay, so...

66
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,300
Night.

67
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,238
Night.

68
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,099
Please, help!

69
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,053
No! No, not my wedding ring!

70
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,153
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

71
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:56,664
Don't worry... the galaxy
will be there next week.

72
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:12,165
Damn it. I knew I should've
changed the alternator myself.

73
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,640
Come on, Oliver.

74
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,898
Jealous much?!

75
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,193
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:01,251
"Somebody save me"

77
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:06,412
"Let your warm hands break right through me"

78
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:11,282
"Somebody save me"

79
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,817
"I don't care how you do it"

80
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,769
"Just save me, save me"

81
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,477
"Come on"

82
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:27,471
"I've been waiting for you"

83
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:37,800
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

84
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:41,834
"Just save me, save me"

85
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:44,696
"Come on"

86
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,472
SMALLVILLE 9x09 "PANDORA"

87
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,545
Oliver!

88
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,581
Oliver!

89
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,050
No, Oliver!

90
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,623
Oh, God!

91
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:35,995
Mia...

92
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,734
What the hell was that about?

93
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:41,102
You tell me.

94
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:44,839
I came here for our training session,
Mia, not an audition for "Kill Bill 3."

95
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,508
I thought if I surprised you,

96
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:50,205
I might actually stand a chance
of kicking your butt.

97
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:53,269
Then you tried to snap
my windpipe.

98
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:55,549
Well, you make
a pretty convincing Ninja.

99
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:59,320
Oliver, that was more
than an overreaction.

100
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:02,336
You didn't even respond
to your own name.

101
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:07,482
It was like you were someone else.

102
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:12,266
This coming from the woman
in the mask.

103
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,375
Chloe.

104
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:29,019
Chloe, what's wrong?

105
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:46,401
The apple is such a plain
yet fascinating fruit.

106
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,963
What are you doing here?

107
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,743
You know, it was the apple
that launched the Trojan War?

108
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:58,212
One of the great epic battles
of all time.

109
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:01,749
And, also, in many religions here, it's the
apple's fall from the tree of knowledge...

110
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,417
that represents the fall of man.

111
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:06,294
Now, I found that story
quite interesting...

112
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:10,471
because it so aptly illustrates
how humans hoard knowledge.

113
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,960
Whereas our own
Kryptonian religion...

114
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,831
now, that teaches...

115
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,934
knowledge should be shared...

116
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,902
by all.

117
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,878
I'm sure you didn’t come here
for a Sunday-school lesson.

118
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,244
What do you want?

119
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,452
When we bowed down
before you, Kal-El,

120
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:34,815
we embraced you with open hearts.

121
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,555
Well...

122
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,193
some of us feel as if our favor
has not been returned.

123
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,339
Your people...

124
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,228
our people.

125
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,662
Our people have assimilated well.

126
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:50,531
They don't need my help
as much as the humans.

127
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,166
No, we need it more.

128
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,568
We have no powers here, Kal-El.

129
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:59,773
And they expect you
to help us get them.

130
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:02,076
We need leadership, a mentor.

131
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,700
I can't help you. I don't know
how to give our people my powers.

132
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,811
Surely, it's a mystery
we can solve together.

133
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,941
Earth is not another Krypton.

134
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:15,395
And trying to make it one
is a dangerous plan.

135
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:22,040
Our people, they don't want to conquer.

136
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,167
But...

137
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,623
if we don't deliver
their powers soon, then...

138
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:33,225
sooner or later they will do
whatever it takes...

139
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:37,083
to get what they want themselves.

140
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,123
We, um...

141
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:52,359
we have to be able to defend
ourselves, Kal-El.

142
00:09:52,394 --> 00:09:55,919
These humans' brutality is, uh...

143
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:58,510
is extraordinary.

144
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,825
And if they discover us,

145
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,273
they will hunt us down like animals.

146
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,890
I won't let that happen.

147
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:16,871
You are reluctant to take action
because you don't trust me.

148
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,867
You think I killed Jor-El.

149
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:33,267
I lost a son.

150
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,572
And I would never deprive
anyone of his father in this life.

151
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,312
You must believe me.

152
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,140
Hello?

153
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,458
Lois?

154
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,421
Is she all right?

155
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:58,374
I'll be right there.

156
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,702
Lois!

157
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,072
Clark.

158
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,593
I'm so sorry.

159
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:16,764
I shouldn't have left you last night.
This never would've happened.

160
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,874
It's not your fault that I had
a bad alternator, Smallville.

161
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,384
Look, some psycho obviously wanted
to get himself on the front page,

162
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,806
and so he decided to shoot
the ace reporter.

163
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,133
What did he look like?
Did you see him?

164
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:32,044
Yeah.

165
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,559
He was dressed up
like Green Arrow.

166
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,722
Hey. You okay?
You don't look so great...

167
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,888
Which, for you, is not exactly easy.

168
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,921
Uh, I didn't realize Lois
already had a visitor.

169
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:02,523
Come on. Ollie...

170
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:06,506
It's been years since you and Lois
steamed up any elevator glass.

171
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,522
I know.
I know.

172
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,159
You have a suspect?

173
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:14,754
Yeah.

174
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,937
Uh, he was dressed up like...

175
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,167
you, actually.

176
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:20,969
What?

177
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:22,720
Yeah.

178
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:26,280
I didn't want to tell you this
over the phone, but...

179
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,651
Lois was shot with an arrow.

180
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:32,252
It went in under her right shoulder.

181
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,655
It didn't do any damage, but
the doctor said that if it had been...

182
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,325
just a centimeter to the right or the left,
her artery would have been seviche.

183
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,192
She would've died in minutes.

184
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,094
Lucky for her, the guy
wasn't exactly William Tell.

185
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,496
No.

186
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,103
No, this guy makes William Tell look
like a summer-camp archery coach.

187
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,888
We're not dealing with just
some random shot here, Chloe.

188
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,688
That's a target specifically designed to
take down your enemy without killing them.

189
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,014
Our shooter’s not an amateur.

190
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,213
This guy's a crack marksman.

191
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,617
Not many people in the world
could hit that shot.

192
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,914
Where's this arrow?

193
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,875
The police are running
some tests on it.

194
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,165
It's pretty low-tech compared
to your titanium missiles.

195
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,822
What?

196
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,814
Nothing.

197
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,170
Vordigan.

198
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:54,037
Clark, thank goodness. A girl could
not live by online blackjack alone.

199
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,147
I am so sorry to disappoint, but I was
hoping to make it up with flowers.

200
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:04,017
Not that I'm against taking flowers from men
I've never met, 'cause lord knows I have,

201
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,852
I think you have the wrong room.

202
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,988
Yeah. Forgive my lack
of manners.

203
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:11,666
America must be wearing off on me.
I'm an old friend of Clark's.

204
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:17,798
I was donating blood, and I thought I'd
stop by and see how you were recovering.

205
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,600
Oh.

206
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:24,299
Look, Clark must have
mentioned me. I'm Zod.

207
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,740
Can't say that he has.

208
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:31,261
And being a championship-wrestling fan,
I'd definitely remember a name like that.

209
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:35,818
Well, you may have never heard of me,
but I have heard all about Lois Lane.

210
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,403
Is that supposed to impress me?

211
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,758
Oh, that Clark Kent, huh?

212
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,927
Can't stop talking about you.

213
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,030
- Really?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:54,649
After meeting you, I can see
that he's not exaggerating.

215
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,041
How do you know Clark again?

216
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:03,414
We've got a lot of history together.

217
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,613
And one night, when,
uh, when you're better,

218
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:10,083
we'll go out and I'll tell you
all about the real Clark Kent. Hmm?

219
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:12,086
Tequila's on me.

220
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,089
I'm not sure Clark's parents
even know the real Clark Kent.

221
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,050
Uh, do you mean
his adoptive parents?

222
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,511
His only parents, really.

223
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:23,697
I don't think he has any idea
who his birth parents are.

224
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,633
No.

225
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:29,067
Okay.

226
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,413
Okay.

227
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,935
Oh, uh...

228
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:38,312
here's to a speedy recovery. The kids on
the second floor were selling them, and...

229
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:42,182
it's a... it's a charm.

230
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:49,824
Interesting shape.

231
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,122
Thanks.

232
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,521
Now, you tell that Clark Kent...

233
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,417
that he's a very lucky man.

234
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,774
Hmm.

235
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,143
I will.

236
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:28,076
You want to tell me
what you're doing?

237
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:31,565
'cause this looks serial-killer scary.

238
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:33,700
Okay.

239
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:37,296
Is this where you tell me you hate the
taste of flesh and make me feel better?

240
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:40,830
It's nothing, really.

241
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,076
You have every surveillance photo...

242
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,617
Queen Industries can capture
of you over the last two days.

243
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:47,847
What the hell's up with that?

244
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:53,086
I think someone's following me.

245
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,023
Well, I guess that would explain our
near-fatal meet and greet this morning.

246
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:59,959
Yeah, not a real great time to dress up
in black and go Steven Seagal on me.

247
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:03,763
So...

248
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,450
All I'm seeing so far
in these pics is...

249
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,643
you.

250
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,364
Isn't this where that lady
got shot last night?

251
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,252
Oh, no, no, no. Hell no. You put
that back where you found it.

252
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,686
You're in enough trouble as it is.

253
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:32,292
Look, Mia, there's a lot of things here
that you don't know about me, okay?

254
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:35,252
I had no right trying to play mentor
with you. It's way too risky.

255
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:37,664
What?

256
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,774
No. No, I'm not just
gonna leave you like this.

257
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,801
The hell you're not.

258
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:45,438
I'm not your teacher anymore,
you understand me?

259
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:49,109
I want you to walk through
that door and don't look back.

260
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,896
Get the hell out of here.

261
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:18,125
Watchtower. Security breach.

262
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:21,975
Watchtower. Security breach.

263
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:26,628
Watchtower. Security breach.

264
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,770
Watchtower. Security breach.

265
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,856
Chloe, what happened?

266
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:31,946
I'm starting to think our
favorite archer isn't all green.

267
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:00,388
Oliver.

268
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,751
Oliver's got a greater destiny,

269
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,396
and you're going to help me fulfill it.

270
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:16,138
And how many arrow-toting Rambos
out there know about Watchtower?

271
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:18,689
And of those, how many
could hack into my system?

272
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,542
Going after Lois...

273
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:22,911
I mean, it's been hard for
Oliver ever since she and I...

274
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,778
Clark, I know that from the outside,

275
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:28,327
it doesn't seem like Oliver would ever
do anything to hurt Lois and me, but...

276
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,310
his dark half might.

277
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:32,487
He left that half behind.

278
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:33,976
Really?

279
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:36,022
Don't you think he bounced back
just a little bit fast?

280
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,846
I mean,
maybe he suppressed it.

281
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,063
Split personalities don't know
what the other half is doing.

282
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:43,967
You think that's what happened to him?

283
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:48,527
Chloe, it would take more than drugs and a
few boxing blows to make him go Jekyll/Hyde.

284
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,870
There's something I have
to tell you, Clark.

285
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,266
A few weeks ago, when Oliver
saved Victoria Sinclair,

286
00:21:56,301 --> 00:22:00,354
he pulled his life out of the emergency lane
and crossed the finish line a hero again.

287
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,772
But he didn't do it on his own.

288
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,130
I changed a couple of tires
along the way.

289
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,423
I set the whole thing up.

290
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,167
What?

291
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,730
He was dead hero walking, Clark.
I had to do something.

292
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:18,934
So you went out by yourself
and you saved him?

293
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:21,131
Isn't that what you do every day?

294
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:23,408
You should have told me.

295
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,186
And this is exactly why
I didn't tell you, Clark.

296
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,782
Anytime you have to pull the trigger...

297
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:31,480
on making a difficult decision,
you always just walk away.

298
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:32,865
I do what's right.

299
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:35,397
You're not willing to do
what's necessary.

300
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:37,853
Pulling the trigger on Oliver,
was that necessary?

301
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,134
Not if it really shattered him.

302
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,661
- Where are you going?
- To pick up the pieces.

303
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:15,155
Lois, what are you doing here?

304
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:18,226
Well, someone planted an arrow
pretty damn close to my heart,

305
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,373
and I don't think it's Cupid.

306
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:25,066
There's someone after me, and
I think they did this to you.

307
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:28,023
Okay, I get that there are some
things that you have to keep from me,

308
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:29,738
but why would they have attacked me?

309
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,240
Because they know we were together,
and they're trying to hurt me.

310
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:35,329
What about all the other girls
you were with?

311
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,579
Why couldn't they have shot
the Danish underwear model?

312
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:39,206
Lois, this person knows
everything about me.

313
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:43,118
They know that out of all those other women,
the only one I ever really cared about...

314
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:45,586
was you.

315
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:58,300
- Lois...
- Oliver...

316
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:02,204
I know you're under a lot of stress right
now, but you have to pull yourself together.

317
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:05,001
You have to find whoever
attacked Chloe and I.

318
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:07,108
Chloe was attacked?

319
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:09,444
Yes. She's okay.

320
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:13,748
Now, I get why this person would go
after an ex-lover, but not a friend.

321
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,421
"Lover."

322
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:24,935
Oh, God.

323
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,029
No vows, no lovers,
no allies...

324
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:30,105
and no disciples.

325
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,269
Mia.

326
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:26,755
Look, I know you probably don't
want to see me anytime this century,

327
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,654
but I finished my research
with those arrows,

328
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,607
and they were heavily collected,
just not by Oliver.

329
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,537
Maybe I was wrong.

330
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:35,622
I wish you were.

331
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,612
I hate to add another boxcar
to the bad-news train,

332
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:53,581
but I've seen this same symbol
before during my research.

333
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,732
Where's it from?

334
00:25:55,867 --> 00:26:01,334
There's a secret Celtic society founded
by apprentices and master archers.

335
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:06,795
Rumor was that they were made up of a
group of 13th-century vigilante assassins...

336
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,730
defending coastal towns from attacks.

337
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:11,433
Think, like, the CIA
with arrows and plaid skirts.

338
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,410
Do they still exist?

339
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:16,426
Well, they don't exactly
have a website, but...

340
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,243
some sort of a mentorship cult.

341
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,511
The apprentice follows
the orders of their master.

342
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:26,681
And vow to swear off lovers,
allies, and disciples.

343
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:28,717
That doesn't sound very Oliver.

344
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:31,353
Well, not exactly the Oliver
that we know now, but...

345
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,833
when he left that island,
he went AWOL for, like, a year.

346
00:26:35,257 --> 00:26:37,292
Maybe he joined this group.

347
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:39,951
He never did tell me
where he honed his skills,

348
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:42,764
and there's only so much you can
teach yourself alone on an island.

349
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,699
He was still getting over
the loss of his parents.

350
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,603
I mean, he wouldn't be the
first orphan to go and join a cult.

351
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:50,418
So, there's a chance this
night stalker isn't Oliver.

352
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,764
Maybe it's someone from his brotherhood
who needs to settle a score.

353
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,305
Mia!

354
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:04,075
Mia!

355
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:23,511
Who are you?!

356
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:25,235
Call me Vordigan.

357
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:28,359
I taught Green Arrow
almost everything he knows.

358
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,817
"Green Arrow."

359
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:34,588
And now it's time for my prize
student to come back home.

360
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:38,753
If you think he's coming back
for a class reunion, forget it!

361
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:41,602
He may not come for me...

362
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,969
but he will for you.

363
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:28,157
At last... the apprentice
heeds his master's call.

364
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:37,784
You know why you're here.

365
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,465
Vordigan.

366
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:46,404
Our paths split a long time ago.

367
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:49,127
You took your vows, Oliver.

368
00:28:49,256 --> 00:28:51,379
Now it's time to fulfill them.

369
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:53,705
You embraced me as your own son.

370
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:59,127
I can't follow in your footsteps.

371
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,179
There comes a time
when every master knows...

372
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:04,729
his best years are gone.

373
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:08,756
I was badly wounded
for the first time, Oliver,

374
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,655
because I wasn't fast enough,

375
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:14,752
physically or mentally.

376
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:19,323
I realized the process
of decay has begun.

377
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:24,012
Our tradition dictates
the master must leave this world...

378
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:27,300
while he's still strong and respected.

379
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,641
As my chosen successor,

380
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:32,272
you must complete your final test.

381
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:34,548
You need to kill me.

382
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:37,703
You taught me many things,
Vordigan,

383
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:41,040
about the kind of man
I wanted to become...

384
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:43,743
and the kind of man I didn't.

385
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:47,811
Some men don't get to choose
who they become.

386
00:29:48,682 --> 00:29:51,305
Your heart is dark like mine, Oliver.

387
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:52,934
No.

388
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:55,521
When I saw your true colors,
Vordigan, I left.

389
00:29:55,604 --> 00:29:57,615
Come on, Oliver.

390
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:01,960
You didn't abandon us because
of some higher moral conviction!

391
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:07,461
You left because you liked the
thrill of the hunt a little too much.

392
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:12,638
But you can't outrun fate.

393
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:17,637
If you won't fulfill your duties...

394
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:21,146
I will hunt down...

395
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:23,464
and kill your apprentice.

396
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:25,766
And when you see her dead body,

397
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,384
the dark archer in you will rise up,

398
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:32,330
and you will hunt me down
and take vengeance.

399
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,558
I'm not gonna kill you, Vordigan.

400
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:14,167
I've checked Oliver's plane, his boat,
and all the usual places. I found nothing.

401
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,094
Yeah, well, there's not much
information on this cult.

402
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:18,137
I mean, that's the problem
with secret societies, right?

403
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,029
They're just, uh, secret.

404
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:24,507
Still, I was hoping to find
some search results.

405
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:28,534
You know, Oliver's not the only
one I've been worried about.

406
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:32,160
You've been looking at the world
through a camera a lot lately, Chloe.

407
00:31:32,185 --> 00:31:34,546
Maybe it's time you go out
and you actually live in it.

408
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:37,126
I'm just looking out for people,
Clark. Just the same as you.

409
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:40,193
That's the problem with looking out
for people. Sometimes you lose yourself.

410
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:43,144
Don't worry.
No one's getting lost, okay?

411
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,230
Everything's under control.

412
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,704
Here's something.
There was an altar...

413
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:52,389
with markings similar to the ones
used by the band of merry men.

414
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:54,670
An entrepreneur bought it, and
he had it shipped from Ireland...

415
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,075
to his estate in Coast City.

416
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,225
There's a naval base nearby. There
should be plenty of satellite coverage.

417
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:02,102
I can switch to passive
microwave image.

418
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:04,516
That way, we can actually
see through the clouds.

419
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:10,731
Chloe, look, the symbol...
It's in the form of a maze.

420
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,828
There's movement.

421
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:24,236
That's the girl who's been
training with Oliver.

422
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:27,106
Like an apprentice?

423
00:32:32,312 --> 00:32:35,414
Oh, my God, Clark. There are
these vows... no lovers.

424
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,316
That would explain why Lois was hit.

425
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,552
And no allies, which would
explain my purple heart.

426
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:42,054
And no disciples outside of the cult.

427
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:43,922
That's her.

428
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:38,688
You know, he always said that
eventually my dark side would rise up...

429
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:40,959
and that I would take his life.

430
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:52,985
You were wrong.

431
00:34:57,924 --> 00:35:00,359
I shot him in the shoulder...

432
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:02,728
exactly where he taught me.

433
00:35:18,554 --> 00:35:20,021
Clark!

434
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:22,557
Sorry I'm late. I was watching
the monster truck jam finals.

435
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:24,684
Grave Maker lost his drivetrain.

436
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:26,629
He s never coming back.

437
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:28,796
It's okay, Lois. He's just a truck.

438
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:33,238
Oh, Clark. Come on. That's like
saying Tommy Lee's just a drummer.

439
00:35:34,737 --> 00:35:37,030
Sometimes I worry
there is no poetry in you.

440
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:39,465
You just have to look a little deeper.

441
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,306
What I wouldn't give
for a little X-ray vision.

442
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:45,284
It might give me some insight as to why...

443
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,874
I had to take a cab
back from the hospital.

444
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:53,088
I'm sorry that I didn't visit
you more at the hospital, Lois.

445
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,657
I was trying to get more
information on dark archer.

446
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:56,858
That's okay.

447
00:35:56,992 --> 00:36:01,431
Lucky for you, your friend kept
me supplied with flowers and gifts.

448
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,035
Who gave you that?

449
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:09,203
You know. Zod.

450
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,442
Really? What did he have to say?

451
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:17,712
Nothing but good things about you.
We talked about getting together.

452
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:19,948
No, Lois,
that's not a good idea.

453
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:21,382
Why?

454
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,985
Are you afraid he's gonna let it
slip that you tipped a cow once?

455
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,539
Clark, there aren't any secrets in
your life worthy of the front page.

456
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:30,316
It's okay.

457
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:52,553
That's PDA number five.

458
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:54,494
Not that I'm keeping track.

459
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:17,890
Nice.

460
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:20,608
Someone taught you well.

461
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:23,311
Yeah.

462
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:25,746
Then told me he didn't want
to see me again.

463
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:27,549
Nice.

464
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,951
Mia, I was trying to protect you.

465
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:34,455
I felt like if I split from you, Vordigan
would leave you alone. That's the truth.

466
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,158
Yeah, well, next time you're
being an unselfish hero,

467
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:40,128
I could use some explaino...

468
00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:42,196
Green Arrow?

469
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:44,321
or...

470
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,906
Mr. Green Arrow.

471
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:50,438
Don't worry.

472
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:54,886
I'm not gonna go tell all my friends
I use to train with the emerald archer.

473
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:57,879
Well, he's not done
with you yet.

474
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,576
I mean, unless of course...

475
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:07,622
- ...you're done with him.
- No.

476
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:11,177
No, I'm actually glad
my old teacher showed up again.

477
00:38:12,494 --> 00:38:15,259
Yours... not so much.

478
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:23,071
I still can't get him out of my head.

479
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:29,177
I just keep thinking, by the time Vordigan
gets out of prison, he'll be an old man.

480
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:32,080
I think you got better things
to worry about.

481
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:34,332
I'm not worried about him.

482
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:36,761
Mia, it's what he said.

483
00:38:40,055 --> 00:38:42,223
I think he's right.

484
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:45,757
What if I can't outrun
these dark places inside me?

485
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,296
That's why you need me.

486
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,698
To keep you in check.

487
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:55,203
There's a dark place
inside everyone, Oliver.

488
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:57,705
What we do with it depends...

489
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,273
not on who our teachers are but...

490
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:02,810
what we do with the lessons learned.

491
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:15,123
Lois Lane is off limits.

492
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:23,631
A Rau charm for good luck
is hardly cause for alarm.

493
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:26,198
Why would you give her
some Kryptonian symbol?

494
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,809
Rau symbolizes all that is good.

495
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,539
Once again,
you're assuming the worst of me.

496
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:36,244
No, we both know the only reason you
visited Lois was to send me a message.

497
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:39,835
You can't hurt me, but you will
hurt those I care about.

498
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,483
Living on Earth
has made you mistrustful.

499
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,770
I trust those who trust me.

500
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,990
You trust no one, Kal-El...

501
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:54,499
not even the woman that
you're supposed to care for.

502
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:58,859
She has no idea who you are,
does she?

503
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:03,203
Crossing that line is why
I won't help you get your powers.

504
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:07,690
I am just trying to save our race!

505
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:10,454
You're just doing this
to save your army.

506
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:13,534
Without them, you're just an
officer with no one to command.

507
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:18,174
I do not do this out of ego.
I do this out of desperation.

508
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:21,576
Don't act like there isn't some
agenda you're not telling me about.

509
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:27,521
You go near Lois again,
I will destroy you all.

510
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,611
You won't have to.

511
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:48,616
Did you find what you were after?

512
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:50,618
He didn't recognize the symbol.

513
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:52,654
- We don't have much time.
- I know.

514
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:55,235
I guess the book of Rau
is not on earth after all.

515
00:40:57,225 --> 00:41:00,528
No. Jor-El left it here.

516
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:02,203
And when we find it,

517
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:04,591
we will have the means
to complete the tower.

518
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:12,966
And we will turn
the yellow sun red.

519
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:18,181
And then Kal-El...

520
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:22,245
will not be the only one
with powers on this Earth.

521
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:26,823
He will be just one of many
soldiers in my army...

522
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:31,524
or a prisoner
in my stockade.
