1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,390
Cut!

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,790
Kill playback.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,290
***

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,890
People, we're losing light.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,890
chloe

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,590
hey Thanks to you, smallville's
finally getting a closeup.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,890
When I said they could film at the farm,

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,390
I didn't realize that half of
hollywood would show up at my doorstep.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,890
At least revel in the irony

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,290
that they've chosen
a single-theater town

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,890
to shoot their bazillion-dollar
"warrior angel" film.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,590
I guess I never really
got into comic books.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,590
Oh, come on.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,990
Who doesn't love the
story of a small-town boy

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,590
who grows up to save the
world from the evil devilicus?

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,890
I didn't know you were
such an avid follower.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,690
I'm not.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,690
It's just right now, fiction's a
lot more appealing than reality.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,890
I mean, dating is so overrated.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,990
Who really needs the extra added
headache of worrying about tables for two

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,890
and wardrobe remorse on a movie night.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,890
In other words, I've had plenty of free
time to create kara's fake backstory.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,190
Your cousin's secret identity
is practically google-proof.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,690
That's great.

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,290
Maybe when she clears her head and
comes home, she'll appreciate it.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,990
Sorry, guys.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,590
Got to move you back.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,190
ok***

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,490
All that for one star.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,590
Clark, rachel davenport
is not just a star.

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,890
She's practically her own constellation.

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,490
I mean, don't you watch movies at all?

33
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,090
Turns out miss super diva put a
moratorium on all press interviews.

34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,090
God, an exclusive with her would definitely
put a snap back into my editor's suspenders.

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,490
And roll sound!

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,890
Roll camera!

37
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,790
Here we go.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,290
Roll playback.And...

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,290
action.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,390
Steven, you won't believe
the photos I got us, baby.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,890
Meet me at the french place in an hour.

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,290
***

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,990
***

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,390
Cut.

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,090
That was perfect.

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,190
Rachel, that's a cut.

47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,890
What the hell?

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,990
Rachel, that's a cut.

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,390
Oh, my god.no

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,390
Is it supposed to be like this?

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,790
Oh, my god!Somebody
help!Somebody help me!

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,490
So, you just totally saved my life.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,190
You're amazing.

hey.

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,290
I can think of other
ways to burn calories.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,290
I didn't hear you come in last night.

60
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,490
I know.

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,790
You were already asleep
when I got home from nell'S.

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,890
And you looked so cute, I
couldn't bear to wake you.

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,890
But even heroes need their beauty sleep.

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,390
local hero clark kent
saves hollywood starlet

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,990
After years of these articles, you'd
think I would have figured it out.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,390
I guess people only see
what they think is possible.

67
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,990
Well, I, for one, am
glad I've seen the light.

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,690
And I think the spotlight is
better suited in hollywood.

69
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,390
Clark kent?

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,290
Ms.Rachel davenport is requesting
your company on the set.

71
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,990
Looks like I'm not your only fan.

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,690
Rachel is very busy, so keep it
short and don't ask for an autograph.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,490
No problem.

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,890
Ms.Davenport, your guest has arrived.

75
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,590
Attention, everyone.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,490
Mr.Kent and i need
some one-on-one.

77
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,690
***

78
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,290
Thank you.

79
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,390
Today we shoot the famous date scene.

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,390
Warrior angel's about to stand me up.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,590
It's heartbreaking.

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,490
In his defense, I'm sure
he has a good excuse.

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,090
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you...

84
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,090
personally.

85
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,990
That was really brave, what you did.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,990
After what happened, I'm surprised
you're not in the hospital.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,690
God, no.

88
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,590
I got my start on a medical drama.

89
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,590
Two seasons of bad memories.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,090
You mean you haven't memorized
my entire acting repertoire?

91
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,090
You know, I don't watch a lot of movies.

92
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,890
Clark, I'm kidding.

93
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,990
You know, it's refreshing for
someone to see the real me,

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,390
not just the tabloid version.

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,890
I'm sorry to interrupt, ms.Davenport,

96
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,790
t this girl said she absolutely
needed to speak to clark.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,790
Rachel, this is my
friend chloe sullivan.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,090
She works at the daily
planet.She'd love to interview you.

99
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,890
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,890
Ually, I don't give
interviews, but you know what?

101
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,490
For a friend of
clark's -- sure thing.

102
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,490
Okay.

103
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,190
Except I'm -- I'm afraid I'm
actually in line behind the sheriff.

104
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,690
Um, after your crash, the
police autopsied your vehicle,

105
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,090
and it looks like someone jimmied the
accelerator and cut the brake line.

106
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,790
No offense, ms.Davenport,

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,790
but the only accident here
is that clark saved your life.

108
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,290
It's lois
lane, l-a-n-E.

109
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,590
Lane!

110
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,490
No time for chitchat, chasing a lead.

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,990
If you were on point, you wouldn't have let
the ledger scoop you on the davenport story.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,190
Head out to the set
and sniff out a scandal.

113
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,590
News flash -- white-collar crime
is this season's hollywood D.U.I.

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,790
Luthorcorp recently purchased 100
acres of land a mile from the dam

115
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,990
where lex was building his toy soldiers.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,990
And I'm stifling my yawn because?

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,990
Because it's not one of lex's
"look at me, I've changed" stories.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,190
This fiction should come with nodoz.

119
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,890
Besides, orphanages,
hospitals --

120
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,490
nobody goes to bed
satan and wakes up oprah.

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,790
It's a front.

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,090
You're new here, so maybe
you didn't read the memo,

123
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,690
but you need proof to write a story.

124
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,290
There's nothing on the
property except a lone cabin

125
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,390
and a bunch of "danger,
no trespassing" signs.

126
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,790
Do yourself a favor, lane.

127
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,090
Drop the lead.

128
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,890
You decided to join us.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,490
Water.

130
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,690
Oh, of course.

131
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,890
You must be parched.

132
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,290
Where am I?

133
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,090
Who are you?

134
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,790
I'm marilyn.

135
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,590
Why haven't you taken me
to a hospital, marilyn?

136
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,490
Not even a "thank you" before
you start asking for silk sheets.

137
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,190
What is
-- I --

138
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,290
What the hell is this?

139
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,290
You unlock it, marilyn.

140
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,590
You know I can't run that risk.

141
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,790
Not even for lionel luthor.

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,590
They're gonna find me, marilyn.

143
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,990
It's only a matter of time, you know

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,990
**yo as far as I know, there's
not a lot of people looking.

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,790
Maybe it's time you
found some better friends.

146
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,190
It's marilyn.

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,490
He's finally awake.

148
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,890
Tell me the truth.

149
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,390
Are you different than other men?

150
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,290
How can you ask me
that?You barely know me.

151
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,790
I know you enough to see you walk
around with a secret so powerful

152
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,590
it won't let you close to anyone.

153
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,490
Um, "you should be with someone who
can give you the love you deserve.

154
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,390
" You are that someone.

155
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,390
But you want to lie and run away.Why?

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,890
"penelope, if I
ever hurt you" --

157
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,390
you can't hurt me if you love me.

158
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,690
It's okay.

159
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,290
It's part of the scene.

160
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,090
Yeah, but
I have a --

161
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,790
Girlfriend.

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,690
Lana.

163
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,090
Rehearsing lines.

164
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,490
- This is, um
-- - rachel.

165
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,590
I know.I'm lana.Hi.

166
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,290
Hi.

167
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,190
I hope that clark saved some of
those lines to rehearse with me later.

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,290
You know what?

169
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,990
I'm gonna go to the kitchen,

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,390
have some cookies, and drink whole milk.

171
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,790
I didn't realize that rachel
was actually staying here.

172
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,290
I figured the farm
was more off the radar.

173
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,390
No one would look for her here.

174
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,890
Well, I didn't want to freak her out,

175
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,090
but chloe might have found
a clue about the attacker.

176
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,390
She got sidetracked by her
editor, but she e-mailed us this.

177
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,190
Warrior angel internet blogs.

178
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,990
Not all the fans are enthusiastic
about the film's interpretation.

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,990
The movie stays true to the
mythology in all ways but one.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,190
In the comics, warrior
angel's girlfriend dies.

181
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,090
And in the movie, she doesn'T.

182
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,390
Blogs, message boards, fan foms
-- these are all pretty extreme.

183
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,090
How are we supposed to narrow this down
to the one psycho who's willing to kill?

184
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,690
There's one poster, devilicus rebel,

185
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,990
who's becoming more and more aggressive.

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,490
"When will davenport learn
our hero lives in solitude?

187
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,690
Her blood will unleash the truth"?

188
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,790
Grew up on a farm with two
dogs, only child, home-schooled.

189
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,690
Looks like our 19-year-old from
minnesota keeps a flawless record.

190
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,390
Keep searching.

191
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,190
I just read about your
heroics in the paper.

192
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,090
Who needs warrior angel when
we've got our own clark kent?

193
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,090
Actually, that's why I'm here.

194
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,990
I was wondering if you could
help me with a reference.

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,290
You're the biggest
warrior angel fan I know.

196
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,790
Was a fan.

197
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,290
I haven't picked up a
comic since we were friends.

198
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,990
Back when I saw life as black and white.

199
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,490
When I realized good and evil was
gray, the stories lost their magic.

200
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,190
Though I have to admit,

201
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,890
yours is the last nose I'd
expect to find in a comic.

202
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,890
Someone wants rachel
davenport out of the movie.

203
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,890
This could be a clue to the next attack.

204
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,690
one hero lives in solitude.her
blood will unleash the truth.

205
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,790
"A hero in solitude.

206
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,390
" Issue number 5.

207
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,690
One of my favorites.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,790
It's the first time the archrival
devilicus gets the upper hand.

209
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,590
Warrior angel's girlfriend
gets in over her head.

210
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,790
In trying to expose devilicus' darkness,

211
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,290
she goes face to face with one
of the most powerful villains

212
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,290
in the fantasy comics universe.

213
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,290
So devilicus does something
no reader sees coming.

214
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,590
He shoots her.

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,990
Warrior angel can't get there in
time, and she dies in his arms.

216
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,490
I read the script.

217
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,690
In the movie version, warrior
angel saves his girlfriend's life.

218
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,090
Sounds like hollywood
went for the happy ending.

219
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,990
In the comic-book world,

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,090
when you're destined to save mankind,

221
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,390
you're destined to be alone.

222
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,690
Here you are, sir.

223
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,490
Loaded, ready to go.

224
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,890
All right, we're rolling.

225
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,790
Rolling!

229
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,690
action.

230
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,590
You'll never live to expose me.

231
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,190
If it's not me, it'll be someone else.

232
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,590
Sooner or later, you'll be
seen for who you really are.

233
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,190
Cut!

234
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,490

Wow, I am really good at this.

241
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,590
Remind me to change my locks.

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,490
Lex.

243
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,490
I thought you were being honored
by the green cross tonight.

Where did you get this?

246
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,490
You know, lois,

247
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,390
journalists have spent the
last decade unearthing my life,

248
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,290
turning whatever dirt they can
find into bad headline puns.

249
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,690
Do you really think you're different?

250
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,390
I don't have any secrets left.

251
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,590
It's not a secret that you
purchased land by the dam

252
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,990
where you were conducting
illegal experiments?

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,290
I never authorized the
purchase of any land by the dam.

254
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,490
Well, not to be callous,

255
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,190
but with your dad M.I.A.,

256
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,590
There aren't a whole lot of luthors around
these days with authorization privileges.

257
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,590
Mr.Luthor?

258
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,090
- Escort her off the premises.
- yes sir

259
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,590
Careful, lionel.

260
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,990
We're not all millionaires.

261
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,890
Look...

262
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,490
I was wrong earlier.

263
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,390
I should thank you...

264
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,290
for everything.

265
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,790
To be honest,

266
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,390
it's starting to get a little lonely all
the way out here in the middle of nowhere.

267
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,090
It's nice having company.

268
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,390
But I don't have time!

270
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,190
Here he comes.

271
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,190
What's it like dating
a hollywood starlet?

272
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,890
Is it true that rachel's
staying here at your farm?

273
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,990
Would you to make any comment?

274
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,290
How long have you been dating?

275
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,790
Are you an aspiring actor?

276
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,690
Do you have any future plans?

277
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,390
Rachel, the sheriff said that he
wasn't able to come up with any more...

278
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,090
leads.

279
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,890
This place is surrounded by
paparazzi.What are you doing?

280
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,090
More like undoing six hours in a body
harness and the stress of a death threat.

281
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,290
Rachel, if the paparazzi found you,

282
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,490
then the person who attacked
you knows you're here.

283
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,390
So much for de-stressing.

284
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,590
Can you excuse us, please?

285
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,790
Certainly.

286
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,390
Can you hand me that robe over there?

287
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,890
Yeah.

288
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,990
clark kent

289
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,990
Rachel, what's this?

290
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,990
A messenger delivered it.

291
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,990
Warrior angel comic book?

292
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,290
i saw what you did. it's your
job to save the world.save it.

293
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,490
What's going on, clark?

294
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,190
Let's go.

295
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,890
We're leaving now.This
place isn't safe anymore.

296
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,190
It's you.

297
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,890
Thank god.

298
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,490
How did he escape, marilyn?

299
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,990
I don't know.

300
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,590
I'm not paying you to make mistakes.

301
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,490
Don't say a word.

302
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,290
Clark, hi.

303
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,790
Just watching a movie with aunt nell.

304
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,690
Of course, I'll pick up
rachel as soon as I can.

305
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,290
Okay.

306
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,690
chloe, I'm glad you're still here.

307
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,990
Yeah, well, overtime really
helps me resist all temptation

308
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,590
to grace jimmy's myspace page.

309
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,190
What's up?

310
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,890
The fan stalking rachel must
have seen me catch that bullet.

311
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,190
He's the only one who knew it was real.

312
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,490
Now he thinks I'm a superhero.

313
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,190
Oh, my god, clark.

314
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,590
This guys' blog gets,
like, 10,000 hits a day.

315
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,390
One post, and all of a sudden you're
everybody's favorite boy wonder.

316
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,290
Can you track this warrior
angel comic to its owner?

317
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,790
I'd be a pretty lame
sidekick if I couldn'T.

318
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,290
Okay, when I was scanning
all of those blogs,

319
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,890
I came across a collector who
tracks warrior angel comic sales.

320
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,590
Maybe he's registered this one.

321
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,090
Here we go.

322
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,190
Cosmic comics in metropolis sold
one to a ben meyers last week.

323
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,590
815 vine street.

324
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,990
***I knew you'd find me.

325
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,090
Only a real hero would.

326
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,090
You're the production
assistant from the movie.

327
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,690
Where are you?

328
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,890
Oh, come on.If I told you
that, you'd never let me go.

329
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,190
You're behind the attacks, aren't you?

330
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,290
Warrior angel was all I had.

331
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,590
He gave me something to believe in.

332
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,590
He gave me hope.

333
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,390
Warrior angel wouldn't
try to kill someone.

334
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,390
You can't mess with someone's idol.

335
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,990
That's exactly why nobody
believes in heroes anymore.

336
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,090
Including you, clark.

337
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,890
And that's where I come in.

338
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,290
Just like devilicus made warrior
angel stand up and save the world.

339
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,990
You need help.

340
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,290
You just don't know it yet.

341
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,090
Dad?

342
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,790
You're alive.

343
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,490
I never gave up on you.

344
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,990
Lex, why did you do this?

345
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,090
But I see you've given up on me.

346
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,490
Don't you make me pull the trigger.

347
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,190
Easy.

348
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,490
We can't all be heroes, lex.

349
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,990
Besides, I read about you luthors.

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,590
Lionel would rather stick around and have
his other wrist broke than be saved by you.

351
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,890
Dad.

352
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,490
Dad!

353
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,190
Dad!!

354
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,790
Lana, I'm sorry for what
you saw in clark's loft.

355
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,190
Rehearsing lines?

356
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,690
It's in his eyes.

357
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,290
You're the center of clark's universe.

358
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,790
I've only seen love like
that once in my life.

359
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,990
What happened?

360
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,990
The director yelled "cut.

361
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,990
" Updated call sheets.

362
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,690
Oh, god.I can't escape
work for three seconds?

363
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,390
How did you find me?

364
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,890
Destiny.

365
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,790
Sorry, lana.

366
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,490
But there's a hero living among us,

367
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,090
and there's only one way
he'll accept his calling.

368
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,190
You need to die.

369
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,390
What did you mean when you said that he
was trying to make you accept your destiny?

370
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,890
That I was supposed to
stand for something greater.

371
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,390
It was my job to save the world.

372
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,590
He didn't think organic
farmer was a close second?

373
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,090
This guy's delusional, chloe.

374
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,790
You couldn't possibly agree with him.

375
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,190
Do you want to cue my editorial,

376
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,690
or do you want to help me find
the guy who's gonna out you***?

377
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,590
What about his hard drive?Might help.

378
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,990
I think it's too rational.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,190
I mean, if ben is this fractured,

380
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,790
we're gonna need to loosen
a few screws of our own.

381
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,090
Approach his next move like someone who's
blurred the line between fiction and reality.

382
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,890
So let's think.

383
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,990
If I'm devilicus,

384
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,090
what is the worst
possible thing I could do

385
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,190
to warrior angel to make
him accept his destiny?

386
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,990
Lana.

387
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,890
Let me go!

388
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,790
I can'T.

389
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,690
Don't you see?

390
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,290
Clark was made for a greater glory,

391
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,090
but until he gives up his own desires
and focuses on the rest of the world,

392
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,890
thousands of lives are at stake.

393
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,590
And mine doesn't matter?

394
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,790
I know it's not easy being a
superhero's girlfriend, lana,

395
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,890
but clark has to face his destiny alone.

396
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,590
An d you're standing in the way.

397
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,990
Lana.

398
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,390
missing ceo found alive
billionaire lionel luthor discovered

399
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,890
This is ***

400
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,090
are you reading it upside down?

401
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,790
Lionel luthor lives.

402
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,690
And he was found on luthorcorp land

403
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,690
that no one in the company
claims to have purchased.

404
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,690
Now, did lex use my
tip to find his father,

405
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,490
or has he been keeping
him there all this time?

406
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,390
You went behind my back.

407
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,790
The rules were, stay
away from the luthors.

408
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,490
Careful, grant.

409
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,890
You're starting to sound
like you care about me.

410
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,690
More like annoyed...

411
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,190
that I'll have to
babysit you friday night.

412
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,890
The planet's being honored.

413
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,090
You're going with me to accept.

414
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,290
Tempting.

415
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,590
I take notes and look pretty,

416
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,590
you get to sit at the bar and
schmooze with all the important people.

417
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,690
I was thinking more along the lines of,

418
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,790
you getting some face time
with the who's who of metropolis

419
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,690
and rescuing me from
some long-winded speeches.

420
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,590
You asking me on a date?

421
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,190
God, no.I'm your boss.

422
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,190
You know what?That's it.

423
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,790
You're fired from being my plus one.

424
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,290
You can't fire me.I never accepted.

425
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,290
Here.

426
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,190
Something tells me you don't want
to be scooped again by the ledger.

427
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,890
Oh, and for the record,

428
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,290
if i had been your plus one,

429
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,290
you would have been my arm candy.

430
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,190
Lex told me you're living here now.

431
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,290
Well,

432
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,290
you haven't wasted much time

433
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,390
getting back to your roots, have you?

434
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,390
Lionel, I heard what happened.

435
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,490
Are you okay?

436
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,890
It's hardly reassuring
to read your own obituary,

437
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,690
but you should know that,
I suppose, shouldn't you?

438
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,890
They said that you were being
held captive by a crazy woman.

439
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,790
Indeed I was.

440
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,890
You.

441
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,590
I would never be involved
in something like that.

442
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,890
Oh, please.

443
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,290
That line stopped working for you
the day you faked your own death.

444
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,690
Lex gave me the details,

445
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,790
which leaves only one
question unanswered.

446
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,990
How much does clark know?

447
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,090
I'm sure that he's thrilledthat
you are alive and well.

448
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,490
I'm sure that you have
managed to convince yourself

449
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,190
that you did everything
for the sake of clark kent.

450
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,390
That your love could protect
him half a world away.

451
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,690
Finding your body and
paying your captor seems

452
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,690
rather complicated from
a hotel in shanghai.

453
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,790
You may have lost the luthor name,

454
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,990
but it's the luthor instincts that
keep those claws of yours sharp.

455
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,790
Lana,

456
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,490
please listen to me.

457
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,690
You are on the edge of
a dangerous precipice.

458
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,090
You could easily tumble down
into someplace very dark...

459
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,690
and very hard to escape.

460
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,490
I hope you don't plan on
spreading these lies to clark.

461
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,390
Lies?

462
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,590
I don't believe your good intentions.

463
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,490
You're not trying to protect clark.

464
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,790
This is about retribution.

465
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,390
Let him go, lana, before it's too late.

466
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,690
belle rave sanit arium keep out!

467
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,690
Lex luthor.

468
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,790
What are you doing here?

469
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,590
I thought you might enjoy this.

470
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,790
Here.

471
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,690
These are the rarest
warrior angel comics ever.

472
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,790
They're worth a fortune.

473
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,290
Why are you giving me this?

474
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,090
Because I've been known
to believe in something

475
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,390
after the whole world
tells me I'm wrong.

476
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,690
Devilicus -- he said that exact
line to the president in issue --

477
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,290
175.

478
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,590
Ben, they dragged you in
here kicking and screaming

479
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,290
because you claim you saw a man with
superpowers swipe a bullet out of thin air.

480
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,590
I'm here to listen.

481
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,890
There's nothing to say.

482
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,190
It was all in my head.

483
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,890
Help, somebody!

484
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,090
Got ya!

485
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,390
Did you ever consider
a career in acting?

486
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,290
I wanted to say goodbye.

487
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,190
But don't worry -- I'll
be back for the sequel.

488
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,590
What's this?

489
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,090
Thanks -- for showing me smallville
had more to offer than a tax break.

490
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,590
It's a little something from the movie.

491
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,690
Every hero needs one.

492
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,190
I signed on to warrior angel
for publicity and a paycheck,

493
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,090
but after meeting you,

494
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,690
I'm starting to believe
that heroes really do exist.

495
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,590
There's something special
about this one, lana.

496
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,390
Hold on to him.

497
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,090
I sure hope that comment
about a sequel was a joke.

498
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,290
You okay?

499
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,390
Just thinking about what ben said.

500
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,490
Oh, lana, don'T.

501
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,290
Ben was a crazy fan...

502
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,690
who got locked up in belle reve.

503
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,790
He needed hope, and he's not wrong.

504
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,590
Millions of people look
up to warrior angel.

505
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,890
What if those people could
look up to you instead?

506
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,490
Well, lana, there's not even
a million people in smallville.

507
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,890
Clark,

508
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,790
I just want to grab on to
you and never let you go...

509
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,490
but one day the world will
need you more than I do,

510
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,590
and I don't want to be
the one holding you here.

511
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,390
I'm not going anywhere.

512
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,590
For the first time in my life,

513
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,090
I have everything I've ever wanted, and
it's right here on this farm with you.

514
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,090
Okay.

515
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,290
