1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,600
Okay,so maybe bowling isn't my calling,

2
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,850
but it is one of the last
doctor-approved exercises left.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,080
Look,lana,
I love bowling gutter balls

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,620
just as much as the next girl,

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,790
but I've got to admit --

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,980
I expected something a little different
for the bachelorette party.

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,210
I know I could have invited a bunch of girls

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,140
and gone out in a limo for a night on the town,

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,150
but this is so much more special.

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,530
Yeah...eating chili fries and knocking down pins.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,850
With my best friend --

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
like we used to,one last time.

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,230
Lana,you're getting married.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,720
You're not moving to antarctica.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm also having a baby.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,180
And I have a feeling that these girls' nights out

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,960
are gonna be a lot harder to come by.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,010
I wouldn't be so sure.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,780
But just in case,let's document the night.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,720
- Okay. 
- All right.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,060
- Ready? 
- Yes.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,670
Cute.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,740
One last picture of lana lang
before she becomes lana luthor.

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,870
Excuse me.

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,710
I couldn't help
but notice your form was perfect,

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,160
but your wrist is a little off.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,330
You think I could give you a pointer?

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,550
Who's gonna man the shoe fort?

29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,750
I could care less.

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,210
My shift's over,anyways.

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,530
- Here. 
- All right.

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,870
Okay,you're gonna point the inside
of your elbow straight down that lane.

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,710
Okay,I'll try,

34
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,960
but don't sign me up
for the pro-bowling league just yet.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,090
Oh,trust me.

36
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,050
I've got the magic touch.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
All right.

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,200
Oh,my god! I did it!

39
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,190
Wow. Nice tip.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,020
But it's the last frame. 
You get to go again.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,390
Cool.

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,500
Remember what I said.

43
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,470
Okay.

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,050
Good job,lana.

45
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,600
Why don't you give me your number,

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,640
and I'll share a few more tips?

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm not sure that my fianc would approve?

48
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,820
Ah,yeah.Probably not.

49
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,540
Thank you.

50
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on,Chloe,have more pictures.

51
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,510
Why here?

52
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,320
Bowling alleys always attract big crowds.

53
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,340
Okay,tobias,it's time to take them off.

54
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,240
Only for a second.

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,530
I know it hurts.

56
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,580
There's one right there.

57
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,270
- Hey! Hey! 
- Help!

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,850

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,090
I can't believe 
there isn't even a skid mark outside.

62
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,810
Maybe there's a clue in here.

63
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,270
You're sure this guy was krypto-powered?

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,860
Clark,there was one pin standing,and then --

65
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,710
boom! --It fell all by itself.

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,860
Huh -- that would give someone a good reason

67
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,770
to kidnap a bowling-alley employee.

68
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,440
Did lana see the abduction?

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,300
No --

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,980
speaking of which,
with the wedding of the century coming up,

71
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,180
are you gonna be renting a tux 
next weekend or a dvd?

72
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,570
Chloe,what possible reason would I 
have to watch them get married?

73
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,030
Maybe because if you showed up,

74
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,150
it would send a message 
that you're actually moving on --

75
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,920
you know,to lana,to lex --

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,290
more importantly,to yourself.

77
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,010
So,what does this guy look like -- 
your bowling buddy?

78
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,830
Uh,he's asian,about 6 feet tall,
with an earring in his left ear.

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,880
You mean like that guy?

80
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,730
Hey!What are you doing? We're closed.

81
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,800
What happened to you last night?

82
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,470
Ohh,did --did you and me --

83
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,190
did we -- did we hook up?

84
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,050
Uh,no,you were thrown in the back 
of a van by men in black.

85
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,900
Damn. I thought i drank a lot last night.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,180
You're sure you don't remember 
getting thrown in the back of that van?

87
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,350
I don't remember anything.

88
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,640
I figured I just blacked out.

89
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,050
It was saturday night.

90
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,170
I wasn't driving,
so I cracked open a pint.

91
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up in bed like any other morning.

92
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,510
Is it me,or do I look like 
a waiter serving high tea?

93
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,160
You look like 
the most handsome groom in the world.

94
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,800
Good answer.

95
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,720
Questo ?perfetto.

96
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,250
Grazie.

97
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,130
About last night --

98
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,760
why did chloe go outside 
in the middle of your bachelorette party?

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,180
She said she needed some air.

100
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,310
In the back alley?

101
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,310
Why not go out front like everyone else?

102
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,090
Lex,you seem a little obsessed 
with the details.

103
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,630
She's your maid of honor,
and she almost got run over.

104
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,510
Lana,I wouldn't want anything 
to happen to her.

105
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,220
Neither would I.

106
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,740
I'll see you at dinner.

107
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,880
Dr. Bethany,did we have an appointment?

108
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,000
The boy is growing impatient.

109
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,760
He keeps askingwhen the surgery is.

110
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,780
Well,tell him corneasdon't grow on trees.

111
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,980
He's blind,mr. Luthor,not stupid.

112
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm afraid if we keep stalling,
he'll start talking.

113
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,180
You were the one 
who warned methat a cornea transplant

114
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,420
would most likely take awayhis abilities.

115
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,880
If he tells anyonewhat we're doing,
my career isas good as over.

116
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,170
I'm the oneon the line here.

117
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,960
Think of your wife,doctor.

118
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,430
If we could have trackedthese 
subjects a year ago,

119
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,540
she might neverhave been murdered.

120
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't pretend you careabout crime,mr. Luthor.

121
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,940
I know aboutyour meteor-rock research.

122
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,240
I've been victimizedby these people,
just like you have.

123
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,160
Tell tobias to be patient.

124
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,970
Daniel may not bethe only one.

125
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,620
Last week a mother called 911,

126
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,980
complainingthat her son 
disappeared in the middle of the night.

127
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,540
But when he showed up in bedthe next morning,

128
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,910
safe and sound,there was no case.

129
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,870
Son's name -- brian osborne,

130
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,080
also on the wall of weird --
suspected clairvoyant.

131
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,420
So people with meteor powersare being abducted.

132
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,270
And then releasedwith a memory wipe 
that reaches backbefore the abduction.

133
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,450
The question iswhat's happening to them 
on their big night out?

134
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,530
I'm guessingnot a pajama party.

135
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,660
Considering lex's historywith 33.1,
I bet he's behind this.

136
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,040
That wouldn't be a shocker.

137
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,000
But this isthe only clue I have.

138
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,750
That's you and lana havingthe time of your lives.

139
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,030
- That's great. - Be patient.

140
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,900
See? That's tobias rice.

141
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,620
He was blindedin the last meteor shower,
and he's pointingdirectly at daniel.

142
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,140
Why would a blind guypoint at someone?

143
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,190
Come on in,guys. 
It's niceto hear a familiar voice.

144
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,100
Tobias,I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

145
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,450
Hey,I got off lucky -- 
my parents,not so much.

146
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,120
Can I get you guyssomething to drink?

147
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,850
How about an iced tea?

148
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,120
Don't make medrink alone.

149
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,900
Sure,I'll have a glass.Thanks.

150
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,150
Tobias,you were at smallvillelanes 
last night,weren't you?

151
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,020
You sound surprised.

152
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,010
You were pointing at someone,
someone named --

153
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,820
I hate to break it to you,
but in my condition,

154
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm not doing too muchpointing these days.

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,870
Hopefully that'll change.

156
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,700
I'm on this waiting list
for a cornea transplant.

157
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,940
Hey,let me help youwith that.

158
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,250
No,I can handle it.

159
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,990
Tobias,I'm sorry.
The glass almost hit the ground.

160
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,640
Are you all right,tobias?

161
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,450
I'm fine.

162
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,250
It's just,when my glasses are off,

163
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,440
I get these ragingheadaches from the light.

164
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,580
Please just go.

165
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,740
Call me crazy,
but it wasalmost like he saw something.

166
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,720
That's what worries me.

167
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,920
Tobias,is that you?

168
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,900
Dr. Bethany... I found another one.

169
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,750
I'm at the hospital now.
We'll deal with this later.

170
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,450
Jimmy,okay,you win.
You can come over tonight.

171
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,750
But I'm warning you --I have a deadline.

172
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,540
Yeah,I like you a lot,too.

173
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,900
Bye.

174
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,510
Hey. Late-nightnuptial emergency?

175
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,370
This isn'tabout the wedding.

176
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,440
I was just wondering --

177
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,240
did you really go outside
for fresh air last night,

178
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,250
or was thereanother reason?

179
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,090
All right,I admit it.

180
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,020
I was worried 
that he wasanother lana lang stalker.

181
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,720
But listen -- 
I gotmy bridesmaid's dress,

182
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,450
and you have amazing taste.

183
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,630
Why do I get the feeling

184
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,990
that you'reseriously sidestepping 
any discussionabout that abduction?

185
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,120
You think lex had something
to do with this,don't you?

186
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,520
Let's just say itwouldn't be a huge leap,

187
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,580
considering dan the manhas a meteor power.

188
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,660
It turns outthat his bowling tips

189
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,230
came with an added advantage --telekinesis --

190
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,860
and I thinkthat's why he was abducted.

191
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,440
But you and I both know

192
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,050
that just because someonehas an ability 
doesn't make thema bad person.

193
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,510
Some of these people 
might usetheir powers to save people.

194
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,530
Okay,I don't knowwho you're talking about,

195
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,180
but the meteor freaksthat I've met 
aren't exactly in line to wina nobel peace prize.

196
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,120
These people don't advertisetheir abilities.

197
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,180
Whoever did this -- 
how did theyfigure out who to abduct?

198
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,720
There's a kid who wentto smallville high

199
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,860
who was blindedin the last meteor shower,

200
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,430
and now he has the abilityto identify meteor freaks.

201
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,880
What's his name?

202
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,620
- Dr. Bethany. 
- Yes. Can I help you?

203
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm friends with tobias rice.
He called you today.

204
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,900
He's a patient of mine.

205
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,710
Tobias said,"I found another one."

206
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm not sure what that meant,
but I'm worried about him.

207
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,190
Well,I'm glad 
that tobiashas such caring friends.

208
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,220
But anything said betweenmy patients and myself
is strictly confidential.

209
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,190
What about daniel kim?
Is he a patient of yours?

210
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,440
I've never heard of him.

211
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,030
Ah,dr. Bethany,

212
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,610
I have something for youto sign here.

213
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,640
**************

214
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,400
**************

215
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,550
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

216
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,400
- Where is it? 
- Where's what?

217
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,100
My computer.You took it,didn't you?

218
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,520
Chloe?

219
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,250
Clark,please tell me
you know where chloe is.

220
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,100
She's not here?

221
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,510
No,I can't find her anywhere,
and to tell you the truth,

222
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,980
I'm starting to freak outa little bit.

223
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,560
She's not answeringher cellphone.******

224
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,300
Wait. Calm down. 
When wasthe last time you saw her?

225
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,360
Uh...

226
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,150
it was at --at the planet this morning.

227
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,860
She's on a deadline. 
She'ssupposed to be here working.

228
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,010
All right,well,
if she's under a deadline,

229
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,300
she's probably outresearching her story.

230
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,420
On the downtownparking meters?

231
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,200
I don't think so.

232
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,890
Look,I swear,clark,
ifanything happens to her...

233
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,310
jimmy,take this computer.

234
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,980
See if you can breakinto its files.

235
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,560
Chloe's the one withthe mad techno skills.

236
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,970
I'm just a guy with a camera and kidnapped...

237
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,980
...Girlfriend.

238
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,040
Where is dr. Bethany?

239
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,290
Clark?How did you get in here?

240
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,600
He's not at the hospital,
and he's not answeringhis pages.

241
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,090
Where is he?

242
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,490
How am I supposed to know?

243
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,730
He kidnapped chloe.

244
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,180
He took my friend.

245
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,580
Now,where is he?

246
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,960
Kidnapped?I don't understand.

247
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,480
Tobias...don't lie to me.

248
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,010
He saidhe was helping people.

249
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,530
He's not gonnahelp chloe,tobias.

250
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,210
She's a witness.

251
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,830
God knowswhat he'll do to her.

252
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,170
Look,if he took her,
it's notbecause she's a witness.

253
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,600
He's trying to lure me in.

254
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,440
You? Why would he wantto do that?

255
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,340
Why would he take chloe?

256
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,820
You -- you guysare such close friends

257
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,570
that I thought you knew.

258
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,570
Knew what?

259
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,390
She's meteor-infected,clark.

260
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,380
Boron levels?

261
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,300
225.

262
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,460
Copper,cadmium,and chloride all high.

263
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,880
The clock is ticking.

264
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,740
Let's not waste time.

265
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,220
Erythrocyte and leukocytecounts confirmed.

266
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,650
Initializing full-bodyspectral scan.

267
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,730
Scanning in progress.

268
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,380
Vertical asymptoteat "X."

269
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
Preparingfor dna extraction.

270
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,800
Hello,beautiful.

271
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,290
How are the two of you
doing this morning?

272
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,210
We're both doing just fine.

273
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,210
Lex,have you ever heardof tobias rice?

274
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,310
No. Why?

275
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
Well,I ran into himin the bowling alley.

276
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,310
We went to school together.

277
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,390
He lost his visionin the meteor shower,

278
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,810
and now he has this ability
to sense meteor-infected people.

279
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,020
That's intriguing,

280
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,460
but why do you thinkI'd know him?

281
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,400
Because I know what kinds of 
things you're interested in,

282
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,560
and meteor powersare high on the list.

283
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,140
Maybe so,

284
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,290
but in this case,
I'm afraid I'm in the dark.

285
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,950
I've never heardof your friend.

286
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,900
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,830
Jimmy,any luck with the computer?

288
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,530
I triedevery trick I know,

289
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,960
but I'm an amateurin the encryption game.

290
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,890
Look,what about the doctor?
What did he say?

291
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,140
He's nowhere to be found.

292
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,560
What if shereally is gone,clark?

293
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,070
I've never met anyonelike chloe sullivan,

294
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,410
and I never will.

295
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,230
And you know what
the most pathetic part is?

296
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,070
Is that --

297
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,420
is that I was so busy
playing it cool that...

298
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,850
...I never got to tell her
how I really,truly feel.

299
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,790
Well,now's your chance.

300
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Chloe. You're back.

301
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,740
Jimmy,easy withthe anaconda squeeze.

302
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,900
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,350
I-I just can't believe
that you're standing here.

304
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,650
Why? I live upstairs.

305
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,770
Chloe,you were abductedlast night.

306
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,120
Oh,my god.

307
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,000
You don't remember?

308
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
The last thing I remember 
is going to sleep,

309
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,800
and then I woke up in my bed.

310
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I don't understand.

311
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,300
Why did they take me?

312
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,500
Because you're a witness.

313
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
They want to shut you up.

314
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,500
No,if that was the case, 
they wouldn't have released me.

315
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,900
Maybe they just wanted to scare you.

316
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
Look,chloe,I'm just glad 
that you're back,all right?

317
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,800
And we have be thany's laptop, 
but all the filesare encrypted.

318
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Maybe you can pull offa miracle.

319
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,300
If you've come here with more of
the blind kid's complaints,

320
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
they're gonna fall on deaf ears.

321
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,100
No,this has nothing to do with tobias.

322
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,500
I don't know how else to say this,

323
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,500
except that sensitive information
about our project has been...

324
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,100
misplaced.

325
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,500
Glasses are misplaced,car keys --

326
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,900
not classified information.

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,700
Oh,I know.

328
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,200
It seems that my laptop was somehow stolen.

329
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,600
On it are files that would not only...

330
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,800
jeopardize our project,

331
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,200
but obliterate my medical career in the process.

332
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,000
Sounds like a real blunder,doctor.

333
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,100
For your sake,
I hope it hasn't  gotten into the wrong hands.

334
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,500
For both our sakes.

335
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
No.

336
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,800
I have nothing to do with you or your research.

337
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,000
Remember,doctor?That was our agreement.

338
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,300
I understand.

339
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,800
But it's more than likely that
there is some mentionof luthorcorp.

340
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,400
Then you give me no choice.

341
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,200
What are you implying?

342
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I don't tolerate loose ends,doctor.

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,500
Bring me tobias...

344
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,700
unharmed.

345
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,700
Tobias.

346
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,000
It's lana lang,from smallville high.

347
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,000
I haven't talked to this many crows
since graduation.

348
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Come on in.

349
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,200
I know about your ability,tobias.

350
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,200
I wouldn't call blindnessan ability.

351
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,900
I know that you're identifying people,

352
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,300
people who are different,
but you have to stop.

353
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,600
Whoever's put you up to this
is exploiting your powers.

354
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
I have the money.

356
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,900
I can put you on a plane.

357
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,800
We can get you far away from here.

358
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm not going anywhere.

359
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,900
I'm in line for a cornea transplant.

360
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay,then you can
get the surgery somewhere else,

361
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,400
where there aren'tany strings attached.

362
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,300
I'll make sure of it.

363
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,700
Why would you do that for me?

364
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,700
Because you may be putting someone at risk

365
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,700
who saves people's liveson practically
a daily basis.

366
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,500
I can't let that happen.

367
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Who told you about me --clark kent?

368
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
Clark was here?

369
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,600
You seem surprised.

370
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,200
Did you tell anyone about him?

371
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
What's to tell?

372
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,400
Tobias,it's okay.You can trust me.

373
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,200
I know that clark's infected.

374
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,200
You must be talking about
a different clark kent,

375
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,200
because the clark I know
is the most normal guy I've ever met.

376
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,700
The files are barricaded.

377
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,200
***

378
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,900
***

379
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,600
***

380
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,800
no,no,but

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,800
***

382
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,700
we worry about you***

383
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Nice try,clark.

384
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,900
Cough it up.

385
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,400
Cough what up?

386
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,100
You know the real reason 
why I was abducted, don't you?

387
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm some kind of meteor freak,aren't I?

388
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,000
We don't know that,chloe.

389
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,300
Well,maybe this will 
helpde mystify things for us.

390
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,900
We're in.

391
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,200
That's a map of smallville.

392
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,400
With a gps overlay.

393
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,200
Clark,I think this doctor
is tracking meteor freaks.

394
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,300
Now the question is why?

395
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,900
Maybe he's trying to observe them
in their own environment.

396
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,300
I just got off the phone
with the planet.

397
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,900
Daniel kim was killed in a car accident

398
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,800
right outside smallville lanes 15 minutes ago.

399
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Or someone tried to make it
look like a car crash.

400
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
SMALLVILLE LANES

401
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,500
There's a new red dot on a street
just outside the bowling alley.

402
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,500
That red dot must be daniel kim.

403
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
SMALLVILLE PARK

404
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,200
And a blinking green one
just turned red in granville.

405
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,800
Chloe,they're killing these people one by one.

406
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,600
TALON TWEATER

407
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,000
There's a green dot in the talon.

408
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,600
What's going on here?

409
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
Chloe,are you okay?

410
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,700
Yeah,I'm fine,jimmy.

411
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
I need you to goto the smallville lanes

412
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
and find out everything
you can about daniel's death.

413
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,500
- I'll call you when I get there. 
- Okay,thanks.

414
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,700
Clark,I need you to x-ray me.

415
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,700
- What? 
- Clark,come on.

416
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,100
We're both adults.
Now,just do it.

417
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Okay.

418
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,800
there,underneath your collar bone.

419
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,200
What is it?

420
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,900
I don't know.

421
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,700
Please,clark,I don't want to die.

422
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,100
Just get it out of me!

423
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,700
We have to get you to a hospital.

424
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,100
Clark,there's something inside of me.

425
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,400
I don't want to go to the E.R.

426
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,400
And wait for the doctors to 
figure out what it's gonna do to me.

427
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,000
How accurate's your heat vision?

428
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,500
- Don't even go there. 
- Is it pinpoint accurate?

429
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,900
Chloe,I'm not gonna burn you!

430
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,100
Clark,daniel kim is dead,

431
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,400
and every single one of those green
dots is turning red one by one.

432
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,000
I will not be the next red dot!

433
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,600
Fine,if you're not gonna do it,

434
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,800
then I'll just do it myself.

435
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,300
Chloe,wait!

436
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,300
Just hold on a second!

437
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,500
Do it.

438
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,300
All right.

439
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Hold on to me.

440
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,700
- You can't move. 
- Okay.

441
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,400
All right.

442
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,700
- I'm sorry. 
- Just get it out!

443
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,100
It's a gps device.That's all it is.

444
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,700
TALON THEATER

445
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,300
My green dot's gone red.

446
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,300
When we were in high school,

447
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
I assume the only thing lana lang
cared about was lip gloss and pom-poms.

448
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,700
You didn't know mevery well.

449
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,500
Well,I'm sorry for ever thinking that.

450
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,400
Tobias!Where are you going?

451
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,700
What's she doing here?

452
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,800
He's coming with me.

453
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,400
Why would he do that?

454
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,500
I have to take him to the medical center.

455
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Tobias,the time has finally come.

456
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,000
We're prepping you for surgery,

457
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,500
just like I promised.

458
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,300
Let me get my jacket.

459
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,400
Tobias,you can get this surgery somewhere else.

460
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,700
It's okay,lana.

461
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,100
Tobias!

462
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
What the heck did you do to my girl,kent?

463
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,500
There was a tracking device, 
and clark had a pocketknife.

464
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,800
We improvised.

465
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,300
- Improvised? 
- Jimmy,it barely even stung.

466
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,100
RESIDENTIAL LISTING

467
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,400
There's only one green dot left,
off highway 52.

468
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,800
Tobias.

469
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
Tobias!

470
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,900
The powers that be want me
to take you to them,but

471
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
but if I do that,I'm a dead man.

472
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,500
So if anyone asks,

473
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,000
you just disappeared.

474
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,300
Please don't hurt him.

475
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,100
Ah. Don't worry.

476
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,500
This amount of voltage 
will stop the heart immediately.

477
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,200
He won't feel a thing.

478
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,200
And neither will you.

479
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,000
But you will.

480
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,000
I always thought my father
had too many guns in the house,

481
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,800
and now I'm glad he did.

482
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,000
Tobias,what good is a gun if you can't see?

483
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,700
But I can hear,

484
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,900
and the next one's going in your heart.

485
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,500
- Tobias,go!Go now! 
- No!

486
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,900
- Don't move! 
- Drop it!

487
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Put it down,
or I swear to god I'll pull the trigger.

488
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,600
I think I'll take my chances.

489
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,900
What happened?

490
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,400
I'm not sure.

491
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
But we're safe now.

492
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,100
Are you okay?

493
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,900
I think so.

494
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm gonna call the police.

495
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Do you have someone who can assist you?

496
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,100
I can.

497
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,100
- Clark? 
- Yeah.

498
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,500
The deputies told me what happened. 
Are you okay?

499
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,000
I should have known what was going on.

500
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600
I just wanted my sight back so badly 
I never questioned it.

501
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,500
It's okay.It's all over now.

502
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,200
A friend of mine's gonna 
get you your operation.

503
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,200
You'll be safe.

504
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,800
Lana wanted to do the same thing for me.

505
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
Lana?

506
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,200
Why?

507
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,600
She had this crazy notion 
that you were infectedby the meteors,

508
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,100
and she didn't want me to tell anybody else.

509
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,300
Really?

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
What did you tell her?

511
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,400
The truth.

512
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,300
That you're the most normal guy 
I've ever met.

513
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,100
Your ride's here.

514
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,300
Thanks,clark,for everything.

515
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,900
Thank you.

516
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,700
Once again,fate intervenes, 
and lives aremiraculously saved.

517
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,400
Yeah.

518
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,900
The paramedics said 
he died of a heart attack.

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
That's bizarre.

520
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,000
What's really bizarreis this.

521
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,700
I fired the gun,

522
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,200
but the bullet 
smashed into the cabinet behind me.

523
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
It must have ricocheted.

524
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,200
Off of something pretty powerful.

525
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
The important thing is that you're okay.

526
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,900
Where did tobias go?

527
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,700
Star city.

528
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,300
Oliver queen has arranged for him 
to get his cornea transplant.

529
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,200
Lana,tobias told me 
what you were gonna do for me.

530
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm not sure where you got 
this idea that I was meteor-infected.

531
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,600
I appreciate you looking out for me.

532
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,300
It means a lot.

533
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,300
You know...even if it were true,

534
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,300
even if you were meteor-infected,

535
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
it wouldn't matter.

536
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,500
You'd still be the same clark kent.

537
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,400
Miss lang,
are you ready to finish your statement?

538
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,900
Lana.

539
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,100
Thank god you're all right.

540
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,500
What were you doing at 
that kid's house in the first place?

541
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,500
I was trying to save him.

542
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
You should have come to me.

543
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,400
I didn't know 
it was gonna turn out that way.

544
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,000
Lex,that doctor --
I saw you meeting with him.

545
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Of course you did.

546
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,500
I was talking to beth any about luthorcorp's donati
onto the new trauma center.

547
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,600
So it was just a coincidence that he was here?

548
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,500
A sad one.

549
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,900
Who would have ever thought 
that a man whose jobit is to save lives would

550
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,700
would do something like this?

551
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,800
Lex,if you were involved in this,

552
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,100
you'd tell me,wouldn't you?

553
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Lana...

554
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,500
you're my bride-to-be,the mother of

555
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,600
tell me the truth,lex.

556
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,300
On the soul of my unborn child,I swear.

557
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,300
It's the truth.

558
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,800
You look dazed and confused.
Are you okay?

559
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,400
I can't sleep.

560
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,800
I can't work.

561
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,400
I can't think about anything else.

562
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,600
You've been through a lot.

563
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,700
There's a reason they took me,

564
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,600
and we both know it's not because 
I was a witness.

565
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,200
Tobias didn't identify you,clark,

566
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,800
because you're not a meteor freak.

567
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,400
It was me.

568
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,700
Chloe,it must have been a mistake.

569
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,400
How do you know that?

570
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,800
I mean,I've been exposed to more kryptonite
than practically anyone else in this town.

571
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,600
It's not that much of a stretch to think

572
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,300
that I could have been infected
somewhere along the way.

573
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
But you don't have any powers.

574
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,200
Do you?

575
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,800
No,but that doesn't rule me out.

576
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,800
There's a percentage of the wall
of weird that were latent for years.

577
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,700
They didn't exhibit any of their powers
until long after their exposure.

578
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,300
Okay.

579
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,300
All right,let's say it's true.

580
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,300
But who's to say you're ever gonna
develop any powers at all?

581
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,700
All I know is that every single meteor
freak I've ever run into

582
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,000
has ended up either deador in belle reve.

583
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,700
Face it,clark.

584
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm a walking time bomb.

585
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,300
Then consider me your own personal bomb squad.

586
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Regarding our most recent subject...

587
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,900
...keep a close eye on her.
