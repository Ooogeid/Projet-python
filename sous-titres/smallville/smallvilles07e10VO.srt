1
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,420
If you found the trues, he could kill you.

2
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,770
You think that this is milton fine?

3
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,099
It's the brain interactive construct.

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,730
If any part of him was left behind to
regenerate, then fine can be out there.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,745
Clark, you're home.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,639
You have chosen to defy me.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,378
This defiance cannot go
without consequence.

8
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:20,958
Hi.

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,010
What?

10
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,653
I just want to remember this moment.

11
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,530
This should help.

12
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:48,458
We should go somewhere.

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,756
Why? I'm happy right here.

14
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,955
No, i mean, we should leave smallville.

15
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:01,665
We should go see the world, lana...
All the places you've ever dreamed of.

16
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:06,233
How about paris? We'll have
breakfast at the eiffel tower.

17
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,134
- Yeah, right.
- I'll fly you there myself.

18
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:13,798
You have a lot of powers, clark, but
last i heard, flying wasn't one of them.

19
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,195
You make me feel like i can fly.

20
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,510
I'd better go.

21
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,669
I have a meeting at the foundation.

22
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,330
I tell you what...

23
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,750
I'll make us a special dinner...

24
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,357
Our very own paris.

25
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:47,811
What a beautiful day. I almost
forgot what the sun looked like.

26
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:52,330
The sun's got nothing on you.
Why don't you close those curtains,

27
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,200
come back to bed?

28
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,400
I guess i could spare a few extra minutes.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,236
I love you, clark kent.

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,236
Smallville - 7x10 - Persona

31
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:42,236
Transcript : Yyets.net
Synchro : Flolo

32
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,243
Mr. Luthor.

33
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:45,099
Ah, if you've come to complain about my
son's recent acquisition of your newspaper.

34
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,639
This isn't about the paper.

35
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,701
It's about something a little
more personal...

36
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:51,988
Paternity.

37
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:55,528
You know, i've dealt with
nuisances like this before,

38
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,486
but from the editor of the daily planet?

39
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,420
I'm already late for my meeting.

40
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,190
I admit i'm not above
embellishing a story,

41
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,960
but i couldn't cook up
something like this.

42
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,390
What if i told you the only
reason i'm standing here

43
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,289
is because lex luthor missed
his baby brother?

44
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:31,605
Pretty amazing, huh?

45
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,920
Using dna from the cord blood
of your deceased son,

46
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,390
Lex created a carbon copy.

47
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,960
Call me julian...dad.

48
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,398
Lex warned me not to see you.

49
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:53,681
He thinks i'm risking my life
just standing here.

50
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,720
But i'm in control of my life now,

51
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,490
and i plan to attack it head-On.

52
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,459
A courageous point of view.

53
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:09,971
If you've got a problem with me,
let's settle it right now.

54
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,161
Problem?

55
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:17,420
If you truly are my flesh and blood...

56
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,504
... I'd like to get to know you...
son.

57
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,560
Hey, beautiful.

58
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,560
What'd you find?

59
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,860
Another homeless man was murdered today...

60
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,213
The seventh in the last two weeks.

61
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,812
The police think it was a serial killer,
but i think that we may have found

62
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:51,790
the kryptonian computer you mentioned.

63
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:53,987
Brainiac.

64
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,669
The brain interactive construct.

65
00:06:57,926 --> 00:06:59,419
Why do you think it's him?

66
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,710
From the victims' coroner reports.

67
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:04,820
All of the bodies were found
drained of their trace metals,

68
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,436
just like that technician from lex's lab.

69
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:13,498
Why do you think this thing
is killing random people?

70
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,960
It must be regenerating,

71
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,516
using the trace metals
from the human bodies.

72
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,164
Clark, you have to stop it.

73
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,620
The problem is,
if it doesn't want to be found,

74
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,294
it can literally disappear
into the woodwork.

75
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,237
I might be able to help with that.

76
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,660
All of the bodies were found randomly
scattered across the district,

77
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:40,224
so i triangulated the attacks

78
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:44,064
to find a possible home base.
Suicide slums.

79
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,815
I'm impressed.

80
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,327
Chloe's not the only one
who knows her way around a computer now.

81
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,290
What would i do without you?

82
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,420
You've fallen far from your ivory tower,

83
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,099
haven't you, professor?

84
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,929
You're not kal-El.

85
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,201
I'm the new-And-Improved version.

86
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,220
Don't fool yourself, phantom.

87
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:06,513
You're nothing more than a failed lab
experiment dressed up in a kryptonian's body.

88
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:11,260
- Where is the boy scout?
- Not sure.

89
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,760
His martian friend took me prisoner.

90
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,520
But i managed to escape.

91
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,920
When i got back, kent was gone.

92
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,620
So, i thought i'd...

93
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,320
Step into his shoes.

94
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,920
You know what? They fit perfectly.

95
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,392
Aren't you concerned how kal-El will react

96
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:29,985
when he comes home to find you
in bed with his girlfriend?

97
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,120
If kent was alive,
he'd be back by now.

98
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,720
Trust me... He's long gone.

99
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,317
Well... lucky you.

100
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,160
But there is one problem.

101
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,990
The yellow sun...
It turns my skin to stone.

102
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:48,569
It's only a matter of time before
someone figures out that i'm not kent.

103
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:51,190
I know how smart you are.
I thought you could help.

104
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,790
Hmm, try a good sunscreen...

105
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,110
Wide-Brimmed hat, perhaps.

106
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:58,535
Kal-El nearly destroyed you.

107
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,202
Help me, or i promise...

108
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll finish the job.

109
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,754
I'm in no condition to help you.

110
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,811
But...

111
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,813
There is someone.

112
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,694
A kryptonian.

113
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:18,950
He came to earth years ago and stayed.

114
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,720
His name is dax-Ur...

115
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,300
One of krypton's greatest scientists.

116
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:25,871
He'll know how to fix you.

117
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,795
How can i find him?

118
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:32,050
Well, when kryptonians traveled
through a portal,

119
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,271
they carried a beacon
so they could be located...

120
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,057
A small shield-Shaped device,

121
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,520
Synchronized to their
individual genetic code.

122
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,835
Dax-Ur's fell into human hands.

123
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:43,909
Find it, and you'll find him.

124
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,158
Are you, uh...

125
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,360
Are you telling me the truth?

126
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,120
Lying to you would be like
lying to a mollusk.

127
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,566
There's no point.

128
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,109
If this doesn't check out,

129
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,790
I'll shove you back into the test tube myself.

130
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,829
Looks like some people lost their jobs.

131
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,270
Casualties of the new commander
in chief, lex luthor.

132
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,362
Out with the old,  in with the new and easily
controlled.

133
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,419
- What's up?
- I need you to help me find someone...

134
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,343
- A kryptonian scientist.
- Another kryptonian?

135
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,660
Jeez, clark, i'm starting to think
that earth was your home planet's

136
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:33,520
top tourist destination.

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,217
- How'd you hear about this guy?
- Jor-El told me.

138
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:41,092
Look, clark, usually, i'm right there to help,
but right now, my hands are so full.

139
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:44,320
And, uh, no offense, but kryptonians
aren't exactly low maintenance.

140
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,442
Chloe, the only way i'm gonna find this guy
is to hunt down the tracking device.

141
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,690
Now, there's a rumor that some
people found it.

142
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,690
I thought the planet's archive
might show a record.

143
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,146
Clark, look around.

144
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:56,113
Lex launched a torpedo through
the hull of the daily planet,

145
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:59,020
and i'm just barely hanging
on to the lifeboat.

146
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,007
- Can't this wait?
- It will only take a second, chloe.

147
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:04,810
As soon as i find out who has this shield,
I'll be out of your hair.

148
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,322
Shield?

149
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,638
Don't you already have one of those?

150
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,825
The kryptonian s.O.S.
From the time capsule?

151
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:18,804
- Remember, beauty pageant, gorgeous gold diggers?
- Yeah.

152
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:30,953
Why don't you go home and just take
a breather, and i'll call you later?

153
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,253
Where is it, chloe?

154
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm sorry. I just really need to find it.

155
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,032
I was hoping you could jog my memory.

156
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,095
You never forget anything.

157
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,628
Your mind's like a titanium trap.

158
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:56,214
Look, do you remember where
i put the shield or not?

159
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:00,091
Sorry, clark. I can't help you.

160
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,115
Dad.

161
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:18,560
Boundaries. Lex, what is so damn important
you had to pull me out of a crucial negotiation?

162
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,867
Well, according to the
luthorcorp visitors' log,

163
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,221
Grant gabriel came to see
you yesterday.

164
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,414
He did, yes,

165
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:32,119
to discuss one of your latest projects.
Mr. Gabriel is at the center of it.

166
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,599
You've always shunned newspapers, dad.

167
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,804
You used to tell me they're nothing
but lies delivered daily.

168
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:40,574
I may have underestimated
the power of the media.

169
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:44,917
And i was curious about
your trusted lieutenant.

170
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:52,871
- And what'd you think of him?
- Insightful... courageous... direct...

171
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Your exact opposite, lex.

172
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,034
Yeah, well, keep your distance.

173
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll deal with grant myself from now on.

174
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:04,069
You say that as if he belongs to you.

175
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,998
Now, grant gabriel is an adult.

176
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,952
You may be his employer, but, uh...

177
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,239
You can't claim him as if he
were a piece of property.

178
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,160
You know, don't you?

179
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:27,278
Do you believe you have the right
to recycle your dead brother

180
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,936
as if he were part of
some sick vanity project?

181
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,459
Well, i only did what you never
had the guts to do.

182
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,120
What you've done is depraved.
You disgust me!

183
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,750
You're telling me you wouldn't
want to see julian again?

184
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:44,740
To look into the eyes
of the son you lost?

185
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,802
It's you i've lost.

186
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,233
It's you i've lost.

187
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:23,255
- Lana.
- Chloe. What are you doing here?

188
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:26,018
I was actually looking for clark.
He came by the daily planet,

189
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,319
and he was acting beyond weird.

190
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,998
Have you noticed anything different
about him recently?

191
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,341
Yeah, i have.

192
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:37,882
He's finally opened up and let me in.

193
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,385
Chloe, he's more understanding than ever.

194
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,360
Lana, he insisted that i help him find
a kryptonian shield that he already has.

195
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,643
The clark i know would never
forget something like that.

196
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:55,920
Well, maybe you don't know
him as well as you think.

197
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,190
After everything he's been through,

198
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,240
I think he's just taking some time
to focus on his own happiness.

199
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,460
His priorities are different.

200
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:12,792
Well, his priorities may be different, but
his personality is in a whole other universe.

201
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,971
Lana, i've been a part of
clark's inner circle for a while now.

202
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,346
I know when he's not himself.

203
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:25,000
Chloe, maybe it's time
for you to let go of him a little.

204
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:30,330
I'm not hanging on.
There's something wrong with him

205
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:33,579
Hey.

206
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,847
Chloe, you seem a little tense.

207
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:42,161
Did you tell her about the move?

208
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,307
What move?

209
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,889
I wasn't gonna say anything
until it was official,

210
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,029
but after lana and i tie up
a few loose ends,

211
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,733
we're leaving smallville...

212
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,866
together.

213
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,090
I don't know what to say.

214
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,449
Actually, i think i should just go.

215
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,690
Is she okay?

216
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,690
She thinks that there's
something wrong with you.

217
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,511
She says that you went to see her
and you completely forgot

218
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,220
about this kryptonian shield that you have.

219
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:38,288
I didn't forget anything.
I just can't find it anywhere.

220
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:41,608
I think kara might have taken it.

221
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:47,103
Well, if it's kryptonian, do you think
that she brought it up to the fortress?

222
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:50,156
Right.

223
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:52,825
The fortress.

224
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:15,774
Jor-El?

225
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,029
I'm searching for something.

226
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,191
I think kara may have brought it here.

227
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,260
Leave here at once, phantom.

228
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,259
And what if i don't?

229
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,920
You're just a voice, jor-El...

230
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,048
An echo from the past.

231
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:43,377
What are you gonna do, lecture me to death?

232
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,188
You are not welcome here.

233
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:48,235
Don't worry, jor-El.

234
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,388
I'll find it sooner or later.

235
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,276
The lost phantom has returned, kal-El.

236
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,381
You must defeat him.

237
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,140
Lana?

238
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,605
Lana?

239
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:32,660
- Lana?
- Clark, what is it? I'm right here.

240
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:35,890
Thank god you're okay.

241
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,063
Of course i'm okay.

242
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,809
You've only been gone an hour.

243
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,237
Lana, i've been gone for weeks.

244
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:48,924
Clark, i know that time's different
in the fortress, but check the clock.

245
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,875
You just saw me before you went up
there to find the shield.

246
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,643
No, lana. That wasn't me.

247
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:55,572
It was the phantom.

248
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,964
Lana, he looks exactly like me.

249
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,919
Jor-El trapped me in the fortress.
He released me to stop the phantom.

250
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,360
No. I'm sure it was you.

251
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,890
Clark, it had to be.

252
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:13,088
Chloe said that you've been having troubles
with your memory.

253
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,691
Just think, clark.

254
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:20,117
Remember in bed when you said
you were going to fly me to paris?

255
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,020
We were going to leave smallville together.

256
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,149
It wasn't me, lana.

257
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,116
Oh, god.

258
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

259
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:42,884
I-I need to get you out of here. There's not
much time. He could be back any second.

260
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:51,600
Change of plan.

261
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
We have a problem.

262
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,500
Having trouble finding your scientist?

263
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,513
The boy scout's back.

264
00:20:57,514 --> 00:21:00,189
The prodigal son of krypton has returned.

265
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,370
I need to kill him.

266
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,423
When i get near green kryptonite,
I drain him of his power.

267
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:08,150
That's not a problem. I'll do it.

268
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,484
Look at yourself. You can barely catch a rat.

269
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:16,341
I am the brain interactive construct.

270
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,193
No matter my form, my intellect
remains formidable.

271
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:22,174
Do not underestimate me.

272
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,658
You should continue your search for dax-Ur.

273
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,846
Not before i get lana away from clark.

274
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,741
Fall prey to the same human
emotion as your counterpart,

275
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:34,170
you open yourself up to the same weakness.

276
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,500
Perhaps you two aren't so different after all.

277
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:38,590
He's nothing like me.

278
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,344
Well, then strategy dictates
that we divide and conquer.

279
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:48,051
Once i divert kal-El, you can fetch
the young object of your affection.

280
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,800
Lionel, the phantom's back.

281
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,624
He's been living with lana
while i've been trapped in the fortress.

282
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:16,541
- Oh, my god. Is she all right?
- She's a little shaken up.

283
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,459
I took her to oliver queen's apartment.

284
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,703
I need to get rid of this thing for good.

285
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:22,320
I don't know how to defeat it.

286
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,865
You're jor-El's emissary.
Do you have any ideas?

287
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,832
The only way to destroy the phantom

288
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,422
is to expose it to blue kryptonite.

289
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,890
I don't understand.

290
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,070
Everything affects us in opposite ways.

291
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,876
If blue kryptonite takes away my abilities,
won't it make him stronger?

292
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:41,247
Yes, but his power will
increase exponentially.

293
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,584
His body won't be able to contain it.

294
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,700
It's like a light bulb being
powered by a nuclear reactor.

295
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,039
Jor-El's ring was made of blue kryptonite,
but it was destroyed.

296
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,109
How am i supposed to find more?

297
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:57,095
Clark, i believe there is another
kryptonian living here on earth.

298
00:22:58,532 --> 00:22:59,725
Dax-Ur.

299
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:05,632
He is a scientist who came to study the effect
of the yellow sun on kryptonian minerals.

300
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,898
If you can find him,

301
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:11,000
he will have what you need.

302
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,213
Why didn't you tell me about
him before?

303
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:16,771
He disappeared.

304
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,999
He made a journey here over a century ago,
and then he vanished.

305
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:25,658
The shield.

306
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,485
It's a kryptonian s.O.S.

307
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:32,420
I found it in a time capsule that was
buried over a hundred years ago.

308
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:35,100
It may belong to this scientist.

309
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,030
You may have found his beacon.

310
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,122
If you activate it,

311
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,413
It should lead you directly to him.

312
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,293
I don't know how to work it.

313
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,192
Sound recognition.

314
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:54,030
Put it in your hand. Speak his name.

315
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,748
I believe that the device will do the rest.

316
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,977
Chloe. Thank god you're okay.

317
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:30,788
Okay? I just found out you and lana
are leaving smallville.

318
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,670
I am nowhere near okay.

319
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,940
No, chloe. That wasn't me.
That was the phantom.

320
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,696
I've been trapped in the fortress.

321
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,614
That would definitely explain
the bizarre behavior.

322
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,486
How do i know you're the
real clark?

323
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:49,683
Chloe, it's me.

324
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:52,570
Now, look, i know how
to destroy the phantom.

325
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,774
I just need the kryptonian
shield in order to do it,

326
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:57,052
but i can't find it anywhere.

327
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:01,041
That was what the other
clark was looking for.

328
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:02,700
Chloe,

329
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,167
look me in the eye.

330
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:07,818
Nice try.

331
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:12,071
But from what i've heard, everything
about  the two of you is exactly

332
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:14,400
the same, right down to your baby blues.

333
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:18,240
If i was the phantom, direct sunlight...

334
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:21,546
Would make my face change.

335
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:26,546
It's me.

336
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:31,770
Oh, my god. Thank god it's you.

337
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:37,500
Your domineering double
had me seriously worried.

338
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,400
I need to destroy him,

339
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,172
But i can't do it without that shield.

340
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:44,447
I think i can help.

341
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:55,696
The way you were acting, I didn't know
what would happen if you found this thing,

342
00:25:55,697 --> 00:25:59,525
so i went to the farm and i...
kind of borrowed it.

343
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:06,699
You saved me again, chloe.

344
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,740
Please be careful, clark.

345
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,140
Kryptonians don't exactly
roll out the welcome mat,

346
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,808
and if this guy ditched his S.O.S.,
he may not want to be found.

347
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,500
I don't have a choice. Stay back.

348
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:26,517
Dax-Ur.

349
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,386
Good luck.

350
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:57,500
Excuse me!

351
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,461
Can i help you?

352
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,790
I'm looking for someone.

353
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,390
Well, if they live all the way out here,

354
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,532
I probably know them.

355
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:14,830
Dax-Ur?

356
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,709
Dexter? No. No, uh...

357
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,104
- Nobody from around here by that name.
- Actually, he's not from around here.

358
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:24,538
He's from krypton.

359
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:27,287
So am i.

360
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,101
I'm kal-El.

361
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,420
The house of el.

362
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
You always were survivors.

363
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,020
So, tell me, how did you leave krypton?

364
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,016
I thought the portals were destroyed.

365
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,190
My father... He built a ship.

366
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,560
- I was found by a family in kansas.
- Daddy!

367
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,820
Max! How you doing, buddy?

368
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,548
- Hey. What's for lunch today?
- Sandwiches.

369
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:19,837
Sandwiches? Just a minute, grace.

370
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:25,060
I didn't know you had customers,
so we'll wait out back. Oh! Come on.

371
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,996
You have a family.

372
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,057
You live like a human.

373
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,949
I understand the only way to do that
is with blue kryptonite.

374
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,220
I didn't put it on overnight.

375
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,416
When i first arrived, i wanted
to be alone.

376
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:56,999
Why?

377
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,025
Sometimes a scientist can
get caught up in theories.

378
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,302
My work led to the creation
of the brain interactive construct.

379
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,748
I realized much too late

380
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:18,060
that my technology could lead
to the destruction of worlds.

381
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:20,053
So, you came to earth.

382
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:23,963
To clear my conscience.

383
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:33,617
I planned to study the yellow sun's effect
on kryptonian minerals but

384
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:37,625
discovered it was the sun's effect on me
that really mattered.

385
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,020
I could save the human race.

386
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,751
You gave up your abilities for grace.

387
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:49,060
It must have been a difficult decision.

388
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,090
I knew in the span of a heartbeat.

389
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,839
The blue kryptonite...
Do you have any more?

390
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,261
What's her name?

391
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,653
It's okay.

392
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:13,643
It's not every day a fellow
kryptonian asks me for help.

393
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:27,239
Lana?

394
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,120
I was just calling you.

395
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,090
Did lionel know anything?

396
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,620
We have a problem.

397
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,585
The phantom found brainiac,
and now they're working together.

398
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:38,560
I can't take them both down on my own.

399
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,920
It's all my fault. I led them right to it.

400
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,060
None of this is your fault, lana.

401
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:49,858
Lana, we should get you out
as soon as possible.

402
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,660
They could be anywhere.

403
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,731
Let me just go get my bag.

404
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:13,908
Come on, lana.

405
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:15,908
We got to go now.

406
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:18,105
I'll be right there.

407
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,100
Guess my secret's out.

408
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:38,720
- Lana, please.
- Stay away from me.

409
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,432
I would never hurt you.

410
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,217
I'm the same person you've
been with all this time.

411
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,520
You're a monster.

412
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:53,341
You told me that you're happier
than you've ever been.

413
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:55,906
I made you feel that way, lana, not clark.

414
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:58,514
You pretended to be him just
so that you could...

415
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,319
Listen, when i first came to smallville, the
only thing that mattered was my own survival,

416
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,785
But that all changed when i met you.

417
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,990
What are you doing?

418
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,855
- Will this destroy him?
- Yeah. But take it and go, lana.

419
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:35,127
Around blue kryptonite, i lose my abilities.
I won't be able to protect you.

420
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:36,751
I'll do it myself.

421
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,441
- Lana, no!
- Clark, stay back.

422
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:40,027
You spent the last month telling me

423
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,689
that you finally felt like we were meant
to be together. Don't listen to him, lana.

424
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,609
I know what's in his mind, lana.
He doesn't love you like i do.

425
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:50,533
- That's a lie!
- You're lying, clark... To yourself!

426
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,127
You're so worried about doing
the right thing, you don't even see it.

427
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,774
You know he won't commit his life
to you like i will.

428
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,774
You know that.

429
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,676
He's right, clark.

430
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,117
What?

431
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,110
I've never been more in love
than i have the past month.

432
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,189
Only it wasn't with you.

433
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,020
It was with him.

434
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,267
Nothing will ever come
between us again.

435
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:18,124
I love you.

436
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,820
It's okay, lana. He's gone.

437
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,681
Good evening, dax-Ur.

438
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:48,572
Who are you?

439
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,905
Uh, you should know.

440
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,410
You created me.

441
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:05,107
It took two superpowered beings to find you.

442
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,470
If they weren't so busy trying
to destroy one another,

443
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,700
they might have figured out
i was using them.

444
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:17,700
Don't... lose your bracelet.

445
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,141
Why are you here?

446
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,599
I'm... damaged.

447
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,497
And you're the only one who
knows how to repair me.

448
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,340
You're on your own.

449
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,639
All i need is the information in your mind.

450
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,070
I'll never tell you.

451
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:50,111
Oh, you don't have to talk.

452
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:18,170
You're so busy, you can't return my calls?

453
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,170
I barely have time to do my job.

454
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,840
I don't know how you expect me
to run a world-Class paper

455
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,140
- with such a limited staff.
- I don't.

456
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,536
You're fired.

457
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:29,434
Excuse me?

458
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,670
I told you not to go near
my father. He's dangerous.

459
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:36,865
Lionel would have found out
about me sooner or later,

460
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:39,138
And i wasn't gonna hide forever.

461
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:41,044
I trusted you.

462
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:44,270
- You shouldn't have told him.
- Why not?

463
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,027
He's made a reservation for the two of us
tonight at the best steak house in metropolis.

464
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,800
Seems dad wants to get
to know me better.

465
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,140
You know, for a newspaper man,
you are shockingly naive.

466
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:00,369
Do you really think you can build
a relationship with that man?

467
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:03,069
- Don't be stupid.
- What's wrong, lex?

468
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,960
You afraid i'll become the favored son?

469
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:09,368
- That i'll accomplish something you couldn't?
- I'm afraid he could have you killed.

470
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,164
Look, you need to leave metropolis
for your own safety.

471
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,315
I set you up with a spot on the
international desk of the london times.

472
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:19,200
Don't do me any favors.

473
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,600
You never help anyone, big brother.

474
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,801
Lex only looks out for lex.

475
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:27,237
Don't walk away from me.

476
00:37:27,238 --> 00:37:30,870
Haven't you gotten used to it...
People leaving you?

477
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:33,715
How many times have you been
married now, anyway?

478
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,649
You ungrateful son of a bitch.

479
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,864
If it wasn't for me, you'd still
be a smudge in a petri dish.

480
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:39,765
Yeah, you're some genius.

481
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:42,862
You're so lonely and pathetic,
you had to build yourself a brother.

482
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,000
I gave you everything!

483
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:49,540
You turn your back on me,
you throw it all away.

484
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,540
I'm not throwing anything away.

485
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,726
Go ahead, kick me out of my office.

486
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,189
It gives me more time to enjoy
the full benefits of being a luthor.

487
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,235
Last i heard, i was practically
made for this family.

488
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,719
There's nothing like a good
new york sirloin.

489
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:22,940
Dry-Aged for 35 days

490
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,362
and enjoyed over 2 glorious hours.

491
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,251
- Thanks, lionel.
- Yeah, well, after a good dinner,

492
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:32,700
one can forgive anybody...

493
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,304
Even one's own relations. Huh?

494
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:38,009
That's not me. That's oscar wilde.

495
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:41,621
I bet oscar wilde's brother
didn't cook him up in a lab.

496
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:46,040
Grant... i don't care how you
came into this world.

497
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,170
You're a luthor... You're my son.

498
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:54,034
Give me your money now.

499
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:56,303
All right. All right. We don't
want any trouble.

500
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,279
Now!

501
00:38:57,282 --> 00:39:00,038
Okay, okay. Just, please, take
it and get out of here.

502
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,129
Julian?
