1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,510
Come on,tippy toes.

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,800
You got to learnhow to tango,baby.

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,850
Hey,brother,come on in!

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,580
And that's game.

5
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,530
Guess you won't be dancingwith the stars.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,430
Time to pony up,yance.

7
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,900
You think I'm paying you,man,you crazy.

8
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,820
Come on,you set the table.I cleaned up.

9
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,070
All right,tomorrow night -best two out of three. 

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,370
can't go.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,160
come on,man.You knowyou got to square me up.

12
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,300
I got a test,man.I ca--

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,190
Hey,what was that?

14
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,090
No way,man.Don't go back there.

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,750
Don't you ever watchmovies?

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,990
Check it out.

17
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,700
that wassome creepy creepy,man.

18
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,960
That wassome creepy creepy,man.

19
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,160
Where is kal-el?

20
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,690
What el?

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,770
I said,"where is kal-el?

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,390
What you going onabout,man?

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,010
What's a kal-el?

27
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,920
Middle of the night,mysterious meeting,

28
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,060
suspicious briefcase?

29
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,880
You normally just call me with an update,dr.Groll.

30
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,770
Why all the intrigue?

31
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,640
The precautions aren't for dramatic effect.

32
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,760
Are you in some sort of danger?

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,610
I think we both are.

34
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,500
The cds contain all my research on the box--

35
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,330
every test result,every theory I've written.

36
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,990
You're quitting.

37
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm disappearing.

38
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,270
Don't you think that's a bit extreme?

39
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,890
You'll find that when you're in as deep as we are with the luthors,

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,280
they won't let you just walk away.

41
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,140
We've started military testing.

42
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,550
I thought we were still in the analysis phase.

43
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,700
Lex didn't tell me that we were already testing with the military.

44
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,230
Forgive me,but I believe that there's a lot that lex neglects to tell you.

45
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,360
You could have just left.

46
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,720
Why come to me?

47
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,860
Because I'm not the only one I'm worried about.

48
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,410
Despite our differences,miss lang,I thought you deserved a warning.

49
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,410
I'm getting as far away from the luthors as possible.

50
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,610
I suggest you do the same.

51
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,230
Oakland,california.

52
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,710
Local authorities determined it was made by a shooting star,

53
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,900
but that was just wishful thinking.

54
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,630
Sorry.

55
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,060
It impacted six weeks ago,

56
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,620
right around the time you fell out of the phantom zone.

57
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,190
It gets worse.

58
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,680
He's already killed once.

59
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,970
Two boys went missing on the site of the crater.

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,920
All they found were human ashes and a basketball.

61
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,930
Sounds like heat vision.

62
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,320
Not unless your heat vision comes with a radiation setting.

63
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,140
The ashes were off the geiger charts,

64
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,450
and the next day,the nuclear facilities 20 miles away were hit.

65
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,390
Any idea why the zoner would be there?

66
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,180
Well,aside from giving the five researchers a premature cremation,

67
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,500
the radioactive material that they'd been working with was sucked dry.

68
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,230
It's almost like he was feeding off it.

69
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,420
We need to checkall the plants in the area.

70
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,590
Hello?Um,have you met me?

71
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,260
There have beena half a dozen incidents across the continent.

72
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,830
The most recent onewas just outside of metropolis.

73
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,460
Chloe,these attacksform a straight line.

74
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,680
Headed directlytowards you.

75
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,350
Chloe...

76
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,810
I'll make a list of all the possible siteswithin a 100-mile radius.

77
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,950
I'll call you.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,430
Thanks.

79
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,780
Raya?

80
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,000
Hello,kal-el.

81
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,580
I was afraidI'd never see you again.

82
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm sorry.I didn't want toleave you in the phantom zone.

83
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,730
You had no choice.

84
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,470
It's okay,kal-el.

85
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,850
And if it wasn't for you,I would have never escaped.

86
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,220
I would have never seenall this.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,410
It's more beautiful than the worldyour father described.

88
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,680
How'd you find me?

89
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,890
Your father told me about the familyhe had chosen for you,

90
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,890
about smallville.

91
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,130
It must have been hardgrowing up here by yourself.

92
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,610
I had my parents.I had my friends.

93
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,180
But no owho really understood you.

94
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,870
You meanwhat was it like to grow upwith such a big secret?

95
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,350
And the amazing rushof racing trains,knowing nothingcan hurt you.

96
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,340
I used to try to pretendnot to notice,

97
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,720
but sometimesI would catch my dad watching me 

98
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,050
when I'd pickedsomething up that was impossiblefor him to even move.

99
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,440
He wanted so much to knowwhat that felt like.

100
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,390
But he never could.

101
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,550
No matter how I thinkI fit in...

102
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,580
every day I'm remindedI'm not one of them.

103
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,840
You're not alone anymore.

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm here.

105
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,740
The wayward boyfriendreturns.

106
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,200
Jimmy,we're in the bullpen,not the back of my yaris.

107
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,960
Which I am looking forwardto visiting again soon.

108
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,060
But first,you needa swanky new dress.

109
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,410
Got to look sharp whenwe're accepting our pulitzer

110
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,400
-- your words,my pictures.

111
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,150
You think I should rent a tux,or is that too stuffy?

112
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,030
Jimmy,I would hold offon the bow tie.

113
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,640
This is a bumper.

114
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,100
Yeah,but watch.This guy takesa metal briefcase into the car and leaves without it.

115
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
What were they doingout there?

116
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,850
Well,I'm working on it.

117
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,210
Well,who isthis mystery man?

118
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,040
I...don't know.

119
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,670
What's in the briefcase?

120
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,060
Something illegal?

121
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,280
Jimmy,this isn't a story.

122
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,460
It's a hunch.

123
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,000
Besides what were you doingplaying stalkerazzi in the middle of the nightfollowing lex luthor around?

124
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Being proactive,hopefullynailing a front-page shot.

125
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,780
You don't think some back-alleyhand-off is suspicious?

126
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,570
I think lex luthor getting outof bed in the morning is suspicious,

127
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,620
but you need facts.You need proof.

128
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,860
Well,thanks forthe pop-up commentary,but that's where I was...

129
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,640
you know,kind of hopingthat you would come in.

130
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,610
Look,jimmy,I've dealtwith the luthors before.

131
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,350
And the kind of ball they playis very,very hard.

132
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,270
Then I guessI better bring my bat.

133
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,670
Appreciate the help.

134
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,470
Jimmy...

135
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,150
You nearly gave mea heart attack.

136
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,930
Serious lack of signagedown here.

137
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,680
Which way is archives?

138
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,190
It's over there.

139
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Are you,um,one of the new...

140
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,290
interns?

141
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,810
Kal-el.

142
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,130
What do you meangroll's lab is cleaned out?

143
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,440
This schematiccan't be all that's left.

144
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,030
What aboutall the research?

145
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,700
Just find him.

146
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,300
Mr.Luthor,thanks for seeing me.

147
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,640
Your girlfriendis very close with the personI care most about.

148
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,540
That's the only reasonyou're here,mr.Olsen.

149
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,570
Uh,would you mindif I start with a few pictures?

150
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,060
Actually,I do.

151
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll have my peoplesend you a publicity shot.

152
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,760
Right.

153
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,330
So,what'sthis all about?

154
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay,then.

155
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,400
Down to business.

156
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,540
What exactly is your connectionto this man,mr.Luthor,

157
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,590
and what was in the steel casethat he gave you?

158
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,450
Can I take thatas a "no comment"?

159
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,990
You know,james,I was very happy to hear that chloefinally landed a boyfriend.

160
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,230
It appears my jubilationwas prematurE.

161
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,110
Mr.Olsen has to get backto metropolis.

162
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,790
Make surehe finds the way out.

163
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,140
Jimmy.

164
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,580
Tell chloelana says hello.

165
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,330
And if you ever tryanything like this again,

166
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,600
you'll be leavingthrough the window,no matterwho you're dating.

167
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,880
I thought I shouldjust give you the car since you obviouslydon't like asking to borrow it.

168
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
I didn't knowthat I had to.

169
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,030
Lana,the caris not a big deal.

170
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,740
You sneaking out of the houseat midnight...

171
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,070
that bothers me.

172
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,490
There's nothingto be upset about,lex.

173
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,660
I had a late-night cravingfor ice cream.

174
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,350
Mocha mint?

175
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,150
That's your favorite,right?

176
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,080
What's dr.Groll's?

177
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,090
Did you honestly thinkthis wouldn't catch up with you?

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,590
I don't like playingcat-and-mouse games,lana.

179
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,230
Is it the gamethat you don't like...

180
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,530
or the fact that someone'splaying it on your level?

181
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,690
I don't knowwhere you stashed the box,but I want it back now.

182
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,290
Please.

183
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,930
You cheated.

184
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,600
I couldn't let a rookie catch mein the last county.

185
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,040
Jor-el would have neverlet you get away with this.

186
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,690
What was he like?

187
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,180
My father.

188
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,100
Brave...

189
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,950
strong...

190
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,010
with the biggest heartof anyone I've ever known.

191
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,640
To be honest,that's notthe jor-el I imagined.

192
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,260
He was determinedto save us.

193
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,320
I remember helping himbuild your ship.

194
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:36,600
He was so careful,planning every detail,down toyour baby blanket.

195
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,760
I wish that he couldsee you now.

196
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,720
I haven't beenthe best son.

197
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,300
Your father was hardon himself,too.

198
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,510
He felt guiltythat he couldn't save krypton.

199
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,290
His only redemptionwas sending you to save earth.

200
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,760
Save it from what?

201
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,090
Extinction.

202
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,270
Your civilizationis going to destroy itself,just like krypton.

203
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,560
You should know this.

204
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,210
It was part of your training.

205
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,800
I haven't startedmy training.

206
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,220
The fortress is damaged.

207
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,390
Jor-el tried to warn me,but I didn't listen.

208
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,690
I mean,how could I trust someone who brought so much paininto my life?

209
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,290
Pain is a partof anyone's journey,kal-el.

210
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,880
You can't escape it.

211
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,440
You must acceptyour destiny.

212
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,560
Too bad that destiny'sjust gotten a little shorter.

213
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,560
The last son of krypton.

214
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,310
I've been waiting for thismoment for a long time.

215
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,290
You're the onewho's been coming for me.

216
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,440
And I thinkit will be worth the trip.

217
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,120
What's the matter,raya?

218
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,310
Don't recognizean old friend?

219
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
It's me,baern.

220
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,910
He's one of the phantoms.

221
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,880
How do you likethe new suit?

222
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,630
What do you want?

223
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,850
To pay back your old man for giving mea one-way ticket to hell.

224
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,200
But then he had to goand get himself eviscerated

225
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,780
along with everyone else from that ice cubeyou call a planet.

226
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,240
So I guessyou'll have to do.

227
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Kal-el?

228
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,730
Where is he?

229
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,610
I know my fathertold you where he sent me,but how did baern know?

230
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,830
After krypton felland jor-el was dead,

231
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,350
the prisonersin the phantom zone discovered that he'd only managedto save his own son.

232
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,780
The story of your survivalwas a myth,a rumor --

233
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,830
one of hope for some of usand revenge for others.

234
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,730
For someone who's beendreaming of killing me for the last 20 years,

235
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,390
his visitwas a little short-lived.

236
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,070
I don't think he was expectingto fight both of us.

237
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,910
He was weakening.

238
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,690
His race feeds offradioactive energy.

239
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,190
So that's whyhe's so strong.

240
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,230
Baern killed hundredson his own planet before he came to krypton.

241
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,320
But jor-el managed to exile himto the phantom zone.

242
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,740
I'm guessing baern is searchingfor a new energy source.

243
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
It won't take him long.

244
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,620
He can sense power sources.

245
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,280
There's only one thingthat can stop him

246
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,250
your father's crystal.

247
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,400
Hey.

248
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,360
I've sent youlike 10 text messages.

249
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,130
Really?I must have missed them.

250
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,990
Look,I'm sorry.

251
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,450
I shouldn't have blown offyour theory about lex.

252
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,050
I just wanted to make sure that you knewwhat a shark he is.

253
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,260
I know.You're right.

254
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,990
So you're dropping it?

255
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,130
No,I meant that you were rightthat I needed proof,

256
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,640
so I pulled a little howeabout a little free publicity for your pet charitywith luthor the lesser,

257
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,950
and I got my foot in the doorand took a look around.

258
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,210
Wow,you must have beenpretty persuasive.

259
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,540
Lex doesn't usually takeinterviews.

260
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,940
actually,I may have dropped your name.

261
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,250
Look,I'm sorry,but I had to.

262
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,330
It was so worth it.

263
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,990
Take a look.

264
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,780
Oh,my god.

265
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,980
You see those symbols?

266
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,360
They're like hieroglyphics.

267
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,230
Do you knowwhat this means,chloe?

268
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,350
Lex is workingwith the egyptians.

269
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,070
You know,I think you're right.

270
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,650
Why don't you makea bunch of copies of these,and I'll call the embassyand see what I can dig up?

271
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,210
Hey,now,that is my girl.

272
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,850
Baern wouldn't have leftthe area with you still alive.

273
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,660
There must besome other place he'd go -- 

274
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,430
maybe a military installationthe public doesn't know about.

275
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,140
I've been trying to call you.

276
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,880
Where have you been?

277
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
Racing around.

278
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,430
Chloe,this is raya.

279
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,370
Oh,raya.

280
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,100
It's nice to know something good finally came outof the phantom zone,

281
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,500
especially sincewe have a big problem.

282
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,250
This is what zod was gonna useto wipe out the earth.

283
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,330
Where'd you get this?

284
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,540
Jimmy took it.

285
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,250
It was on lex's desk.

286
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,350
I thought I destroyed it.

287
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,850
I know this design.

288
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,610
It's part of the braininteractive construct.

289
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,610
What?

290
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,330
Brainiac --this box is its power core.

291
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,320
Kryptonian energy sourceexponentially stronger than anything hereon earth.

292
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,090
Baern...

293
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,470
if he gets ahold of this,it'll give him enough power to fuel him indefinitely...

294
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
and kill us both.

295
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,220
Safe and sound.

296
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,910
You didn't keep it.

297
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,730
It's not mine to keep.

298
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,070
Incredible,isn't it?

299
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,020
Such a small,fragmented piece of metal might hold the secretsof the universe.

300
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,460
Or a new wayto destroy ourselves.

301
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,210
Lex,you didn't tell me you started workingwith the military.

302
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,470
Well,who betterto help defend us?

303
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,570
Lana,the futurealways has risks.

304
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,210
That doesn't meanwe shouldn't move forward.

305
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,060
I thoughtwe were in this together.

306
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,760
We still are...

307
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
just not on the same side.

308
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,100
Lex,you're obsessed.

309
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,000
We've been through this beforewith the ship,and somethinghas got to give.

310
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,360
The box...or me.

311
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,820
You have something I need.

312
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,170
Lana,call security.

313
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,080
They're kind ofunavailable right now.

314
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,750
You're not getting near it.

315
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,010
Lex!

316
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,320
A lex...

317
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,380
it's onlya second-degree burn -- nothing to worry about.

318
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,290
They want to run an x-ray tomake sure my ribs are all right.

319
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,750
How did that thingknow about the box?

320
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,520
That's exactlywhat I was wondering.

321
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,140
Do you think that I'd actually be involvedin something like this,

322
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,090
that I'd let you get hurt?

323
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,740
No...

324
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,910
of course not.

325
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,640
Clark.

326
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,770
What are you doinghere?

327
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,190
I went by the mansion.I heard you were takento the hospital.

328
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,530
You okay?

329
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,410
We're fine,clark...both of us.

330
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,060
What happened?

331
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,350
We had an uninvited guest,but...

332
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,730
we're used tothat kind of thing.

333
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,310
I'm gladyou're all right,then.

334
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,970
Mr.Luthor,let's get you down to x-ray.

335
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,230
Hate to questionyour good-natured visit,

336
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,410
but are you really interestedin lex's health?

337
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,380
What's the real reasonyou're here?

338
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,740
Look,you don't want to getin the middle of this.

339
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,610
No,you don't want me in the middle of it,but it's too late.

340
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,560
Clark,stop tryingto think up excuses and just tell mewhat's going on.

341
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,390
Have you seen thisbefore?

342
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Yes.

343
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,030
But it doesn't matteranymore.

344
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,020
It's just a pileof ash now.

345
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,420
That thing destroyed it.

346
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,460
Clark: Raya,I told youthe fortress is dead.

347
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,900
Why are we here?

348
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,820
Raya: The fortress isour only hope to defeat baern.

349
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,950
This was all we had leftof our home,kal-el.

350
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
And now it's gone,too.

351
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,220
It was more than that.

352
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,700
The fortresswas a storehouse for all the knowledgein the universe－

353
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,830
at least all that we had.

354
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,580
How could this happen?

355
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm sorry.

356
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,250
I don't know howto bring it back.

357
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,680
Your father wouldn't havegiven up so easily.

358
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,800
I haven't given up.

359
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,400
I don't know what else to do.I've tried everything.

360
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,570
Everything except the trainingyour father wanted for you.

361
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,380
So,why are we here?

362
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,730
Baern is too dangerousto attack anywhere else.

363
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,510
With the power he absorbedfrom the box,

364
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,740
he could wipe outhalf a continent.

365
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,680
If he's that strong,will the crystal still work?

366
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,410
It should,provided we stayalive long enough to use it.

367
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,870
I'm not sure it'll be that easyjust to lure him here.

368
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm gonna seeif I can reroute whatever residual poweris left --

369
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,830
just enough to send outa signal...

370
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,700
to let baern knowyou're here.

371
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,590
Clark,I'm home.

372
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,490
I canceled the rest ofmy meetings and came back early.

373
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,230
If I had to listento one more egoist droning on about the needr school 

374
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,660
reform rather than actuallydoing something about it...

375
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,080
clark?

376
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,960
Don't you mean kal-el?

377
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,010
He leftwithout saying goodbye.

378
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,180
Who are you?

379
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
Where's clark?

380
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,990
That's what I wouldlike to know.

381
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,590
Kal-el.

382
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,950
That's all the powerI was able to draw.

383
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,380
Hopefully it'll be enough.

384
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,310
That sound --I've heard it before.

385
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,960
Every kryptonian familyhas a unique tone --

386
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,100
a beaconto identify itself.

387
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,930
Baern's sureto recognize yours.

388
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,900
And follow itstraight to me.

389
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,740
So this is jor-el'sfamed fortress of knowledge.

390
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,140
I thought it'd be bigger.

391
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,580
It doesn't matter.

392
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,150
You won't be staying long.

393
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,070
Big talk,big man.

394
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,260
I'm surprisedyou're still standing.

395
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,780
I guess jor-el was rightabout how the yellow sun affectsyou kryptonian cockroaches.

396
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,040
But I'm back.

397
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,470
And now...

398
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,650
I'm supersized.

399
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,490
This is the perfect placefor the fall of the house of el.

400
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,180
Paying for the sinsof your father can be a bitch.

401
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,910
Raya?

402
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,740
Raya.

403
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,810
The crystal...

404
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,560
it has enough power now.

405
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,120
Restore the fortress.

406
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,060
You can't leave me,not now.

407
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,400
I'm sorry...

408
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,070
I couldn't sharein your destiny...

409
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,740
kal-el.

410
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,720
Man,where am I?

411
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,760
A hospital...in kansas.

412
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,370
Kansas?

413
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,780
Do you have any ideahow you got here?

414
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,540
I barely even knowwhere here is --

415
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,030
 I mean,no ball,no beach.

416
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,390
Kansas is strictlyflyover.

417
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,110
So,the last six weeks...

418
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,750
six weeks?

419
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,460
The last thingI remember was...

420
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,210
I was playing ball withmy boy yance and after that...

421
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,820
nothing.

422
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,650
Am I supposed toknow you?

423
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,440
No.

424
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,070
My name's clark kent.

425
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,570
We found you unconscious,and...

426
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,620
I didn't knowwhat else to do,so I brought you here.

427
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,690
This is crazy.

428
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,070
The doctors sayyou're gonna be all right.

429
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,170
I get the feeling I've got youto thank for that,man.

430
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,480
Kansas,huh?

431
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,220
Kansas.

432
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,930
Oh,no,I know that look.

433
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,580
Meeting didn't go wellwith the editor,huh?

434
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,690
Some meeting.

435
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,660
I pitched my take on thelex luthor-egyptians conspiracy,

436
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,010
and they refusedto put somebody on the story.

437
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,690
And I had proof.

438
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,100
Well,maybe notdefinitive proof,but you definitelywere on to something.

439
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,090
I'm sorry,jimmy.

440
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,160
That's not eventhe worst of it.

441
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,690
Well,you couldn'thave been demoted.

442
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,360
I mean,you can't get any lower.

443
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,660
Try unemployment.

444
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,050
Apparentlylex made a call.

445
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,470
They fired me.

446
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,680
Look,I managed to talkmy way back,but only as faras the basement.

447
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,420
Well,don't knockthe basement.

448
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,310
My career's over.

449
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,340
Scanning photos at the archivefor the rest of my life.

450
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,810
No,you won'T.

451
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,540
In fact,you should consider the fact that lex tried to get you fireda compliment.

452
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,360
If you hadn't been so goodat your job -- too good --

453
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,500
he wouldn't haveeven bothered.

454
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,550
You're gonna be a great photographerone day,jimmy olsen.

455
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,310
I thought maybe you'd hadanother sweet-tooth attack.

456
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,600
Don't worry,lex.I'm not going anywhere.

457
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,070
You sure?

458
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,420
Not tonight.

459
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,960
I think we need to reassesssome things.

460
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,850
Because of the box.

461
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,750
Because you lied to me,lana.

462
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,140
After all your talkabout honesty.

463
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,180
Then I guess we're even.

464
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,780
I'm just gladthat the box was destroyed.

465
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,430
How can you say that?

466
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,940
You've seenwhat can happen,the threatsthat are out there,

467
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,580
that the box was our only hopeof defending ourselves.

468
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,750
The human racehas survived this long.

469
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,360
It doesn't need lex luthorto save it.

470
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,110
You know,our conversationwas interrupted.

471
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,780
Don't you meanyour ultimatum?

472
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,400
Do you honestly thinkI wouldn't have chosen you?

473
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,770
I guess we'll never know.

474
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,310
Raya sounds likean amazing woman.

475
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,470
I wish you could havemet her.

476
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,700
She loved this place,this whole world.

477
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,230
She barely had enough timeto discover it...

478
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,680
before she gave her lifeto protect it.

479
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,340
It looks like kryptongave us more than one hero.

480
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,380
I'm so sorry,clark.

481
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,030
When I was with raya...

482
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,240
I didn't feel aloneanymore.

483
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,190
Clark...

484
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,370
mom,I know how much you love meand how much dad...

485
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,470
but I've always felt...

486
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,210
different.

487
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,160
It's because I am.

488
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,960
And raya wasthe first person I ever met who could reallyunderstand that.

489
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,510
And I don't thinkI ever really thought about what I'd lost...

490
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,710
a family,a whole race of peoplewho were just like me.

491
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,430
For the first time,I'm ready to stop running...

492
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,100
from who I really am...

493
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,920
from my destiny.

494
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,750
Your training with jor-el -

495
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,170
-you want to go.

496
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,620
But I can'T...

497
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,740
not yeT...

498
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,400
not until every prisoner that I released fromthe phantom zone is returned...

499
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,560
or destroyed.
