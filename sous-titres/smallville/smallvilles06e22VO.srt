1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,790
Previously on smallville

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,190
welcome to the phantom zone.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,490
He can free us all.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,890
Not until every prisoner that I released is returned or destroyed.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,590
I stopped expecting you to act like a friend a long time ago.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,790
Were we ever really friends, lex?

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,090
Lex luthor's developing an army of superfreaks.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,490
The prototype is in the final stages of testing.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,490
He's gonna pay for what he did to wes.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,890
Letting lana go was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,390
Lana lang,will you marry me?

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,590
Lana, what happened?

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,190
I'm pregnant.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,190
You know clark's secret,don't you?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,090
Lana,we should be together.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,990
If you don't honor the promise that you've made to my son,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,590
I will kill clark kent.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,590
I've been exposed to more kryptonite than practically anyone else in this town.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,290
I'm some kind of meteor freak,aren't I?

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,290
- You lost the baby. - no

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,090
I was never pregnant.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,990
You knew what lex was doing to me,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,090
orchestrating a fake pregnancy just to trap me into marriage with him.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,190
I'M...protecting...clark.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,990
no

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,790
The war is about to begin.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,090
Baie-Saint-Paul,Quebec

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,190
Marie?Is that you?

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,190
Leave us alone!

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,090
I've come to save your father,

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,690
I think he's dying.

32
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,490
Back away!

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,190
No, papa! No!

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,490
no!

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,490
No.

36
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,090
No, papa! No!

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,790
no,no,no

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,990
Papa, no!

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,290
we got him.

40
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,890
No bullets!It's inside him. We need the man alive.

41
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,790
The entity can't survive out of the human body.

42
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,590
I want you to check the eyes of every man,

43
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,990
woman, and child until you find it.

44
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,090
Lex.

45
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,390
You look worried, son.

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,790
Is everything okay?

47
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,590
You tell me, dad.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,590
Ever since the day I put on this wedding ring,

49
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,190
you seem to havean uncanny knack for being one step ahead of me.

50
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,490
I don't have time for this.

51
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,690
I have things to do.

52
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,790
Like have a private screening of that dvd?

53
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,790
You know,the documentary --the one lana stole from me and gave to you.

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,990
Oh, dear.

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,690
I'd hoped married life had lessened some of your paranoia.

56
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,590
I have security footage of lana in this library

57
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,190
forcing open my briefcase and pocketing the dvd.

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,090
Lana would never,

59
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,290
ever do something like that unless she was being coerced.

60
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,590
As hard as it is for you to believe, lana actually loves me.

61
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,290
Oh, you know so little about women, lex.

62
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,190
I suppose losing your mother at such an early age didn't help matters.

63
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,790
Lana does not love you.

64
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,790
The only reason she agreed to marry you was that I gave her a gentle,

65
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,890
yet very firm, nudge.

66
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,390
Using my wife against me...

67
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,090
that's deplorable,even for you.

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,190
Whatever debts you think I still owe you, we are even.

69
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,190
I want you out of my life.

70
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,790
I don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easily.

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,790
Car's ready.

72
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,190
You know, I was thinking,

73
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,890
if you're half the senator that you are a mom,

74
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,690
this country's in really good hands.

75
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,590
I always thought you'd be the one to leave the farm first.

76
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,590
Well, washington, D.C., Is no different than topeka.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,090
It's only a few seconds more away for me.

78
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,290
That's not what I mean.

79
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,490
I know this has been a really difficult year for you,

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,990
especially since lana and lex got married.

81
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,890
Like you always tell me, some things are just meant to be.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,190
Clark, if you feel it would be better to have some distance

83
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,690
from them by moving away from smallville,

84
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,190
I don't want you to let this farm keep you from doing that.

85
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,390
This farm, it's my home.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,790
And it's been in our family for over 100 years.

87
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,390
Someone has to take care of it.

88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,890
But that someone doesn't have to be you.

89
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,290
Just because I'm leaving doesn't mean you have to stay.

90
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,990
Excuse me.

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,490
Senator, it's time to go.

92
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,190
Your plane to washington is waiting.

93
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,990
I'll be right there.

94
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,790
I love you.

95
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,190
I love you, too, mom.

96
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,890
Hey.

97
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,390
Is that the look of a reporter on the trail of a hot story

98
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,290
or is someone trying to pick good lottery numbers?

99
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,290
Right before wes haywired,

100
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,490
he kept repeating these numbers over and over again.

101
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,290
They have to mean something.

102
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,990
Well, wes was a soldier.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,990
I mean, maybe it was his serial number.

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,790
Not in any branch of the armed forces I've ever heard of.

105
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,090
And I've run the numbers through every search engine on the web.

106
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,290
I got diddly-squat.

107
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,290
Good.Let's keep it that way.

108
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,090
Look, lois,take it from someone who's gone up against the lex luthor army more than once.

109
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,890
Not only will victory remain elusive,

110
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,490
but you're almost certain to step on a land mine in the process.

111
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,790
I'm the general's daughter,remember?

112
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,890
I live for battle.

113
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,490
Not the kind of battles you can't win, lois.

114
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,590
You remember what he did to my mother.

115
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,790
I don't want him to hurt someone else that I care about.

116
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,790
Now, please, back off.

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,490
You know what?

118
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,990
You're right.

119
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,490
Why would I knowingly walk straight into enemy fire?

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,390
He'll get his.It's only a matter of time.

121
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,090
Good.

122
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,190
You can thank me later. Now, I got to rocket to the planet.

123
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,190
Longitude and latitude.

124
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,390
No duh.

125
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,990
He's a mail carrier from a nearby village.

126
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,190
We found his body in his truck the day after the incident.

127
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,590
Did his blood get us anywhere?

128
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,190
No abnormalities.

129
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,590
And definitely no alien peptide sequences.

130
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,290
Whatever that creature was on the dvd,

131
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,090
it's not inside this guy anymore.

132
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,690
Wes keenan was a subpar prototype

133
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,690
because the peptides we used came from a dead specimen.

134
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,990
We need the entity to be in a living host.

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,090
We're trying, sir,

136
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,490
but we discovered this thing only lasts in a human for 24 hours

137
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,590
before it needs to find a new victim.

138
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,490
Then you better set your stopwatch.

139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,090
That alien dna is the only way to get my army combat ready.

140
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,290
lana?

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,390
I'm leaving lex.

142
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,190
Lana, I know this is when I'm supposed to say I'm sorry,but I can'T.

143
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,390
Clark, I came here to say goodbye.

144
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,190
Lex is going to be very angry.

145
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,790
It's too dangerous. I have to leave smallville.

146
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,490
Lana, you don't have to worry about lex.

147
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,190
You don't have to be afraid. I can protect you from him.

148
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,090
I can protect you from anything.

149
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,990
You can't this time.

150
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,690
Clark, I'm sorry.

151
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,090
Just know that I will always love you.

152
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,790
Wait, lana.

153
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,790
I can't lose you again...

154
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,490
...not without telling you the truth about me.

155
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,890
Clark, I already know about your powers.

156
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,090
There's more.

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,990
I'm from another planet.

158
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,390
It's called krypton.

159
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,190
It's light-years away, and my parents sent me here to save me.

160
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,290
They sent me to earth just before krypton was destroyed.

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,590
Please say something.

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,290
You're still the same clark kent to me.

163
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,290
I guess there's no reason for you to go.

164
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,890
We can be together now.

165
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,590
You'd be safe.

166
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,390
You won't be.

167
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,090
There's not many things that can hurt me.

168
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,990
But you're not invincible. You have a weakness.

169
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,090
How do you know that?

170
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,890
Did someone tell you that?

171
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,090
It was lionel, wasn't it?

172
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,690
Lana, you need to tell me everything you know.

173
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,390
Clark, lionel threatened to kill you if I didn't marry lex.

174
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,190
Martha, I am calling to congratulate the newest united states senator.

175
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,790
I have no doubt that capitol hill will never be the same now that you are --

176
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,490
clark,what are you doing here?

177
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,190
What I should have done a long time ago.

178
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,190
You come into my life pretending to be some kind of guardian angel.

179
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,890
You're exactly the opposite.

180
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,890
No, clark, you got it wrong,I swear.

181
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,990
- you*** - no

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,590
Clark,if lana's spoken to you, I know what you must be thinking,

183
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,990
but you've got to listen to me.

184
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,490
I've listened to you for too long!

185
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,990
Lex is tracking a wraith from the phantom zone.

186
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,290
I had to force lana to marry him.

187
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,790
It was the only way she could get close to him

188
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,000
to get the information I needed to help you.

189
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,190
No.

190
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,290
I never asked for your help, and I never will.

191
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,990
You're not a murderer.

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,290
You're kal-el.

193
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,190
Don't call me by that name.

194
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,390
Stop.

195
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,690
This man is on our side.

196
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,790
He is an emissary of jor-el.

197
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,290
Subject en route and fully anesthetized.

198
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,290
Meet you at base.

199
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,190
Lex, we have to talk.

200
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,390
We most certainly do,

201
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,790
but it will have to wait.

202
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,090
I'll be back tonight.

203
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,790
I won't be.

204
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,390
Lex, I can't live like this anymore.

205
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,990
Yeah,I don't blame you --

206
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,490
livi a lie in a marriage you never wanted.

207
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,590
It must take its toll after a while.

208
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,490
You're the expert --

209
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,590
setting up a nursery,

210
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,890
an heirloom crib,

211
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,090
the tears of joyin your eyes when you saw that ultrasound.

212
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,490
What kind of a toll does that take, lex?

213
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,390
What in god's name are you talking about?

214
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,190
I'm talking about the massive amounts of hormones

215
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,290
that you injected into my veins to make me believe I was pregnant.

216
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,490
What kind of a monster are you?

217
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,290
I don't know where you're getting your information from, lana,

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,990
but it's nothing but slander.

219
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,290
You know I would never --

220
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,290
don't lie, lex.

221
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,990
It's too late for all that.

222
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,590
This marriage is over.

223
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,190
Lana, I know I'm far from perfect...

224
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,890
but you can't deny what we had between us.

225
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,890
Lex, all there is between us are lies on top of lies.

226
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,690
Lana, everything I've ever done --

227
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,790
it's because I love you.

228
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,890
You aren't capable of love, lex.

229
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,190
You never were.

230
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,690
It's clark, isn't it?

231
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,090
You never could get over him...

232
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,990
even if he is the greatest liar of them all.

233
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,690
Clark means more to me than you ever will.

234
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,490
Lana.

235
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,090
That's the last time you'll ever touch me.

236
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,990
Do you really think I could just let you walk away?

237
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,490
What are you going to do, lex...

238
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,990
kill me?

239
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,190
Because that's the only way you're gonna keep me in this mansion.

240
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,990
I know. I know.

241
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,690
The methods I have to use seem cruel, heartless,

242
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,590
but the truth is, I am using them to protect you.

243
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,290
I don't understand. None of this makes any sense.

244
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,090
It was when lex was possessed with zod.

245
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,990
I became possessed with all your father's knowledge.

246
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,490
I found myself writing,in kryptonian,

247
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,090
the symbol for power.

248
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,290
It was a beacon --

249
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,390
the same beacon jor-el used when he needed me.

250
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,190
You knew my father?

251
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,290
I worked for jor-el, bringing criminals to justice.

252
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,390
When krypton was on the verge of annihilation,

253
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,090
he asked me to keep an eye out for you.

254
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,290
Where have you been all these years?

255
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,990
Watching from a distance.

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,690
Your father wanted you to pass the test without any help.

257
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,590
He wasn't to interfere unless it was absolutely necessary.

258
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,790
When you unleashed those phantoms, your life was at stake.

259
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,790
I didn't have a choice.

260
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,390
Like what happened at the docks in seattle.

261
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,990
When that phantom infected my mind.

262
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,290
That's right.

263
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,690
Unfortunately,I've lost a step since then.

264
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,290
What happened?

265
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,390
Nothing.

266
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,890
That's not nothing.

267
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,990
I had a run-in with the last phantom.

268
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,490
I have to leave earth's atmosphere to heal,

269
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,890
but first I must complete the job I started.

270
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,490
I have the crystal that raya gave me.

271
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,990
I doubt that crystal will work.

272
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,790
It's not an ordinary phantom,clark.

273
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,290
It's the product of a kryptonian lab experiment.

274
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,890
It's been destroying one human being after the other,

275
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,890
desperately searching for the only host

276
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,090
that will ensure its survival --

277
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,290
a kryptonian body.

278
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,390
Where's the phantom?

279
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,690
If you were to get infected, it could kill you.

280
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,790
People are being killed every day.

281
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,690
If anyone's gonna stop this phantom, it's gonna be me.

282
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,790
LAT 3852 LON 9532

283
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,490
Reeves dam.

284
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,690
I don't get it.

285
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,590
So, you said the symptoms were black eyes and a high fever, right?

286
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,190
That and a bad temper.

287
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,390
Your hack worked.

288
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,690
I'm into the qpp database. I'll start searching police records.

289
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,590
Here we go.

290
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,090
There was an 8-year-old boy admitted to a hospital 13 miles away from that cabin.

291
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,490
Blackened corneas, high fever, explosive tendencies.

292
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,090
And the doctors didn't know what was wrong with him.

293
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,690
What hospital is he at?

294
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,990
St. Mary's, but that's not gonna get us anywhere

295
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,090
because it says here the boy disappeared.

296
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,090
I have the police report.

297
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,190
A maintenance worker said he saw the boy being loaded in an unmarked helicopter.

298
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,390
This has got to be lex.

299
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,590
So, lex is tracking a wraith from the phantom zone,

300
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,290
and lionel luthor is your new father figure?

301
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,890
This is a lot of excitement for one day.

302
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,290
Yeah, there's more.

303
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,890
Lana's leaving him.

304
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,790
That's a happy headline. Why didn't you say anything?

305
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,490
Chloe,I told lana my secret.

306
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,590
She knows everything. She knows that I'M...

307
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,290
an alien.

308
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,490
Well

309
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,890
So, I guess we have a new charter member of the clark kent secret-keeping club.

310
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,890
What did she say?

311
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,090
She kissed me.

312
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,290
That's fantastic.

313
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,290
You've been wanting this forever. You just --

314
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,290
you must be on cloud 99.

315
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,190
I will be as soon as I deal with this phantom.

316
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,490
What are you doing down here?

317
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,290
I'm an engineering major at met u,

318
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,090
and I'm doing a paper on hydroelectric power.

319
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,390
Go back the way you came and get out of here.

320
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,790
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's really going on at this dam.

321
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,690
You're not a student.

322
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,790
Come on.Let's go for a walk.

323
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,990
Okay, you got it. You're the guy with the gun.

324
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,090
Looks like we got ourselves a wild one.

325
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,390
Wait until you see my claws.

326
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,290
Chloe...

327
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm through with all you losers.

328
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,090
I'm leaving smallville.

329
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,190
Lana, I'm minutes away.

330
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,390
- Just stay where -- - I don't trust you.

331
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,990
I don't trust anyone anymore.

332
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,190
Lana, stay calm, please.

333
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,690
It's too late.

334
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,790
Lex hit me.

335
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,690
All right, I'm here.

336
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,190
I'm pulling up right now.

337
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,290
I'm getting out of here, and I'm never coming back.

338
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,690
Lana!

339
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,690
Lex has the phantom.

340
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,790
He used an unmarked helicopter to kidnap a boy from the same village in quebec.

341
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,790
What happened to you?

342
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,390
Clark, I, uh...

343
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,590
...I don't know how to tell you this.

344
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,590
Tell me what?

345
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,490
It's, uh...

346
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,290
lana.She'S...

347
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,190
she, uh...

348
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,290
she what?

349
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,090
She's gone.

350
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,790
She's gone?

351
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,390
What do you mean "gone"?

352
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,190
She's dead, son.

353
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,490
No.

354
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,290
It was a bomb in her car.

355
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,490
I don't believe you.

356
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,290
I was there, clark.

357
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,190
I saw it happen.

358
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,890
I'm so sorry.

359
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,490
I'm so sorry.

360
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,590
She was gonna leave him.

361
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,590
He didn't let her leave.

362
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,090
Where's lex?

363
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,390
Clark...

364
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,490
tell me where lex is.

365
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,090
I can't let you do something you'll regret for the rest of your life.

366
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,190
No.

367
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,790
Oh, god.

368
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,190
Lois, you're gonna be all right, okay?

369
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,590
I'm gonna get you out --

370
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,090
oh, my god.

371
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,490
Oh, my god.

372
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,790
Lois. Come on, lois.You're a fighter. Come on.

373
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,490
Come on, lois.

374
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,290
Come on.

375
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,690
You're the strongest girl I know. Come on!

376
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,890
Please!

377
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,290
You can't die.I can't lose you.

378
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,490
I love you too much.

379
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,690
Please.

380
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,390
Chloe?

381
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,490
Chloe?

382
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,390
Wake up.

383
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,790
Honey, wake up.

384
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,990
No discernable activity from the subject.

385
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,890
24 hours are almost up.

386
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,190
Let's move.

387
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,390
Draw the blood.

388
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,290
This better be it.

389
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,790
Yes, well, it looks perfectly normal.

390
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,690
Let's hope it isn'T.

391
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,990
"Hope" isn't a word in my vocabulary, doctor.

392
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,590
I need results.

393
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,490
Do we have what we need?

394
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,390
It looks like your fleet of fighters are about to get their jet fuel.

395
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,990
Wait!

396
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,790
Wait!

397
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,290
Wait!

398
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,590
Clark!

399
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,290
Clark, wait!

400
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,690
She was your wife, lex.

401
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,190
Now is not the time to lecture me about my marriage, clark.

402
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,090
Why did you do it?

403
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,890
Just tell me.

404
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,390
Get your hands off me!

405
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,590
You afraid she was gonna bring you down,

406
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,190
or was it just too humiliating for you that she was gonna leave you?

407
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,690
Why'd you have to kill her?

408
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,190
Why?

409
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,190
What are you talking about?

410
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,990
You already know.

411
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,390
Lana is dead.

412
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,490
No.

413
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,390
No.

414
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,190
You don't need to act so surprised.

415
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,190
You're the one who killed her.

416
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,190
You put a bomb in her car.

417
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,190
You're the one who killed her!

418
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,690
Get out of here.

419
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,790
It'll kill us both.

420
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,090
He's right.

421
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,790
At last...

422
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,690
a kryptonian.

423
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,490
Thanks for sharing.

424
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,690
I feel a lot better now.

425
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,890
What just happened?

426
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,990
I took a little piece of your dna.

427
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,390
And now I'm gonna take your life.

428
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,790
Put your hands up.

429
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,090
My wife --

430
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,990
something's happened to her.

431
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,990
Hands up now.

432
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,190
You're making a mistake.

433
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,890
You're under arrest for the murder of lana luthor.

434
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,590
Clark.

435
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,890
Son, what is it?

436
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,690
That's not me.

437
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,390
It's the phantom.

438
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,090
How do you like my new look?

439
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,690
Thanks.

440
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,890
That's just what I needed.

441
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,890
What the hell are you?

442
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,690
I'm you,only a little more bizarre.
