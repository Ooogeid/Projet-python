1
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:05,512
You know, lex luthor may
have been wowed

2
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:08,910
By your high-Tech
smoke and mirrors, dr. Gruel,

3
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:11,873
But i've come to expect
more hard-Core evidence

4
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:13,901
From boys and their toys.

5
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:18,270
So far, my toyshave provided a
breakthrough the crystal's origin.

6
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:21,076
Prove to me i wasn't wrong
spending weeks

7
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:24,578
To lure one of lex's
top scientists out of hiding.

8
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:27,288
After an exhaustive battery of tests,
we discovered

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,175
That the crystal's composition
doesn't match any element on this planet.

10
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:34,238
It appears to be some kind
of computer hard drive.

11
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,040
We believe it may be alien.

12
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,586
You can't be serious.

13
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:42,202
I know that's hard to accept, but
that's what the facts support.

14
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:44,577
No, the facts are,
lex disappeared in an arctic

15
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,961
Wasteland here on earth.
He's not lost in space.

16
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:51,361
This crystal is the only clue
that we have, so stick to science,

17
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:54,248
Not science fiction,
and find me lex luthor.

18
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,058
Preliminary findings suggest
that the crystal responds

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,699
At a molecular level
to sonic vibrations.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,496
If you allow me to proceed,
this frequency generator

21
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:08,242
May be the key to telling you
what you want to know.

22
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:13,057
For your sake,
i hope it is.

23
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:49,605
What just happened?

24
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,523
Look, matt. I know the stock is crap.

25
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:04,778
But it's pump-And-Dump time,
my man.

26
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:07,890
So hype it, sell it, and make me
a profit, or you're dead to me.

27
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,545
Hello?

28
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,309
Hello?

29
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:41,847
I came when i saw
your kryptonian beacon.

30
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:44,125
Yeah.

31
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:46,132
Whatever you say.

32
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,008
I'm maxima, queen of almerac.

33
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,810
I've been searching for you.

34
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,786
Well, here i am, baby.

35
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:22,815
Wow, what a rush.

36
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,569
What'd you give me?

37
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:27,987
A taste of things to come.

38
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:48,583
You lied to me.

39
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,383
You're not kryptonian.

40
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,305
What's happening?!

41
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:55,497
You're dying because
you're not the one i came for.

42
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,688
But i will find him.

43
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:10,338
Smallville 804

44
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,081
Synchro : flolo

45
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:53,569
For seriessub.Com

46
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:07,730
Ready for some breakfast, boy?

47
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:13,127
You know, i still can't get used to it
just being you and me around here.

48
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:43,156
- Hello?
- I need you, smallville...

49
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,225
I just got to the planet, and i'm already
having the workday from hell.

50
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,956
What's your e.T.A.?

51
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:50,605
I'm flying into the building
right now. I'll be there in a second.

52
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:00,439
Go ahead. Come on.

53
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,488
Hey, i thought you said you
were coming in for a landing.

54
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,756
What happened to you...
run into some turbulence?

55
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:12,281
According to the clock, i'm still two
minutes early. Now, what's the hurry?

56
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:14,459
Well, i need you to take on
some of my work load.

57
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,934
This is my second quart of java,
and i'm still not firing

58
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,377
- On all eight cylinders.
- Rough night of sleep last night?

59
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,767
More like no night of sleep.

60
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:23,015
Jimmy moved in so he and chloe
can save their wedding pennies,

61
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,444
But the groom
snores like a freight train.

62
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,703
I am so jealous of you in that
kent farmhouse all by yourself.

63
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,675
So many empty rooms, huh?

64
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:33,518
It is pretty quiet.

65
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,909
You are about as predictable
as mullets in nascar.

66
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:44,063
One little mention of you living alone,
and you start singing

67
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:46,044
The "missing lana" blues.

68
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,230
You know, i hate to be the one
to dish out a helping

69
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,023
Of tough love here, clark,

70
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:52,536
But lana is gone for good.

71
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,987
Time to get back
in the saddle, buckaroo.

72
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,541
But this go-Round, you need
to look outside your wheelhouse.

73
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,224
I didn't know
i had a wheelhouse.

74
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,804
Of course you do... pretty, friendly,
damsel-In-Distressy.

75
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,342
You need to try another scoop
of the 31 flavors,

76
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:09,100
Maybe a little less sweet vanilla
and a lot more wild cherry.

77
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,593
Let's get back
to the work... please.

78
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:12,899
Good idea.

79
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,440
Bury your heartache
in your job.

80
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,139
Here, start with this.

81
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,296
Baby-Face broker
dies of ticker trouble.

82
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,850
How does a healthy 25-Year-Old
suddenly die of a heart attack?

83
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,535
I don't have time to handhold,
but the coroner's report

84
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:28,014
Said the endorphin and
adrenaline levels in his blood

85
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,510
Were sky-High.

86
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,918
You know... endorphins?

87
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,183
They're hormones that are released

88
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:37,301
- When the body performs a certain activity.
- Like when you play a sport.

89
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:41,265
Or there's another kind
of activity two people share...

90
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,709
Repetive motion,

91
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,716
Builds to a climax.

92
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:47,380
Thank you.

93
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,566
The police say they found
the victim fully clothed.

94
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,790
What, he didn't even
get past first base?

95
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:59,170
And the m.E. Says the
hormone levels weren't

96
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,159
Only through the roof,
they're higher than any

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,084
Normal human body can produce.

98
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,696
You know, unpacking your fiancé

99
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:15,072
Really should be
a wedding requirement course.

100
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,328
I had no idea
you had such a propensity

101
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,994
For recording bass-Fishing shows
and reading pablo neruda love poems...

102
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:25,823
And that you've collected
every cd ever made by abba.

103
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,650
I'm complicated.

104
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,583
Who knew there were
so many sides to jimmy olsen?

105
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,868
Why? Do you have
a problem with that?

106
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,603
Not at all. I love a man of mystery.

107
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,178
But i would keep the abba
away from lois.

108
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,701
She's a whitesnake girl,
and i don't think she'd

109
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,980
- Understand this side of you.
- Well, i don't think that lois likes any

110
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,552
Side of me these days. She's still
mad 'cause i didn't tell her the truth

111
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,177
About lex luthor's arctic antics.

112
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:52,121
Yeah, lois wins medals
for holding a grudge.

113
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,472
Don't worry.

114
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,675
Just a couple of weeks
of walking around on eggs hells,

115
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:57,363
And it'll all be over.

116
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:58,508
Great.

117
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:33,023
I guess we sort of skated over the
conversation about boundaries.

118
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:37,507
Looks like i stumbled into
the razor wire

119
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,355
Surrounding the clark issue again.

120
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,206
I knew that he was
your first love. I just...

121
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:47,060
Never knew
that you felt like this.

122
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:49,927
It's ancient history.

123
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:53,210
I wrote that when i was 15.
I've told you before...

124
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:55,595
Clark is my best friend,
and that's all.

125
00:09:57,123 --> 00:10:01,921
"I'm the girl of your dreams
masquerading as your best friend."

126
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,057
You realize i'm living
my biggest nightmare right now.

127
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:09,112
Jimmy, it was a schoolgirl crush.

128
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,339
And to be perfectly honest,
this constant insecurity

129
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,954
About clark is really starting
to wear thin.

130
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,128
Every time i try
and leave it in the past,

131
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,334
It just keeps making its way
into the present.

132
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,540
I don't know what else
i can do.

133
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,934
Why don't you start
by asking yourself...

134
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,593
Why you never said
these things to me?

135
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,359
It arrived this morning.

136
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,404
"Meet me at the ace of clubs."

137
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,006
Oliver sure hasn't lost
his flair for the dramatic.

138
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,320
You'll have him
eating out of your hand.

139
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,853
Thank him for the dress,
but send my regrets.

140
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,632
Well.

141
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,428
Talk about being fashion-Forward,

142
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,041
But i'm afraid
you've crashed the wrong disco.

143
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,035
Whoever you are, i think
it's time that you leave.

144
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,482
Where's the owner of the crystal?

145
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:53,055
Crystal? I'm sorry.
That doesn't ring a bell.

146
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:57,650
But maybe if you told me about
the owner, i could help you.

147
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:02,074
He's kryptonian.

148
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:04,316
And my perfect mate.

149
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,174
You know, i thought there'd be
more of them on this planet,

150
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:10,893
But every single man
i've come across has been human.

151
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,356
Maybe if we work together...

152
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,856
I could help you find
this... kryptonian.

153
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:25,170
Find him?

154
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,289
I know the beacon came from here.

155
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:30,307
Is it the man who sent you this?

156
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,764
You're trying to keep him
for yourself, aren't you?

157
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,943
Well, i've traveled too far
to let you stand in my way.

158
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,480
Thanks.

159
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,551
Lois, i thought you said you didn't
have time to work on this article.

160
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,767
That's when it was gonna end up
buried on the last page,

161
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,028
But with the super-Endorphin angle,
the scoop is a lot bigger.

162
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,051
You just learned to dog-Paddle
your way through a story.

163
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:06,238
What kind of friend would i be if i threw
you in the deep end without a floatie?

164
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:09,439
What did the police officer say?

165
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,885
They found evidence of a fire in
the alley, but they suspect it's unrelated.

166
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,463
So, in other words, there was no
reason for us to come down here.

167
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,284
Common rookie mistake.

168
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:19,414
See, that's why you're lucky
i came along.

169
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,030
The scorch marks are probably
from a homeless homedown.

170
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:25,771
If we talk to a few local transients,
maybe somebody saw something.

171
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:43,896
Well, this story just made it
above the fold.

172
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:46,005
Cops say a string
of hormone-Jacked stiffs

173
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:48,630
Turned up between metropolis
and smallville...

174
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,841
All males.

175
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:53,095
Ask me... i think we have
a meteor freak on a rampage.

176
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,132
They make it look so easy.

177
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:40,302
Women are a complicated
species, dude.

178
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:43,259
You have to embrace a little
survival of the fittest.

179
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,673
Make her realize she's not
the only fox in the forest.

180
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:51,734
You are so right.

181
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,861
I see you're the only one
in here that's all alone.

182
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:05,205
I think you're the man
that i've been looking for.

183
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,226
Am i glad to see you.

184
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:28,077
Now that lois is riding shotgun
in your mystery machine,

185
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,894
Your old sidekick's
jonesing for a scooby clue.

186
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,965
Let me see
that concrete crop circle.

187
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,916
I know it's not kryptonian.

188
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,107
This is a hypogeous marker.

189
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:39,247
It's the royal crest
from the planet called almerac.

190
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:42,331
- This belongs to their queen.
- A planet called almerac?

191
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,344
Chloe, i didn't realize
that your brainiac download

192
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,088
Had included some sort
of intergalactic encyclopedia.

193
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,326
Were there fresh burn marks
in the area?

194
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:51,784
Yeah.

195
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,378
Then she must have
teleported in recently.

196
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,136
They use a ucrillian bracelet
that acts as a hyperdrive,

197
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,604
Compressing the fabrics
of time and space.

198
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,704
You said the chemicals
in her victims were elevated?

199
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:09,022
Endorphins and adrenaline.

200
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:10,957
All the men died the same way.

201
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,509
She's searching for a mate.

202
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,145
Those chemicals must be
released into her victims

203
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:19,189
Once she locks lips with them.

204
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,824
She's won the battle
of the sexes on her planet,

205
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,714
And now she's looking
for a new contender.

206
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,439
If she can find someone
to survive her killer kiss,

207
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,233
Then she can live
happily ever after.

208
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,537
The only problem is that humans
can't take the hormone surge.

209
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:33,863
- They all flatline.
- Certainly narrows down her choices.

210
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,491
If there are numerous deaths,
then maybe i can find a pattern

211
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,867
So you can stop
this kissing bandit.

212
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:46,178
Chloe, do you remember when you
said we'd talk about your condition?

213
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,648
You know, if things got worse?

214
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:52,829
Clark, i've analyzed
every possible scenario,

215
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,467
And, as much as it scares me,
you can't wave

216
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,889
Your kryptonian wand
and save me on this one.

217
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,910
- I'll find a way.
- Clark, it's just how it is.

218
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:03,759
There's nothing you can do,
so just let it go.

219
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,820
Here we go. According to the police wire, it
looks like she's struck again.

220
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:16,715
They just found a german businessman
outside the ace of clubs.

221
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:21,107
Clark, i'm not the only one in
the world who needs your help.

222
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,392
You have to go.

223
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:34,035
Those were some dance moves
you were doing in there.

224
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,147
Get you arrested in most states.

225
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:39,452
Wait until you see some of the
moves i'll show you now that we're alone.

226
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:50,698
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,499
Look...

228
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,278
You are really, really pretty,

229
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:58,772
And... hot.

230
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,795
But i wasn't honest
with you before.

231
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm in love with another woman.

232
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,563
I promise.

233
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:14,290
Just one kiss, and you will see
that i was meant for you.

234
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,780
That's embarrassing.

235
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,594
Help me.

236
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,428
I'm really sorry.

237
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,595
You were so sweet.
I really hoped you were the one.

238
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,426
- Jimmy, what's wrong?
- It's my heart.

239
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,759
Now, that's more like it.

240
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,063
Good evening, miss sullivan.

241
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,991
I am sorry for
the cloak-And-Dagger routine,

242
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:05,643
But i didn't have time to schedule
this little meet and greet.

243
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,109
- My name is...
- You can save the introduction.

244
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,414
I know who you are.

245
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:13,316
And i don't care to talk with
anyone connected to lex luthor.

246
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:17,456
It's no secret that you and lex
have your differences, but...

247
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,674
I'm sure that you are
far too fair a person

248
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,862
To fault me for his mistakes.

249
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,908
Because i really need your help.

250
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,179
I know that you've cracked into
some of the most complex

251
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,014
And protected computer systems
in the world,

252
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,811
And i'd like to hire you
to do the same for me.

253
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:39,111
I guess lex's lackeys didn't tell you
that he actually dropped

254
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:41,659
The dime on me
for being a techno-Wiz.

255
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,440
I was locked up.
It wasn't pretty.

256
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,868
Well, no laws will be broken.

257
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:52,855
You'll be trying to hack
a very unique supercomputer.

258
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,719
Sorry. My plate's full.

259
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,361
Yeah, i'm sure planning a wedding
and starting up

260
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:03,514
The Isis foundation
have you pretty busy.

261
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,590
How did you know all that?

262
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:11,440
I have access to all of lex's records.

263
00:21:11,864 --> 00:21:14,615
And i know everything about you, chloe.

264
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:18,059
Which is why i know you're the
only person that can help me.

265
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:21,092
So i'm hoping you'll reconsider?

266
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:24,664
You learned well from lex.

267
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:29,777
When you don't get your way,
you just... threaten.

268
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,342
This isn't my first tour of duty
on the luthor battlefield.

269
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:37,228
So you're gonna have to come
at me with a lot more firepower.

270
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:01,492
Oh, it feels like my chest
was run over by a mack truck

271
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:03,849
And the rest of me
was dragged behind it.

272
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,247
You got to the hospital just in time.

273
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:09,720
The doctors say your vitals have
stabilized, so you're gonna be okay.

274
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:14,476
I need to know what happened
at the ace of clubs, jimmy.

275
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:20,800
Yeah, it must have been all
those tequila shots.

276
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,157
I know that you were
with a woman, jimmy.

277
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:32,117
That wasn't my fault, c.K.

278
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:36,126
I mean, the drinking part was, but...

279
00:22:39,743 --> 00:22:42,382
It all started with that letter.

280
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:44,927
What are you talking about?

281
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,149
I found an old love letter
that chloe wrote.

282
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,838
And i realized...

283
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:02,735
... a person never really
gets over their first true love.

284
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,678
I mean...

285
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:13,721
You believe you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with someone,

286
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,801
That they're the one.

287
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,456
And when you got to start over
again with someone new...

288
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,061
Is it ever the same?

289
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:34,298
Everyone has to move on, jimmy.

290
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:38,634
Chloe must have,
because she found you.

291
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:45,077
You don't know how lucky you are
to have each other.

292
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,530
I kissed another woman, c.K.

293
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,599
It wasn't your fault, jimmy.
You weren't in control.

294
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,597
But i need you to tell me
what she looked like

295
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:05,010
So i can find her
before she hurts anyone else.

296
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,955
Look, everything's a blur
after she came up to me at the bar.

297
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:14,337
Jimmy. What happened?

298
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,467
He's gonna be okay.

299
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:21,044
He was at the ace of clubs,
and things got a little messy.

300
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:25,314
The important thing
is that you guys are together.

301
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,302
Clark kent.

302
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,522
That's a strong name.

303
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:25,491
- I like it.
- Who are you?

304
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,509
Maxima.

305
00:25:29,782 --> 00:25:32,805
You don't know how long
i've searched for you.

306
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,945
Not here.

307
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:31,744
Smallville.

308
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:35,857
Lois?

309
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,524
I'll take the stairs.

310
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,622
Let her go.

311
00:26:53,118 --> 00:26:54,425
Lois.

312
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:56,603
- Lois, wait!
- What?!

313
00:26:57,234 --> 00:27:01,037
Oh, sorry to rain on your orgy, smallville.
I think i scared off your date.

314
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,267
Where'd she go?

315
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:04,656
Probably to find you two a motel room.

316
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:07,239
- You don't understand.
- What's not to understand?!

317
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,551
You were pulling a "91/2 weeks"
in the elevator.

318
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:12,106
I mean, it may not
get you a membership in the mile-High club,

319
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:14,407
- But, hey, you got to start somewhere.
- Just calm down.

320
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:16,581
I am calm! I am perfectly calm!

321
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:19,373
Why wouldn't i be calm?
Dial down the ego, smallville.

322
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:21,474
I don't care what you do
with your love life.

323
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,288
Give me a break.

324
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:36,741
Does he really think i care
who he sucks face with?

325
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,020
Hello.

326
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:44,106
That sluttyanna
wasn't even his type.

327
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:06,084
I couldn't kill you in front of him.

328
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:08,999
But now that you're alone, i'll make
sure you never take him away.

329
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,154
Who... smallville?

330
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:15,968
Look, i don't know who or what you are,
but you got it all wrong, lady.

331
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,465
There is nothing romantic
between lois and clark.

332
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:21,281
You have a deep connection
to him. I felt it.

333
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,393
Then your radar's on the fritz.

334
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:25,840
'Cause even on a good day,
we're barely friends.

335
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:28,033
He would never have been able
to pull away from me

336
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,395
If he wasn't drawn
by his attraction to you.

337
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:34,457
Look... he's about as attracted to me
as a red sox fan to the yankees.

338
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,795
Oh, he may not know it yet.
But believe me... there's a bond.

339
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,518
And i could see it on your face
when you caught us together.

340
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,116
You feel it, too.

341
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:46,246
But i finally found the man
that i've wanted all my life,

342
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:49,272
- And you can't have him.
- Freeze!

343
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:10,579
Chloe, just talk me through
the face-Recognition software.

344
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:13,405
I'll call you back.

345
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:16,242
Amazing, kent.

346
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:19,647
It seems wherever we are in the
universe, our stars keep crossing.

347
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:21,357
It is strange.

348
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:24,696
Especially when i find you in a
locked office and you don't have a key.

349
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,874
And how come clark kent
has an all-Night pass

350
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,573
- To a clinic for the meteor-Impaired?
- My friend works here.

351
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,938
She's helping me on an article.

352
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:41,601
Are you writing a story about that woman?

353
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,390
You know her?

354
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:50,282
We had a close encounter this afternoon.

355
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,849
What do you know about her?

356
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,251
She's wanted for murder.

357
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:02,771
That's a pretty big story
for a copy boy.

358
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:05,466
Up until now, she's only attacked men.

359
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:09,294
I wonder why she'd be after you.

360
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:14,353
She has her heart set on finding someone.

361
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,770
Who?

362
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,767
The guy who owns this.

363
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:29,703
I was hoping that chloe
might use her... skills

364
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,815
To shed some light on it.

365
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:35,790
Where did you get
something like that?

366
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:38,825
It was the only thing found at
the spot where lex disappeared.

367
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:44,234
You spent a lot of time with lex.
Did you ever see him with it?

368
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,043
No.

369
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,524
Clark, do you know what this is?

370
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,701
I've never seen that before.

371
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:03,655
Yes?

372
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:08,284
Target located, miss mercer.
Corner of melbourne and holly.

373
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:12,390
She flipped a car. Civilian female
trapped inside her pontiac.

374
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:20,599
Hello? What's going on?

375
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,911
Bring it, bitch.

376
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,038
Finally.

377
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:48,756
A man with some fight in him.

378
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:51,943
None of the men on my planet
have the stamina to keep up.

379
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,573
Maybe you shouldn't have
come on so strong.

380
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,707
You didn't seem to mind.
You came back for more.

381
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,402
I came back to stop you
from killing lois.

382
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:04,104
What would you have done to her
if i didn't stop you?

383
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:08,280
I couldn't let her have you.
You're my soul mate.

384
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,623
You don't even know who i am.

385
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,903
When i was a little girl,
i heard the stories

386
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:16,435
Of the brave and gallant men of krypton,
men worthy of standing

387
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,144
By a queen's side.

388
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:21,940
When i learned your planet
had been destroyed...

389
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,720
I prayed for survivors.

390
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:29,410
And when i saw your beacon...

391
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:34,006
The beacon didn't come from me.

392
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,037
It... doesn't matter.

393
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:43,670
I found the last son
of krypton, and...

394
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,612
You're everything i wished for.

395
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,694
A man who...

396
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,683
... is my equal.

397
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,819
When we kissed...

398
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:05,558
I felt your passion so much stronger
than i've ever felt from any other man.

399
00:33:08,557 --> 00:33:10,144
And...

400
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:14,421
I could sense that you were
as desperate as i was to find a mate.

401
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:18,206
You want me...

402
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,522
As much as i want you.

403
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:25,155
I don't want you.

404
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,246
Are you sure?

405
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,028
Because no one on this planet
will be a better match.

406
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:37,062
I know the loneliness
of not finding your soul mate.

407
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:41,654
You come back with me,
and you will never be alone.

408
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,737
It's our destiny to be together.

409
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:50,291
My destiny is here.

410
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:52,355
And you're not a part of it.

411
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:14,620
Hey. I just talked to the doctor.

412
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,893
I'm bringing jimmy home in two hours,
with his heart

413
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:19,916
In the right place and his hormones
in check.

414
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:23,165
I guess you figured out
that maxima kissed jimmy.

415
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:24,822
Oh, please.

416
00:34:24,823 --> 00:34:28,329
One look at jimmy's blood panels,
and i put it all together.

417
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,143
I can't say i'm thrilled
that he macked on an alien goddess,

418
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:35,887
But i got to say... maxima knows
how to rev a guy's engine.

419
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:38,879
Yeah, speaking from experience,
he didn't stand a chance.

420
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,032
Especially since she went after
him when he was vulnerable.

421
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:45,058
He was really shaken up
about some letter.

422
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,061
Yeah.

423
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:50,219
That letter was for you.

424
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,350
I, read it to you sophomore year in
high school when you were really sick.

425
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:57,147
The only way i had enough guts
to tell you how i actually felt

426
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:59,030
Was when you were unconscious.

427
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,715
"I may not be the one
you love today,

428
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:16,819
"But i'll let you go for now,
hoping one day you'll fly back to me."

429
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:21,848
The kicker is, you did respond,
with one word...

430
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,155
"Lana."

431
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:28,409
I guess i always knew. I just...

432
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,407
Clark, that was a long time ago.

433
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:33,680
Don't worry. I don't feel that way now.

434
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:36,260
I just wanted you to read it
so that i could finally close

435
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,742
That chapter of my life
and put it behind me.

436
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:43,278
But... don't get me wrong. I don't regret
having had those feelings.

437
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:46,001
But that's because
they helped prepare me so

438
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:49,655
That i was ready to share
my love with the perfect person.

439
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:52,628
And to me, that person is jimmy.

440
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,367
So you blew it, bud.

441
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,488
I just want you to be happy.

442
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,868
Clark, what you and i have,
i will never share with anyone else.

443
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:07,827
You're my bff.

444
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:12,297
Which is why, um...

445
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,696
When jimmy and i get married,
i was hoping that...

446
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:18,290
You would give me away at the altar.

447
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,026
Absolutely.

448
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,806
I'd be honored to, chloe.

449
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,693
And i may have an early
wedding present for you.

450
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:32,628
Since jor-El created brainiac,
i think he can cure your infection.

451
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:37,548
Maybe so, but i thought that when the
fortress disappeared, so did your father.

452
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:41,191
Jor-El's just complex computer programming
inside a kryptonian crystal...

453
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:43,389
The same crystal
that produced the fortress.

454
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,441
And now tess mercer has it.

455
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:51,136
That's the computer
she wants me to hack into.

456
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,717
And i think i can re-Create
jor-El and the fortress.

457
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:55,859
I just need
to get that crystal back.

458
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,234
The only problem is, i've already searched
the daily planet and the mansion.

459
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,860
I haven't found it.

460
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,465
Maybe this time, we use a little
less brawn and a little more brain.

461
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,151
Kickbox, chloe?

462
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,238
I find it helps focus my anger.

463
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,875
Maybe i should rush over to the dojo,
'cause i have a lot of it

464
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,697
Building up right now.

465
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:38,506
Call me paranoid, but it sounds
like that rage is directed at me.

466
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:42,740
I don't appreciate people breaking
into my office when i'm not around.

467
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,809
The door was open.

468
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,041
Do it again, and i'll press charges.

469
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,189
You made your point.

470
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:59,079
Listen, while i'm here, maybe i could
take a look at that supercomputer.

471
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:05,410
Sorry, but, uh... looks like the little
hacker bird missed the worm.

472
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,415
What do you mean?

473
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:11,598
I thought you said that i was the
only one capable of getting into it.

474
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:15,699
You might be, but we won't know now,
because i don't have it.

475
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,467
It was stolen.

476
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:22,319
Well, who else would want it?

477
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,203
I intend to find out.

478
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:26,341
Stay by your phone, chloe.

479
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:28,792
Only a handful of people
knew about that device,

480
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:32,358
And when i find out who has it,
i'm taking it back.

481
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:57,656
Lois, what are you doing here?

482
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:00,517
You know, if you're worried
about the editor taking away

483
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,383
The story, buck up.
It's not your fault.

484
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:07,523
Metropolis pd says that,
as far as they know,

485
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:10,448
Our big-Haired bimbo has vanished
off the face off the earth.

486
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:13,887
I'm afraid this may not be
the last we've seen of her.

487
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,233
Well, i'll be ready for her.

488
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,570
The late-Night game of bumper cars
might have knocked

489
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:20,805
The wind out of me,
but one supercharged fembot

490
00:39:20,806 --> 00:39:23,087
Can't put a serious dent in lois lane.

491
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,341
Thanks for showing up when you did.

492
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:32,033
I guess you could say you saved my life.

493
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,256
Tell me about it.

494
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,955
If i hadn't severed your love connection,
you would have ended up

495
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:38,331
Like all her other dates.

496
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:43,501
You know, she said
some... weird things to me.

497
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:45,283
Really?

498
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,470
She said she was my soul mate.

499
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:54,979
I think you can do a little bit better
than, uh, a man-Eating meteor-Freak.

500
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,754
I know she's not the one, but...

501
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,483
It got me to thinking.

502
00:40:02,045 --> 00:40:04,833
Chloe showed me this love letter
she wrote to me years ago,

503
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:06,123
And...

504
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,707
Her feelings were really intense.

505
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:13,602
And chloe was right there in front of me,
and i never realized how she felt.

506
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:19,509
What if my soul mate comes along
and i'm too blind to see it?

507
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:24,798
I don't know, smallville. I think...

508
00:40:25,332 --> 00:40:27,839
That when the right girl
walks into your life...

509
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:29,547
You'll know.

510
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:34,855
What did maxima say to you?

511
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,866
Nothing for the front page.

512
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:44,428
Well, i got to go. I'm meeting with
a realtor, finding my own place.

513
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:48,178
Those love birds are so sweet,
my teeth will rot if i don't move out.

514
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,319
Hey, lois, um...

515
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:53,566
You were right.
This house is pretty big.

516
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:57,372
If you want your old room back, it's yours.

517
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,939
Being housemates didn't work out for us
the first time, smallville.

518
00:41:03,205 --> 00:41:04,989
Why tempt fate?

00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:10,299
