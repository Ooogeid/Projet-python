1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:01,746
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:04,279
<i>I've picked out a nice little
font for my exposé.</i>

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,450
I actually had another
headline in mind.

4
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:09,498
"The Blur murders Lois Lane."

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,754
I know you're out there somewhere!

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,884
I've been keeping an eye on you.

7
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,213
I have to see you.

8
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:22,869
How do you feel about phone booths?

9
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:24,768
Hello?

10
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,450
This is the Red-Blue Blur.
I received your letter.

11
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,241
What I've really been wondering is...
What is it that you need?

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,470
I need your help.
But you can't tell anyone about it.

13
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:34,481
I promise.

14
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:37,322
I wouldn't ask if it weren't a matter
of life or death.

15
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:39,127
Welcome to Checkmate.

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,791
We've been blocked by a new player.

17
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:53,883
How do you get yourself
into these things, Lane?

18
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,120
The guy's inside, boss.
Says he'll only show it to you.

19
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,498
Wants to collect the
million-dollar reward.

20
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,708
Really. Ladies.

21
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:12,441
Hey, dollface.

22
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:15,271
My old friend.
It's been too long.

23
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:24,410
- Glad to have you back, Ray.
- Good to be back, darling.

24
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:27,211
Your coat, sir.

25
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,205
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Go right in.

26
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,401
Well...

27
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:54,510
As your ex-district attorney...

28
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:58,423
I'd like to thank you all for
joining me in

29
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:00,929
celebrating the national treasure

30
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,706
that is our American justice system.

31
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,499
You know...

32
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,900
they kicked me out of office...

33
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,508
they charged me with
attempted murder...

34
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,467
They even tried to
put me away for life and yet...

35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,433
here I am.

36
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,817
So...

37
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:37,406
I understand you have
something for me.

38
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,722
What about my million dollars?

39
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,623
Don't test me, son.

40
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,240
I told you to find the story.

41
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,301
<i>Not be the story.</i>

42
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,265
One of you want to
tell me what happened?

43
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,861
Let me guess.

44
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,734
You two have a lovers' spat?

45
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:01,658
Clark and I don't spat.
There was no spatting.

46
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,623
What Lois is saying
is that we try not

47
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:06,155
to let our personal lives
get in the way of our jobs.

48
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,577
You don't have to "try" anymore.

49
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,712
Because you're both fired.

50
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,910
Smallville - 9x18 - Charade

51
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,353
Synchro: Flolo

52
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:13,230
SeriesSub.com/Sous-Titres. Eu

53
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,883
Can you believe it? I'm early.

54
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:39,492
No, Lois, "early" is when you arrive
at your destination by a set time,

55
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,966
not when you can see it
from seven blocks away.

56
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,722
Nobody's raining
on this girl's parade today.

57
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:49,056
Clark's taking me up to the roof
tonight to do a little stargazing.

58
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,372
That explains the 911
to the craigslist queen.

59
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,090
Long live the queen.

60
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:58,616
I can't believe you got one so fast.

61
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:02,510
I kind of noticed that Clark
has this thing for telescopes.

62
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:04,431
Do you think he'll like it?

63
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,649
But what is it exactly
about a telescope

64
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,705
<i>that merits 76 trombones
and big parade?</i>

65
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:13,640
Well...

66
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,212
Tonight's the night.

67
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,950
In the words of the general...

68
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,714
- it's time to drop the L-bomb.
- What?!

69
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,386
<i>You mean to tell me that you guys
haven' volleyed the word yet?</i>

70
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:28,958
Among other significant
relationship milestones.

71
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:32,224
I don't know, things used
to be easier with Clark,

72
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,061
back in the days when you'd wake up
and the first thing you'd do is check

73
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:39,351
for a text or an e-mail
and it'd be there, waiting for you?

74
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,679
Anyway, things have been different.

75
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:45,706
Ever since we decided
we could keep secrets from each other.

76
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:48,782
But that's all changing tonight.

77
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:53,370
Wait a minute. Secrets?
Changing how?

78
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,900
No more secrets.

79
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,574
It's time to take our
baggage out of the closet.

80
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,443
I mean, if we "L" each other then...

81
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:05,340
<i>nothing should come between us,
right?</i>

82
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,315
Do you ever check your voicemail?

83
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,998
Looks like somebody missed breakfast
in bed with Oliver this morning.

84
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:32,604
- I'm not here to talk about my love life.
- That makes two of us.

85
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,138
- I'm here to talk about yours.
- Can't we stick to a topic like

86
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:37,989
- aliens assimilating the earth?
- This isn't about assimilating.

87
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:41,687
Zod has powers now and you told him all
of your secrets.

88
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,205
This is not a good time
to bring Lois in, too.

89
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:47,544
She told me about
your big date tonight

90
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,703
where you both are gonna
come clean with everything.

91
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:51,815
I'm not gonna tell Lois anything.

92
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,608
<i>I'm making Lois dinner tonight
so she shares her secret.</i>

93
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,510
She's been keeping
something from me.

94
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,603
I didn't want to use my abilities to
spy on her. It's been driving me crazy.

95
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,919
So you're gonna
seduce it out of her?

96
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:04,358
You're the reason all of this
is happening to begin with.

97
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,380
I have not called her
as The Blur in months.

98
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:09,655
That doesn't matter. The second that
your back-in-black alter ego asked

99
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,281
Lois to lie about the Blur
was the day that you asked her

100
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,660
to lie to the person
that she loves, which is you.

101
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,163
<i>And she did.</i>

102
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,283
A relationship with
secrets can never work.

103
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:24,588
Look at you and Oliver.
Everything's out in the open.

104
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,981
That is because we both
understand that our relationship

105
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,488
comes second to a higher calling.

106
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:32,322
- You and Lois...
- don't have to be any different.

107
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:35,256
Now, if Lois is gonna trust me
tonight maybe it's time I trusted her.

108
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:01,305
Did you get my message?

109
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,052
Yep.

110
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:08,095
So, we're still on for tonight?

111
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,466
Definitely.

112
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:15,524
What's in the box?

113
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,335
A surprise.

114
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,697
It's gonna be a long day.

115
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,452
Yep.

116
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,938
How about a sneak preview?

117
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:46,671
Sometimes, I swear you
have more than two hands.

118
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,615
Either that kiss altered
my sense of time and space

119
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,553
or this place is busier than usual.
It's a big news day.

120
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,844
I think it has something
to do with our new editor.

121
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:01,262
Another editor? They should just install
a rotating door up there.

122
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,516
Obviously, our illustrious owner has
spun some big wheel of fortune in the sky

123
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,229
to see who'd be steering
the ship this week.

124
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,124
Well...

125
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,617
I guess I pulled the
lucky number this week.

126
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,034
Franklin Stern. You must be

127
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,226
the lovely and
charming miss Lane, I presume.

128
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:25,138
Miss Lane is an acquired taste.

129
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,645
It's just that ever since Tess

130
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,938
went away, we've gone through
a lot of editors.

131
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,300
Not for long.
The board just launched

132
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,105
a global search
for the next editor-in-chief.

133
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,014
And I intend to make
their decision very easy.

134
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,297
And you decided to
start your campaign

135
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:45,310
by downsizing the desk inventory?

136
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:47,312
Miss Lane...

137
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:53,079
I've been reading
through the personnel files

138
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,706
to identify any red flags,

139
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,296
and I understand you two

140
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:02,369
are entangled in an
interoffice relationship.

141
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,384
- No.
- No, sir.

142
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,666
Yeah. Right.

143
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,605
Well, for whatever reason,
it seems you're both spending

144
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,230
so much time out of the office
trying to reel in the big fish,

145
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,509
you're not delivering
the daily catch.

146
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:20,387
To be fair, sir, we've both
turned in some pretty big stories.

147
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,247
Here's a bigger one.

148
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,988
Our fair city's disgraced D.
A., Ray Sacks,

149
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:28,178
just had is life sentence reversed.

150
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,480
He gets out o prison today.

151
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,445
Only one of these stays on the desk
at the end of the day.

152
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,050
May the best reporter win.

153
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,718
Oliver gave you keys to his office.

154
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:30,374
He must trust you with just
about all of his secrets.

155
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,739
I thought you were
supposed to be underground.

156
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:37,589
If you're having a hard time finding
your way there, I'm sure I could help.

157
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,360
So we're over the temporary truce

158
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,653
and straight back to "
fire at will."

159
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,301
Just remember, that out there,
I might be M.I.A., but in here...

160
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,060
I'm still C.E.O.

161
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:57,943
<i>Where is Oliver?</i>

162
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,613
Out of town.

163
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,521
I was curious how you two...

164
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,647
got into each other's orbit.

165
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,458
Mutual friends,

166
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:16,018
which I understand you could
use some help finding,

167
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:19,241
considering the fact that you have to
go to outer space to look for them.

168
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,300
The Kandorians?

169
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,569
You'll see, they're
better as allies than enemies.

170
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,724
Clark gets that.

171
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,933
Why don't you and Oliver?

172
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,969
Clark optimistically thinks

173
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:35,949
that Zod will be happy wearing
an apron and slinging coffees.

174
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:37,779
We don't...

175
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,068
Especially now that he has powers.

176
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,174
"We"?

177
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,116
As in, you and Green Arrow?

178
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,459
I get what you see in your heroes,

179
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:54,972
but what do they see in you?

180
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,704
I could ask Zod the
same question about you,

181
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:00,830
but I guess I don't have to anymore.

182
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,166
I've been watching you two,
and it seems like Zod

183
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,722
hasn't been home for
dinner for quite a while.

184
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,182
Be careful, miss Mercer.

185
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:14,269
At this rate, you're gonna
run out of people to betray.

186
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,390
I don't know what's worse, that they
freed the D.A that threw me off the roof

187
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:30,196
or that our editor threw us in
the ring to wrestle for the same desk.

188
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:33,270
Don't worry, if we land a big enough
story, we can save both our jobs.

189
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,808
Now, in order for him
to reverse his sentence,

190
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,723
Sacks must still have powerful
friends

191
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,981
down at City Hall. According
to the underground blogs,

192
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:42,275
he's having a "welcome home"
party tonight at Maxwell's.

193
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,340
Crime kingpins like
to keep out the outsiders.

194
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,158
It'd be easier to
crash the White House

195
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,112
than it would be to
sneak into that party.

196
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,161
We only have till the end
of the day to get this done.

197
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,694
I think we'd cover more
ground I we split the work.

198
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:56,353
That's a good idea.

199
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,690
Can't wait for tonight.

200
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:11,376
It's me, Lois.
Guess you're out.

201
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:14,389
It's strange to think that I can
leave a message for The Blur.

202
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,649
Not strange/weird.
It's just you know what I mean.

203
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,740
It's hard to picture The
Blur screening his calls.

204
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:21,203
<i>Not that you'd be screening my
calls or anything but I...</i>

205
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,377
Me again. Got cut off.

206
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:25,858
That's not lot of time
for someone to leave a message.

207
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,323
That beep comes at you pretty fast.

208
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:31,513
Then again, you are The Blur, of course.
I'm sure you'd like it fast, but I...

209
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:35,300
Here's the deal. I'm on a story about
our deadly ex-D.A.

210
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,827
Now, normally, I'd be working
with my partner in reporting,

211
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:41,034
but I want to keep him safe, secure,
as far away from Sacks and

212
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,199
his murderous mob as I can.

213
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:46,211
Clark's not bulletproof,
but you are. Be my wingman?

214
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,187
<i>Lois will find a way to see Sacks
before the party tonight.</i>

215
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:57,720
- I have to find him first.
- Look, I get it.

216
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:59,791
I'm spending a small
fortune of Oliver's money

217
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,924
to update the security
system here at Watchtower.

218
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:04,393
Plus I have a satellite trained on your
fortress at all times

219
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:07,199
now that Zod knows your zip code.
I understand the instinct

220
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:08,891
to protect the ones that you love.

221
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,594
Half of being in
a relationship with Lois

222
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,179
is protecting her from herself.

223
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,785
Actually, she's not the only one
Sacks is gunning for right now.

224
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,022
According to the Internet,
he's offering a million-dollar reward

225
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,647
for anyone who can supply him
with an image of The Blur.

226
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,441
Again? What's with this guy and
his obsession with The Blur?

227
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,349
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

228
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,859
you publicly disgraced him
and threw him in prison.

229
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,241
Since he's been out,
I have a hard time tracking him down.

230
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,555
Sacks is all about the V.
I.P. treatment.

231
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,579
Maybe he's got a favorite
bar or restaurant.

232
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,292
Someplace that he
would want to go to

233
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,559
after being locked
down for eight months.

234
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,930
<i>Our paroled prosecutor does
have a favorite haunt,</i>

235
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,735
but it isn't exactly five-star.

236
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:07,059
<i>Mr. Sacks, Lois Lane from
The Daily Planet.</i>

237
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,860
<i>You may remember me from the
roof of The Daily Planet.</i>

238
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,098
Yes. Yes, I remember you.

239
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:16,576
You have a nasty habit of always
landing on your feet, don't you, Lane?

240
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,937
And now I need to land a story.

241
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:20,871
So, who let you out of your cage?

242
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,813
Since I'm the one that
you sent skydiving without a parachute,

243
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:27,069
I figure I'm at least owed a quote.

244
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:29,468
You have too much faith
in The Blur, Lane,

245
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:32,473
to think you can meet
with me like this alone.

246
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,098
My editor knows where I am.

247
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,322
Hurt me, and you'll be back behind
bars before this pizza cools off.

248
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,522
I won't hurt you, no. He will.

249
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:49,371
And this time,
they won't find me guilty because

250
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,611
they'll never find your body.

251
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:08,528
It's him! Come on! Go! Go!

252
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,520
Wait!

253
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,098
Thank you...

254
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,791
for saving my bacon.

255
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,403
I'd be two strips of
pain on the pavement

256
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,529
if you hadn't gotten my call.

257
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:28,764
What call?

258
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,268
You have no idea what it means
that you trusted me enough

259
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,404
to let me help you these past weeks.

260
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,725
I have never felt such a sense
of purpose in my entire life.

261
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:40,368
Whatever you need...

262
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,121
you can count on me.

263
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,728
Payday.

264
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:01,411
That million's mine.

265
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:03,395
I got a picture of The Blur!

266
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,503
What you've got is two choices.

267
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:09,981
You either trash that photo
or I throw you in he trash!

268
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,232
Lois, stop!

269
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,921
- Who are you calling?
- It's not important, Clark.

270
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,006
No, that's The Blur, isn't it?

271
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:37,533
Why would you think that?

272
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:39,385
And what are you even doing here?

273
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,223
You told me that you
stopped talking to The Blur.

274
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:49,138
All those secrets that you've
been keeping from me. It's him,

275
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:50,646
isn't it?

276
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:53,692
Okay, this is between
The Blur and me.

277
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,652
That's all I can tell you.

278
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,404
Do you even know who
you're really talking to?

279
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,566
Okay, what's going on here?

280
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,483
- You don't need to be jealous.
- No, I'm not. I just...

281
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,375
I need to know who that is.

282
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:10,542
You did not just ask me that.

283
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,785
Is this about the story?

284
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,048
You want me to give up The
Blur just to save our job?

285
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:21,648
I'm trying to save you.
Don't you think that, sometimes,

286
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,596
you might have a little
too much blind faith?

287
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,846
Why? Because if he trusted me,
he'd show himself? Is that it?

288
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,157
Okay, I need you to listen to me.

289
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:35,886
No, Clark,
I am sure he is dyin tell me,

290
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:38,770
but how could anyone
who cares about me

291
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,563
put me in that kind of position?

292
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:43,108
If I knew his true identity,

293
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,768
then every lowlife with
high hopes of hurting him

294
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,490
would come after me,

295
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,439
and he would never put
me in that kind of danger

296
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,672
just to get a secret off his back.
That's why I trust him.

297
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:19,209
I take it your search for
Sacks didn't go so well.

298
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,064
I found Sacks,
but I may have lost Lois,

299
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,635
or at least her trust.

300
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:29,412
Oh, no. I know that look.
What happened?

301
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,908
I did this to myself.

302
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,782
I asked Lois to keep her
calls with The Blur a secret,

303
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,657
and she did...

304
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:39,422
even from me,

305
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,883
now someone else is calling
her pretending to be The Blur.

306
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,886
Why? Who would want to
Blur a mile your shoes?

307
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:48,276
I don't know, Checkmate, Zod, Tess.
They've all been circling my secret.

308
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,131
I stole her phone to see
who she was calling.

309
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,980
She's already deleted the list.

310
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,504
As much as I don't want to,
I have to say...

311
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:01,486
it's pretty impressive how committed
Lois is to protecting The Blur.

312
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,938
From me.

313
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,089
Yeah, talk about a
Kafkaesque nightmare.

314
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:07,373
I almost ended it all
and told her everything

315
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:10,256
till she reminded me why I can never
put her in that kind of danger.

316
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:15,337
I need to find whosever
lying to Lois using my identity.

317
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:17,126
She said she had
something to tell him.

318
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,157
And you want Watchtower
to trace the call. Got it.

319
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:29,681
I would have called you on my cell,
but I can't find it.

320
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,141
Someone photographed
you on their phone,

321
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,102
and they're about to
sell it to Ray Sacks.

322
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,903
I don't know when you'll get this
so I'll blitz his bash at Maxwell's

323
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:38,527
and try to run interference,

324
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:40,743
but you need to get
there as soon you can.

325
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,024
Piece of cake.

326
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,410
With attempted murder.

327
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:08,413
They even tried to
put me away for life and yet...

328
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,388
here I am.

329
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,191
I understand you have
something for me.

330
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,616
What about my million dollars?

331
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,574
Don't test me, son.

332
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,190
Sorry about your million dollars.

333
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,418
That's okay, kid.

334
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,755
We don't need that picture.
We just need you.

335
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:47,712
Three years of selfless
service to this paper,

336
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,975
the new editor on the
block just up and fires me.

337
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,157
Not just you.

338
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,207
At least one of us
would have kept their job

339
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:55,881
if you hadn't been so obsessed
with unmasking The Blur.

340
00:24:56,727 --> 00:25:00,183
I don't know how you found out about
that photo but crashing Sacks' party?

341
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:02,363
Just how many hurdles
are you willing to jump

342
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:05,039
to expose the person that
I'm trying to protect?

343
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:07,551
You jumped out of a cake
and you slugged me.

344
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:09,529
It was just a distraction.

345
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:11,354
I had to do something extreme

346
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:14,095
to destroy that extremely
dangerous picture, no thanks to you.

347
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:17,931
No, save it. I don't know why you
suddenly have it in for The Blur,

348
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,885
but whatever you're gonna tell me right
now isn't gonna make a difference.

349
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,554
I'm seeing a whole other
side of you and for the first time...

350
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,608
I'm not a fan of the view.

351
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,413
I take it this is the official
invitation to join you.

352
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,500
The black king.

353
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,502
Your work on this
operation has proven

354
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:27,606
to be surprisingly invaluable.

355
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,919
They have all witnessed The Blur.

356
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:37,431
Pieces of his identity have been locked
within their minds.

357
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,819
They simply need to be severed.

358
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:44,322
And you're extracting their memories

359
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:47,225
with this whole "Jedi
mind control" thing.

360
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,531
Very impressive
interrogation skills.

361
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:05,251
Listen, Mr. Lord,
I am no friend of The Blur but

362
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:08,000
why are you after him?

363
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:10,734
You are aware, Sacks, that...

364
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:14,257
Metahumans exist on the planet.

365
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:18,778
I assume this Checkmate agency
wants to use them

366
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,347
to protect and serve?

367
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,933
That's the white queen's plan.

368
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:27,567
Waller barks orders
from behind a desk.

369
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:30,611
I work in the real world,

370
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,740
a world that needs the rule of law.

371
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,895
Anything outside the
natural order is...

372
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,078
unpredictable.

373
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,494
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.

374
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,962
You have powers...

375
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:48,295
You're one of them.

376
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:52,648
Which is exactly why I know
how dangerous they can be

377
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,339
and why I plan...

378
00:27:55,594 --> 00:27:57,482
on eliminating them.

379
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,240
Chloe, when did you find this?

380
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,123
Can't you get a clearer picture?

381
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:17,858
Okay, one at a time.

382
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,853
I was following Lois just in case
she found Sacks before you did,

383
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:23,730
and I got the security footage
from a camera 60 floors up.

384
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:27,673
Now, unfortunately, zoom technology
isn't exactly on par with X-ray vision.

385
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,124
Where was Lois taken?

386
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:34,767
I don't know. I lost the car right after
it went into Rombauer Tunnel.

387
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:38,184
- This has to be Sacks.
- I did some digging.

388
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,386
Right around the time that our devious
D.A. walked, all his new little

389
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,451
prison friends who were sent up the
river were transferred off the grid.

390
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:48,293
I know these guys. I put every one of them
behind bars. They're all violent offenders,

391
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,404
and the only person who can
authorize their transfer is the Governor

392
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,880
who did you say threw Sacks' little
"welcome home" mobster ball?

393
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,817
Some tycoon named Maxwell Lord.

394
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,602
Three guesses who the largest contributor
to the governor's re-election fund was.

395
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:09,975
With that kind of influence, Lord
has some serious strings he can pull.

396
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,158
If Maxwell Lord wants The Blur,
that's exactly who he'll get.

397
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:20,563
You should see Lord's
setup downstairs.

398
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:23,192
This guy is a major player,

399
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:26,590
and he has just given me...

400
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,686
the key to the city.

401
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,002
Checkmate.

402
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,478
You're fighting it.

403
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,478
You know him, don't you?

404
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,026
Get away from her!

405
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:28,159
I see we're past
formal introductions.

406
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,548
Stop.

407
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:32,288
One wrong step...

408
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:36,083
and I'll eviscerate every
last thought in her head.

409
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:44,829
You're using their memories
to learn my identity.

410
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:46,844
Let them go.
They don't know who I am.

411
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,258
True.

412
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:51,852
They've only seen glimpses of your face,
nothing more. You've been careful.

413
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:55,352
Except for this one.

414
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,658
Even unconscious...

415
00:30:57,783 --> 00:31:00,107
her mind protects memories of you.

416
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,297
Maybe she doesn't have any.

417
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:05,659
Or maybe the connection
between you two...

418
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,921
is stronger.

419
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:11,599
Stronger than the fear that
binds you with the others, stronger.

420
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,706
Because of love.

421
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,614
You're here.

422
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,640
I can't know who you are.

423
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:18,460
I'd give anything
to see your face...

424
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,106
to know your name.

425
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,928
But you can't protect us
if we know who you are.

426
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,012
I understand that now.

427
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:53,961
Go.

428
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,029
Sorry, Max. Little
change of itinerary.

429
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,524
So it's true.

430
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:07,086
<i>The red queen does exist.</i>

431
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,996
I guess the upside to unemployment

432
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:23,492
is you on't have to pick
out a tie every morning.

433
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:25,377
You're beating yourself up,
aren't you?

434
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:28,493
Which "me"?
The Blur that Lois

435
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:31,701
would die to protect or the boyfriend
that Lois is protecting him from?

436
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:35,295
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Not everyone with a press pass

437
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,213
is also moonlighting as the
city's greatest superhero.

438
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:42,121
And the whole phone/rooftop/blur thing.
At least give yourself creative points

439
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,807
for trying to be as honest
as you could with Lois.

440
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:47,032
I guess if half of
me has Lois' trust

441
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:50,130
and the other half gets the rest of her,
it all works out in some weird way.

442
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:55,105
There's only one
problem with that...

443
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,093
one of those halves
has to say goodbye.

444
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,658
I finished tracing the
number of our rogue blur...

445
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:05,052
to R.A.O. Industries.

446
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:08,510
It was Zod.

447
00:35:10,638 --> 00:35:14,423
Everything he said
about brotherhood, it was all a lie.

448
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:17,572
Of course he's the one
who's been using Lois.

449
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:20,585
I know you want to go and take
your anger out on Zod right now,

450
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,325
but you and I both know that there's
something you have to take care of first.

451
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,319
Until you can tell Lois
that you are the one and only Blur,

452
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,345
anyone with a voice modulator and a
calling plan can pretend to be you.

453
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,888
I know what I have to do.

454
00:35:42,294 --> 00:35:43,579
Hello?

455
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:46,370
Lois, thank you for coming.

456
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:50,283
When The Blur leaves a handwritten
message, you better believe I'm there.

457
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:54,866
Chalk it up to the curiosity of
a recently unemployed reporter...

458
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:57,202
but since we've been
doing this cell to cell,

459
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:59,675
why are we back to
doing this old-school?

460
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,566
I wanted to have this conversation

461
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:06,376
in a place that meant
something to both of us.

462
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:10,053
Sounds awfully official.
But, you're the boss.

463
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:13,128
So, what's my next
impossible mission?

464
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,680
There won't be one, Lois.

465
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:18,675
I'm sorry. This is our
last conversation.

466
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:23,402
Last conversation
today or for a while?

467
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:27,362
If you have to go back on another
hiatus, I understand. I'll be there.

468
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,625
As in, our last talk...

469
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,356
Forever.

470
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:35,295
No.

471
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,435
Our relationship put you at risk.

472
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,407
I know that we would do
anything to protect each other.

473
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,743
What if, one day, I'm too late?

474
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:48,022
But you don't understand.
I don't care about the risk.

475
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:49,845
When I'm working with you,

476
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,419
I'm doing something good,
something right.

477
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:56,462
You don't need me for that.

478
00:36:56,722 --> 00:37:00,165
But I do need you maybe I didn't realize
it until it was too late,

479
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,011
but this the most
important part of my life.

480
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,175
There must be...

481
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:09,685
some other part that
means more to you.

482
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,745
When I'm with you,

483
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,251
it's about more than what I want,

484
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,138
who I want.

485
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,905
It is something that
is bigger than me.

486
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,993
I wish things could
be different, Lois.

487
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,962
This is the only way
I can protect you.

488
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:32,948
I won't call again.

489
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:37,041
If anyone calls claiming to be me,

490
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,704
don't believe them.

491
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:42,603
No matter what they say or what happens,
you can't trust them

492
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,469
no, please.

493
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:53,080
I will be watching over you.

494
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:55,772
I promise.

495
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:01,083
Goodbye, Lois.

496
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:12,367
Goodbye.

497
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:48,467
I'm glad you still came up after
what we talked about on the street.

498
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:52,148
It's beautiful, Clark.

499
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:53,979
Thank you.

500
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:00,003
What is it, Lois?

501
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,634
You know you can tell me anything.

502
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,763
Can I?

503
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,472
Then, why did I lie to you?

504
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:15,811
We both agreed we would keep
some things to ourselves.

505
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,777
I've been talking
to The Blur, Clark.

506
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:26,064
Doing things for him,
sharing things with him that I couldn't

507
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,283
share with you.

508
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:33,328
It's probably just the
reporter blood in you, right?

509
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,644
It was more than that.

510
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,930
But we...

511
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,841
I talked to him, and it's over.

512
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,830
He doesn't want me
in his life anymore.

513
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:56,918
There's someone standing
right here who still does.

514
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:03,275
It's okay.

515
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:08,738
You don't have to be okay with it.

516
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,243
It's not right for me to
ask that of you, Clark.

517
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,991
He meant a lot to you, didn't he?

518
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,805
It's not like this with you.

519
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:40,428
I wish you could understand
what it felt like to have this...

520
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,264
A calling...

521
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:47,382
A duty to people in - in the world.

522
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,702
Made my feelings for you
and everything else seem...

523
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:57,902
selfish,

524
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:00,195
like there's a whole world
out there that needs you,

525
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,573
but if you take anything
from it for yourself,

526
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:04,666
it's at someone else's expense.

527
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:08,924
Lois, I do understand.

528
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:11,912
How?

529
00:41:16,051 --> 00:41:18,624
I guess, with him gone,
the question is...

530
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:21,764
am i enough?

531
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:39,940
