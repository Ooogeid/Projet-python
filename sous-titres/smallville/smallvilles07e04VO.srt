1
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,649
You know it's true love when you fight off
caffeine-pumped preppies

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,403
to get a girl her favorite treat.

3
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,546
Scored you the last
melted mocha muffin.

4
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:20,798
And I know my inner chocoholic
will never speak to me again but...

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,946
I think I'll pass.

6
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:27,639
Something is definitely up,
and it's worse than I thought.

7
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:30,892
Since the sugar fix didn't do the trick,

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,350
maybe these will turn
your frown upside down.

9
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:35,982
Jimmy!

10
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:40,474
Oh, my god, you must've broken a whole
pen of piggy banks to afford these.

11
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,525
And you are worth every dime...

12
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,181
Nickel, and penny.

13
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:47,722
A night on the town,
just the two of us,

14
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,797
might be exactly
what the doctor ordered.

15
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:53,109
<i>- Do you have any honey?
- Sure, here you go.</i>

16
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:59,140
Uh, you're doing that distant thing.

17
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:06,192
I'm sorry. I think an old friend
just buzzed into town.

18
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:07,708
Wait here.

19
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:15,131
<i>- Belle Reve Hospital.</i>
- I think one of your patients is missing.</i>

20
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,014
Sasha Woodman, early 20's...

21
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:19,015
<i>Sorry, who ?</i>

22
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:21,472
Has a thing for bees ?

23
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,589
<i>We'll check our records, miss.</i>

24
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:29,005
- I didn't escape.
- Back off!

25
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,129
You or any of your swarm
try and sting me,

26
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,106
and I will go black flag on you.

27
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,428
Do I know you?

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,836
Chloe Sullivan.

29
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:40,548
Freshman year, you tried to go queen bee
and kill two of my best friends.

30
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:42,531
How did you get past the orderlies?

31
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,192
You don't understand.

32
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,766
I don't belong in Belle Reve.
I'm not a meteor freak anymore.

33
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,345
I've been cured.

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,283
A few weeks ago,

35
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:57,357
I had an operation.

36
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,826
Operation?

37
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,919
Who was the doctor?

38
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,509
Curtis Knox

39
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,793
He changed my life.

40
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,436
My family told me about
the terrible things I did in the past,

41
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,659
but I'm different now.

42
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:16,450
What do you mean your family told you?

43
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:20,596
When they took away my powers,
some of my memory went along with it.

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,950
The last... six years are blank.

45
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:31,539
If I did anything to you
or your friends, I'm really sorry.

46
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:11,424
Dr. Knox!
You scared me.

47
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,159
What are you doing here?

48
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,739
You have something I need.

49
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:18,642
I do?

50
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:44,343

54
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:42,712
Barby Flay, Rachael Ray, look out -
Here comes Lana Lang.

55
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:44,323
Can I help?
What you making?

56
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:48,048
Clark's favorite Blueberry pancakes.
I wanna surprise him before he wakes up.

57
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,176
This is what I don't get.

58
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,922
You guys are so ga-ga over each other,

59
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,368
and you've known
each other forever, right?

60
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,569
What took you so long?

61
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:03,294
Well, as long as Clark kept
his secret, it was impossible.

62
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,093
So is it like a...

63
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:10,862
A human thing to be so secretive
and cautious, or what?

64
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:13,198
No, I think it's just a Clark thing.

65
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:16,994
But he's only that way because he cares
so much about protecting people.

66
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,354
Oh, you didn't have do all this.
It looks great.

67
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,412
Yeah, but we're out of maple sirup.

68
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,173
Did you just go to the store?

69
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:36,480
Vermont's finest.

70
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:40,228
What happened to
"not showing off your powers"?

71
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,206
Stay away from Kal-El.

72
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:50,569
You might have been able to bully me
on Krypton, but not on this planet.

73
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:54,664
You two know each other?

74
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:00,089
He's the one that broke into our house
in the middle of the night,

75
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,143
and forced my family from our home.

76
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:04,682
Considering what your father did,
you were lucky.

77
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:07,781
What's he doing here?

78
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,895
He saved my life.
He's a friend.

79
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,870
Then pickingfriends
isn't one of your skills.

80
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:18,302
Watch your back, Kal-El.

81
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:27,312
Let me guess...
U're from Krypton, as well?

82
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:33,451
Mars, actually.

83
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:41,480
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

84
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,221
I'm gonna go
and meet aunt Nell in Metropolis.

85
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:48,686
It was nice to meet you.

86
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,332
Your cousin's arrival cannot be
taken lightly, Kal-El.

87
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:11,569
I went to see my father.
He gave me the same warning.

88
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:12,994
But I don't get it...
She's my cousin...

89
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,204
The only kryptonian family I've besides
a disembodied ice from the arctic.

90
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:19,747
And she could use your longing
for family against you.

91
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,334
She's dangerous.

92
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:25,120
Her father tried to assassinate Jor-El.

93
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,061
They were brothers.

94
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:31,281
Their hatred for one another
was stronger than any familial bond.

95
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:35,251
Does Kara have her crystal?

96
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,881
Not anymore. It was in her ship when
it exploded, but now it's missing.

97
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:43,020
I've been trying to help her find it,
but we've had no luck.

98
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:44,632
If she gets to that crystal,

99
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,665
everything you hold dear
in this world could be lost.

100
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,809
You must find the crystal before Kara.

101
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:54,944
<i>Trust is a luxury you cannot afford.</i>

102
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,884
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

103
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:18,235
Mussolini once killed a conductor
for not keeping a train on schedule.

104
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:22,450
Fortunately, I'm infinitely
more patient than "Il Duce".

105
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:25,627
Mussolini went down in defeat, doctor.

106
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,283
I won't accept that
in what we're undertaking.

107
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:31,744
Well, hiring me is certainly
a winning strategy.

108
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:36,812
Legions of your own scientists said that
curing meteor-infected's was impossible.

109
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:39,216
Well, as impressive as your results are,

110
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:42,093
some of your practices
deeply concern me.

111
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:47,556
I sever the cerebral wiring of the freaks
in your gallery, and you pay me my fee.

112
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,025
End of story.

113
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,849
You've authorized batteries
of tests I never approved.

114
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:55,554
Tell me, are the levels
of meteor rock toxicity

115
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:59,180
in the patients' vital organs
really relevant to the task at hand?

116
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:03,791
Mankind's greatest advances would never
have seen the light of day

117
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:09,197
had the genius minds behind them
been scrutinized under a microscope.

118
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,277
Leave the science to me.

119
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:16,877
Doctor, three of my patients
are missing.

120
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,140
You wouldn't happen to have any idea

121
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,738
why someone with a brand-new
lease on life would suddenly disappear?

122
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,273
Perhaps it's because you insisted on
eradicating any recollection

123
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:29,947
 of their stay at "Hotel 33.1".

124
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,937
I insisted they'd be able to start new
lives unttered by disturbing memories.

125
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,679
Especially those that could
incrinate you.

126
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,419
If there's nothing else,
I have a schedule to keep.

127
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,966
I have good news, my love.

128
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:26,583
I found another piece of the puzzle.

129
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,383
Please let me go.

130
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:01,328
Relax, Sasha.

131
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,913
Just relax.

132
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:07,403
You're here...

133
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
...to serve a greater purpose.

134
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,593
Is my girl ready to rock?

135
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,643
I was thinking that we either hit
change's on the way to the show tonight,

136
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,534
or we can chow down
chili dogs at the arena.

137
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:39,311
Jimmy, I know you spent a small
fortune these tickets tonight, but...

138
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,458
Why is the word "but" never
followed by something good?

139
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,918
Would I be the worst
girlfriend in the world

140
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:49,375
if I asked for a rain check
on our night out on the town tonight?

141
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,600
I know.
I- I'll make it up to you.

142
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:55,640
It's just I'm chasing down
a hot lead on the meteor challenged.

143
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,170
This can't wait till tomorrow?

144
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,818
Look, please don't take this personally.

145
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,091
I thought I could deal with this, but
everythings about meteor freaks lately.

146
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,504
I thought we agreed we weren't
gonna use that word anymore.

147
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,983
Well, that's what they are,

148
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:10,833
and if those freaks
weren't locked up in Belle Reve,

149
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,129
then maybe they'd get
to see you once in a while.

150
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:25,500
Chloe, can Dr. Curtis Knox take
a backseat? I need your help.

151
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,389
You know, you're gonna have to hang
a bell around your neck or something,

152
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,416
so I can at least hear
when you're coming.

153
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,259
I need you to help me
find Kara's missing crystal.

154
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,244
I need you to check the
databases, satellite imagery...

155
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,472
Clark, you're gonna have to fly solo on
this one

156
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,170
because my dance card's completely full.

157
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,875
- Chloe, this is important.
- I'm sure that it is.

158
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:44,396
Look, I know that from mount Olympus,
the view must seem like us mere mortals

159
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,759
have nothing better to do than
help you look for your crystal,

160
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,875
but believe it or not,
I have important this to do, too.

161
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:09,578
So, tell me how I can help you,
miss...

162
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,403
Sullivan.

163
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm a meteor freak...

164
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:19,493
And... I want to be cured.

165
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,383
Lana?

166
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:45,851
Sorry about the clash
of the titans this morning.

167
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,454
Oh, I'll get used to it.

168
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:51,393
You're home early. I thought Chloe was
helping you to trackdown Kara's crystal.

169
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,984
Lana, has she opened up
to you about anything?

170
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,162
Maybe something
that's been bothering her?

171
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:01,749
No, she's been working 24-7 to impress
that wonderboy editor.

172
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,997
She was researching a story...

173
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,988
- About a Dr. Knox.
- Curtis Knox?

174
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:08,597
You've heard of him?

175
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,357
Yeah, he's a...
He's a neurosurgeon.

176
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:14,339
I heard a rumor that he's working
with meteor-infected people.

177
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,426
How do you know all this?

178
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,114
Well, I've been doing my own research
on the meteor-infected.

179
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,704
More people than just me
have been hurt by Lex,

180
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:28,535
and they need help.

181
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,736
I want to do whatever I can.

182
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:35,531
I didn't know you had a secret
plan to save the world.

183
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:40,388
So far, I've only made a few contacts.
Knox's name just came up.

184
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:45,797
As amazing as it sounds, he is using
brain surgery to remove their powers.

185
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,708
That actually explains a lot.

186
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,391
A headline like this
could change Chloe's life.

187
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:07,638
Trust me, if these seats were any closer
you'd be arrested for stalking the band.

188
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:10,206
I'm scoring big points
with the boyfriend, Olsen.

189
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:11,611
Ring that bell.

190
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,268
There it is.

191
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,508
James.

192
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,233
I'm so glad I found you.

193
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:21,961
Really?

194
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,898
Yeah, um, I've been looking
all over for Lois.

195
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,550
Have you seen her?

196
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,034
Uh, you'll need a telescope,

197
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,509
new editor sent her to the city of angel
to get a quote from the DUI of the week.

198
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:35,933
Bummer.

199
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:39,660
You know, I heard that she
snuck into a grain silo,

200
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,631
and took some videos of a spaceship.

201
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:43,979
I was kind of hoping
I could sneak a peek.

202
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,859
I'm a bit of an E.T. Junkie.

203
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,276
No kidding?
Me too.

204
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:50,775
I used to sit in the backyard
and try and pick up

205
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:51,399
martian signals on my dad's ham radio.

206
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:56,282
Um, martians use infrared, silly.

207
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:03,361
Unfortunately, Lois' video
is nothing to phone home out.

208
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,883
Tech guy couldn't get anything
off it but static.

209
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:11,084
Well, um, you know your way
around cameras, right?

210
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:14,160
And I bet you're a lot smarter
than he is.

211
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:16,987
Is there anything
that you could do?

212
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,652
What the heck?

213
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,912
It's not like I'm doing
anything else tonight.

214
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,675
I'll crunch a few pixe,
see what I come up with.

215
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:29,043
Okay.

216
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,060
You are my hero.

217
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:35,367
Call my cell when you're done,
and I'll be here in a blink.

218
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:38,979
Thanks.

219
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,742
How's your article going about Dr. Knox?

220
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,100
Uh, he's doing some
interesting research,

221
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,636
but I don't... I don't believe
there's a story there.

222
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,132
Neither do i.

223
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,293
Chloe, you're a good liar.

224
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:14,263
You've had lots of experience
keeping my secret,

225
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:16,992
but I don't believe you're
researching knox for an article.

226
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,705
I think it's about the procedure.

227
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,151
Then you realize that he's my only hope.

228
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,427
Dr. Knox said he could fit me in
at the end of this week.

229
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,892
Chloe, you don't know anything
about this doctor.

230
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,651
I know that he can give me
a chance at a normal life.

231
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:40,504
Look, I understand wanting
to have a normal life... I do...

232
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:42,830
But brain surgery is not
the way to do it.

233
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,419
You don't understand,
Clark.

234
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,977
Going psycho or turning into
a serial killer

235
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:49,287
aren't the only two things
I have to worry about.

236
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:52,801
When I healed Lois in that dam,
it almost killed me.

237
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,655
Who's to say the next time I try
and save someone isn't my last?

238
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,968
What are the side effects
of the procedure?

239
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:04,505
- Potentially memory loss.
- Chloe...

240
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:07,839
If I have to give up a bit of my past
to gain a future, then so bet.

241
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:08,967
You're gonna forget everything.

242
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,119
You're gonna forget your friends,
your experiences...

243
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:15,114
You're gonna forget me.

244
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,956
You're gonna forget me.

245
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:28,674
People will be there when I come back
to fill in the blanks.

246
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,905
In time, I'll be fine.

247
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,666
Clark, if you want to save me,
let me go.

248
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:19,587
I applaud your ingeniosity,
doctor.

249
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,702
After mulching the body
into the fertilizer supply,

250
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:27,687
by week's end her DNA will be spread
over every cornfield in Kansas.

251
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:29,565
Oh, Lex.

252
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:34,180
If only you were a typical rich kid -
Chasing women across the globe,

253
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:37,408
instead of dabbling with science
that you don't understand.

254
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:39,778
Your killing spree stops right now.

255
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,923
I'm not gonna let you hurt
one more person.

256
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,383
Countless patients are living new lives

257
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:49,084
with no idea what you did to them,
thanks to me.

258
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:51,301
How about the ones
you murdered?

259
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,868
They're the chosen few,

260
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:57,923
the reason I created a cure
and came knocking at your door.

261
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:02,105
Because I knew that somewhere
in your museum of oddities

262
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:05,036
I would find the ones
I was looking for.

263
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,532
Your practice is closed,
doctor.

264
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,351
You come one step closer,
and I swear to god, I will shoot you.

265
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm quaking in my boots.

266
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:37,207
Son of a bitch!

267
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:47,939
I have been speared
by mayan warriors...

268
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:51,633
...survived mongols' arrows,

269
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:55,881
and the cold steel of crusaders' blades.

270
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:02,961
What makes you think the sting
of a 9 millimeter could slow me down?

271
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:37,689
So, you're no Mr. Miyagi.

272
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:40,240
But that's okay,
because...

273
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,036
I know a little trick.

274
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,533
Now, you move the top stick,
and keep the lower one straight,

275
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,106
and you never, never let
the noodles intimidate you.

276
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:56,125
Okay.
Let's do this.

277
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,380
I knew it.
You're a natural.

278
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:09,704
You're a really patient teacher.

279
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:11,600
Thanks.

280
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,294
<i>Render complete.</i>

281
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,304
<i>Video codec rendering completed.</i>

282
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,589
That's not the ship.

283
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,803
But we have something.

284
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:28,089
Flintlock is a technology supplier for
the security branch of the government.

285
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:29,684
The government?

286
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:34,376
Looks like we got another area 51
right in the heart of Kansas.

287
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,433
Oh, Chloe's gonna do backflips.

288
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,581
No, you can'tell Chloe.

289
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:40,224
Why not?

290
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:46,038
Well, she'd tell Clark, and
he can't stand my obsession with UFOs.

291
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:50,685
But it's exactly what she needs to enter
new editor's honor roll. I got tell her.

292
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:53,120
James...

293
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,720
I know I can trust you.

294
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:58,963
This has to be our secret.

295
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,333
Okay? It's between you and me.

296
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:10,060
Do you want some chinese?

297
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,003
It's good, but they
really make you work for it.

298
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,194
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you were busy.

299
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,834
And, uh, we were just...

300
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,987
Look, I can explain.

301
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:25,899
There's no need.

302
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,252
I have to go.

303
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,179
I swear it's not what it looks like.

304
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,613
Bye, Jimmy.

305
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,836
You're the last person
I thought would save me.

306
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,821
I was following that butcher you used to
erase the memories of your 33.1 victims.

307
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:15,818
- Lana told you about Dr. Knox?
- Don't bring lana into this.

308
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,124
No point in lying for her, Clark.

309
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:21,901
I know Lana's somehow been
uncovering company secrets.

310
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,690
Probably using the $10 millions
she stole from me to do it.

311
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:29,123
At the moment,
i'd say it's money well spent.

312
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:31,940
If she hadn't tipped you off,
i'd be in the morgue.

313
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:33,986
You're just as guilty
as that doctor.

314
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:38,368
Makes me sick to think that
I had to take a life for yours.

315
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,867
Knox isn't dead, Clark.

316
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:48,957
He came after me.

317
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,773
I put six bullets in his chest.

318
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,474
They didn't leave a scratch.

319
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,757
You're saying Knox is still alive.

320
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:04,107
Not only is he alive, he's murdering
his patients one by one.

321
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:12,419
Miss Sullivan.

322
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:13,463
Right on time.

323
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,933
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

324
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,228
I'm just glad my test results proved
I could have the procedure.

325
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:20,812
You're one of a kind.

326
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:23,723
The level of meteor rock
concentration in your heart...

327
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,295
It's extraordinary.

328
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,671
In my heart?

329
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:29,970
Just relax.

330
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,382
After tonight, you'll have
nothing to worry about.

331
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,797
Where are all your staff?

332
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:43,062
They'll be here shortly.

333
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:50,823
What is that?

334
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:19,441
Where's Chloe?
I've been looking everywhere.

335
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:22,681
We had a major misunderstanding C.K.

336
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:24,712
I need your help.

337
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:26,935
There's no time.
Where is she?

338
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:29,821
Well, she's jumping to conclusions.

339
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,960
She stormed out of here
before I could explain.

340
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,195
Did she say where she was going?

341
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:34,723
No, but she dropped off
this rubik's cube of a rt,

342
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,604
and I have no idea what it means.

343
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,637
"After tonight, I might not remember you,

344
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:40,637
so don't let me forget why we belong together."

345
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:45,038
I don't get it, C.K.
What's happening tonight?

346
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:56,694
What are you doing?

347
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:01,686
Taking your heart
and giving it to Sophia.

348
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:07,343
Thanks to you, Chloe Sullivan,

349
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,316
my love will last forever.

350
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:24,018
Where did Knox take Chloe?

351
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,966
Look, Clark, I want to stop Knox
as much as you do.

352
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:30,824
I've check every address we had on file.
They're all dead ends.

353
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,447
He didn't disappear into thin air, Lex.

354
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,336
No, but he's had a lot of
experience covering his tracks.

355
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,817
Send me the pictures on Knox.

356
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,671
I used face-recognition software
to run an image search.

357
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:44,842
There we go.

358
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:50,717
Knox wasn't alive during World War II,
Lex. He's too young.

359
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,692
He's much older than he looks.

360
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,540
This is knox in 1888.

361
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:59,377
And here he is in 1675.

362
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:04,006
Clark, he's had 1,000 names,
and he's lived for centuries.

363
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:06,538
That's why you can't kill him.

364
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:08,656
Curtis Knox is immortal.

365
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,340
Well, he couldn't have gotten far.

366
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,577
Must've dropped this
in the struggle with Chloe.

367
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:16,264
It stopped less than an hour ago.

368
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:20,834
"Este perpetua."

369
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:22,437
"May you live forever."

370
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:24,615
It's a roman greeting.
I've seen this before.

371
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:28,457
The Victorian Arms?

372
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,911
Knox was the robber baron who owned it.
He lived there in the '20s.

373
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,037
Maybe he never moved.

374
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:42,023
If your wife is sick,
I can cure her with my abilities.

375
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:44,345
Sophia is perfectly healthy.

376
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:48,903
I've induced her coma simply to
reduce her stress before the procedure.

377
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:52,112
You put her in a coma because
you knew that she would freak

378
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:55,987
if she knew that you were playing fatal
games of operation with innocent people.

379
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:58,365
That doesn't sound like
eternal love to me.

380
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:02,983
You've been around, what,
two decades?

381
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:06,401
What do you know about true love?

382
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,100
I know there's someone that
I want to live to see again.

383
00:29:10,344 --> 00:29:12,164
A schoolgirl crush.

384
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,705
Very quaint.

385
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,990
Unfortunately, you won't be able
to say goodbye.

386
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:23,567
Now, let us begin.

387
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:29,516
I came here for help, not to be cut open
by some Jack the reaper wannabe!

388
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:32,180
I was Jack the reaper.

389
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:42,445
Chloe?

390
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:56,039
Your powers might be far beyond those
of mtal men, but you've met your match.

391
00:29:58,292 --> 00:29:59,895
I won't let you kill anyone else.

392
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,783
I'd kill 1,000 more
to never have to be alone.

393
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:12,070
You don't know the pain of living
centuries, watching the women you love,

394
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:14,314
grow old and turn to dust!

395
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,887
You and I are more alike than you think.

396
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:23,709
I won't go through again!

397
00:30:37,162 --> 00:30:38,156
My god.

398
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:40,134
What have I done?

399
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:11,978
Please don't leave me.

400
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,789
Please.

401
00:32:05,143 --> 00:32:06,512
What'd you do with Knox?

402
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,304
Your father and I had a
"don't ask, don't tell" policy

403
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,264
when it came to crime and punishment.

404
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:16,314
I suggest we abide by the same rules.

405
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:23,829
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- Knox is immortal, Kal-El.

406
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,547
You can't kill him.

407
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:29,653
I know what it's like to have
feelings for the people here,

408
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:37,823
And when they're gone, you still
have a greer calling to fulfill.

409
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:40,274
Have you found the crystal?

410
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,758
I got a little sidetracked.

411
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:46,029
What is "Red eyes" still doing here?

412
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,164
I heard what he said about my father.

413
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:53,323
He's the one who can'be trusted.

414
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:57,680
Ask him to tell you about
what he did to my family.

415
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:00,729
Your father was a traitor.

416
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:03,868
He's lying.

417
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:10,136
Who are you
gonna believe, Clark...

418
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,693
Your family...

419
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:17,094
...or this martian manhunter?

420
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:24,111
Guess this family reunion is over.

421
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:54,253
I heard the police shut B.C.E. Clinic
down and that Curtis Knox went awol.

422
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:57,079
Did you have anything to do with that?

423
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:59,756
Turns out he was killing his patients.

424
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:04,182
Chloe's story got her in
a little over her head.

425
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,318
Oh, my god.

426
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:06,828
Is she okay?

427
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:09,759
You know Chloe, there's not a whole lot
that can keep her down.

428
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:12,463
She's lucky to have someone
like you in her life, Clark.

429
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:14,247
We all are.

430
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:25,351
What's wrong?

431
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,269
Lex helped me find Knox.

432
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,759
Well, he probably has
an ulterior motive.

433
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,448
Lex doesn't generally do things
out of the kindness of his heart.

434
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:44,032
He told me you stole
$10 million from him.

435
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:54,049
You can see
what he's doing, right?

436
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:57,293
he's trying to destroy
what we have all over again.

437
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:02,888
Clark, that money was a part
of the divorce settlement.

438
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:06,019
I plan on using it to help
the meteor-infected people

439
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,210
who have been victimized
by LuthorCorp.

440
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:15,005
Don't let Lex's lies come between us.

441
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:22,087
I'd never hide
anything from you.

442
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:46,247
There you are.

443
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:51,429
Remember me?

444
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:55,713
That's a good sign.

445
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:59,859
Your letter was a little "da vinci code,"

446
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,869
and I'm no cryptologist, but...

447
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,520
I brought this...

448
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,633
...to remind you
why we belong together.

449
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,150
It's the cocktail napkin from that july
4th party,where you gave me your number.

450
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:32,505
Oh, the Grandville carnival.
This was the best first date ever.

451
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:35,657
And my favorite...

452
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:39,405
a piece of stain glass from
the bullpen that broke,

453
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:41,558
during that weird
earthquake last fall.

454
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:46,004
Okay, now, i'm the one
that needs the decoder ring.

455
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:51,668
We lost touch for the longest time,

456
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:55,948
and the day that we bumped
into each other again, the world...

457
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,403
well, it literally shook.

458
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:07,007
And if that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.

459
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:11,445
Jimmy, I'm so sorry
about all the craziness

460
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:13,742
I've put you through
in the last couple of weeks.

461
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:17,370
Well, let's just agree that
the future will be more normal.

462
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:26,954
You know, I don't think
I can make you that promise.

463
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:33,892
I don't think things will ever
be normal between the two of us.

464
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:53,611
Wait a sec.

465
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:57,007
Is this because of Kara?

466
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:04,625
Because after all the times you left
me on hold to go run off and help Clark,

467
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:08,281
i'd hate to think that you're gonna give
me a hard time for helping Kara once.

468
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:10,340
No, this isn't about Kara.
This is about me.

469
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,486
This is entirely me.

470
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,585
What's going on, Chloe?

471
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:31,094
If you can't say it...

472
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,292
Try some sign language, or subtitles.

473
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,720
I can't.

474
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:41,499
I'm sorry.

475
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:44,475
So am i.

476
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:52,277
'cause I've tried really, really hard
to be the understanding boyfriend, but 

477
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:56,285
there's so much a guy can take before
there's nothing else to do but jump.

478
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,197
I don't know what to say.

479
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:05,941
Maybe that earthquake
wasn't a sign.

480
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:13,585
Maybe it was a giant fluke
just like this relationship.

481
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:19,905
Maybe you're right.

482
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,471
You know what?

483
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,153
I can't do this anymore, Chloe.

484
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:45,473
I can't.
