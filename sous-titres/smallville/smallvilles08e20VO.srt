<i>Previously on "smallville"...</i>

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,634
bless me, father, for i have sinned.

3
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:07,230
I have hurt many people...

4
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:11,427
- that i care about.
- No more than three tablets a day.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,734
They can be highly addictive.

6
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:17,418
Please, for your own
good, get out of here now!

7
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:22,104
I put up with years of your taking
someone else's side over mine...

8
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:23,943
first clark and then davis?

9
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,367
Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life.

10
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:30,351
There is a savior among us.
Until you fulfill your destiny,

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,501
he won't have his great
challenge to overcome.

12
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,033
You were destined to kill each other.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,767
Sorry about being the
invisible best friend lately.

14
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,824
Just when i thought i'd hit my fill

15
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:43,868
of high-maintenance men,
i take a job from oliver.

16
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,659
Watchtower is officially online.

17
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:49,501
There is something
about being around you

18
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,200
that seems to calm
the murderer inside me.

19
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,178
Will you stay with me?

20
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:58,701
We all have our inner demons...

21
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:04,492
... but we must learn to control them.

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,400
Davis, is everything okay?

23
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,317
Sorry if i woke you.

24
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:34,702
i had another one.

25
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:37,100
It's just a dream.

26
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,567
You know you're safe with me.

27
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:43,684
Could you come down
anyway? I need to see you.

28
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,748
Of course. I'll be down right away.

29
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:34,674
You know, this isn't exactly the
typical response to a bad dream.

30
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:37,286
Most people just get a night-light.

31
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,100
I wanted to surprise you.

32
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,536
It's beautiful.

33
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,400
But i don't remember ever seeing

34
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:50,033
a box of candles down here or flowers.

35
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,788
There weren't any.

36
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:58,000
Davis, we talked about this.

37
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:01,084
- You can't leave the basement.
- I was careful.

38
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,451
I know how much you're risking by
helping me. I only wanted to thank you.

39
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:07,200
I don't need thanks. I
need to able to trust you.

40
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,567
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

41
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:22,133
You've helped me when no one else would.

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,133
Well, friends help each other, right?

43
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:31,792
Friends help you move. They
take you to the airport.

44
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,435
You can't think that's
really all this is.

45
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:40,534
Okay, so maybe it was a 9.9
on the richter scale of favors,

46
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,253
but that doesn't
change our relationship.

47
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:47,325
We met in a flurry of
smoking ash, burnt-out cars,

48
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:50,367
people freaking out,
but for a moment there,

49
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:54,234
it felt like everything
disappeared except us.

50
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,196
Those feelings haven't changed.

51
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,905
I do care about you, davis.

52
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,541
- But...
- Stay.

53
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,660
Please.

54
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:16,948
Without you, the man that
i want to be doesn't exist.

55
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:12,267
Davis, is that blood?

56
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,901
What did you think was gonna happen?

57
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,868
No!

58
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:05,868

For seriessub.com

61
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,450
you okay?

62
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:08,768
You can usually make
cappuccinos blindfolded.

63
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,494
Yeah, i just didn't get my full
seven hours of sleep last night.

64
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:18,218
And judging from the look on your face,

65
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:20,650
you didn't come here
to join me for pancakes.

66
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:23,151
Tess named davis the serial killer.

67
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:27,318
She devoted the whole front page
of today's paper to the story.

68
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,017
Headlines can't hurt
davis now that he's dead.

69
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:36,825
That's the thing, chloe. I'm starting
to believe that davis is still alive.

70
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,765
Come on, clark. We both watched him die.

71
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:45,034
- Oliver buried the body.
- But it says in this article

72
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:48,526
they found one of bruno mannheim's
thugs in a dumpster, torn apart,

73
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:52,084
the same way that doomsday
dismembered his victims.

74
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,483
That body was probably there for weeks.

75
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,650
The murder happened after davis died.

76
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,584
I love a good ghost story
just as much as the next girl,

77
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,184
but there has to be a
more logical explanation

78
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,617
than the resurrection
of an alien monster.

79
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,817
There could be a copycat killer.

80
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,819
Chloe, he's come back
from the dead before.

81
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,984
Not from meteor rock.

82
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:24,154
Look, clark, i understand why you're
paranoid. Davis was sent here to kill you.

83
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,758
I mean, that would make anyone believe
there were monsters under their bed.

84
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:32,051
It doesn't change the fact
that davis is a murderer.

85
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:35,450
But, clark, davis is dead,

86
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:39,260
and the only thing that's keeping
him alive in your mind is fear.

87
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,864
Let him go.

88
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:55,901
Gentlemen, luthorcorp is going green, and i
certainly don't want all the old-money investors

89
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:58,892
to think we're wasting all of
their money on hemp bracelets, so...

90
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:02,110
we could send some cameras into
the geothermal energy facility.

91
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:05,017
It's innovative. It's profitable.

92
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:08,417
Okay, perfect. Call tess.
Arrange a press release.

93
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:11,788
Nothing screams "photo op" like a
10-mile hole in the ground, right?

94
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:18,750
Hey, oliver, um, can
we talk for a quick sec?

95
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:23,051
not the greatest time
right now, actually.

96
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,318
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

97
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,967
Okay. All right.

98
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,218
Gentlemen, excuse me.

99
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:33,265
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry to barge in on your lunch...

100
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,750
yeah, jimmy, listen, those
guys aren't my frat brothers.

101
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:39,300
- I'm here on business.
- Yeah, i know. I know.

102
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:40,917
Real quick.

103
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:44,284
I was hoping that you could
spot me 600 bucks, stat.

104
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,717
My mechanic called a code
blue on my alternator.

105
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:49,701
Well, you work here. What are they
paying you, in shirley temples?

106
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:53,017
They, uh... they let me go.

107
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,917
Cutbacks. I mean, you know how that is.

108
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:57,984
I do.

109
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:02,045
That's why i'm pretty sure it's not
your car that needs the fix, buddy.

110
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,148
You think that i'm lying?

111
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,784
I got three bus transfers to prove it.

112
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:14,634
Listen, i know a really great place you
can go to, get back to being yourself.

113
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,717
It's very discreet, staff's
very supportive, food's great.

114
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,450
Now, if you're worried about
paying for your treatment, don't...

115
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,142
'cause i can take care
of that for you, okay?

116
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:26,811
Great.

117
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,123
You gonna drive me there, too?

118
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,717
'cause my car doesn't work.

119
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,684
All right, hey...

120
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,536
... this road that you're on,
man, it is lonely, all right?

121
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:43,632
Now, if you need someone to
talk to, if you need a friend...

122
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,337
then i'm that guy, but, uh...

123
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,337
i'm not gonna give you
any money for drugs.

124
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:56,598
You know, i thought after everything
that happened that we could be friends.

125
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,951
But seeing you don't
trust me, i guess not.

126
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:14,784
You've been caring for davis
bloome in your basement?

127
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:18,087
Who else knows about this?

128
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,816
No one.

129
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,750
Not even oliver.

130
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:24,881
And i came to you directly
because he can't be trusted.

131
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:27,873
Chloe, he created our organization

132
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:30,455
to help with exactly
this kind of problem.

133
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,917
Oliver killed lex luthor.

134
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:40,531
And the stakes are too high to have
someone involved who can't think clearly.

135
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:45,040
Webmd doesn't exactly have a
lot of intergalactic infections,

136
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:48,643
so you were the only person
that i could turn to for a cure.

137
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:53,717
No, i'm glad that you came to me,

138
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:58,284
but there's only so much
i can do with a few cells.

139
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,717
You have his dna. What more do you need?

140
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,778
The subject in person.

141
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,764
That's not gonna happen.

142
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:13,750
I can run some preliminary
tests on the saliva.

143
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,984
But, chloe, are...

144
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:22,025
are you sure this is something
you want to take on alone?

145
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:24,483
I'll be fine.

146
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,643
Call me when you get the results.

147
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:38,735
- Who was that?
- Davis, you shouldn't be outside.

148
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,588
What's going on? Who
were you talking to?

149
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:43,667
Look at me. It's fine, okay?
Calm down. It's just a friend.

150
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,238
Now, you know you're not supposed to
be out of the house. What's happening?

151
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:50,318
Nothing helps.

152
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:53,861
I tried looking at photos of you, i
tried holding strands of your hair...

153
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:56,734
none of it works. This thing inside me,

154
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,221
it starts to claw its way
out as soon as you leave.

155
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,233
I can't be away from you now.

156
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,917
You are now metropolis'
own cornfield killer.

157
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:20,300
Now, i didn't tell you about this earlier
because i didn't want to upset you,

158
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,786
but the police are hunting
for you as we speak.

159
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,732
And by accepting your help, i put
you directly in their cross hairs.

160
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,934
Only if someone finds you, which they
won't because i won't let that happen.

161
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,817
<i>But what about when the cops find you?</i>

162
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,817
- What then?
- Then we leave.

163
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,455
We load up the car and never look back.

164
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:53,669
You've done more for me in a few weeks

165
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,953
than anyone's done in my entire life.

166
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,553
But i can't ask you to run away with me.

167
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:02,318
Then it's a good thing
you're not the one asking.

168
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:22,339
You wouldn't be able to say
goodbye to anyone, not even clark.

169
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,131
Can you do that?

170
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,684
Can you honestly tell me

171
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,302
that i am the most important
person in your life?

172
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,617
... i would do anything for you.

173
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:54,483
Well, then maybe this is
our chance to start over.

174
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,680
Let's leave smallville.

175
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:06,307
So, this is actually happening.

176
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,805
i just need to close a few accounts
and dead-end some paper trails first,

177
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:13,500
but we can be on the road by sundown.

178
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,202
... i don't know where
i'd be without you.

179
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,263
Oliver, i checked the quarry
where you said you buried davis.

180
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,662
- He's not there anymore.
- Your vision must be getting blurry.

181
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,800
I buried that body myself. I still have
the dirt under my fingernails to prove it.

182
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,535
I saw the grave. It's empty.

183
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,784
Why would someone move the body?

184
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:59,634
I don't think anyone moved it. It doesn't
look like anyone dug into the ground.

185
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:02,784
Looks like something...
clawed its way out.

186
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,650
Then that thing's still alive.

187
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,284
It went after chloe before.
I think it may try again.

188
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,533
Have you warned her yet?

189
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:13,084
She thinks i'm being paranoid.

190
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,105
Paranoid?

191
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,805
She knows he's obsessed with her, right?

192
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,151
Which is why i need you to find
her. Take her someplace safe.

193
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:23,231
I need to head to the fortress, see
if i can find a way to send doomsday

194
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,550
to a place he can't hurt anyone again.

195
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,784
No need to pack your parka.

196
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,051
I can tell you how to conquer the beast.

197
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:34,622
Kick his ass, clark.

198
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:37,935
Get this thing out of our
lives once and for all.

199
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:40,130
You want me to kill him.

200
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,334
No. I need you to kill him.

201
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,318
We all do. You're the only one who can.

202
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:48,984
That doesn't make it right.
I'd still be taking a life.

203
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,318
You'd be saving thousands, clark.

204
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:54,318
The only way any of us are
ever gonna be safe again

205
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,684
is if doomsday is destroyed... for good.

206
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,951
Doomsday is my problem,
and i will handle it.

207
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:03,146
Just, please, take care of chloe.

208
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:15,734
I'm down to my last card, emil,
and i really don't want to play it,

209
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,084
so please take another
look at the samples.

210
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,261
There has to be a cure.

211
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:24,184
<i>His nuclei are in a
constant state of mutation.</i>

212
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,084
<i>I tried to destroy a cell,
and somehow, it got stronger.</i>

213
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:30,218
You said you wanted
to see him in person.

214
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,284
I mean, how 'bout i bring
him down to your lab?

215
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,184
<i>Frankly, i don't want
him anywhere near me.</i>

216
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,884
He's not always a monster.

217
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:39,074
<i>I mean, something is keeping
him from transforming.</i>

218
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:43,550
<i>Well, sometimes, dramatic
changes to the body</i>

219
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,817
<i>are caused by intense emotions...</i>

220
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,138
<i>love, hate...</i>

221
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,109
<i>obsession.</i>

222
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:58,550
Which is why my presence
stops him from morphing.

223
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:04,028
<i>Chloe, this creature
puts us all in danger.</i>

224
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:08,135
<i>- We need to warn people.
- You don't want to do that.</i>

225
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,417
You betray me, you betray davis,

226
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:13,017
and you sure as hell don't
want to be on his bad side.

227
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:15,123
<i>Fine.</i>

228
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:19,347
<i>But if you do have this power
over him, then it's all on you.</i>

229
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,917
<i>You're the only cure.</i>

230
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,945
Were you just talking to someone?

231
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,172
Just one of my patients.

232
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,350
Have you heard from oliver lately?

233
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:41,472
Not since he asked me to hack into a
stream of transmissions from tehran,

234
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:45,744
and considering the fact that,
farsi isn't exactly my strong suit,

235
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:48,450
i should probably get
back to translating.

236
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,807
Chloe, davis is alive.

237
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,750
I have proof, and i need to find him.

238
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:57,017
Well, i'm sure that when he
resurfaces, we'll hear about it.

239
00:18:57,084 --> 00:19:00,784
He has a habit of crashing
his way onto the 6:00 news.

240
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:04,168
Well, i intend to find him and bring
him to the fortress before that happens.

241
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,784
I got a faint signal from the console,

242
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,251
and i found the crystal that
brainiac used to release zod.

243
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:12,959
Okay, putting aside my serious
distrust of all things brainiac,

244
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,951
how is the crystal gonna help?

245
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,218
It's gonna open up a
portal to the phantom zone.

246
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:20,783
Clark, you can't send davis there.

247
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:24,968
Chloe, he has killed over 50
people. He put jimmy in the hospital.

248
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:27,825
- There's nothing more i can do for him.
- I'm talking about you.

249
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:31,084
<i>I mean, what if, when you open
the portal, it sucks you in.</i>

250
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:33,340
You once told me if
there was no other choice,

251
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,612
that you hoped i would put
the good of the world first.

252
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:39,483
Exactly. And losing you
is not good for the world.

253
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,433
It's a risk i have to take.

254
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,817
Okay, then maybe i can help.

255
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:52,239
I've been hearing about a string
of suspicious murders in alaska.

256
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:55,531
Now, i didn't pay much attention to them
because they weren't trademark doomsday...

257
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:57,707
it's okay. It's a lead. I'll find him.

258
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,324
Good luck.

259
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:32,951
So, you're stealing
money from chloe now.

260
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:36,020
I guess your car really
does need those repairs.

261
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:39,381
It's just a loan.

262
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,095
I'm gonna pay it back.

263
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,251
Holy...

264
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,803
oh, what the hell?

265
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,384
Hey, you okay?

266
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:23,972
Aside from being snatched
by a crazed serial killer?

267
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,750
Yeah, i'm great.

268
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:30,050
Any idea who did this?

269
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:33,874
Not to sound like a broken
record, but it was davis bloome.

270
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:42,408
- Where the hell are we?
- Looks like the talon basement.

271
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:46,471
My god, what's he done with chloe?

272
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,950
Never hurt chloe.

273
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,251
She, uh...

274
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:57,484
she saved me.

275
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:00,884
No way.

276
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,905
Now, chloe might be a sucker for
the strange, but she's not crazy.

277
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,255
Bit of advice...

278
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:09,850
you really don't want
to upset me right now.

279
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,584
Yeah, trust me, i know.

280
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,084
I've seen your horns.

281
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:17,964
You give a whole new meaning
to the term "bridezilla."

282
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,970
You're the beast.

283
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,815
Hey, davis, it's me. I'm
just on my way home right now.

284
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,297
Chloe, hurry. I can feel myself changing.
Please get back here and stop it.

285
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,133
Chloe, stay away!

286
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:48,451
Is there someone there with you?

287
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:52,019
Some guys broke into your
apartment. I'm holding them here.

288
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:54,317
Why did you leave the basement?

289
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,767
Because i thought you were in danger.

290
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:58,917
Okay, you trust me, right?

291
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:01,839
So trust me on this and let them go.

292
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,864
As soon as we're out of smallville.

293
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,184
Just come home, chloe. Hurry.

294
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,686
I'll be there as soon as i can.

295
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:24,636
Why did you do it?

296
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,349
Come on.

297
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:35,113
Every killer's got a sob story.

298
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,551
You know, i hear that an
unhappy childhood, that's...

299
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,084
that's pretty popular.

300
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:44,717
You wouldn't understand.

301
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,551
Of course not, because you, uh...

302
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:51,387
you brooding types... you
guys are all so complicated.

303
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,618
Jimmy, come on, man. Chill out.

304
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,451
No!

305
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,217
No, that monster destroyed
my life and brainwashed chloe,

306
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,017
and he's trying to ruin hers, too!

307
00:24:00,117 --> 00:24:02,079
You have no idea what
chloe really wants!

308
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:04,551
We have to be together.

309
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:07,482
Hey, man, look, i know what
it's like to jones after a girl.

310
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,984
Really, i do, but you can hold
on a little bit longer, okay?

311
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,929
- You have to. Chloe's on her way.
- Oh, i hope so.

312
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:15,417
I really do, because if she's not,

313
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:18,652
the only way that i can control
myself is if i kill one of you.

314
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:24,832
Then kill me...

315
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:28,137
because you've taken everything from me.

316
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,321
All that's left is scar tissue.

317
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,639
Jimmy, that's enough.

318
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:39,634
What are you, anyways? Because
you're sure as hell not human.

319
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:41,717
Stop talking.

320
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:55,584
Do you really think
chloe could ever love you?

321
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:59,249
Whatever lies that you told her...

322
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:03,149
she's gonna find out the truth
eventually, and when she does...

323
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,817
no, davis! Davis!

324
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:17,552
Chloe's never gonna forgive
you for that! You understand?!

325
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,773
Please!

326
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,742
Please.

327
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,750
You're right.

328
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:33,384
You mean too much to chloe.

329
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:48,376
It has to be you.

330
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,750
I'm sorry.

331
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:25,317
Davis, don't do this, please.

332
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,158
Please, no!

333
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:33,163
Where's chloe?!

334
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:36,205
What are you gonna do to me, clark?

335
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,301
Oh, my god.

336
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:15,034
Was davis holding jimmy in the basement?

337
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,734
They're lucky to be alive.

338
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,167
Jimmy, i'm so sorry.

339
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,209
Whatever you do, chloe...

340
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:37,042
- stay away from that monster.
- Let's go.

341
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,201
You know, chloe, i thought
about calling the police.

342
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:48,290
Instead, i figured i'd give
you a chance to explain yourself

343
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:51,142
before i let them haul you off to
prison for harboring a serial killer.

344
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,553
I shouldn't have left davis here alone.

345
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,001
This is all my fault.

346
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,867
When did you become
one the bad guys, huh?

347
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:08,951
For whatever reason, i calm the
beast inside him. He needed me.

348
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,682
He needed you.

349
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:15,356
So, the needs of the cornfield killer outweigh
the needs of the rest of the world. Is that it?

350
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,844
- It's complicated.
- No, it's complicated, yeah.

351
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:20,101
That's the same thing your
psychopathic boyfriend told me.

352
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,634
Look, either i keep him with
me or let innocent people die.

353
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,134
Oh, come on...

354
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:29,551
if you really believed that, you would have handled
things a little bit differently, don't you think?

355
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:33,018
Instead, what do you do? You cook him dinner,
you fluff his pillow, you rock him to sleep.

356
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:35,494
Okay, look, i understand what
it looked like from the outside,

357
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:38,067
but trust me, i had the
whole thing under control.

358
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:41,538
You didn't have anything under
control! Speaking as davis' next victim,

359
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:44,634
i can tell you, your
plan was seriously flawed!

360
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:53,118
How did you think this
was gonna end, chloe?

361
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,134
I'll find him, okay? I'll fix this.

362
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:00,800
No. You won't.

363
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,139
I think you've done enough. We'll
let clark handle it from here.

364
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,957
Wait, oliver.

365
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,850
Where is clark?

366
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:14,826
Well, he took davis.

367
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,334
He's finally gonna finish this.

368
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,919
I don't care if this place
trapped me once before.

369
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,734
You want to throw down
with me, good luck.

370
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:52,567
I didn't come here looking for a
fight. This fortress can help you.

371
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:56,457
It's all that's left of our planet.

372
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,301
How did a piece of krypton get here?

373
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,608
My father created it using
kryptonian technology.

374
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:07,767
It'll send you to a world

375
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:10,428
where you don't have to
hide who you are any longer.

376
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,301
A world without chloe?

377
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:25,400
No, you better have a plan
"b" because i'm not losing her.

378
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:28,167
If you truly cared about
her, you would let her go.

379
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:31,368
You got it all wrong, clark.

380
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,867
<i>She chose to protect me.</i>

381
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:36,167
It was her idea for us to
leave smallville forever.

382
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,700
Chloe would have done that for anyone.

383
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,669
She believes in second chances.

384
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:45,268
She doesn't actually
have feelings for you.

385
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:47,901
Why? Because of what i am?

386
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,767
I didn't want this, clark.

387
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:54,251
I even killed myself to try to
escape this life, but the darkness...

388
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:57,179
it doesn't come out when chloe's around.

389
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,474
She makes me...

390
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,630
human.

391
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,134
What happens when that changes?

392
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,033
It won't.

393
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:19,446
Look, she is my chance to be happy.

394
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,454
Why can't my own kryptonian
brother let me have that?

395
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,800
I'm sorry, davis. I was wrong.

396
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:27,168
We're not brothers.

397
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:48,525
I don't want to hurt you, davis.

398
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:51,834
Don't worry. You can't.

399
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:26,819
If i go, i'm taking you with me.

400
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,734
Chloe, what are you doing?

401
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,968
I can't let you do this.

402
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,767
This is the right choice, chloe.

403
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,365
Trust me.

404
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:04,268
Trust you? Clark, the only
reason why you won't kill him

405
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:06,867
is because you don't
want blood on your hands.

406
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,400
I can't believe you
were willing to force him

407
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:12,097
into a life of hell for all of eternity.

408
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:18,744
I know you better than anyone.
I can't let you do this.

409
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,768
You would never forgive
yourself for giving up on him.

410
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,201
Tell me that your search
team has a read on that beast.

411
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:03,184
I have people on every
continent, jimmy, but so far, no.

412
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,232
No castle to storm.

413
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:06,942
Sorry.

414
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:12,474
You know, i'm not sure the beast you
need to be fighting's out there, jimmy.

415
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:15,534
I think maybe, uh... maybe it's in here.

416
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,170
Look, if this is another attempt to
turn me into the poster boy for rehab,

417
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,630
cancel the photo shoot,
'cause i'm not interested.

418
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,990
I didn't call you here for a lecture.

419
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:29,227
Just this.

420
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,101
It's the money you asked for...

421
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,301
for your car.

422
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,836
Forget it.

423
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,000
i don't need your handout.

424
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:46,416
Oh, it's not a handout.
It's your first paycheck.

425
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:49,568
Let me guess... got 12
steps attached to it.

426
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:54,465
Well, only if you decide not to
take the elevator to your office.

427
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:57,528
The truth is, there's
an opening on my staff,

428
00:34:57,611 --> 00:35:00,347
and something tells me
you'd be perfect for it.

429
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,301
I ran a little background check on you.

430
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,934
It seems to me there's
more to your story than

431
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,983
you write on your cover letter.

432
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,367
Unfortunately, what
you see is what you get.

433
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:13,058
I'm a mediocre photographer
turned failed bartender.

434
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:16,278
I don't remember seeing a job
posting for that on careerbuilder.com.

435
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:21,351
I don't know, jimmy. Everybody
knows you take great action shots.

436
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:24,787
What i didn't realize
until recently was,

437
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,043
when called upon, you're pretty
damn good in action, as well.

438
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,213
You make it sound like
i'm some kind of hero.

439
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,800
Trust me, i'm not.

440
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,844
I wouldn't be so sure.

441
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:47,018
You figured out davis bloome's
serial-killer secret before any of us did.

442
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:50,499
You took on the beast all
by yourself. It takes guts.

443
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,334
You got good instincts, jimmy.

444
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:58,563
- That's enough for me.
- Yeah. Thanks to those instincts,

445
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:01,633
my life is really awesome these days.

446
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,579
Well, if you don't like it, change it.

447
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,600
Why don't you start
by accepting my offer?

448
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,508
What's the catch?

449
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,104
No, no, no catch. No catch,
just work, and a lot of it.

450
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:20,224
It's a full-time gig.

451
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,733
What do you say?

452
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,230
If you're looking for chloe,
you're wasting your time, clark, but

453
00:36:57,313 --> 00:36:59,800
i guess that's what
you do best, isn't it?

454
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:06,027
She's gone, man. She
doesn't want to be found.

455
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,184
If there's anyone who can make
themselves invisible, it's chloe.

456
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,468
Davis must have done something to her.

457
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:14,067
Chloe would never have lied
to me if she weren't trapped.

458
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,672
Either that or she just can't
resist tall, dark, and doomsday.

459
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:19,367
Besides, davis isn't a
monster when he's around her.

460
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:23,074
- He's got real feelings for her.
- Whatever his feelings are for her

461
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:26,267
chloe would never care about him.

462
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:30,672
Clark, she sent you on a
wild-goose chase to alaska

463
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:33,234
when she was hiding that
psycho killer in the basement.

464
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,767
Take it from a guy who spent $10 billion

465
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,934
on a merger with the girl that got away.

466
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,167
You don't always
choose who you fall for.

467
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:44,065
The chloe you're talking
about does not exist.

468
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:47,312
She'd never choose
davis over her friends.

469
00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:53,322
Well, people change, clark.

470
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,709
Maybe it's time you did, too.

471
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:01,887
You should have killed that
thing when you had the chance.

472
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:14,886
Clark, i know you
want to save everybody.

473
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:19,364
But eventually, you're gonna
have to make the tough decisions.

474
00:38:22,315 --> 00:38:24,491
It's what heroes do.

475
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:59,974
Who is this?

476
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:01,900
Clark, it's chloe.

477
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,211
I just wanted to let
you know that i'm okay.

478
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:06,520
Where are you?

479
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:11,264
Davis and i are gone, but please don't
try and find us, okay? We're fine.

480
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:14,068
You think that you're safe, chloe, but
you aren't. You are not safe with him.

481
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,992
I'm sure everyone's fitting me
for a straightjacket right now,

482
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:19,055
but, clark, i do know what i'm doing.

483
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:21,267
And i knew that if i told you any sooner

484
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,664
that you would have found
a way to stop me, so...

485
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,172
look, everything i've ever done,

486
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:30,143
right or wrong, i did for you.

487
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:32,192
By running away?

488
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:34,791
Admit it, chloe. You
have feelings for davis.

489
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,667
That's why you're protecting him.

490
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:39,101
<i>Clark, i'm protecting you.</i>

491
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,733
I meant what i said.

492
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,158
Condemning davis to a life as that
monster is worse than killing him.

493
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:46,934
But what about you, chloe?

494
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,867
Chloe, i'm gonna spend
every second looking for you.

495
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,767
I will find a way to save you.

496
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:54,000
Clark, you're not here
to save one person.

497
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,059
You're here to save all of us.

498
00:39:56,896 --> 00:40:00,306
And you think sacrificing
yourself will help me do that.

499
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,118
Chloe, you're wrong.

500
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,350
You're wrong, chloe.

501
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:10,234
I must have thrown a
million green rocks away,

502
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,602
and i have never really saved you.

503
00:40:13,697 --> 00:40:15,382
Now i can.

504
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,915
Chloe, listen to me. This is your
life that we're talking about.

505
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,834
Don't do this.

506
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:30,367
If there's one lesson
i've learned from you,

507
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:33,460
it's that choosing the greater
good is never a sacrifice.

508
00:40:56,447 --> 00:41:00,267
You said that road trips
give you a sweet tooth, so...

509
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,673
Thank you.

510
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:07,172
We better get moving. We want
to hit the border by morning.

511
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,101
Let's disappear.
