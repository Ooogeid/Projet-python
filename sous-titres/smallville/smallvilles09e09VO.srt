1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:01,534
Previously...

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,011
- where is the orb?
- What the orb?

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:07,206
You just want to take over
the world with some alien nation.

4
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:09,215
<i>I am trying to save the world.</i>

5
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:12,228
My cousin lois vanished for three
weeks and then suddenly appeared,

6
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:15,014
claiming that she was being
chased by a ninja-clad assassin.

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,892
I think i know
where she was. The future.

8
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:21,411
Could these vivid dreams you've
been having have something to do

9
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:23,703
with your three weeks
of blocked memory?

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,321
Why don't we have the powers
we should have under yellow sun?

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,669
I will find the answers
we are looking for,

12
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:32,004
or i will die in the quest!

13
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:34,907
I give you
the world's first solar tower.

14
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:37,709
- Why are you risking your own life?
- Because it's the only chance i have

15
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:41,013
- before you destroy our world.
- Clark would never in a million years

16
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:42,458
risk what needed to be done.

17
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,467
And i told you lois
doesn't have that kind of time.

18
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,628
You get dr. Weiss on a helicopter
and get him to met gen now.

19
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,694
I got three of the country's
best neuro mds on their way.

20
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,410
- It's too late. She is already missing.
- What do you mean she's missing?

21
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:11,780
You took her to the hospital.
You've been with her all night.

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,693
I was. I stepped out
to see if you called,

23
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:16,518
and when i got back, she was gone.
There's nothing in her chart.

24
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,777
There's no releases,
and there are no witnesses.

25
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:22,808
Hospital said someone called and
requested a copy of lois' test results.

26
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,160
Why would emil care about lois?

27
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,593
He wouldn't.

28
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:31,057
Maybe the person
he's working for would.

29
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,699
Spying on lois' computers
and hacking into her therapist files.

30
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:56,119
Did you really need to escalate into
kidnapping her from a coma ward?

31
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,892
There's a mystery
surrounding miss lane.

32
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,724
And this is my chance to solve it.

33
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,973
So, what, all this
because she told a shrink

34
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:05,811
she has headaches and sees
weird futuristic flashes?

35
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,129
What? I can't hack into
these files and not read them.

36
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,632
They're called boundaries,
stuart. Find some.

37
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>And these futuristic flashes
may not be imaginary.</i>

38
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,395
Besides, lois was investigating zod's
orb when she vanished for three weeks.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,350
you think these are repressed memories
that she's already been through?

40
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,045
This technology will tell us.

41
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:43,419
Can't you get more
than just fragments?

42
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:46,888
I'm sorry but her mind is like
a mental mosh pit right now, okay?

43
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,597
- Only a human,
- pause it.

44
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,207
That's zod's solar tower...

45
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,477
exactly as it's designed
to be built.

46
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,649
But the plans haven't even
gone public yet.

47
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,087
<i>Lois did go to the future.</i>

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,054
Okay, you better pop some popcorn.

49
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:13,687
She's remembering something.

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,268
Where's the orb?

51
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,572
What orb?!

52
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:32,511
Where are you? Don't start
what you can't finish.

53
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,958
What the hell?

54
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:28,360
Hello?!

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,356
Why are you out of uniform?

56
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,169
Maybe because i dropped out
of girl scouts years ago.

57
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,949
You're bleeding.

58
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:01,233
You're nothing but a filthy human.

59
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:04,097
This zone is off limits
to your kind.

60
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,429
But this dream is all mine,
so what's with the attitude?

61
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,805
It is not your place
to ask questions.

62
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,007
I'm a reporter.
Asking questions is in my blood.

63
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,180
Well, then...

64
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,536
it would be a shame to spill it.

65
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:33,785
The red-blue blur.
He'll stop you.

66
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,349
Not under a red sun.

67
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,088
Look around you.

68
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,020
The blur is dead.

69
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,193
Smallville - 9x09 - Pandora

70
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,865
Synchro: Flolo

71
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,636
For Seriessub.com

72
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:59,628
tuning the tv
to channel lois is one thing but

73
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,927
syncing your brainwaves to hers?

74
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,747
All we're seeing on the screen
are jumbled images.

75
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:09,011
To get the answers
i'm looking for, i need to plug in.

76
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,574
<i>I didn't build
this technology, okay?</i>

77
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,092
Don't you think we should have
someone from summerholt here?

78
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:19,777
Zod said that his tower's
going to change the world.

79
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:24,333
Lois' memories of the future
should show me how.

80
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:30,284
How hard can this be?

81
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,498
Time for food.

82
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,441
Come on. Let's go.

83
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,180
Stealing will not go unpunished.

84
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,151
Easy. I was just hoping
for some food here.

85
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,865
And i'm pretty sure this is a bad dream,
but right now, i could eat

86
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,256
- about 30 maple doughnuts.
- You want food?

87
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,134
And what do you have to trade?

88
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,907
Take this.

89
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,678
It's all i have.

90
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,798
It's yours if you let her go.

91
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,233
This will do...
for now.

92
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,322
I thought i'd lost you forever.

93
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,157
Thank god.

94
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,271
I can't believe you're alive.

95
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,591
- This dream just got 10 times brighter.
- What do you mean "dream"?

96
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,883
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you
this but you're not dreaming.

97
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:50,522
If this isn't a dream then it's the
worst nightmare i could ever imagine.

98
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,829
Since when did the kent
family farm become a prison?

99
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:56,903
Why would you give away the one thing
of your dad's that meant so much to you?

100
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,232
<i>I did it for you.</i>

101
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:03,848
Okay, hold on.

102
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,254
Explain about the wicked witch
and the flying freaks.

103
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,191
Have we been invaded
by "the wizard of oz"?

104
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:11,120
More like another planet.

105
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:13,495
Aliens?

106
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,648
Before i fought tess,

107
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:19,080
she went on and on about some orb,

108
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,988
called it alien technology, said
there was life inside of it.

109
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:24,713
This invasion, tess knew about it.

110
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,916
Yeah, tess may have helped.

111
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:30,128
These aliens have
their own leader. His name is zod.

112
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,488
I tried to fight him, but...

113
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:36,292
i made all the wrong choices.

114
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,804
A lot of people died.

115
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,934
Please tell me
chloe wasn't one of them.

116
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,801
I don't know.

117
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,911
After i thought i lost you,
i went off on my own.

118
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:51,321
I haven't talked to her in months.

119
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,693
Months?

120
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:55,279
You vanished a year ago.

121
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:59,529
No, i was just throwing down
with tess a few hours ago.

122
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,364
And then i grabbed that gold ring.

123
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,654
The legion ring?

124
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,040
It must have brought you here when
you put it on. Do you still have it?

125
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:14,653
Yeah.

126
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,798
You. Zod likes to see you.

127
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,271
Protect the ring.

128
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:56,308
Where's lois?

129
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,758
Last i heard, you dropped her
at the hospital.

130
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,969
Someone moved her and i know
that you had emil look into her records.

131
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,695
She's my cousin.

132
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,330
You've been hiding things
from me for months.

133
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:08,376
Now i think you're hiding lois.

134
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:12,584
Right accusation, wrong girl.

135
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,729
I may not have been sharing my deep,
dark secrets with you lately,

136
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:18,329
but someone else has been
playing hide-and-seek

137
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,544
<i>a lot longer than i have.</i>

138
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:25,851
Yeah. We can work
on your apology later.

139
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,928
Tess has been keeping more
than just an editorial eye on lois

140
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,956
for the past few months.

141
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,614
Lois can't answer any of
her questions. She's in a coma.

142
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:36,629
She doesn't have to talk to tess
for her to run tests on her.

143
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,899
And we both know how obsessed
she's been with the fact

144
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,895
that lois vanished for three weeks.

145
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,970
You think this has something to
do with her trip to the future.

146
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,951
I think it's possible.

147
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:49,763
Emil gave me
the hospital workups on her.

148
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:52,604
She suffers from
post-traumatic stress disorder.

149
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:56,096
So every time she has a memory,
her body relives the trauma.

150
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:58,277
Her heart can only take so much.

151
00:12:58,732 --> 00:13:00,268
I have to find her.

152
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,087
Tess is never gonna admit that
she took lois. Let me try something.

153
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,402
I have a guy on the inside.

154
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,535
Okay, ladies, we're a little
touch-and-go here right now but

155
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,086
we are stable again.

156
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:16,247
And you should have a front-row
seat to the lois matinee.

157
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:20,120
No, no.

158
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:21,875
No.

159
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:36,109
I guess membership has
its privileges.

160
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:38,302
Try the truffle.

161
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,535
It's my favorite.

162
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,985
To think...

163
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,372
a few of these
could mean the difference

164
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:58,789
between life and death
for your kind.

165
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:14,468
I'm general zod.
And all of this

166
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,574
is mine to give...

167
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,666
if you give me the names

168
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,026
of whoever snuck you
into the restricted zone.

169
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,778
My dad's a general, too.

170
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,995
<i>And he still
couldn't get me to spill</i>

171
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,022
how i got an m1 abrams tank
to take me to prom.

172
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,087
<i>So i'm definitely not
telling you anything.</i>

173
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,041
Then you hear this.

174
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,601
No matter how many times
you resistance fighters

175
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:46,051
break into the zone, you'll never...

176
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,461
<i>never take down my tower.</i>

177
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:02,865
What is this?

178
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:11,195
You?

179
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:15,432
You redheaded rat!

180
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,577
Do you know her?

181
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:20,941
She used to work for me.
But then she disappeared.

182
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,360
Traitor!

183
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,756
I am this planet's savior!

184
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,987
I helped general zod take power

185
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,255
to ensure this earth's survival.

186
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,087
Tess mercer,
the ultimate ecoterrorist.

187
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,683
<i>And what are you?</i>

188
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,870
I understand you were seen
talking to clark kent.

189
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:45,569
It was only a matter of time
before the resistance got to him.

190
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:49,793
The only thing i'm resisting is
the urge to kick both your asses.

191
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:52,603
And if clark were here
right now, he would back me up.

192
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,884
The only reason clark is still alive
is because i'd hoped he'd join us

193
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,475
to bridge the gap
between our people.

194
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,477
Trust me, zod.

195
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,656
No one has worked as hard as i have

196
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,882
to get clark to see
the good that we're doing.

197
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,842
But i think we've fooled
ourselves long enough.

198
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:11,053
He won't come around.

199
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,828
Which is why...

200
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:23,829
Neither of you
is any good to me alive.

201
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,372
Excuse me?

202
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,151
A double execution
will send out a strong message

203
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:33,945
to anyone who would dare defy me.

204
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,624
Take heart, lois.

205
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,623
At least you can enjoy
a glorious last meal.

206
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,455
Today, two lives end...

207
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,580
but another begins.

208
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,777
Rise, soldier.

209
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,750
You betrayed the entire human
race for some crappy dog tags.

210
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,504
Way to go!

211
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,590
Let her go.

212
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,998
Take my life!
Let her live!

213
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,936
Your bravery is commendable.

214
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:59,779
But by defying me,
you have forced my hand.

215
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:14,741
I wanted you to join me
on this new earth.

216
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,026
But now i must bury you beneath it.

217
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,492
No!

218
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:35,762
There's too much kryptonite.

219
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,872
Heya, legs. Long time, no see.

220
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:12,098
And am i glad to see you
and your band of merrymen.

221
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,767
It's not my band.

222
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,022
- What?
- It's hers.

223
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,007
I didn't think i was ever
gonna see you again.

224
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,578
You almost didn't. Those crazy
space invaders almost killed us.

225
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,616
I guess we owe you guys our lives.

226
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:44,142
You always were a good shot.

227
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:46,943
I didn't do this to you.

228
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,587
I didn't.

229
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:51,224
I know.
I did this to myself.

230
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:56,106
It was a risk choosing zod
over my own people...

231
00:19:56,944 --> 00:19:59,378
but someone had to save the earth.

232
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,131
I couldn't give up on that.

233
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,107
I had the shot.

234
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,111
I had to take it.

235
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:33,239
Chloe kills me.

236
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,004
<i>I'm not sure
what you saw in there but out here,</i>

237
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,270
<i>you were still alive.</i>

238
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,824
So, i guess i did okay, right?

239
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:44,284
You did your job, mensa boy.
Now finish it.

240
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,842
I don't want lois waking up with
the memories that i just saw.

241
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,576
That would be too dangerous.
Use the device to wipe them out.

242
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:52,476
If i make a mistake,
she could come out of this catatonic.

243
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,594
Don't argue with me, stuart.

244
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,110
No.

245
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,988
Okay? I won't do it.
I won't.

246
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:16,659
- Excuse me?
- I'm gonna pull her out.

247
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:18,094
I'm sorry,

248
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:21,387
<i>but we are literally messing
with someone's mind here.</i>

249
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,536
I'm sorry, too.

250
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,773
Stuart went rogue.
He took her.

251
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,042
- I had to stop him.
- What'd you do to her?

252
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:56,999
We may have won the battle,

253
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:59,535
but zod will come back harder now.

254
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,436
Then it's time we take a stand.

255
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,640
Lois vanished a year ago after
she put on the legion ring.

256
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,621
You time-traveled here?

257
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:10,046
I'm pretty sure i didn't walk a whole
year into the future. Not in these heels

258
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,281
<i>The thing is, i lost the ring.</i>

259
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:14,684
That one-named wonder, zod, took it.

260
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,658
We need to get the ring back.

261
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:18,495
Then lois can return to the past

262
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,012
and prevent zod's tower from
being built in the first place.

263
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:23,458
<i>That's not a bad plan, clark,
but why should i trust you now?</i>

264
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,117
You already left us once
to fight on your own.

265
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:30,190
You abandoned us, big guy.
Plain and simple.

266
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,934
I thought i could stop zod myself.

267
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,028
<i>I tried to take him on
as my enemy, and i was wrong.</i>

268
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,999
<i>But i'm here now.</i>

269
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,597
Okay, then, look.

270
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,164
Why clark decided to take on
our enemy e. t.s by himself

271
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,014
is beyond me, and maybe you think
he abandoned the cause or something.

272
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,507
But come on,
aren't we all in this together?

273
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,152
You guys shut down that tower
and bring back the yellow sun,

274
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:52,743
you know i'm your best chance
of getting back that ring.

275
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:55,691
Maybe.

276
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,750
I still don't trust you.

277
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:01,997
I guess that's a start.

278
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,498
So, about the tower?

279
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:06,043
The towers are the key
to the kandorians' power.

280
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,244
They collect all the sun's
radiation, turn it red,

281
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,447
and then beam it back up
to the luthorcorp satellites.

282
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,675
Those satellites take the radiation and
they beam it back down to earth,

283
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,733
giving those alien s. o.b. s
all their superhuman strength.

284
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:19,548
<i>Now, we take the tower down,
we take them down.</i>

285
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:21,717
Guys, i've seen zod's troops.

286
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:24,086
We are seriously outnumbered.
We'd never reach it.

287
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,320
We don't have to.

288
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:27,589
We have a secret weapon.
Watchtower.

289
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:31,493
I powered down watchtower
so the kandorians couldn't find it

290
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:35,069
but i can use the computers to
hack into zod's big red flashlight

291
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:37,773
and unleash a virus that should
shut it off remotely.

292
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,330
You guys bring back the yellow sun,

293
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:42,444
and i'll take the others
to find the legion ring.

294
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,439
I just have one more question.

295
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,645
How does turning the sun yellow
make clark our number-one draft pick

296
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,583
for taking on this zod guy?

297
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:58,677
Zod and i have history.

298
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,066
You okay?

299
00:25:23,703 --> 00:25:25,442
Define "okay."

300
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:29,285
So far today,
i've traveled through time,

301
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,727
fought a flying alien,

302
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:34,329
and almost got my head chopped off.

303
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:41,812
But despite all those things...

304
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:45,191
one thing i can't believe...

305
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:50,147
i can't believe you and chloe
aren't friends anymore.

306
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:52,698
It's not her fault.

307
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:56,936
I turned my back on her.

308
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:03,297
After you disappeared, i couldn't...

309
00:26:04,744 --> 00:26:06,680
<i>i couldn't be around.</i>

310
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:10,644
Oliver or chloe, it reminded me of you,
and that hurt too much.

311
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:16,118
So...

312
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:18,057
i left...

313
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:23,110
and trained myself to fight zod.

314
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:30,671
What did you mean about
having a history with him?

315
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:36,209
Let's just say
that i made some mistakes.

316
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,545
Stop beating yourself up.

317
00:26:42,372 --> 00:26:44,450
You are not alone in this.

318
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:48,287
The truth is...

319
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,421
we could all die tomorrow.

320
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,072
I died when you left.

321
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:05,980
<i>I'm here now.</i>

322
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:44,210
I wish we had more time.

323
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,985
Clark, can you hear me?

324
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,304
Can you hear me, clark?

325
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:08,220
The ambulance will be here soon.

326
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:11,135
Stuart's lost a lot of blood,
but luckily he's still alive.

327
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,451
And i'm sure that mercer
"the merciless" will be fine.

328
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,032
How's clark?

329
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,312
Somehow this machine
synced their brainwaves.

330
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:19,358
Clark's literally
locked into lois' memories.

331
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:21,542
But i believe there's a way
that i can pull them out.

332
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,175
Don't close the curtain yet.

333
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,444
I took a peek into lois' therapy
files that tess hacked into.

334
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,419
I think that every time
that she saw her therapist,

335
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:32,150
it actually unlocked more of
her memories from the future.

336
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,461
These memories
are physically damaging.

337
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,563
You really want
to put their lives in danger?

338
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:38,447
If you pull clark out now,

339
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:41,010
it will put a lot of
other people's lives at stake.

340
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:44,721
When that assassin
from the future came back,

341
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,257
<i>she told clark that
he would destroy the world.</i>

342
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:50,958
Now, he has to know how to stop it.

343
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:17,797
Honey, i'm home.

344
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:24,062
Okay, remember when we were 10

345
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,337
and i kicked you out of
my clubhouse for spilling soda

346
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:28,434
and you said
you'd just build a cooler one?

347
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,873
You win.

348
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:46,363
So, this is what happens
when there's no blur.

349
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,818
That's why we need
every hero we can get.

350
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:54,088
For the woman who has everything.

351
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,549
It's a meteor-rock knife.
I've encased it in lead

352
00:29:57,674 --> 00:30:00,020
so the enemy won't know you're
packing till it's too late.

353
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:04,051
Even in the future, you still
know how to charm a girl.

354
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:07,857
The last firewall's down.
I'm in the zod tower's command center.

355
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:09,971
The virus is almost ready.

356
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:16,161
Take that, master control.

357
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,219
There. Just a few minutes,

358
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:23,994
we should see our yellow sun
rise and shine again.

359
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,052
Kandorians are coming.
We should go.

360
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:28,566
I'll scout ahead and make sure
the coast is clear.

361
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,856
Go. I'll be right behind you.

362
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:58,317
Come on!
You can make it!

363
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,703
No!

364
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,736
Get the hell away from her.

365
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:48,279
Look at me!

366
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:50,616
You're gonna be fine!
You're gonna be okay!

367
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,739
The best way to avenge her death
is to get that ring.

368
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:07,564
No.

369
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:10,081
No, i won't leave her.

370
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,593
She's still alive in the past, lois.

371
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:14,705
You can save her!

372
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,789
Make sure this future never
happens and you'll save all of us.

373
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:26,741
You better get going.

374
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,452
Clark's heading to the tower.

375
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:30,044
I'll cover you.

376
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:50,674
I should have guessed
you'd come after me.

377
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,011
All to save a doomed race.

378
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,779
When faced with a crumbling
world, these humans,

379
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:59,073
they'd rather die
than unite under a single leader

380
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:03,315
and do what's required
to build a glorious new world.

381
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:13,511
It's tragic. You thought you could
take me on like this.

382
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,802
Metropolis would not be destroyed

383
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:20,036
if you had all just
stopped fighting and joined me.

384
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,630
We'll never stop fighting, zod.

385
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:25,500
Humanity will never lose its spirit.

386
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:54,161
Goodbye, son of jor-el.

387
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,242
No.

388
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:31,031
Your reign of terror is over, zod.

389
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,270
I'm sending lois home to the past.

390
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,783
She can warn us about your tower
before it's ever built.

391
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:42,419
You chose to fight me.

392
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:45,440
You forced me to unleash my power!

393
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,959
We could have made this planet
a paradise!

394
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,460
It always was.

395
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,796
But you never gave humanity
a chance.

396
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,860
They've made you weak.

397
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:09,505
If she travels back in time,

398
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,482
then the lives we know
will cease to exist.

399
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:19,199
You have destroyed our world.

400
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:38,796
Take the ring, put it on.

401
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:41,144
- No.
- You have to. Now.

402
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:44,057
What if i never see you again?

403
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:47,836
You will.

404
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:22,420
- Welcome back.
- How's lois?

405
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:24,732
She'll be up in a few minutes
with a headache,

406
00:36:24,857 --> 00:36:26,985
but it's nothing that a couple
of aspirin can't handle.

407
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,053
I was able to isolate
the area of her cortex

408
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:31,406
where her synapses were firing
at an accelerated rate.

409
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:34,743
By injecting her with a chemical inhibitor
i effectively reset those synapses.

410
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:37,070
So her memories from the future
are gone, right?

411
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,463
If she had them while under the influence
of the machine she won't remember.

412
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:45,901
From the look on your face,
i take it the future isn't so bright.

413
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,079
What did you see, clark?

414
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,915
Here.
This is for you.

415
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,394
You just got back from a trip
to the hospital, not hawaii.

416
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,350
You need to take it slow.

417
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,932
I have hypoglycemia.

418
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:11,233
Not arthritis.

419
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,960
Doc says as long as i eat
every three hours, i'm gold.

420
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:17,282
- Happy?
- Very.

421
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:21,057
I almost lost you once.
I don't want it to happen again.

422
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,702
What are we doing?

423
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,458
I'm eating a maple doughnut.

424
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:38,264
And you're kind of invading
my personal space.

425
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,731
I mean us.

426
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,134
Lois and clark,
clark and lois, as a couple.

427
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,633
Cowboy!

428
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:47,737
You just went from 10 to,
like, 110 in 2 seconds flat.

429
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:49,765
Let's just slow it down.

430
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,602
I still need
to get my feet back under me.

431
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:55,869
You can lean on me for strength.

432
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,817
I feel stronger
when you're around, anyway.

433
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,697
<i>I have done this dating
thing wrong so many times.</i>

434
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:08,512
Then let's do it right.

435
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,772
Let's take our time.

436
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:14,379
Really?

437
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,132
In that case...

438
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:23,799
let's go get a real cup of coffee.

439
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,742
And then we'll have lunch ...
the first of many.

440
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:28,711
There will be ice cream
and chalupas,

441
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:31,285
picnics in the park,
dancing in the rain.

442
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:34,974
<i>And you will take me
to a monster-truck rally.</i>

443
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,568
For a guy who just got a mondo case
of kryptonite, you sure seem happy.

444
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,595
The sun is shining,
lois is gonna be all right.

445
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,913
She should be fine. Dr. Emil ran
every possible test on her,

446
00:39:04,038 --> 00:39:06,315
and she's healthy
and doesn't remember a thing.

447
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,762
Except, of course, the flowers
that clark sent to her hospital room,

448
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,932
but who could forget
five dozen roses?

449
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:14,466
Five dozen roses.
Wow. That's subtle.

450
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:18,167
I really don't get why
the two of you are grinning,

451
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,920
considering the fact that we're all
about to die terribly tragic deaths

452
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,846
in the not-so-distant future.

453
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:25,696
That's because if we do something in
the present, we can change all that.

454
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,637
I vote we take zod out right now.
That way, he doesn't have a chance

455
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:30,480
to take the sunshine
off our shoulders.

456
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,618
In the future that i saw,
i tried to fight zod.

457
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:34,656
All i did was turn him
into a more powerful enemy.

458
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,553
Just because you learned
a lesson in teamwork

459
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:38,474
doesn't mean
we have to stop fighting zod.

460
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:41,441
But going up against zod will only force
him to come back with everything he has.

461
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:43,462
what, you think you two
can just hug it out?

462
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,618
When my father said "save zod,"

463
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:48,334
what i think he meant
was save zod from himself.

464
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:50,792
Now if i can befriend him,
show him how good life can be here.

465
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,586
That would be a mistake.

466
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:56,499
If zod gets his solar towers online that
gives him all the power in the world

467
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:58,983
<i>and us none, including you.</i>

468
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:02,690
Zod will fly
psychopathic circles around you.

469
00:40:03,538 --> 00:40:06,285
I've seen what happens
when i treat zod like the enemy.

470
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,704
<i>This time, i'm gonna do things
the right way.</i>

471
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,208
This tower must be built...

472
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,149
<i>at all costs!</i>

473
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:19,874
You...

474
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,046
you find your way into city hall.

475
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,709
Smooth over any laws
that might get in our way.

476
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:29,522
You, infiltrate the power plant
to divert the energy we need.

477
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,681
And you...

478
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,910
i understand
you've been looking for me.

479
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:00,831
My brother and sister kandorians...

480
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:03,901
he has come.

481
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:10,316
Kneel... before kal-el.
