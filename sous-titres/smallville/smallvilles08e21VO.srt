1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,298
Previously on "Smallville"...

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:04,534
- How many times do I have to apologize?
- I don't want an apology!

3
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:08,701
- What the hell were you so afraid of?
- You.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,001
It'll be okay, Tommy. I promise.

5
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:14,137
How could you do this to me?!
Just stay away!

6
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:19,467
I want to introduce you to some people,
a sort of team.

7
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,655
We'll make a hero out of you yet.

8
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,134
Lex deserved to die, Chloe.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,815
This is murder.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,540
You know what I did was right.

11
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,624
You can't tell Clark.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,267
- I would do anything for you.
- Let's leave Smallville.

13
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:40,037
Where are you? Chloe!

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,811
I said "no."

15
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:53,828
We can't risk the casualties, okay?
You wait for the team to move in.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,934
Well, you seem to be
taking my open-door policy...

17
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,142
a little liberally
these days, don't you?

18
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,428
I guess I assumed after
you ambushed me in my barn...

19
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:11,267
and accused me of being an alien Jesus
that we had dropped any formalities.

20
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,601
You know, I can't say that the sarcasm
adds to your coy charm,

21
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,525
but, please, come in.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,332
Greasy kung pow for one?

23
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,340
I don't have much of an appetite.

24
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:27,564
Okay, then.
Tell me, what's on your mind, Clark?

25
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,734
Do you really think that spreading panic
is responsible journalism?

26
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,267
Making Davis Bloome front-page
news every day is reckless.

27
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,187
Reckless?

28
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:41,100
I think reckless is not
doing everything in your power...

29
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,405
to stop him.

30
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,234
Starting a massive manhunt
isn't helping anyone.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,895
Clark, if you don't want to admit
your true identity, that's fine.

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,900
But we both know that Davis Bloome...

33
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,155
isn't a man.

34
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,187
He's a beast.

35
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,237
If he is this beast,

36
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:04,287
then encouraging the police
to go after him is dangerous.

37
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:05,870
People will die.

38
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:10,228
And when that happens,
you'll know where to find him...

39
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:16,438
so that you can finally
slay the proverbial dragon.

40
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,302
This is not some fairy tale.

41
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,467
Obviously, there's some dark part
of you that needs to be saved,

42
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:25,868
but I am not your white knight.

43
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,834
You're risking innocent
lives, including Chloe's.

44
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:32,273
Oh, right,
the accomplice of the serial killer.

45
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:35,068
She's his hostage, and
she's in the most danger.

46
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,031
If you're so worried
about her getting hurt,

47
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,306
why are you fighting my help?

48
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,602
Maybe it's because you're
actually afraid to find Davis...

49
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,812
...because the pure
and virtuous Clark Kent...

50
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:55,834
can't face what he'll have to do...

51
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:00,434
what you are destined to do
when that moment comes.

52
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,554
Clark,

53
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,252
I'm just making sure
you embrace the inevitable.

54
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,049
Clark!

55
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:24,298
Clark!

56
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:27,084
please, help me!

57
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,009
Clark!

58
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,295
Clark!

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,100
- No!
- Chloe, it's me - Clark.

60
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:11,234
It's me. It's me. It's Clark.

61
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,868
- It's okay.
- Clark.

62
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,001
It's okay.

63
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,761
He's found her.

64
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:41,646
Now it's time we make our move.

65
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:51,045
"Somebody save me"

66
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:55,272
"Let your warm hands break right through me"

67
00:04:55,443 --> 00:05:00,478
"Somebody save me"

68
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,680
"I don't care how you do it"

69
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:10,699
"Just save me, save me"

70
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:12,346
"Come on"

71
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:16,322
"I've been waiting for you"

72
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:25,685
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

73
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:30,824
"Just save me, save me"

74
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,579
"Come on"

75
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,730
SMALLVILLE 8x21 "INJUSTICE"

76
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:44,134
We really should get you
to the hospital, Chloe.

77
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:55,900
I understand if you don't
want to talk about it.

78
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,867
He never left me alone.

79
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:14,401
There was this motel just outside
Metropolis that we found, and...

80
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,134
he wouldn't let me leave.

81
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,833
He...

82
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,857
I was so scared.

83
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,167
We just hid during the
day until dark, and then...

84
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:48,967
one day, he decided
that it was time to leave.

85
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:53,632
And so we stopped at this gas station.

86
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,967
And I just ran.

87
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,543
- You're safe now.
- No, Clark.

88
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:11,467
No.

89
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,301
He's still out there.

90
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,003
Anything that was good
in him is now gone.

91
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,349
No one's safe...

92
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:26,267
not till you destroy that beast.

93
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:44,218
I can't believe we lost
track of that thing.

94
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,699
If I had their powers, I
would have gotten the job done.

95
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,535
They're the ones that
screwed up, not us.

96
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,508
So quick to assign blame.

97
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,768
I taught you to take
care of one another.

98
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,768
You were trained as a team.
If one of you fails, then all of you fail.

99
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,808
What the hell is going on here?

100
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,489
Livewire and Neutron found the monster.

101
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:16,467
By the time Parasite and I showed up,
things had gotten messy.

102
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:20,291
She said Neutron zapped him with
some sort of radioactive blast.

103
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,367
Your mission...

104
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:25,301
was to find him and then wait
until I sent the traveler.

105
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,180
Is that all you can think about?!

106
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,234
- Neutron's dead!
- Hey!

107
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,701
- Back off.
- Tess was trying to keep us save.

108
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,134
It was you and Neutron
who didn't wait for backup.

109
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,934
That thing caught us tailing him,
and he attacked.

110
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,967
We didn't have a chance.

111
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:45,101
I am not gonna be the
opening act to this traveler...

112
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,978
when you won't even
clue us in to who it is.

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,145
I want out.

114
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,167
What - so you can go back to stealing
cars and running from the cops?

115
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,622
Tess turned your life around,

116
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,936
gave us a place where we belonged,

117
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,184
a chance to do something
good for the world.

118
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,482
We all suffered a loss here,

119
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:08,087
but we should learn a lesson from this.

120
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,994
We're only strong when we're together.

121
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,673
If we find that beast, you
will save so many lives.

122
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,685
You can't walk away from that.

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,467
Watch me.

124
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,174
Go find another sucker to be your hero.

125
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:45,100
Thanks for the power-up.

126
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,301
It's up to you two now to find him.

127
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:58,067
Don't worry.
We won't let you down.

128
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,934
So, what are you
gonna do with me now -

129
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,933
put me back in jail?

130
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,267
Cyborg, Impulse, and Canary
have a wide net out for Davis so far.

131
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,134
But they haven't caught anything.

132
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,567
How's Chloe?

133
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,867
Something happened.

134
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,533
I can't believe I put her
through something like this again.

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,601
First Brainiac and now Davis.

136
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,067
It's not even over yet.
He's still out there.

137
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:42,134
Yeah, well, something tells me
without his beauty to soothe the beast,

138
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,400
we don't have much time.

139
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,467
Davis may not be as
invincible as we thought.

140
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,154
There is something that might work...

141
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:55,196
but I can't do it alone.

142
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:59,067
Yeah, if it means getting rid of this guy
once and for all, just say the word. I'm in.

143
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:03,062
Good. Because we're gonna
need the help of Lex Luthor.

144
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,534
You know, Clark, last time I heard,

145
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,367
Lex Luthor was in no
condition to lend a hand.

146
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:13,533
When Lex was murdered, he left all
his Kryptonian research to Tess Mercer.

147
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,549
Meteor rocks, crystals, and artifacts-
she keeps them all in a safe.

148
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:20,598
I think she has something
that might work on Davis.

149
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,791
It's black kryptonite.

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,314
I need you to steal it.

151
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:32,067
Because if there's meteor rock
in there, it could kill you. I get it.

152
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,768
Well, it's been awhile, but I can probably
find my way into the Ice Queen's vault.

153
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,435
Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.

154
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:44,341
That's never gonna change.

155
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:55,101
Believe me, I know how difficult this is.
We're supposed to be the good guys.

156
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:59,167
But sometimes, we have to get our
hands dirty. Do what's necessary.

157
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,667
It's the only option.

158
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,601
We need to kill Davis Bloome.

159
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:36,659
What are you doing with the crystal?

160
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:41,210
Don't worry about it, okay?
I don't want you involved.

161
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,135
You've been through enough already.

162
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,467
Clark, I just survived a gothic romance
with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

163
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,301
I think I can handle
anything you throw at me.

164
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,940
I'm gonna save Davis.

165
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,619
What?

166
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:00,399
When did you plan on telling me this?

167
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,595
I wasn't gonna tell you
till after I took care of it.

168
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,200
Clark, you told me that
you sent Oliver on a mission...

169
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,834
to find your own brand
of Kryptonian hemlock.

170
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,101
I lied.

171
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:13,890
I don't know, Chloe.

172
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,767
It seems like in order to
do the right thing lately,

173
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,866
there has to be all these
lies and secrets attached.

174
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:20,685
I didn't even know if Oliver
would help me if I told him the truth.

175
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,552
Which is?

176
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:27,826
My parents once used black kryptonite
to split off my Kryptonian side.

177
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,332
I'm gonna separate Davis from the beast...

178
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,801
and use this crystal to send
Doomsday to the Phantom Zone.

179
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,801
Spare me the Kryptonian mumbo jumbo.

180
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,333
You have to bend the rules on this one.

181
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:44,402
When I took Davis to the fortress,
you stopped me from sending him away.

182
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,068
You knew he was worth saving.

183
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:49,434
- I was wrong.
- No, you weren't wrong, Chloe.

184
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:55,474
Look, I know what you've been through, but
there's still a side of Davis that's human.

185
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,808
So, then what if the plan fails?

186
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,075
It won't.

187
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:07,101
Sometimes, justice...

188
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:11,347
it's not about
making the easy decision.

189
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:14,767
Sometimes, it's about finding
that last bit of good in someone...

190
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,767
and saving them from themselves.

191
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,552
You taught me that.

192
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,843
What is it?

193
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,166
It's from Dr. Emil.

194
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,260
Doomsday struck again.

195
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,699
John Jones gave me the heads-up
when Granville police got the call.

196
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:55,168
He's stalling local authorities,
but we have to move fast.

197
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:58,193
Bone spur embedded six
inches into concrete?

198
00:14:58,328 --> 00:14:59,901
You're right.
Doomsday did make an appearance.

199
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,333
Yeah, and unfortunately,
he had an audience -

200
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,901
a man and a woman, both dead.

201
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,767
Clark, we have to stop him before
he kills more innocent people.

202
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:10,034
Well, maybe they weren't so innocent.
They were both meteor-infected.

203
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,233
And from the evidence we've gathered,
it looks like they were hunting him.

204
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,233
Great. Now that Tess made Davis
public enemy number one,

205
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,068
we have supercharged
bounty hunters on the case.

206
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,967
Who died doing what
they believed was right.

207
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,410
Maybe.

208
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,883
But I think something
else is going on here.

209
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:28,068
Two victims died from
very different causes.

210
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:49,778
She's been marked.

211
00:15:53,556 --> 00:15:56,467
You sure the beast killed her?
There's not a mark on her body.

212
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,167
It's because he didn't kill her.

213
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,300
This did.

214
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:05,525
It's a temporal-lobe implant...

215
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,956
GPS device that's also a small explosive.

216
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:11,767
I don't know what triggered it,
but when it went off, it killed her.

217
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,669
It was blown into her ear
canal where I found it.

218
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:17,783
So someone other than
Doomsday wanted her dead,

219
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:20,217
someone who was controlling her.

220
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,089
And monitoring her.

221
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:25,986
Chloe, are you okay?

222
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:29,236
Yeah, I think all the mayhem
is just a little more than I can handle.

223
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:32,282
- I'm gonna go outside for some fresh air.
- Look, Chloe...

224
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:35,901
Look, I don't like you going outside alone,
not when Doomsday could be so nearby.

225
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:40,817
Clark, it's just outside.
Trust me, if he comes back, I'll holler.

226
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,199
I know all that she's been through
must be taking its toll,

227
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:53,239
but I think something
else is going on with her.

228
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:54,959
Why would you say that?

229
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,610
Her feelings for Davis Bloome
may be stronger than she's telling you.

230
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:02,742
Last week,
she came to me, desperate to cure him.

231
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,548
She didn't tell me that.

232
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,828
Well, that's not surprising, Clark.

233
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:12,026
When it comes to affairs of the heart,

234
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,326
everyone uses secrets and lies
to protect the ones they love.

235
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,636
Bette, I think we
have a serious problem.

236
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,667
You guys were there.
You must have seen what happened.

237
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,546
It ticked me off that
she screwed up the job.

238
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:46,634
But all I did to Livewire
was hoover her powers.

239
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:50,168
Yeah, when we left,
miss scaredy-cat had all nine lives.

240
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,652
I know it wasn't us. That's the point.

241
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:56,734
There was an explosive microchip in
her brain that landed her in a body bag.

242
00:17:56,801 --> 00:18:00,367
Look, I'm sorry she's history.
What's it got to do with us?

243
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:01,734
We're wasting time.

244
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,801
We should be hunting down Godzilla
before he tears down Metropolis.

245
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,913
Don't you get it?
Tess put that thing in her head.

246
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,267
I'm starting to wonder if we
can believe anything she's said.

247
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,667
Look, Tess kept us out
of jail and Belle Reve.

248
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:17,767
She pays for our room, our ride,
and our three squares a day.

249
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,205
She gave me the home I never had,

250
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,367
and she did a lot more for you.

251
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,901
When everybody else turned
their backs on us, she was there.

252
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,056
I don't want to believe it, either.

253
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,267
But after all the tests and procedures
we had at Black Creek,

254
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,530
I mean, who's to say we're
not chipped right now?

255
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,801
Do you know how long it took
for Tess to put this team together?

256
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,767
Why would she ice one
of us in cold blood?

257
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:42,704
She's done us too many solids
to do something like that.

258
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,300
Somebody else pulled the
plug on Livewire, not Tess.

259
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:53,445
Come on, we're finishing this job,
just like we promised her.

260
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:06,034
Bette, I think we
have a serious problem.

261
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,682
Your secretary said you were out.

262
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:12,373
If your assignment was to
insult your new business partner,

263
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:14,030
you get an "A" plus.

264
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,538
And you flunked getting the hint.

265
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,901
I don't have time for
a wine tasting, Oliver.

266
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,842
Corporate titans need to
learn how to multitask, Tess.

267
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,468
It's all business.

268
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:29,649
That's not a quarterly earnings report.

269
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,945
You're always very perceptive.

270
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,275
You know, I like that in a woman.

271
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,802
It's a turn-on.

272
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:39,171
If I remember correctly,

273
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,480
when it comes to the opposite sex...

274
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,883
there's little that doesn't turn you on.

275
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:53,202
Actually, there's only been one
woman that ever had that effect.

276
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,157
Nice try.

277
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,319
I'm still busy.

278
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,767
Well, it's to celebrate the reopening
of the geothermal power station.

279
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,701
I don't think you're
understanding the significance.

280
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,275
No, I get the P.R. benefits.

281
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,306
But the eco-friendly little girl,

282
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,832
the one who wanted to grow up
and be a marine biologist...

283
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:15,326
surely, she's excited that we're
reducing our carbon footprint, right?

284
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:19,276
Well, thanks to all the men in my life,
that little girl grew up.

285
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:23,268
Now she only has time to worry about
things like investor satisfaction...

286
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:25,894
and balance sheets.

287
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:30,519
Well, I remember when the only sheets
that separated us were made of silk.

288
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,228
All you cared about
was saving the planet.

289
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:37,553
Oh, I still want to save the planet.

290
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:41,866
It's just some of the people
that I could do without.

291
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:52,474
Look, I have things to do, Oliver,

292
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,396
so...

293
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:58,819
Yeah, no, I'm sure you're busy.
So...

294
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,394
Boy, I got to tell you
that's a shame, you know?

295
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,500
It's a '64 Soleil.
It's from my private collection.

296
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:12,569
I was thinking we could just take the
afternoon off, and, uh, pop the cork.

297
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:18,882
Keep your cork... in your pants.

298
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:23,382
Your loss.

299
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:01,420
Chloe, why did you take off
without telling me...

300
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,254
and then not answer your
cellphone when I called?

301
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,692
And do you know I've been
searching everywhere for you?

302
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,545
Sorry, Clark.

303
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:13,554
Look, I've already got reasons
not to trust Oliver, but now you?

304
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:16,493
First, you want me to save Davis.
Now you're asking me to kill him.

305
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:18,601
So I need to know what's going on.

306
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,038
I know you're hiding something.

307
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:28,844
You're right, Clark. I've been lying
to you ever since I came back.

308
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,523
I know the girl who was killed.

309
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,845
Her name was Leslie Willis,
A.K.A. Livewire.

310
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,506
And I was using the Isis computers
to hack into Tess' mainframe, and...

311
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:42,305
I found all of this.

312
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,375
Together with the other inmates from
Black Creek, Leslie was part of a team...

313
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,679
assembled by Tess.

314
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,150
Eva Greer?

315
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:58,387
Tess' assistant is meteor-infected?

316
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:00,347
But Tess betrayed her.

317
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:03,146
It was all a deception that...

318
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:08,475
Chloe? Chloe!

319
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:11,918
Chloe!

320
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:14,077
What's happening?

321
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:17,435
Chloe, tell me what's happening.

322
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:22,573
Chloe!

323
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,588
Chloe...

324
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,168
Eva.

325
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:45,204
This means that Chloe is
still out there with Doomsday.

326
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:47,555
I can't believe I didn't
see through Eva's disguise.

327
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,815
Well, she was a shapeshifter, Clark.

328
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,036
It was her job to fool you.

329
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:54,805
She knew that by posing
as your best friend,

330
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,408
she'd catch you at your most vulnerable.

331
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,224
They've all been tagged.

332
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,835
As much as I hate what Eva
did, she didn't deserve this.

333
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,322
I know who killed her.

334
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,060
She told me she and the others
were all working for Tess.

335
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,514
Well, if Mercer has a
team looking for Doomsday,

336
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:18,513
then Chloe could get
caught in the cross fire.

337
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:20,404
I'm not gonna stand here
and wait to find out.

338
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,178
Tess Mercer needs to be stopped now.

339
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,728
Clark, in my experience with rats,

340
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:29,442
you never corner one,

341
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,830
not when they're this lethal.

342
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,798
She put kill switches in
both Eva and the other girl.

343
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:38,940
If the rest of her team is
wired and you confront her,

344
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:41,041
she could hit a remote
and kill them all.

345
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:44,524
You said these implants
were also GPS devices.

346
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,823
That means they work on a frequency.

347
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:49,278
Do you think you can isolate it?

348
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,799
I could piggyback on a
signal and locate the others.

349
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,409
Tess' people are hunting Doomsday.

350
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,372
If I can find them,

351
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,749
I can find Chloe.

352
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,378
Eva...

353
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:07,776
I've been searching downtown for hours.

354
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:11,188
Look, the beast is M.I.A.,
and so are you.

355
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,791
Look, I'm starting to lose it.

356
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:16,357
Call me back.

357
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,769
- Bette.
- Get away from me!

358
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:23,324
It's okay. I'm here to help.

359
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,501
Right.

360
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:27,821
Last time you helped, you gave
me a one-way ticket to Belle Reve.

361
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:30,283
I know that Tess Mercer got you out.

362
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,231
She promised to turn your life around,

363
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:35,012
but she's not the friend
that you think she is, Bette.

364
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,902
She killed Eva and livewire.

365
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,296
She died right in my arms, and I'm here
to make sure that doesn't happen to you.

366
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:43,707
You're lying.

367
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,574
How do you think I found you?

368
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,128
Look, Tess Mercer...

369
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:51,074
she put some sort of kill
switch in your temple.

370
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,881
- She's tracking you with it.
- No.

371
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:58,014
No, why would she do that?
She sent us out to find Chloe and Davis.

372
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,882
She said we were gonna be heroes.

373
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,192
You still can be.

374
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:05,793
But first, we need to
make sure that you're safe.

375
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:09,574
So tell me where everyone is, and
I'll take you to a doctor who can help.

376
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,027
Then we can find Chloe
and Davis together.

377
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:14,014
Not until that bitch is dead.

378
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,234
- I know how angry you are.
- You don't have a clue.

379
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,753
But Tess Mercer is gonna find out
how explosive my temper really is.

380
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:24,693
We're gonna turn her over to the
authorities. That's the right thing to do.

381
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:27,771
You can afford to do
the right thing, Clark.

382
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:31,752
Nobody can hurt you 'cause
you're some kind of superfreak.

383
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:36,458
Me- I want real justice, and
I'm gonna make sure I get it.

384
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:39,274
I won't let you do that.

385
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,249
You don't have the power to stop us.

386
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh, Dude...

387
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,700
I thought you were
just fast on your feet.

388
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:03,477
You're so much more.

389
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:05,962
Don't hurt him.

390
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:08,012
There's nothing he can do.

391
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:12,208
He's not in control... this time.

392
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:30,074
East corridor is secure.

393
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,263
Sweet dreams.

394
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:44,401
Plastique and parasite fell
off the grid 20 minutes ago.

395
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:49,401
Keep trying their cells. And come get
me the moment that you make contact.

396
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:51,351
Right.

397
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:06,317
No, please, don't stop getting
undressed on my account.

398
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,370
You really don't know the
meaning of boundaries, do you?

399
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:15,142
Well, I know you shot me down earlier,
but I'm always eager to try another flyby.

400
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:17,149
How did you even get past security?

401
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,671
Must have been sleeping on the job.

402
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,125
Oliver, I think it's
time for you to leave.

403
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,903
Really?

404
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,013
Okay.

405
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,036
Where the hell are your pants?

406
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,109
Yeah, yeah, I hid my pants,

407
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:45,721
like that time I hid your
clothes in Fiji in the cabana.

408
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,977
Remember that? That was a good time.

409
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:52,545
If I remember correctly, we spent
the rest of the vacation au naturel.

410
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:57,729
You can streak down memory
Lane all by yourself.

411
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:59,646
Those days are over for me.

412
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,096
Really?

413
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:05,634
Because I'm pretty sure I felt some of
the old chemistry earlier this afternoon.

414
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,900
Oh, there was tension. Mm-hmm.

415
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,104
But it wasn't sexual.

416
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,057
Well, I beg to differ, Tess, because
I've seen that look in your eyes before.

417
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:17,041
What do you say, hmm?

418
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,330
I'll fly you to places
you never knew existed.

419
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,570
You know, you might want to
cool your jets there, ace.

420
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,469
Maybe we should start over.

421
00:30:29,504 --> 00:30:31,523
It's too late for that now.

422
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,178
Thanks for the bolts you made me take from
livewire, I deep-fried your little chips.

423
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:50,134
We should have known you were only
pretending to be the good mother hen.

424
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,323
TERMINATION UNSUCCESSFUL

425
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:56,067
Looks like your freaks
have come home to roost.

426
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,451
Were you able to get through?

427
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,789
I tried calling the mansion,
but all the lines were down.

428
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,334
Someone's got to warn Tess.

429
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,567
I need to get to Smallville now.

430
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,600
Are you there yet?

431
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:16,215
I'm at the corner of Marshall
and Beaman. I don't see anything.

432
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,629
All right, turn north,
and walk about 30 feet.

433
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,967
It's not faster than a speeding bullet,
but it'll get you there pretty quick.

434
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,069
Are you in pain?

435
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,619
Think of how Livewire and Eva felt
when you popped their brains.

436
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:03,623
They betrayed us all.

437
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:06,322
You're the one who betrayed us.

438
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:09,007
Just tell me what you want.

439
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:18,031
First, you're gonna give us access
to the inmate files from Black Creek.

440
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:22,148
Then we're gonna reach out to everyone
that suffered your injustice...

441
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:24,100
and form our own league.

442
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,367
You may have recruited us,
but we're free agents now.

443
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:30,468
And with all that power,

444
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,492
no one will ever mess
with us ever again.

445
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:37,671
Cough up the password to those files.

446
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,065
I'm not about to let the world get
taken over by a bunch of freaks.

447
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,400
Well, this freak's gonna make you talk.

448
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,913
Get away from her.

449
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:59,033
Gutsy move coming in with no firepower.

450
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:02,447
You're better than this, Bette.
I know you are.

451
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,905
It's "Plastique" now.

452
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,226
And, no, I'm not.

453
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:18,327
If being better means letting people
like her get away with murder,

454
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,995
we'd rather be the bad guys.

455
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,824
Stop!

456
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,667
Let him go!

457
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:09,477
The pain is... killing me.

458
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:13,120
You can stop the pain.
Just give me my powers back.

459
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:05,634
You'll be happy to know
that our misguided teens

460
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,728
are locked in a secret rehabilitation
facility where escape's not an option...

461
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:12,893
and Tess won't be able to
get her hands on them again.

462
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,402
So we can focus on
finding Chloe and Davis.

463
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,493
Where's the kryptonite ring?

464
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:21,944
It's in a safe place.

465
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,956
You know something, Clark? You're lucky
I had that thing. It saved your life.

466
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,472
You know that ring can kill me.
Why would you make something like that?

467
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:33,400
I didn't make it.

468
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,680
I took the ring...

469
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:42,734
after I took Lex Luthor's life.

470
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,539
You're responsible for the explosion.

471
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:54,815
You know, Lex may have been your
friend a lifetime ago, Clark, but...

472
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,948
eventually, he would have killed you.
That meteor-rock ring is proof of that.

473
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,868
Why were you wearing it?

474
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:03,739
In case I don't agree with
the next murder you plan?

475
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:06,068
You know what? This is great.

476
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:08,029
Really, really great.

477
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,114
You don't have the guts to
take out that murdering bastard.

478
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:15,115
I come in, I mop up your mess, and what do
you do? You get all self-righteous on me.

479
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,321
We do what we have to do, Clark!

480
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,747
And deep down in your heart, you
know that that was my only choice

481
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:23,687
'cause you're gonna do the exact
same thing when you find Davis Bloome.

482
00:36:24,222 --> 00:36:28,300
And all I can do is hope that the guilt
doesn't weigh you down as much as it does me.

483
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,851
Thank you, Oliver.

484
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:33,400
But I'll take it from here.

485
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:37,263
All right, look, we don't see eye to eye
on everything. That's no secret, Clark.

486
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:39,302
We're still on the same side.

487
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:43,616
No, we're not.

488
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,501
I see.

489
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,615
You're not gonna use that
thing to kill him, are you?

490
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,430
I'm gonna use it to
split Davis from the beast...

491
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:57,016
and send Doomsday to
the Phantom Zone alone.

492
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,855
Well, I guess I wasn't the only one
hiding something, then.

493
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,857
I didn't have a choice, Oliver.

494
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:05,604
I had to tell you what you wanted to hear
so you'd get me the black kryptonite.

495
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:08,582
How many more lives are you
willing to sacrifice if your plan fails...

496
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,661
this time, Clark?!

497
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:14,904
Put your ego aside.

498
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:16,840
You have a responsibility.

499
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,826
My responsibility is to do what's right.

500
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,687
Like it or not, we stand for something.

501
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:24,672
We set an example for others to follow.

502
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:27,730
And if we don't, then we're no
better than the people we fight.

503
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,970
I'm not your enemy, Clark.

504
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,934
Then who are you?

505
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,434
You're looking for the crystal?

506
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,629
Let me guess,
Eva told you all about it.

507
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:14,268
You know, I thought I finally figured out
the whole Kal-El puzzle...

508
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:16,427
with the Veritas journal, but...

509
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:20,634
sending her in undercover did seem to
reveal a few missing Kryptonian pieces.

510
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,186
So, what did you do...

511
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:26,091
have one of your Black Creek inmates steal
the crystal before you had them murdered?

512
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,454
I had nothing to do
with their deaths, Clark.

513
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,046
Black Creek was Lex Luthor's project.

514
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,110
The chips were implanted there.

515
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,731
The technology was untested.
If it malfunctioned, you can't blame me.

516
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:40,890
I'm sure there's no way
to tie it back to you.

517
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,426
You've already had your
people cover your tracks.

518
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:46,527
Where is the crystal?

519
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,034
I had it destroyed...

520
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:57,074
so that you'd have no choice
but to kill the beast.

521
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:00,323
Sending him to some otherworldly
prison, that's not enough.

522
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,694
How many people like Plastique
have you sent to jail...

523
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:05,289
only to have them slip
through the system?

524
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,333
What if that happened again?

525
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:13,138
You can't tell me that no one's ever
escaped from this Phantom Zone.

526
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:16,072
This isn't your battle.

527
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,947
So you admit that it's yours.

528
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:23,618
Clark, don't you see that
I'm doing this all for you?

529
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,761
- For me?
- Yes.

530
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,716
You're so delusional, you
put together a small army

531
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:31,519
to make some fictional
prophesy come true.

532
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,968
Clark, the mark of a true hero...

533
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,568
is somebody who's willing to sacrifice
his own personal morality...

534
00:39:37,603 --> 00:39:39,507
to help keep the world safe.

535
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:42,413
No one has the right to
choose who lives and dies.

536
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,100
I was beginning to think that
you were different from Lex.

537
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:50,672
I was wrong.

538
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:55,183
The difference...

539
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,981
is that he turned his back on you.

540
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,342
But I still believe.

541
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:04,888
I understand...

542
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,304
that if everyone was more like you,
the world would be a better place.

543
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:14,000
But the truth is that
that's out of your hands now.

544
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:19,015
You can't avoid your fate.

545
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,902
Lex did teach me one thing.

546
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:26,883
The word "fate" is used by people
who've lost sight of who they are.

547
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:33,317
Why are you so determined
to see Davis Bloome die?

548
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,839
That's simple, Clark.

549
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:42,149
An entire civilization's
survival depends on it.

550
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:23,895
Is Kal-El ready to fulfill the prophecy?

551
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,386
I did as you asked.

552
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,825
The crystal has been destroyed.

553
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:45,415
Then you shall be the savior of Kandor.

554
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,600
