1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,990
I don't think this blind fold
thing's gonna work, jimmy.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,090
I know these hallsbetter than anyone.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,990
Hey, it's not my surpriseyou're spoiling.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,690
All right.But I can't get too far away.
I need to hear the phone.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,490
All right.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,090
I transferred your linein here.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,790
It's not your faultyou got stuck on duty
duringsenator burke's visit.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,590
But unless he makes
a pit stop to thepole-dancing parlor...

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,190
...Then we can stillmake it a date.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,990
Jimmy.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,290
Have I mentionedthat you are the best
boyfriend a girl could have?

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,690
Right back at you, sweetheart.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,790
I figuredyou could use an escape
from your real-lifesoap opera.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,090
What do you mean?

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,190
"THE BIG SLEEP"

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,890
Well, you live it every day,
but from the outside.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,090
Your life's got cagney and
stanwyck written all over it.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,990
You've gotyour billionaire mogul.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,190
You got the confused damsel
who chose money over love,

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,090
and a mysterious best friend
who shows up everywhere

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,990
because he can't seemto get a real job.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,290
Not to mention the steadfastdame
they all depend on.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,190
A real glimpseinto the mind of jimmy olsen.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,290
Not bad.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,390
Fyi -- "dame"?

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,790
Not so flattering.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,390
What's your name?

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,490
Riley. Doghouse riley.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,690
That's a funny kind of name.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,490
- Think so?
- Uh-huh.

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,890
What are you?

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,390
Prizefighter?

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,390
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's a shamus?

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,590
It's a private detective.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,590
You're making fun of me.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,890
They don't make themlike they used to.

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,890
Movies or people?

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,590
You're cute.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,690
Thank you.

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,690
No.

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,290
- That wasn't from
- the movie.

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,890
Jimmy!

No. Tell them we're on our way up.

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,290
Female, early 20s,
gunshot wound to the chest.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,790
She gonna be all right?

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,690
She's hurt pretty badly.Come on, clark.

50
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,290
I'm sorry, lana.

51
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,890
I'm sorry I got you
caught up in all this.

52
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,290
I'll find whoever did this.
I'll find them.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,590
lex

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,590
- Where is she?
- She is being medevacked to her

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,090
specialist in smallville.

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,290
She was with you at the opera.

57
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,590
Yeah.And you didn't show up.

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,090
So I dropped your wife at her car.

59
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,090
This was about an hour ago.

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,990
You better hope she's all right.

61
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,990
Now, I know someone as alert and amazing
at his job as you must be,

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,690
you must have some idea
what happened here.

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,490
Nice try, miss lane.

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,790
It's not gonna work.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,790
Well, a girl's got to try,right?

66
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,890
- Hey, phil, got a sec?
- Excuse me.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,790
Oh, man,I am such a klutz.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,390
I'm so sorry.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,590
So, the police think it was a mugging.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,790
A mugging?

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,790
Inside the building?

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,090
Now, normally, I'd be the first
person to cry "foul play,"

73
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,090
but she was downtown,
middle of the night,

74
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,390
fancy dress,stolen purse --

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,890
he probably jumped her before
she knew what was happening.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,290
Am I the only onethat thinks it's weird

77
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,290
that she was wining and dining
with daddy warbucks instead of lex?

78
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,490
Wait, whoever attacked heris
still out there.

79
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,290
Jimmy and I saw him flee,
and he did get away.

80
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,290
But the policewill run prints on the gun.

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,890
Which the muggerthoughtfully left behind.

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,290
What was lana doing here in the
middle of the night, anyways?

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,890
I should have beenwatching her.
Ever since she married lex,I've been so angry

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,790
tell me you arenot making this your fault.

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,690
I've always been there for heruntil now.

86
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,490
I got to find outwho did this.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,390
Well, the policearen't saying much.

88
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,390
But maybeyou'll have better luck.

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,490
Jimmy, I need you to download
the photo of lana's attacker.

90
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,990
I...

91
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,190
Don't even ask her.

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,190
She never remembanyway.

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,890
Just what did she forget about sean regan?

94
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,590
What did she tell you?

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,790
Not half as much as you just did.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,490
Take it easy.

97
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,690
I don't slap so good around
this time of the evening.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,190
***

99
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,790
Sleeping on the job
--what's the big idea?

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,790
I don't -- I can'T...

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,090
"I don't"?"I can't"?

102
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,890
What's gotten into you,jimmy olsen?

103
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,490
The whole town is hopping
with the senator's visit,

104
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,490
and you're on the first trainto dreamland.

105
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,990
Now, I didn't take a jobslinging
coffee for just anyone.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,490
I picked the best, I tell you.The best.

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,090
The daily planet's never seen
a reporter like you,

108
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,090
and I plan onkeeping it that way.

109
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,990
Miss sullivan,we haven't even met yet,
and already,I've ruined your blouse.

111
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,490
This is very...

112
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,790
clark kent.

113
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,490
With a "k," kent.

114
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,490
I'm clark kent.

115
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,990
Chloe sullivan,and it's quite all right.

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,990
What's with the glasses?

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,490
Special deliveryup in the mail room.

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,890
So, what, I'm supposedto answer
your phone, now, too?

119
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,090
Hello?

120
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,090
Olsen here.

121
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,790
I hear you're the best.

122
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,890
I want to report a murder.

123
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,990
Whose?

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,590
Mine.

125
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,690
I hope I didn'tkeep you waiting, mr. Olsen.

126
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,790
Well,how do you like that?

127
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,290
The untouchablelana luthor.

128
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,790
Seems a lot of peoplegot a lot
of ideas about me.

129
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,590
Listen, I don't know ifthis is
such a good idea.

130
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,790
Your old man's got to ownhalf
of metropolis,

131
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,790
not to mention a certainbuilding
at 1000 broadway.

132
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,290
Big globe on top.

133
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,690
This talkingcould lose me my job.

134
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,890
Better your jobthan my life.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,290
My husband'strying to kill me.

136
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,590
Now, why would you believea thing like that?

137
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,290
The other day, I was crossing
6th street when, out of nowhere,

138
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,990
this car veered right toward
meand sped away.

139
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,290
It was no accident, jimmy.

140
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,190
You don't mindif I call you "jimmy,"
do you?

141
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,190
Well, actually, it's james.

142
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,890
You're so confidentand so brave,
and I'm so afraid.

143
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,590
I wonder if you could sparea
bit of your strength for me.

144
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,890
Please?

145
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,890
I always knew somethingdidn't
sit right with luthor.

146
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,890
It's just a shamea girl like you
had to get caught upin this rotten business.

147
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,490
You have any proof?

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,090
I knewI could count on you.

149
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,690
My husband'sbeen sneaking out at night.

150
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,990
I found thisin his pocket.

151
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,890
the TALON

152
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,490
Consider it a thank-youfor your help.

153
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,590
I'm here to see a friend.

154
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,590
Ain't everyone?

155
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,190
Look, I don't want any trouble,honest.
I just --

156
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,290
The kid's with me.

157
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,190
Eyes back in your head,olsen.

158
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,590
I didn't peg you as the kind
of guy with a secret identity.

159
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,690
And you're never gonna.

160
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,890
Now, suppose you tell mewhat
story you're chasing.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,590
No story.Just...thirsty.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,890
Come on.

163
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,990
A guy like youwith a reputation to uphold?

164
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,890
You wouldn't be caught100 yards of this place
unless you weresitting on a big scoop.

165
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,490
Rye whiskey.

166
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,190
Rocks.

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,490
Put it on his tab, joe.

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,790
Name's kent.

169
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,490
You stroll in herewith this crackerjack kid.

170
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,690
You trying to land mein the cooler?

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,190
Cool your jets, mack.

172
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,190
Jimmy here is justa little down on love.

173
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,990
Ain't you, jimmy?

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,690
Poor sucker.

175
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,890
Dames is poison.

176
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,890
*Doo, do-do-do-do*

177
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,890
*I want somebody else*

178
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,990
*somebody who could be*

179
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,090
*someone not like yourself*

180
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,790
*but somebody who loves me*

181
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,890
*'cause I need somebody else*

182
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,590
if that's what you're after,get in line.

183
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,690
No, no, I'm just...

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,290
*all that I want to give*

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,690
*somebody who loves me*

186
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,090
- who's your new heavy?
- Ah, relax.

187
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,490
I got nothing on kent so farbut his tab.

188
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,890
Losing your grip, paps.

189
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,090
You used to run this town.

190
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,190
Now it looks likethe only shots you're
calling are from behind that bar.

191
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,990
*Like I know I deserve*

192
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,690
Which luthorare you after?

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,090
Better wipe that newsie smileoff your face.

194
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,990
- Luthor can smell fresh blooda mile away.
- Fresh?!

195
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,890
- Now,you listen here, kent.
- Relax.

196
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,590
I'm one of the good guys.

197
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,190
***

198
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,390
If it's young luthoryou're tailing,

199
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,590
I got a tip for you,on the house.

200
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,390
Every nighthe makes a big exit.

201
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,690
Makes surethe whole joint knows it.

202
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,890
But when his car pullsout of the alley...

203
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,190
...he's not in it.

204
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,190
*You know I'd walk right out the door*

205
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,890
*if I could onlyget the nerve*

206
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,290
*and I'd find*

207
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,990
*someone kind*

208
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,490
*like I know I deserve*

209
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,190
*somewhere there is a man*

210
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,490
*that could be loving me*

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,890
*somebody who loves me*

212
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,390
*somebody who loves me*

213
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,990
*Somebody who loves me*

214
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,090
Lex.

215
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,690
I can't take it anymore.

216
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,090
You're never gonnalet me in
on your real life.

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,990
Believe me, angel...

218
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,190
my wife will beout of the picture
soon enough.

219
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,390
You can't keep toyingwith a girl's
heart like this.

220
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,890
I got to know it's real.

221
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,590
Is this real?

222
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,190
Did anyone follow you?

223
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,290
No.

224
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,890
Lost him hours ago.

225
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,190
You shouldn't have come.

226
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,790
He could be homeany minute.

227
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,990
I can't bear thismuch longer.

228
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,590
Has it all beenin my head?

229
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,090
Have I been so lonely,

230
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,290
I've started making up storiesto
amuse myself?

231
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,390
I'm afraid not.

232
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,890
You're right about your husband
wanting to get rid of you,and soon.

233
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,390
If I run,he'll track me down.

234
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,790
And if I confront him,
he'll make itlook like an accident.

235
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,890
Don't worry.

236
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,990
I'll take care of lex.

237
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,390
Just to protect yourself.

238
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,690
Please.

239
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,690
I couldn't bear itif anything
happened to you.

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,890
Nice driving back there.

241
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,690
And don't worry.

242
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,590
Kept my word.

243
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,790
I'm here alone.

244
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,490
I'm afraid your word'snot worth much,luthor.

245
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,390
Doesn't matter.

246
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,890
By tomorrow, you'll be picking
lead out of your lungs.

247
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,090
Not unless you want thisto be
the next headline.

248
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,890
I'm guessingthis isn't about a raise.

249
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,790
It's about right and wrong.

250
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,190
What you do with the singer,
that's your business.

251
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,290
But I'm not aboutto let you
bump off your wife along the way.

252
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,090
***I heard you sayyou were
gonna get rid of her.

253
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,590
Sure, I am.

254
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,490
Once the divorce is final.

255
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,590
Filed for it today.

256
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,090
Came as a shockto your wife.

257
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,990
I doubt that.

258
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,090
Don't worry, jimmy.

259
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,490
You're not the first suckershe's
spun in a web.

260
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,690
But you better get outbefore you stick.

261
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,490
Gardenia.

262
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,890
Operator,get me junction 435.

263
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,090
Would I lie to you,louie?
It just came overthe wire. Okay.

264
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,390
Hey, what's allthe flurry about?

265
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,190
There's been a murder,
and they say the victimis lex luthor.

266
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,590
I am such a klutz.I'm so sorry.

267
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,490
Look, I'll cover youwhile you go clean up.

268
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,090
Mr. Lex luthordead on arrival.

269
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,690
A press passfrom the daily planet

270
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,990
was found on the site with a photo
of mr. Luthorand that singer.

271
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,990
Now, a suspect was seenfleeing
the scene of the crime.

272
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,090
Suspect -- 5'10".Brown hair,
brown overcoat,medium build.

273
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,390
Jimmy.

274
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,090
Last call.

275
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,490
Give me another.

276
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,990
No, make it a double.

277
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,290
Only one thingwill drive
a man to drink alone.

278
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,290
I wish it wereas simple as a dame.

279
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,090
Nothing simple about 'em,kid.

280
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,590
Guess that's what keeps
uscoming back for more, huh?

281
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,890
Jimmy, I've been to every ginjoint
in town looking for you.

282
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,190
You're not the only one.

283
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,190
I figured it would bethe last place you were,
but the first placeI'd find you.

284
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,790
They thinkyou shot lex luthor.

285
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,990
I shot him, all right.

286
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,090
Went down coldright in front of me.

287
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,990
Listen, I'm not gonnalet you
go down for this, jimmy.

288
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,790
Someone set you up, and I just
might know who did it.

289
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,990
That telephone lineyou have for mrs. Luthor?

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,390
Turns out, you weren't the onlyone
who's been dialing it.

291
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Seems that shiny new reporterclark kent's
been spinning those numbers

292
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,400
ever since he came into town.

293
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,490
What are you tryingto tell me?

294
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,590
Looks likethe boss' old lady

295
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,090
might be gettinga little more from kent
than just the headlines.

296
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,390
Yeah, it's me.

297
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,590
Listen, boy wondermay have taken the bait,
but he's on to you.

298
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,290
Doesn't matter anymore.

299
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,390
You're back on topof the lowlife food chain,

300
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,090
and I'm out from undera suffocating marriage.

301
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,390
There's somethingI have to take care of.

302
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,590
I thoughtthat's what I was here for.

303
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,590
Don't worry.

304
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,290
We won't have to sneak aroundmuch longer.

305
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,690
oaily planet building

306
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,090
guess you took me for a patsy,
didn't you, kent?

307
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,890
You played meright from the very start.

308
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,190
You saw your chanceto bump
off the old man,

309
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,390
let me take the fall for it,
and you get away with the girl.

310
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,990
But why'd you have to...

311
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,290
he didn'T.I did.

312
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,090
Well, aren't youfull of surprises?

313
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,790
I'm sorry I had to drag you
in to all this, james.

314
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,790
I really am.

315
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,890
They are gonnaput me away.

316
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,490
They won't get the chance.

317
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,790
Why'd you make me do it?

318
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,990
It was all for you.

319
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,090
Gardenia.

320
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,890
I should've known better.

321
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,690
Rule number one --

322
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,890
never get mixed upwith a girl.

323
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,690
Not when you're on the job.

324
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,590
On the job?

325
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,490
You're a cop?

326
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,890
Undercover unit.
I was sent hereto watch lex luthor.

327
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,290
Falling in love with his wife
--that was...

328
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,790
that was my mistake.

329
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,990
Those were some eyesthat she had.

330
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,890
Would have made any guywant to be a hero.

331
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,690
Yeah, well, those eyes
just got you the electric chair.

332
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,290
Someone should havetold you, kid.

333
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,490
There are no heroesin metropolis.

334
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,990
Jimmy?

335
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,690
Oh, my god.Are you all right?

336
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,890
Don't bother.

337
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,590
The picture of lana'strigger-
happy friend is gone.

338
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,490
- Gardenia.
- Okay.

339
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,390
It was right in front of methe whole time.
I didn't see it.

340
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,190
Uh, jimmy,remember me?
The one outsideyour head?

341
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,990
Lana didn't knowyou were
working last night.

342
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,390
What if she wasn't hereto see you?

343
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,890
What if she's not as innocent
as she looks?

344
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,090
Why would she cometo the cellar of wannabes in
the middle of the nightif it wasn't to visit us?

345
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,290
Look, I knowthat lana's your friend

346
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,590
and you don'twant to think of her as a
double-crossing,two-timing backstabber, but...

347
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,990
maybe she had something
she couldn't trust you with.

348
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,490
The cigarette caseis missing.

349
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,290
Think about it.

350
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,890
Lana doesn't smoke.
What would she be doing with it?

351
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,590
- What was inside?
- A cigarette case?

352
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,190
Maybe something big enough
to get killed over.

353
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,190
And she was taking it to someone
on the other floor when she was shot.

354
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,790
So what?She just staggered into
the elevator and ended up here?

355
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,490
You know,the elevator has a memory,

356
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,890
so its computer could tell us
what floor it was on last.

357
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,490
I was thinking more gossipcolumn
than political intrigue.

358
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,190
My god.

359
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,990
Lana, what have yougotten yourself into?

360
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,290
When did you learnto do that?

361
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,790
Some girlsgo for sports cars.
I figured you're moreof a lock-picking girl.

362
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,090
Well, accordingto the building's
exit records,

363
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,190
brennan was the only reporterleft
on this floor when lana was shot.

364
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,490
Bowling trophies don't exactly
scream "cold-blooded killer."

365
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,890
What the hellare you doing in here?

366
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,990
We have reason to believe that lana luthor
was with youearlier tonight.

367
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,790
Never met her.

368
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,690
Maybe you shot herand snagged her purse
to make it look likea petty robbery.

369
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,790
I'm calling security.

370
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,190
Great.

371
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,490
Then you can tell themhow you knocked
out jimmy and erased your photo.

372
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,490
The entire buildingwas sealed
off by police.

373
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,290
Only someone with prior accesscould
have done it.

374
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,590
Hey, look --

375
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,490
mrs. Luthor said she had a story
and wanted to meet.

376
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,890
She must have beengetting off the elevator
when someone intercepted her.

377
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,890
I-I heard the gunshot,
I saw the elevator going down.

378
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,390
So I took the stairs.

379
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,490
But when I got there,I heard you coming,

380
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,290
and I guess I just panicked.

381
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,490
I-I'm sorry about your head.

382
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,790
But -- but if the policehad
gotten your photo,

383
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,490
they neverwould have believed me.

384
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,390
What was shebringing to you?

385
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,990
All I know is she said sheneeded help,
and it had --

386
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,590
Call 911!

387
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,690
Calling...Clark

388
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,190
You didn't have to wait
till the last second, you know.

389
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,090
What fun would that be?

390
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,590
Chloe!Chloe!

391
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,190
Oh, my god, chloe!

392
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,290
Did you get him?

393
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,890
I knocked him out cold.

394
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,890
You don't have a scratch on you.
I don't understand it.How is that --

395
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,090
Busy day, ms. Lane?

396
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,690
Does breaking and entering
not mean anythingto rich people?

397
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,390
About as much as removing
evidence from a crime scene.

398
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,890
I caught your little maneuverat the planet.

399
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,090
So, it didn't surprise me that
a piece of evidencewas, uh...missing.

400
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,990
The silver cigarette case.

401
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,790
Really, mr. Luthor,

402
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,690
I was lucky to get a quote
from a parking attendant.

403
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,690
George?

404
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,390
Lillian loved this.

405
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,090
My wife.She was fond of gardenias.

406
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,090
But I think what you'relooking
for is inside.

407
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,490
You open this?

408
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,890
There was nothing on it.

409
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,890
Ares is supposed to be operational.

410
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,390
We're in the final stages of testing,
senator.

411
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,890
Well, after all my shuffling
to keep the appropriations under the radar,

412
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,190
I certainly hope so, lex.

413
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,890
We both have a lot to lose, senator.

414
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,290
You didn't know lex was working
with senator burke, did you?

415
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,190
You have got to give lanamajor props
for double-crossingboth luthors.

416
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,490
Be careful...miss lane.

417
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,490
Whoever's protectingsenator burke
hired someone to killthe wife of a luthor.

418
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,790
I doubt whether they'd
think twice about silencing you.

419
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,690
Close call.

420
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,290
Luckily,I don't remember much.

421
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,590
Let me fill you inon a few of the details.

422
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,790
Someone really didn't wantyou and brennan
to expose whateverwas in that cigarette case,

423
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,890
so they tried to kill youand succeeded with him.

424
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,090
Now, I know that lexwould never do anything
to hurtthe love of his life,

425
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,490
but who did?

426
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,690
Chloe, if I could tell you,I would.

427
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,890
It's complicated.

428
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,390
I'm a quick learner.

429
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,190
Lionel.

430
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,990
He's been forcing meto dig into lex
and turn over everythingto him.

431
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,590
Lionel has youspying on lex?

432
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,290
But instead of giving himthe
information you found,

433
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,490
you were gonna give itto the papers?

434
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,490
Why?

435
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,190
It was my only wayto get out
from under them.

436
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,690
I don't understand.

437
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,890
I mean, lionel hasa league of minions.
Why you?

438
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,290
He needed someoneon the inside.

439
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,990
Someone who could get closeto lex.

440
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,790
Holy...

441
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,590
lana, is that why youwent through
with the wedding?

442
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,990
Why would you do that?

443
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,090
To protect clark.

444
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,790
From what?

445
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,490
Clark can take careof himself.

446
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,590
What about his weakness?

447
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,490
Chloe, you admitted yourself
that he has one.

448
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,190
Whatever clarkis capable of,

449
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,190
there's something strongerthan him,
isn't there?

450
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,390
Lana, if you are keeping thisfrom clark
because you're tryingto protect him,

451
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,890
- he needs to know.
- He can'T.

452
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,790
Chloe, I know that youconfide
everything in him,

453
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,790
but I need you to trust me.

454
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,390
Clark's lifecould depend on it.

455
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,990
I've been all over town,

456
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,590
and all I can find outabout the guy
who attacked lana is that he's a hired gun.

457
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,090
Yeah,and now he's out of commission,
so it looks likewe hit a dead end.

458
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,290
That's it?

459
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,390
Someone out theretakes a hit out on lana,
and you're just gonna give up,just like that?

460
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,790
You're holding back somethingfrom me,
aren't you?

461
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,690
Chloe, I can't believeyou'd lie to me.

462
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,590
I can't believe you didn't hear the
deafening irony in that statement.

463
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,190
You know how much lanameans to me.

464
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,390
First, ouch.

465
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,090
Second, if youreally want to help,
just stay out of it,please.

466
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,990
I'm gonna findlana's attacker...

467
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,990
with or without you.

468
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,590
Clark, how long have youkept your
secret from lana

469
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,690
because you were tryingto protect her?

470
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,590
Are you trying to tell me that
lana's doing this to protect me?

471
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,690
All I'm sayingis that sometimes
people do thingsthat

472
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,090
you don't expect and you don't understand.

473
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,890
And sometimes they have
a really good reason for it.

474
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,190
As much as I want to believe
that that reason is lex...

475
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,590
we both know he'd neverdo anything
to hurt her.

476
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,590
Well,if it's not lex, then...

477
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,390
there's only one other person
who would manipulate herlike that.

478
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,890
Take itfrom the look on your face
the cops can't getlana's attacker to talk.

479
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,990
Didn't havemuch of a chance.

480
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,590
Guy got knocked off right after
he landed in county lockup.

481
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,190
Mr. Luthor,the gun at the crime scene
didn't belong to the assailant.

482
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,790
It's yours.

483
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,690
Mine?

484
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,490
Police never mentioned...

485
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,990
it's unregistered,

486
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,190
but I pulleda ballistics report.

487
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,290
It matches your gun,
the one that's been missing.

488
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,390
My guess is lana'sbeen carrying it,

489
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,790
pulled it on whoeverconfronted her,
and lost.

490
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,990
Lana's never carried a gun.

491
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,290
Who could she beso afraid of?

492
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,790
There's my hero.

493
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,390
Just my luck.

494
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,790
Finally get a photoon page one --
HERO AMONG US

495
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,190
I'm in front of the camera,not behind it.

496
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,090
Oh, come on.Even I was impressed with
the sam spade quick-thinking.

497
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,390
You can't tell me all that just
came from a bonkon the noggin.

498
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,390
You know, it was so weird.

499
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,490
Half of it made sense.But

500
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,990
lana and lionelworking together,

501
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,690
and clark kentleading a double life as a
reporter by dayand crime-fighter by night...

502
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,790
you know, it's funnywhat your mind will cook up.

503
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,290
So, why the pilgrimage to podunk
at the peak of your fame?

504
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,590
Well,I made you a playlist
to keep you companywhile I'm gone.

505
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,290
Gone?

506
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,090
I'm being senton assignment.

507
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,590
That's great.

508
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,790
Photo editor saw the paper --
finally knows my name now.

509
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,490
Are you on the human trafficking
story in istanbul with fletcher?

510
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,890
Actually,the polar bear swim club
in milwaukee, wisconsin.

511
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,090
Bunch of old guysin a lake, but --

512
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,790
it's a start.

513
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,790
I got to go catch my plane,
but there's somethingI got to do before I go.

514
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,090
*...Who loves me*

515
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,490
*'cause I need somebody else*

516
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,690
*somebody who loves me*

517
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,890
*somebody who loves me*
