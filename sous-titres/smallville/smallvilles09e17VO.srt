1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:02,086
Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:06,228
a Cybertronics,
self sustaining heart.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,274
The subject is prepped
for the upgrade.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,755
Okay, my blurry,
butt-kicking friend.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,940
You were right.

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,763
Tess of the uber-villains
is up to no good.

7
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,867
She is hoarding more
meteor rock here

8
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,059
than there probably is
in all of Smallville.

9
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,212
And something tells me the
reason is behind that curtain.

10
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:46,414
Hank?

11
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:49,507
I don't think so.

12
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,870
Tell that to the
bean counters in H.R.

13
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,783
They didn't want to chip in to buy
extra letters to spell "Henrietta."

14
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,617
How did she get in here?

15
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:00,643
Inform the boss
the upgrade has been compromised.

16
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,354
Get rid of her.

17
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,236
Get off of me!

18
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:12,745
Oh my god! He's gone.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,730
Lockdown! Now!

20
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:19,370
I need sector 3 and 4 lockdown
immediately. You, come with me.

21
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:33,904
Oh, God.

22
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:02,567
Smallville - 9x17 - Upgrade

23
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:05,512
Synchro: Flolo

00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:47,211
SeriesSub.com/Sous-Titres. Eu

25
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,711
How'd you get in here?

26
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:16,584
How did i get in here?

27
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:20,865
It must have been some night.

28
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,334
Yeah, I was chasing
down a red-hot lead and then

29
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,893
hit a dead end.

30
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,535
Lois, what happened to you?

31
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,512
You know, I was just...

32
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:36,947
I was trying too
hard to open up my...

33
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,415
"The Hangover" DVD,

34
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,578
with dad's swiss army knife.

35
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,564
He was sure I wouldn't
put it to good use.

36
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,723
Want to kiss it better, soldier?

37
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:48,102
What's going on?
You've been AWOL for over a week.

38
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,051
I know we agreed a little
mystery between us would be good,

39
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:52,754
but I'm worried about you.

40
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,541
Come on. I think it'd be a good idea if
there was nothing between us.

41
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,767
I think that can be arranged.

42
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:15,443
I'm sorry, Smallville.
It's Randall.

43
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,450
It could be the
story of the century.

44
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,718
I can't risk a potential "coulda,
shoulda, woulda."

45
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,306
It's okay. I wouldn't want you to
miss out on something big.

46
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:33,743
Really, really bad timing,
but I won't hold it against you.

47
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,026
Have you found the information
on Mercer I requested?

48
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:41,712
Yeah, she's running a secret
underground facility at 4th and Lincoln,

49
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:43,971
where she's testing some
red form of meteor rocks.

50
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:47,036
But score one for the "obvious" column.
I think that you already knew that,

51
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,057
since you saved me from
an early obituary, right?

52
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,372
Yeah.

53
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:55,002
What is she experimenting on?

54
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:58,442
You know what? Listen, if this isn't a
matter of life and death,

55
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,642
I really... I have to go.

56
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:57,721
I got to hand it to you,
bright eyes.

57
00:05:57,846 --> 00:06:00,887
You sure have a way
of finding trouble.

58
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,719
Said the man who swatted me
around like a tether ball

59
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:07,428
on our last arena challenge.

60
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:09,299
I just wanted to get you home.

61
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:11,735
I didn't mean for you to see me.

62
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,504
Wait. Get me home?

63
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,602
When I woke up on the lab table,
they had altered me.

64
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,466
And my mind my mind
is almost normal.

65
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:21,779
It is. It is.

66
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:25,649
Except for this.
This upgrade here.

67
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:28,122
- It's here. Look.
- Upgrade?

68
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:48,591
John, who did this to you?

69
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,911
Her scientists did.

70
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:54,936
I heard them saying something about

71
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,815
slamming a chip

72
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,335
in the back so they could control
everything that I do.

73
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:04,256
But then you...

74
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,967
you helped me escape before -
before they could.

75
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,648
John, what's happening?
John, look at me.

76
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:22,037
My heart is gonna stop

77
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,444
if I don't find a
meteor rock and refuel.

78
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,476
Thank you.

79
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,537
Okay. Vector 10 1/2 feet north.

80
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,672
Have I sunk Lois' battleship?

81
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,798
I can see 50
feet in every direction.

82
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:00,244
There's no reason why Lois
would be standing in this spot

83
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,938
for two hours last night.

84
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,847
Not that I want to wade

85
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,407
into the salty ocean of amour
that is Lois and Clark,

86
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,776
but if you two are playing "Mr.
& Mrs. Smith" now,

87
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,722
don't you think there might
be a sight trust issue?

88
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:13,915
I'm worried she's holding
something back from me

89
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,884
it's kind of different when the
control's on the other foot.

90
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:18,956
You know, Lois trusts you.

91
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,874
Now you need to trust her.

92
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:22,751
- I do.
- Right.

93
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,060
And that's why you had
me lojack her key chain?

94
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,576
I just checked the time code,
if we could rocket back a few hours,

95
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,600
you would be standing
on Lois' shoulders.

96
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,658
Clark Kent at the keyboard?

97
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,709
Have I been downsized in
the bureaucratic world of supeheroes?

98
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,892
I just got tired of waiting for you.

99
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,185
Snap.

100
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,235
Someone woke up on the
wrong side of the planet.

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,228
More like the wrong side of Lois. That
will never happen again. Check this out.

102
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,051
What exactly caught
your better-than-bionic eye this time?

103
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,192
It's Tess.

104
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,736
It was her underground lab
that Lois was snooping around in.

105
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,210
What's with the thermo-radioactive
scan of North America?

106
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:39,564
She's storing meteor
rock around the country.

107
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:41,555
She's gonna pay for it.

108
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,972
Clark, wait.

109
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,370
As much as I would love to
have Tess out of our lives,

110
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,229
you can't take her down for this.

111
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,763
You're connecting the
dots in the wrong order.

112
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,092
These deposits don't belong to Tess.

113
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,925
Tess is the only one who knows
what Kryptonite can do to me.

114
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,543
Except... for me...

115
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,342
and Oliver.

116
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,529
You and Oliver betrayed me.

117
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,418
It sounds worse than it actually.

118
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:19,117
You're stockpiling weapons around
the world that can kill me.

119
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,815
- Not you... Kryptonians.
- I'm Kryptonian!

120
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,861
The weapons are just insurance.

121
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:26,583
In case what?
In case I turned on you?

122
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:32,029
God, I was such a fool to think
that you could ever understand me.

123
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,742
You think you're better than Tess.

124
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,402
At least she didn't pretend
to be on my side all those years.

125
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,089
Clark, why don't you hear my side?

126
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,297
What if some day
there was ever a war?

127
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,747
There is a war, Chloe, right now.

128
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:47,086
And you're about to lose it.

129
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,330
Stay away.

130
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:14,255
Stay back, Lois.

131
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,893
Glad to see you're looking so good.

132
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,574
Thanks.

133
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:31,321
You look... pretty good, too.

134
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,169
I meant, you know, strong.

135
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:38,164
I mean... healthy, alive.

136
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:45,772
Maybe we should get
out of here before

137
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:48,869
The Blur decides to light this
place up like a Christmas tree.

138
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,886
The Blur did this to you?

139
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,368
Yeah, I don't know how he found me.

140
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,652
Maybe he wasn't here for you.

141
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:01,235
Maybe he was following
a well-meaning source.

142
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,832
And you did kind of go
"phantom of the boiler room"

143
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,079
last time you entered stage right.

144
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,947
Last time I checked,
this was private property.

145
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:34,122
Looks like Tess Mercer's skeleton is
finally crawling out of the closet.

146
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:40,005
Speaking of being hidden in the closet,
how's Oliver doing these days?

147
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,653
Don't worry your pretty
little head about that.

148
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,812
And by "head," I mean the one

149
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:49,259
that the secret government
agency Checkmate is wanting to lob off.

150
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,820
That must really suck to be
on the outs of your own walls.

151
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,146
I'm guessing you'd know.

152
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,231
Since you're not cuddling up to
your own cyberscreens,

153
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:03,894
I'm venturing that Clark has finally
uncovered your Kryptonite arsenal.

154
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,328
This is the last place I sent him.

155
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,226
I should have known Clark took
a walk down the ruby-red road.

156
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:26,098
That explains his
lack of "edit" button.

157
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,389
I thought Clark was only
affected by green meteor.

158
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:32,508
What's the red do?

159
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,733
Basically it turns him into
the bad boy every girl dreams of...

160
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,111
in her nightmares.

161
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,477
And why should I care?

162
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:43,490
Clark's made it clear that he's
not my knight in shining armor,

163
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,446
which is why I made my own
all-purpose bodyguard.

164
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:50,483
Believe it or not, Tess,
this isn't all about you.

165
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,930
Sooner or later, Clark will out himself
and your merry band of Kryptonians.

166
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,265
If the world gets wind
of their existence,

167
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,003
there's no turning back.

168
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,879
Right, but you can protect your alien
pet project if you help me find Clark.

169
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:29,111
"Irony...

170
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:33,204
The cleaning baptism
that redeems the soul."

171
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:38,468
Kierkegaard.

172
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,864
You have to enjoy the paradox.

173
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,296
The only thing on their planet
that can harm us is a piece of our own.

174
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,045
You lied about having powers.

175
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,548
How'd you get them?

176
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:04,762
From you.

177
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,761
From your blood.

178
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,965
When you saved me.

179
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:14,767
It's contradictory, isn't it?

180
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:18,157
But then again, you are the
greatest contradiction of all,

181
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:20,295
dedicating your life
to the greater good

182
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,208
and at the same time deceiving
those you love the most.

183
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,125
I'm the one who's been deceived.

184
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,756
Come, come, Kal-El.

185
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:32,092
You have become far too calculating

186
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,861
to play the naive farm boy anymore.

187
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:37,352
Your closest friends fear you

188
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,801
because they will never understand you.
And how could they?

189
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,750
You need me.

190
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,524
Who else in your world has
ever truly been your equal?

191
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,763
I have no equal.

192
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,883
You really can't see it, can you?

193
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,985
A modern-day messiah

194
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,997
whose symbol is worshiped by
the mere mortals at his feet,

195
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,883
a God who rips decisions
out of the hands of fate.

196
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:18,964
Now there is a real threat
out there to both of us.

197
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:22,163
And with your map of the
Kryptonite arsenals,

198
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:25,299
we can take out any defense
they have against us.

199
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:27,016
Nothing can stop us.

200
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:29,512
Now the question is...

201
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:32,392
Who will you join?

202
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,518
Your friends?

203
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,827
Your friends,
who have stockpiled weapons

204
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:46,493
around the world to kill you?

205
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:50,743
Or the one man who weighs
the same decisions,

206
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:53,286
struggles with the same dilemmas...

207
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:57,220
And who just saved your life?

208
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:33,382
I appreciate you trying to help,

209
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,475
but I've got it from here,
all right?

210
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:38,868
You get yourself into enough trouble
without me leading you to more.

211
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:43,393
I promised I'd get you to the
military base in South Dakota.

212
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:53,851
So, what are you,
my personal bodyguard?

213
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,083
My dad assured me Dr.
Vale is the best guy around.

214
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,153
So whether you like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

215
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,492
As nice as that sounds,

216
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:06,482
I could have Tess Mercer's
entire defense division

217
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:09,157
- descending on me at any minute.
- Exactly.

218
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,157
So when you're free and clear

219
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,334
and planting your homestead
spike in the badlands

220
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,448
then I'll send you the sayonara.

221
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,273
Let me help you with that.

222
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,350
That's so kind of you.

223
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,702
For someone so reticent
about joining forces,

224
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:03,831
you've certainly wasted no time in
destroying Chloe's Kryptonite stock hold.

225
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,861
I'm sure there's some quote
about betrayal stinging the most

226
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,814
when it's from someone you trust.

227
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,842
Your father could
have rattled it off.

228
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,845
- You remind me of him.
- Yeah. I'd rather not hear it.

229
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,214
I didn't get the chance
to know him like you did.

230
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,858
Don't get me wrong.
We used to fight...

231
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,750
until all hours of the night.

232
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,187
So, what? He was stubborn, like me?

233
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,642
Yeah.

234
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,132
But that never meant that
I didn't respect him.

235
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,167
You must have had a friend
that you had a connection with,

236
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:39,745
like you were opposite
sides of the same soul.

237
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,312
Yeah. Once. A long time ago.

238
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:46,862
You no longer have to be worried about
people envying you.

239
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,848
Or fearing you...

240
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,953
because you have a family now,
a family who understands.

241
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,007
Good.

242
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,217
Maybe it's time to live a little.

243
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:09,998
It's quite a view.

244
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,246
Everything seems so
clear from up here.

245
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm asking myself why it
took me so long to see it.

246
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:22,621
Sometimes it just takes somebody
to share your perspective.

247
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:28,247
If only your father could see us.

248
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:30,723
He can.

249
00:22:33,195 --> 00:22:35,686
How would you like to say hello
to your old friend Jor-El?

250
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:47,749
But first...

251
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:51,560
let's give the people of
Seattle a little surprise.

252
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:09,299
My ops found our soldier
of fortune on a bus.

253
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,656
Any luck with your problem child?

254
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:13,663
How often does it snow in Seattle?

255
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:16,818
Not a great time for a game
of Trivial Pursuit, Chloe.

256
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,741
No. Seriously, Tess.

257
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:22,369
Seattle just had a fluke snowstorm
with the temperature at 64 degrees.

258
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,882
I got it.
Thank God for blogging.

259
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,038
They saw something vaulting towards
the space needle six minutes ago.

260
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,009
Guess who's coming for dinner,
together...

261
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:52,881
with powers.

262
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,819
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

263
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:05,478
What I don't know is why
the sudden bromance.

264
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:37,836
Welcome home, brother.

265
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:00,221
He isn't exactly rolling out
the welcome mat, is he?

266
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:03,320
- Nothing's working...
- which figures.

267
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,056
As soon as I embrace my heritage,
you vanish.

268
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:09,533
Given what you told me about my role

269
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,873
in the last days of Krypton,
I'm not surprised.

270
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:14,867
He can't blame you for
something you haven't done yet.

271
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,955
It took you almost a
year to warm up to me.

272
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,916
I wouldn't expect my
discerning old friend

273
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:24,952
to give me any more latitude.
It's all right.

274
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,613
I've learned everything I
need from this thing anyway.

275
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:32,865
Don't be too quick to dismiss what
Jor-El has to offer you, Kal-El.

276
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,492
Trust me. I can live without constant
lectures and mind games.

277
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,664
How about the answers to
everything in the universe?

278
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,606
Give me a break.

279
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:47,061
I was a skeptic, too.

280
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:50,754
On Krypton, our children are raised

281
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:53,617
to revere the red sun God, Rao.

282
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:56,135
Unlike your civilizations,

283
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,891
superstition has no
place in our beliefs.

284
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:04,234
Religion is science,

285
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:08,973
not some... mystical
questioning of it.

286
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:14,759
Your father left our bible,
the book of Rao, on this Earth.

287
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,147
And what with all of this and
the knowledge in that book,

288
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,681
Kal-El, there is no limit
to what we can achieve.

289
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:41,130
I lost the GPS feed.

290
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:44,978
Where'd you send him?

291
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:49,128
On a hunch.

292
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,668
How not surprised am
I to see you here.

293
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:12,048
By the way, this is the
least-secret secret lab

294
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,986
I've ever been in...

295
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,111
Twice.

296
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,970
I am so sorry to
disappoint you, Lois.

297
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,802
But I doubt that the government

298
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:22,860
is going to want their
covert defense programs

299
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:25,648
on the front page of The
Daily Planet. So if you could just...

300
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:29,711
I saw what you did to Corben.

301
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:32,899
I was on the bus when you sent me
on a tranq trip to Mount Rushmore.

302
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:35,741
You can't cover this up, Tess.

303
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:43,452
Sorry, Lo.

304
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:50,303
You take care of her,

305
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,888
and I'll clean the rest of this up
to make sure that no one will believe

306
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:55,894
Lois' trip down the rabbit hole.

307
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:07,172
How did he get in here?

308
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:49,642
I sure do like what
you've done with the place.

309
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,660
And I thought I got a
chilly welcome.

310
00:30:18,354 --> 00:30:22,147
I don't blame you for frying me.

311
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:26,267
But someone who cares about
you sent me here to save you.

312
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,715
And I owe you one.

313
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,757
This is my lucky day to be saved.

314
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:41,126
Take it from someone
who's been there.

315
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:46,208
We don't always know
when we need saving.

316
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:28,010
You can thank me another time.

317
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,688
Zod.

318
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:12,214
God. Do you take lessons
in how to do that?

319
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:16,146
Isn't the appropriate response,
"thank God you're still alive.

320
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,689
Too bad you're wearing
clothes this time"?

321
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,759
Yes, that's it. The first part.

322
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,179
So, how did you get
away from Mercer?

323
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,025
It involved a secret cave,

324
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,748
action sequence out
of the Ice Capades and your best friend.

325
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:47,792
Maybe this makes up for everything.

326
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,140
Where'd you get that?

327
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:02,432
Souvenir from my own
little adventure.

328
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:09,176
The first time I saw you,

329
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,786
I never thought that you'd
end up being my hero.

330
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,232
Of course, I was hoping to escape
with a different heart.

331
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:19,896
You know, Lois,

332
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:23,327
you're the only one
that's been honest...

333
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:26,734
and loyal and brave.

334
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:31,550
That's a scary-high pedestal of
adjectives you just put me on.

335
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:35,079
You're the only one
that's given me a chance.

336
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:41,470
I mean, I can't ever
tell anyone else about me.

337
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:45,989
You're the only chance
that I have of living an honest.

338
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,972
Honest life.

339
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,820
If I were gonna disappear again,

340
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:59,644
I would want to disappear with you.

341
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,350
Me.

342
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:09,539
John, that means a lot.

343
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:14,675
But I'm with someone else.

344
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,318
It's a little on the squeaky side,

345
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:21,259
I probably won't pull back the curtain
and reveal our wild and crazy ride.

346
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:24,058
But...

347
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:27,599
he is it for me.

348
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:43,543
Sorry. I...

349
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:51,213
You have one of those words for now?

350
00:34:56,775 --> 00:35:00,764
Maybe if this were another lifetime

351
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:05,884
yeah.

352
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,047
You know, I really...

353
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:13,334
hope that your guy knows
who you really are.

354
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:16,257
'Cause you are a real...

355
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,481
dame, Lois lane.

356
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,082
You're not that naive, are you?

357
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:07,497
If Kal-El and I can work together,
why wouldn't I try

358
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,583
because he doesn't have your
best interests at heart.

359
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,474
But you and I, we have a
commitment to each other.

360
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:25,191
You're not backing out me, are you?

361
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:29,472
I'm not the one that sent
a modern-day metal Nero to attack you.

362
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:33,566
No.

363
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:37,013
Not today.

364
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:52,909
You can't bet everything
we've worked for,

365
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:55,380
including the safety of your people,

366
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,234
on someone who's so quick
to switch allegiances.

367
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,609
I don't think you have any idea of
the power that lies within Kal-El.

368
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:06,723
I hope you're right.

369
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:12,062
'Cause you're losing
control of the Kandorians.

370
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,416
I discovered a secret rebellion.

371
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:38,364
A group of your people
have turned against you

372
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,180
and are looking to a new leader.

373
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:12,361
I didn't think it would be a good idea
to get the handyman to repair this.

374
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,335
If I had an apology on video,

375
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,497
it would have saved me a
lot of time this year.

376
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:25,093
I'd say I did my fair
share of trespassing, as well.

377
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,347
You mean the part where you were amassing
the only weapons that can kill me?

378
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:31,184
Yeah, that would be the part.

379
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,549
Maybe you were the one seeing
things clearly from the beginning.

380
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,827
There's something I didn't
tell you about the future.

381
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,237
Your Kryptonite armory was
the only thing that saved the world.

382
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:50,913
And me teaming up with Zod,

383
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,448
turning my back on you and Oliver,
that wasn't all the red Kryptonite.

384
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,704
Curious.

385
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:01,129
I think it was some sort of
wish-fulfillment thing for me.

386
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:05,722
If you wanted to redecorate the place,
all you had to do was ask.

387
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:12,904
It's just that seeing you and Lois
together, you're like sisters.

388
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,477
The two of you have an
understanding of each other,

389
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:17,597
a shorthand that I've never known.

390
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,708
We're family.

391
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,217
Something I don't
have much of anymore.

392
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,893
I mean, Zod and I, we've...

393
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:30,290
we've been on different sides.

394
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:34,627
We were raised in different worlds.

395
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:40,794
But somehow, through the
isolation and the burdens,

396
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,799
losing our home, trying to
manage in somebody else's,

397
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,759
he understands things about
me that nobody else can.

398
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,966
Chloe, he's the closest
thing to a brother that I may ever know.

399
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:14,585
Some of our brothers and
sisters have defected.

400
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:19,124
And I'm afraid we've been betrayed.

401
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:22,963
But we will prevail.

402
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,680
The time has come to
share in your birthright.

403
