1
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,360
So, uh, we used to come to
places like this together?

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,900
I can't believe it's all blank.

3
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,130
It'll come back.

4
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:45,300
How about i rein you to your favorite bevvy?

5
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,953
Okay.

6
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:48,737
I'll be right back.

7
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:58,630
Excuse me. Excuse me.

8
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,206
Hey.

9
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,930
The promoter needs some gum,
and i'm fresh out.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,427
You got any?

11
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:12,492
Look around, einstein.
We're in a gum factory.

12
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,116
Right.

13
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,692
Let's hear some noise!

14
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:38,030
And here is one republic!

15
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:30,224
Hey, look out!

16
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,426
Hey, what happened?

17
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,360
Thanks.

18
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:27,360

21
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,057
Well, at least kara didn't forget
how to use up all the hot water.

22
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:22,533
Yes, but i understand that,

23
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,326
She still hasn't managed
to recover her memory.

24
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:31,127
She still thinks she's from minnesota.

25
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:35,300
But i think the more
she looks into her past...

26
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,406
She'll realize it's all a lie.

27
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,230
Do you think, if she was, uh,
taken to the fortress...

28
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,360
It might speed up the, uh, process?

29
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,461
Last time i went to jor-El for advice,
he kept me prisoner in the fortress.

30
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,146
I think it's time to tell her the truth.

31
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:55,204
She won't believe you.

32
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,357
Clark, we have to protect her.

33
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,568
I agree, especially when she's been...

34
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,960
Visiting...

35
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,530
With lex.

36
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:12,142
As much as i hate to admit it, it makes sense.

37
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,530
He found her. She trusts him.

38
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:19,842
Her bracelet.

39
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,477
That connects her to krypton.

40
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,088
Yes, but, uh, i thought it had gone missing.

41
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,130
It has, but there's got
to be some way to find it.

42
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,282
Oh... in the meantime,

43
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:36,366
I suggest you keep a sharp eye on lex's,

44
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,530
Latest endeavor.

45
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,995
Pete ross. What a surprise.

46
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,414
- Oh, my god, pete.
- Hey.

47
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,160
Pete, it's good to see you.
What are you doing here?

48
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,004
More importantly, what's he doing here?

49
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:02,112
I guess more has changed
around here than i thought.

50
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,899
It's a long story.

51
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:34,555
Lex?

52
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,495
I take it the fresh farm air isn't as
invigorating as it's cracked up to be.

53
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,800
I spend every day wandering
around that place,

54
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,860
Trying to find something
that will jog my memory.

55
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,060
Well... did anything stand out?

56
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,410
Anything out of the ordinary?

57
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,233
Actually, yeah.

58
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,698
Everything.

59
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,354
I don't feel connected to it at all.

60
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,030
But thanks for finding what you did.

61
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,617
I know it matches with the girl
formerly known as kara kent, but...

62
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,919
The girl in that folder isn't me.

63
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:19,795
How well do you know clark?

64
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,775
Do you trust him?

65
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,145
I wish i could say yes.

66
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,012
I'm starting to wonder if he's
hiding something from me.

67
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,516
Doesn't it seem weird that i don't have
any medical or dental records?

68
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:40,522
Who doesn't get sick?

69
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:43,597
Clark can be evasive.

70
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,230
Why would he lie to me?

71
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,128
I mean, what in my past could be so horrible
he wouldn't want me to know about it?

72
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,760
I promise you...

73
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,426
I will do everything in my power
to help you get your memory back.

74
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:03,499
Now, i don't suppose clark has mentioned
anything about your missing bracelet?

75
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,081
No.

76
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,225
Then i guess i should tell you.

77
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,079
The design on your bracelet is a symbol...

78
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,941
A symbol that matches others
that have appeared around smallville.

79
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:26,542
These were first seen as paintings
in the kawatchee caves.

80
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,593
But they've appeared much more recently...

81
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,430
Burned into the kent barn.

82
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,988
Whatever clark's hiding from you...

83
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,313
I think it has something
to do with these symbols.

84
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:47,335
That bracelet could be the clue
to uncovering your true identity.

85
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,030
Well, i'll see you this afternoon.

86
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,230
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

87
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,210
No, it's okay. Ben will
help me unload the posts.

88
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,160
So, the secret of the century
is not so secret anymore.

89
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,378
Lionel, chloe, and lana

90
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,030
All know the truth about your
extraterrestrial crash landing?

91
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,730
It all just kind of happened.

92
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,193
Well, the truth is, with all the danger
i put you in, knowing my secret,

93
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:44,043
I actually didn't want to tell anybody else, but...

94
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,958
But... let me guess.

95
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,766
You couldn't stop trying to save the world,
and you got caught.

96
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,365
Let's go.

97
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:02,226
Wonder what your dad would think about
a luthor hanging out in his kitchen.

98
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,360
2-1.

99
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,540
Since my dad's been gone...

100
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,830
Lionel's done a lot for me and my mom.

101
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,100
Oh, i'm sure he has. I mean,

102
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,537
He's done a lot for my family, too.

103
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:24,087
Took our factory, caused my parents' divorce.

104
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:25,965
The guy's a real saint.

105
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,730
That's the way it used to be.

106
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,800
I can't really expect you
to understand. I mean,

107
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,318
You have been gone for over three years.

108
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,764
What have you been doing?

109
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,340
We don't all land our dream career like chloe.

110
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:46,589
Kind of been doing the roadie gig.
Pays the bills.

111
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,909
Could of at least returned one of my calls.

112
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,930
You think it's easy saying goodbye
to your best friend?

113
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:58,917
I couldn't risk anyone using me
to get to the truth about your secret.

114
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:03,197
I figured it was better just leaving
it all in the past.

115
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:08,578
- I didn't ask you to do that, pete.
- I know,

116
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:12,329
But it doesn't change the fact that i've been
looking over my shoulder ever since.

117
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:18,184
I mean, i had to leave my life
behind because of you, clark.

118
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,367
And to be honest...

119
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,300
It was better than living in your shadow.

120
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,906
I didn't know.

121
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,687
Luckily, everything's changed.

122
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,788
I finally brought my game up
to your level, clark.

123
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,043
- What happened to you?
- Doesn't matter.

124
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,084
The other night, i saved this girl,

125
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:49,713
And i finally got a taste of what
it felt like to be you...

126
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,079
To be a hero.

127
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:58,675
Whatever it is, we need to
find a way to reverse it.

128
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:03,069
I should have known you
couldn't be happy for me.

129
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,293
- I want you to be careful.
- And what, hide like you?

130
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,900
This isn't you. It's the kryptonite.

131
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,960
You know what it does, it warps your reality.

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,178
The only thing warped is how many more
people's lives you're gonna ruin

133
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,260
By keeping your powers a secret.

134
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,907
I'm not gonna make anyone live
with that burden like you did.

135
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,865
Things change, clark.

136
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,900
Time to share the glory, and
if you try to stop me,

137
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,099
My secret isn't gonna be the only
one in danger of being exposed.

138
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,379
Well, who should i blame
for my server problems?

139
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,718
I've been locked out of my files.

140
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,253
Yes!

141
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,400
Thank you.

142
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,351
Open my e-Mail yet?

143
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,500
Sorry, jimmy, i've been in i.T.
Hell all morning.

144
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,817
Some network issue has got me
surfing the slow lane.

145
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,404
Okay. Here.

146
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,048
Pretty cool, huh?

147
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,878
Oh, my god.

148
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,860
I know, right?
This guy's elastic limbs

149
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,430
Are gonna slingshot his story straight
to the front page.

150
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,790
Jimmy, this guy is pete ross.
He was, like, my best friend in high school,

151
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,130
Like, back before clark.

152
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,929
You, uh, ditched him for clark?

153
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,160
No.

154
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,253
Uh, i mean, we were all friends.
We were all best friends.

155
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,531
Well, he is gonna be an overnight superstar.

156
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:45,302
I just got off the phone.
He's the first meteor freak.

157
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,960
Uh... biologically enhanced individual...

158
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,247
... who's willing to be
interviewed about his powers.

159
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:58,232
I just need to flesh this out a little.

160
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,806
- Interviewed? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

161
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,231
Imagine what a guy like pete could do for the
public perception of the meteor-Enhanced.

162
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:06,636
He's smart. He's funny.

163
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:10,167
The guy's story is beyond amazing, it's great.

164
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:13,860
Okay, so, he's a walking personal ad,

165
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,089
But, jimmy, as much as i appreciate
your socially conscious attitude adjustment,

166
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,600
The press would turn pete into a circus freak.

167
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,610
It's just an interview.

168
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,686
You know what? Maybe you're right.

169
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:33,621
Do you mind if i, um,

170
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:36,196
Add a little purple prose,
just to smooth out the rough edges?

171
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:40,199
Please sprinkle some of your hemingway dust.
Look, i'm off to the stride factory.

172
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,409
I'm gonna interview a few of elastic man's
comrades before they start the next gig.

173
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,830
Thank you.

174
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,060
Thank you. Thank you so much.

175
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,200
Hey, clark, uh, we've got a problem,

176
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,900
And it appears to be growing.

177
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,345
Chloe.

178
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:36,374
Glad to see someone's taking advantage
of my open-Door policy.

179
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,617
The i.T. Department told me
you've been monitoring

180
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:41,712
Everything that happens on
the daily planet computers.

181
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,587
Unauthorized surveillance is totally unethical.

182
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,060
Pretty big words from a cub reporter.

183
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,489
Shouldn't you be using them to write stories?

184
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,100
Good idea.

185
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,900
I think "office espionage"
has a nice ring to it.

186
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,777
Look...

187
00:16:56,886 --> 00:17:01,248
I'm new here, but i thought lois had first
stab at conspiracy theories.

188
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:04,900
You hacked into my computer
and copied my files, lex!

189
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,282
- I have rights!
- No. You don't have rights.

190
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:10,944
You have responsibilities.

191
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:14,164
Owning the daily planet means
everything within these walls,

192
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:17,154
And if you have a problem with the way
i run this paper, miss sullivan,

193
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:21,181
You're free to find out if the inquisitor
offers a more considerate environment!

194
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,257
You're excused.

195
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,999
- What time is the concert tonight?
- 8:00.

196
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,030
Thanks, bro. Keep livin'.

197
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:49,200
Hey, c.K.

198
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,400
Kara tell you about pete's
stretch save last night?

199
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,166
Snapped his arms out like silly
putty right in front of me.

200
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,700
Maybe you didn't see what you
thought you saw, jimmy.

201
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,199
What, you don't want to think that one of
your best friends could be a meteor freak?

202
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,980
Look, i just hate to think that you have
something against the meteor-Enhanced.

203
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,990
That's not it... i just don't want to see
anything happen to pete... that's all.

204
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,060
Like what, get the credit he deserves?

205
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,062
Pete ross is a hero. He saved kara's life.
And having the courage

206
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,287
To reveal that to the rest of the world...
that's a big deal.

207
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:18,432
I'm not sure the rest of the world
is gonna see it that way.

208
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:22,106
Why? The world needs a hero
now more than ever, clark.

209
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:29,300
Maybe meteor freaks can walk among
us without being afraid.

210
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,000
Wouldn't you want that if one was your friend?

211
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:17,331
I always knew the torch would light
the way to the big leagues.

212
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:20,975
Pete, hey! It's so good to see you!

213
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:25,659
Don't be too impressed, though. I just went
from being a big fish in a small pond

214
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,895
To a minnow in the atlantic.

215
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:30,530
Well, i, for one, have read all your stories.

216
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,999
And as much as some things change,
some things always remain the same.

217
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,060
I couldn't agree more.

218
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,627
I'm actually in the process of mopping up
lex luthor's daily carnage as we speak.

219
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,756
Now, there's a name i don't miss.

220
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:46,147
He's playing big brother on all of
the computers at the daily planet.

221
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:49,022
All my work is under his cyber lock and key.

222
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:52,258
Well, can't you just work some of your
virtual voodoo and get them back?

223
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:56,530
Short of a direct hit from a massive virus,

224
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,504
All of these files will forever be in
the clutches of citizen lex.

225
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:06,096
Maybe i can give him something
else to focus on.

226
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:15,063
Cool, huh?

227
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:17,354
A-Actually, yeah.

228
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:20,411
Uh, come here.

229
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:24,610
You don't want lex or anyone else
seeing that you can do that.

230
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,851
Come on, chloe, don't tell me that clark's
got you running scared

231
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,880
- Because of his secret, too?
- Okay, i know you don't mean that.

232
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:32,087
- Cause this isn't about clark.
- Isn't it?

233
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:36,262
I mean, i remember what it was
like, covering for him...

234
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:40,451
Always having to watch what
you had to say, lying...

235
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,858
To you.

236
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,199
Sometimes you don't have another choice.

237
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,801
Yes, you do.

238
00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:51,331
And for once, i'm glad not to be
following in clark's footsteps.

239
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,517
No secrets, chloe. Put it on the front page.

240
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,579
Okay, pete, i get the whole "reach
for the stars" mentality,

241
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,360
And right now you actually could reach
a few of those stars. But

242
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,932
What all about all the meteor-Infected people
who still appreciate their privacy?

243
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,010
If they want to keep living a lie,
that's their problem.

244
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:23,188
Maybe it's time for everyone to realize
that a real hero doesn't hide in the shadows.

245
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:25,109
Excuse me.

246
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,735
Are you looking for something?

247
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,928
Lana.

248
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,660
Um... yeah, i was...

249
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:56,888
Kara, i don't think that clark would
appreciate you going through his things.

250
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,830
What do you know about these symbols?

251
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:13,956
As much as anyone in smallville, i guess.

252
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,026
They're from a local indian tribe.

253
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:18,637
Then why were they on the
bracelet i used to wear?

254
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,059
Well, maybe you bought it
while you were here visiting the kents,

255
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,485
Or maybe they sent it to you as a present.

256
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,819
Know what's amazing?

257
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,430
How you and clark can just lie
on autopilot like that.

258
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,071
I know about the symbol's
burned into the barn...

259
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,887
And the fields.

260
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,460
And i know about this.

261
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,800
A tattoo you somehow don't have anymore.

262
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:54,766
Where did you get these?

263
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,231
Lex.

264
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:11,059
Lex has a way of being the hero

265
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,830
At the exact moment that you need to be saved.

266
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:17,328
I know how enticing that can be.

267
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:23,009
One day, he'll turn the tables,
and you'll realize that everything was a lie.

268
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:30,788
If you really want to prove that
lex is the one lying...

269
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,016
Then just tell me the truth.

270
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:36,924
It's obvious you're covering something.

271
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:40,830
Please, lana.

272
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,418
You know, you can keep
shoveling dirt over my past...

273
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,711
But eventually...

274
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,570
I'll uncover the truth.

275
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,977
Please... don't let me disturb you.

276
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,331
Quite the hero these days,
aren't you, pete?

277
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:11,264
Saving kara.

278
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:13,593
And now i gather you're
trying to impress chloe

279
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:17,079
By erasing any record of her
extracurricular projects.

280
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:19,913
I guess things never change.

281
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,030
You're living proof of that.

282
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,688
You know, we may have more
in common than you think.

283
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,460
We both had a friend who let us down,

284
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,130
And something tells me you know
what it's like to love a woman

285
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,400
Who's still infatuated with clark kent.

286
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,260
Maybe i was wrong.

287
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:39,932
Things do change.

288
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,676
You're even more messed up than before.

289
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:48,618
I thought an olive branch was
a pretty civilized response

290
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:50,800
To breaking and entering. But...

291
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,142
However you want to see it, one truth remains...

292
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,647
I control chloe's fate.

293
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,133
And if you really want to be her hero,

294
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:02,213
You're gonna put that amazing
ability to work for me.

295
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:06,550
Now... there's a certain bracelet

296
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:09,226
That i believe is locked in my father's vault.

297
00:26:10,143 --> 00:26:11,683
I want it.

298
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:13,477
I'm sure you do.

299
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,483
But chloe wouldn't want you
using her job to make me do anything.

300
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,816
I'm not talking about her job, pete.

301
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:26,237
I'm talking about the secret
she's been keeping.

302
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:31,400
Do you really want to be
the reason the world

303
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,456
Finds out that chloe's a meteor freak?

304
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,003
- Stride gum factory?
- It's been used as an underground venue

305
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,037
For bands until it was shut
down a few months ago.

306
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:49,415
It's already been closed?

307
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:52,222
Maybe next time they won't let
the flavor last quite so long.

308
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:54,468
I found the source of pete's powers.

309
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:57,501
Kryptonite-Enhanced gum.
I found a whole stockpile.

310
00:26:57,502 --> 00:27:00,445
Chewing gum? Is nothing sacred anymore?

311
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:03,492
I destroyed it, but we have to find pete.
His attitude is changing.

312
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:06,215
Ah, so, you got a whiff of pete
"the boss" ross, too, huh?

313
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:09,849
If he ingests any more kryptonite...
we both know what happens to people.

314
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,403
Present company on standby.
And since the "go-Go gadget" arms

315
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:16,159
Has been going public with his
abilities, he's got to be...

316
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:23,723
What's going on?

317
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,854
It looks like some kind of virus.

318
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,256
My computer's totally fried.

319
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:36,012
And judging from the collective sighs,
so is everybody else's.

320
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:44,162
Clark, i think our new hero went vigilante
and wiped out the planet's server to protect me.

321
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,430
Hey, guys!

322
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,300
Major scoop.

323
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,999
Pete's headed over to lionel luthor's office.

324
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,230
He's stealing something for lex.

325
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,208
Guess your world's only big enough for one hero.

326
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:43,649
This isn't the way to be a hero, pete.

327
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,213
The kryptonite is affecting your judgment.

328
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,266
Just tell me what lex has on you.
I'll take care of it.

329
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:52,001
By doing what?

330
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:56,282
I've only been back in town one day, and already
lex is squeezing me to get to your secret.

331
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:58,056
My secret?

332
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,710
Look familiar?

333
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
It always comes back to you.

334
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:09,400
Guess you didn't know your new
best friend had that?

335
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,267
- There must be a reason.
- His last name, clark.

336
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:21,630
Lionel, lex... they're the same person.

337
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,293
And they're not gonna stop using people
until they get to the truth about you.

338
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,959
Sorry, clark...

339
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:34,173
... but i don't have a choice.

340
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,024
Now, if i turn that bracelet over to lex,
he's gonna get one step closer to your secret.

341
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,992
The only way to stop all this
is to take lex out of the equation.

342
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,938
It's my turn to save you...

343
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,590
And everybody else from lex once and for all.

344
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,864
Pete... you're late.

345
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,360
You're right.

346
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,221
I should have done this three years ago.

347
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,257
How many more people are you gonna hurt?!

348
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:05,257
When is it gonna end?

349
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,873
Where's the bracelet, pete?

350
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,560
I never found it!

351
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,291
- I don't have it.
- Where is it?

352
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,500
I don't have it.

353
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,900
I don't have it.

354
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,660
You're starting to try my patience, pete.

355
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,056
Then bring it on...
cause the truth isn't gonna change.

356
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,642
Then maybe we can help.

357
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,530
What happened, clark?

358
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,963
You and i need to talk.

359
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:11,042
First, i need to stop pete from
making a huge mistake.

360
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:37,549
I don't like this any more
than you do, pete...

361
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,160
But i need that bracelet.

362
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,706
Now, this is the last time
i'm gonna ask you.

363
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,821
Where is it?

364
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:48,732
I don't have it! I already told
you i don't have it!

365
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,478
And i never did.

366
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,350
Okay.

367
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,227
You okay?

368
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,888
Yeah.

369
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,993
I guess the best part about
knowing your secret is...

370
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,423
Being able to say...

371
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,317
Thank you.

372
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,402
I got to admit...

373
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:55,460
One-On-One was a lot more
fun when i had powers.

374
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,546
Now i'm really at a disadvantage.

375
00:34:57,547 --> 00:34:59,050
Come on, pete.

376
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:01,889
Even without powers, you were
always at a disadvantage.

377
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,742
Let's just hope for a quick recovery.

378
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:09,467
Look, clark, um, i didn't really mean
what i said yesterday.

379
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,927
You're not the reason my life's
ended up the way it has.

380
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,789
I know the kryptonite

381
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,660
Can get you a little amped,
but you weren't wrong.

382
00:35:21,316 --> 00:35:24,123
Almost every day, i wonder what it would
be like not to have to live a lie,

383
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,800
But... you can't. I know.

384
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,651
I never really understood how
hard it was being you.

385
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,354
I was always a little jealous
of your life, and...

386
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,261
It was easier to blame you.

387
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:40,900
I'm sorry.

388
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,760
It's time for me to make a change.

389
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:52,815
I know there's a hero inside
me somewhere. I just...

390
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,038
I got to find another way to save the world.

391
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,130
Hey, chloe.

392
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,620
Hey.

393
00:36:08,621 --> 00:36:11,494
Is this the "barry bonds" pete
or the "hank aaron" pete?

394
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:14,377
This is a "100% pete ross" pete.

395
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,530
I just came by to apologize before i left.

396
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,812
Clark told me what you did.

397
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,800
Thank you.

398
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,825
You risked your life to protect me. Now,
that's not only webster's definition of "hero,"

399
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,403
It's mine, too. There's no apology needed.

400
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,100
Chloe, um, lex told me you had a power.

401
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:39,900
Y-You don't have to tell me what it is.

402
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,589
This...

403
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,830
Is for ruining your computer.

404
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,329
Pete...

405
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,349
Just promise me you won't let another
light-Year pass by before i see you again.

406
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,269
- You can count on it.
- Come here.

407
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,699
Hey!

408
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:06,430
Jimmy.

409
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:11,760
No hard feelings, man.
I-I decided to live my life in anonymity.

410
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:13,706
I understand.

411
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:16,895
- Some secrets are better kept.
- Yeah.

412
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:19,177
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

413
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:20,830
Pete!

414
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:23,139
Relax.

415
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,169
It's kryptonite-Free.

416
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,353
Bye.

417
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,762
So, you guys gonna be hanging out anytime soon?

418
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,359
I just mean, it looks like
gumby found his pokey.

419
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,209
- Unless you...
- You were right the first time.

420
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,457
- Pete and i are just friends.
- Cool.

421
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:46,934
Yeah, it's cool.

422
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:52,600
What about you?
How was date night with kara?

423
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,553
Uh, you know...

424
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,800
No, kara's great... but...

425
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:03,047
I think the spark kind of
fizzled for both of us.

426
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:07,113
Sorry.

427
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,100
No, you're not.

428
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,775
No, n-No, w-Wha... uh, what i meant
was that i... i hope that you're not.

429
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:21,053
I should have just said that i'm not, right?

430
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,112
Is there any...

431
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:34,392
Interest in seeing if we can breathe
some fire into this ember over a cup of coffee?

432
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:40,000
I'll bring the butane.

433
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,160
Mr. Luthor?

434
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,830
I checked with the metropolis observatory

435
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,560
About the constellation in your family crest.

436
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,304
The last time these stars were configured
in this exact arrangement

437
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:14,930
Was october 7, 1989.

438
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:18,730
The day of the first meteor shower.

439
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:21,550
And there's something else.

440
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,035
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.

441
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,541
I thought i made myself clear.

442
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,877
You're always welcome here.

443
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,778
I was hoping you'd say that.

444
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:54,014
I don't trust clark and lana anymore.

445
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:57,753
And the idea of living with them on the farm...

446
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,840
I hope you don't mind, lex, but i was
wondering if i could stay here...

447
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:05,955
With you.
