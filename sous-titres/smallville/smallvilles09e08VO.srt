1
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:34,143
I wish we had more time.

2
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,588
Earth to Lois.

3
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:27,261
It's like you've been on another
planet for the last 15 minutes.

4
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:32,096
Easy, Armstrong. This space
case is buried in research.

5
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:35,166
I've got like two weeks' worth
of work to catch up on.

6
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,504
It was a sort of last-minute
vacation, wasn't it?

7
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:43,374
Yeah, well, I've got a pretty
tightly wound bolt reflex.

8
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:47,411
Is this about what happened?

9
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,919
Are you turning red?

10
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:01,106
Believe it or not,
my ejector-seat malfunction...

11
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,311
wasn't totally about you.

12
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,030
We should talk about it.

13
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,531
When I want to talk about it,
I'll send up a smoke signal.

14
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,868
Excuse me?
Can you help me?

15
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,003
I need a signature.

16
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,738
I got a delivery out back,
and nobody's in yet.

17
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:26,844
Ho-ho-ho, merry Christmas to me.

18
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:31,122
- Want me to help you with this?
- No.

19
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,425
Did I ever tell you that before Christmas,
I used to unwrap all my presents...

20
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:37,128
and then re-wrap them while
my parents were still sleeping?

21
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:39,497
You know, Lois,
that doesn't surprise me at all.

22
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,274
- Just what I've always wanted.
- Is that...?

23
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:53,126
I don't think
it's powdered sugar, Smaville.

24
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:55,480
Lois Lane, Daily Planet.

25
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:57,655
Care to comment on what illegal
activities you've been up to...

26
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,642
that got you trussed up like a turkey?

27
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,378
I'm a cop!

28
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,550
We're all undercover cops!

29
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,844
Our sting went South.

30
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,626
Someone must have thought
you were the real dealers.

31
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:11,156
Who could be responsible
for such a super screw-up?

32
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:13,464
It's on the building!

33
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:24,008
Now, that's what I call a scoop.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,685
"Somebody save me"

35
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:38,857
"Let your warm hands break right through me"

36
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:43,738
"Somebody save me"

37
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:49,285
"I don't care how you do it"

38
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:54,248
"Just save me, save me"

39
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,960
"Come on"

40
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,963
"I've been waiting for you"

41
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:10,315
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

42
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:14,358
"Just save me, save me"

43
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:16,944
"Come on"

44
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,460
SMALLVILLE 9x08 "IDOL"
Subtitles subXpacio

45
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:24,563
First, The Blur doesn't call for weeks and
now he's overnighting our boys in blue?

46
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,392
Of course, he's probably
tailspinning into the stratosphere

47
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,461
because he doesn't have his
go-to girl to keep him grounded.

48
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,431
There's no way the botched save is
the work of The Blur. It's not his M. O.

49
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,700
I'll admit sugar-coating
isn't exactly his style,

50
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:36,169
but the 20-story calling card
was unmistakable.

51
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:40,068
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm
beginning to lose faith in our resident hero.

52
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,361
You're breaking
my heart, Lane.

53
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:44,545
I need a feature on The Blur's
questionable tactics by the end of the day.

54
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,446
You don't really think
this is big news, do you?

55
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,884
Turns out Adrian Pope,
the organized crime boss,

56
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,035
is still on the street
because of The Blur's blunder.

57
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,338
The D.A.'s out for blood.

58
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,021
When is the D.A. not out for blood?

59
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,442
He's just trying to cover up
his dirty connections.

60
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,592
Listen, I am not your Blur girl
on this one.

61
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,661
Just run with it.

62
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:05,999
Listen, just see this as an opportunity
to investigate both sides of the story.

63
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,465
Well, that would require a certain
super someone to actually find five minutes...

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,899
to give me a call.

65
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:15,107
What's with the disguise?

66
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,232
All my flannel's at the
dry cleaner's. Go figure.

67
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,579
- Lois -
- Ah.

68
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,013
Leave it alone, Inspector Gadget.

69
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,251
I have a top-secret interview I'm
doing For an exposé on the hush-hush.

70
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,554
So don't follow me.

71
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,896
Could you lose the notebook?

72
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:38,731
I'd prefer that all our meetings

73
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,008
remain off-the-record.

74
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,641
Whatever makes you feel
more comfortable, Lois.

75
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:55,971
Why don't you start by describing
these dreams you've been having?

76
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:03,042
Okay, well, they're as real
as you and me right now.

77
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,790
More real, actually.

78
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:08,794
And despite some flashes
of some serious NC-17 violence,

79
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,931
really, the situation
involves clothes...

80
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,533
coming off - you know, naked.

81
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,870
Skin, skin on skin, just -

82
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:21,007
Lots of skin.

83
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:26,110
So, it's a sex dream?

84
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,948
With the co-worker
you mentioned before?

85
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,080
Clark Kent?

86
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:33,138
What is this, "nightline"?

87
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:36,142
All right, yes, I'm doing the virtual
"Kama Sutra" with Clark Kent.

88
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:39,258
My desk is soft-core central.

89
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:43,496
Listen, Lois, you came to me
to explore the deeper meaning...

90
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:46,065
within these vivid dreams
that you've been having.

91
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,068
And all of this doesn't
have to be taken literally.

92
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:51,661
A lack of clothing
in a dream can signify...

93
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:54,940
the desire to uncover
what's actually hidden.

94
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,580
You know, sometimes I do feel
that Clark is hiding something.

95
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,562
It sounds crazy, but the closer
I get to him, the more...

96
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,590
I feel like he's going to disappear.

97
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:19,655
Could this have something to do with
your three weeks of blocked memory?

98
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,302
Maybe you're trying
to protect yourself, Lois.

99
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:26,739
Didn't you say that the last
time you opened up to someone -

100
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:30,109
Your mysterious caller -

101
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,311
He vanished?

102
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,614
"I need a hero"

103
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:39,819
"I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night"

104
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:44,357
Speak of the devil. The Halley's
Comet of phone dating himself.

105
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:51,163
Sayonara, super stud.

106
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,334
You still have strong feelings
for this mystery man.

107
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:59,105
Please. Remember 8-tracks
and rotary phones?

108
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,807
That's him - ancient history.

109
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,077
And the fact that you haven't
gotten that news flash...

110
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:08,214
means I'm probably wasting my time with
all this head-shrink mumbo-jumbo stuff.

111
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:14,299
Lois, you have projected so much
onto this mystery caller.

112
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:19,425
Maybe you should focus on the man
that's right in front of you.

113
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:26,462
I can't believe
she's not picking up.

114
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:29,468
You freeze the girl out, she's gonna
give you a cold shoulder, hero or not.

115
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:30,731
After what happened with Corben,

116
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,906
I stopped calling her as
The Blur for her own protection.

117
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:36,809
Sorry. This is a really bad time
for your P. R. queen to go M.I.A.

118
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:38,545
She's the only one who
can tell the world the truth.

119
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:41,438
Lois has to know The Blur is not
responsible for the failed drug bust...

120
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,290
or the crime boss getting away.

121
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:46,119
You know, Clark, you need to get to work
on some serious spin-doctor magic,

122
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,389
because whoever's posing as The Blur is
a genius at marketing and self-promotion.

123
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,896
He's co-opted your brand.

124
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:56,663
I'm not a brand.

125
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,567
The Blur has a blog.

126
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:03,769
And apparently, you're Twitter
and you're on facebook,

127
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:07,040
where you have 10,000 friends,
by the way.

128
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,075
You've come quite a long way since
being scarecrowed in high school.

129
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,880
Why would somebody go through
so much trouble to discredit me?

130
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:15,329
Now, here's the hitch.

131
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,316
I think he's actually trying
to help you.

132
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:23,656
I discovered five messy, but successful,
saves obviously not done by you.

133
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:27,026
Whether this person means well
or not, they need to be stopped...

134
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,725
before someone gets hurt.

135
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,078
Pull over by the power station.

136
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,418
Nice and easy.

137
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:52,305
These ladies and I
have a date with destiny.

138
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,931
Gun it!

139
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,434
Go!

140
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,281
- We did it.
- Did you see that guy's face?

141
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:54,380
- Pretty slick, Z.
- Way to go aggro, J.

142
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,182
Once the police see this,
they'll be off our backs...

143
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:57,946
for your genius cops-in-a-box idea.

144
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,985
Hey, they were undercover.

145
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:02,329
Think we should tie him up?

146
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,586
He's out cold.

147
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:07,259
- Let's just get some shots to upload.
- Okay.

148
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,101
What are you doing? You're in
the shot. This is our evidence.

149
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:15,388
Got to give props to the man.

150
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,609
Come on, Zan. Let's fly.

151
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,990
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

152
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:47,029
Two hours to get here
with the monorail down.

153
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:49,431
Chalk another one up
to the blundering Blur.

154
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:53,402
He may have stopped a diamond heist, but his
blackout belly flop has crippled Metropolis.

155
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,151
And the scavengers
have already started circling.

156
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,404
No City can function...

157
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,909
District attorney Ray Sacks,
my pet research project.

158
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:04,012
Since when is a veteran D. A.
Newsworthy?

159
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,516
Since his Christmas-card roster
reads like a soprano's hit list.

160
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,086
I call him "sacks-ophone" 'cause
he loves to blow his own horn!

161
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:13,055
Susan, I'm not here
because I'm running for mayor.

162
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,057
I'm here because I think
it's a travesty...

163
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,594
that this city has been brought
to its knees by The Blur.

164
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,265
Lois, I can't help but think there's more
to this story than people are seeing.

165
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,067
I think it's pretty obvious.

166
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,003
Either The Blur is hitting
a quarterlife crisis,

167
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,805
or his ego has gotten really supersized.

168
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:33,268
And you're sure he didn't try
to call you and explain himself?

169
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,046
He called.

170
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:39,548
I didn't pick up.

171
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:42,484
Since when did you become
The Blur's big defender?

172
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,621
He just doesn't deserve
the silent treatment...

173
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,790
just because he's been
out there saving people.

174
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:52,127
Of course you would say that, Clark.
You're a guy.

175
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:57,077
The Blur can't expect me to be his
beck-and-call girl after weeks of no contact.

176
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:04,121
I spy with my little eye
a potential witness.

177
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,635
I totally tanked this one.

178
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,703
Don't be so hard on yourself.

179
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,239
You're not the one
who lost her phone.

180
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:38,507
Are you sure you don't have it?

181
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,709
I must have dropped it
back at the power plant.

182
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:46,030
I know I sort of pulled you into this,
but maybe we're just not hero material.

183
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:55,724
- It's you, J.
- What?!

184
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,008
This can't be good.

185
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,390
What if someone's
already on to us?

186
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:02,082
What do we do?

187
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,396
Time to motor.

188
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,595
Powers, activate.

189
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,753
Whoa, what the...

190
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,877
Where are we?

191
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,540
How did we even get here?

192
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,967
It had to have been The Blur.

193
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,602
Come on, Z, there's no way.

194
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,305
Think about it.
Who else could have stopped us?

195
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:50,446
- This is The Blur's lair.
- He doesn't have a lair.

196
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:54,183
I'm telling you, this tech
is definitely off the grid.

197
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,952
Oh, wait until I tweet
everybody about this.

198
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,087
That's not gonna happen.

199
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:02,257
Welcome to watchtower.

200
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,494
And if you chat one word
about what you see and hear,

201
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:08,997
I will vaporize your twitter
accounts, facebook pages...

202
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:12,701
Every trace of your virtual
existence will be obliterated.

203
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:14,403
Holy hacking.

204
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,505
You can do that?

205
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,240
Our tweets are totally sealed.

206
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,509
Code of silence all the way.

207
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,344
So, who are you?

208
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,813
- It's The Blur's sidekick.
- We don't know that.

209
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,014
Not exactly.

210
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:28,784
I'm doing pro bono for The Blur
and keeping an eye on you two.

211
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,355
Wait, you're not gonna hand us
over to the cops, are you?

212
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:34,390
We just wanted to help
fuel The Blur's legend.

213
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:38,060
Okay, about the helping.
Right idea, wrong execution.

214
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,462
Look, I've been where
you guys are. I get it.

215
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,159
You're just a couple of mega fans
who really want to make a difference,

216
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:47,621
but you are single-handedly
destroying what The Blur stands for.

217
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:54,914
We know we made some mistakes.

218
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,679
How can we make up
for what we've done?

219
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,482
You just wait for the right moment.

220
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,857
You'll know.

221
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,954
So, The Blur trusts you, right?

222
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,359
I mean, how do you always
know the right thing to do?

223
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,294
You don't.

224
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,282
And neither does he.

225
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:19,235
But you stick around a hero long enough
and you get your share at saving him...

226
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:22,404
sometimes even from himself.

227
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,967
Oh, man!

228
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,813
I don't know how old-school
journalists broke a story...

229
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:41,170
without breaking somebody's neck.

230
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,697
I will never take you
for granted again, I swear.

231
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,834
"I need a hero"

232
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:57,506
"I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night"

233
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,277
I suppose you were the one
who gave us that little reboot.

234
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:05,414
In a way, the city
going dark was my fault.

235
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:08,483
The least I could do is put things right.

236
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:10,520
You know, just because you threw
a few switches doesn't make up...

237
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:12,387
for all your bonehead moves lately.

238
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:14,623
Lois...

239
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:16,992
I wasn't the one behind the saves.

240
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,564
The Blur has an imposter nipping at
his heels? How did you let that happen?

241
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,520
It's not that simple.

242
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,917
They were just misguided fans.

243
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,836
I'm not turning them over to the D. A.

244
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:30,906
Without proof, nobody's gonna
buy the misguided-fans angle.

245
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:34,109
You're risking a lot to protect
some feckless meteor freaks.

246
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,248
Maybe.

247
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:38,994
But doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance?

248
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,217
Oh, you want to go there?

249
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:44,519
Let me tell you about
second chances, buddy.

250
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:47,055
There's a way you treat a woman.
It's called respect.

251
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:48,591
So, how did you guys
end up on the street?

252
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:51,567
Oh, for a long time now,
we've only had each other.

253
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:54,463
Nobody really bought us as
transfer students from Sweden.

254
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,032
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That taps
into cell phone frequencies.

255
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,634
Just don't touch anything, okay?

256
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:01,935
Sorry.

257
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,341
So, just because you're some fancy hero...

258
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:06,308
Lois, I tried.

259
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,310
There is no try, Skywalker.

260
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,813
You have superpowers.
Why don't you pick up a phone?

261
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,881
Lois,

262
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:15,016
you're just gonna have to do something
you've had trouble with lately.

263
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,043
You're gonna have to trust me.

264
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,891
Smallville.

265
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,503
Last night was a whirlwind
of happy endings as Metropolis' Blur...

266
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:36,912
worked overtime to bring the city out
of the darkness and into the light.

267
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:40,537
Lois.

268
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,974
I didn't realize you were
filling in for the paper boy.

269
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:47,990
You look pretty chipper.
Busy night?

270
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,859
My story about The Blur
made it above the fold.

271
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,396
I think he'd be pretty happy that
I included his side of the story.

272
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,727
- So, you finally heard from him.
- Yeah.

273
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:02,405
Anyway, I've been thinking a lot
about my carbon footprint lately,

274
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:05,441
And I figured, you know,
we could start carpooling.

275
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:10,408
I thought, you know, the ride...

276
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:14,847
would give us a chance to get past
the whole kiss-and-run of it all, and...

277
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,431
get to know each other better.

278
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,354
Better?

279
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,425
You tell me the color of your underwear
every day. What else is there to know?

280
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:32,201
I hope you didn't misunderstand
all my Blur-bashing I did yesterday.

281
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,538
Deep down,
I never doubted him.

282
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,443
I'm sure he'd be happy to learn that
your faith in The Blur never wavered.

283
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:45,550
Of course, he never explained
why he didn't call me back.

284
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:50,051
Lois, what's going on?

285
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,191
Okay, look.

286
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,160
I woke up this morning...

287
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:03,187
and I saw things clearly
for the first time.

288
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:10,572
In breaking news, Metropolis'
D. A. has called out The Blur.

289
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,009
No one has the right to take
the law into their own hands.

290
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:17,779
Not you, not me,
not even The Blur.

291
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:23,046
Now, because of the damage he has
caused this city, am asking The Blur...

292
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:27,690
to come out of the shadows,
to stop this vigilante behavior...

293
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:33,028
and agree to work hand-in-hand
with our law enforcement.

294
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:37,654
Now, I will be holding a press
conference later this afternoon.

295
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:42,404
At that time, I will ask
The Blur to show himself...

296
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,741
and to take responsibility
for his actions.

297
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:50,991
Big news day.

298
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:53,171
I'll have to take a rain check
on the carpooling.

299
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,519
Okay.

300
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:00,716
Dr. Evans...

301
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:06,163
I'm going to save you
a lot of time and money, okay?

302
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:09,765
It's all your parents' fault.

303
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,540
Marjorie?

304
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:24,446
Oh, she had to take off.
Family issues.

305
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,452
Look, I know you think you're pretty
good at this head-shrinking stuff.

306
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:33,262
But thanks to you,
my head is about to explode,

307
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,714
and I don't know what to do.

308
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,007
I focused on the man
in my dreams,

309
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:43,498
And now I found out that my mystery
caller and Clark are the same person.

310
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,334
- The same?
- Unbelievable.

311
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:49,639
Up until today, he couldn't lie
his way out of a speeding ticket.

312
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:53,668
And - and now he can
hold down an alter ego?

313
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,831
Lois, take a step back.

314
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,713
What do you think is more likely -

315
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:01,333
That your mysterious caller
and Clark are the same man,

316
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:05,487
or that you're trying to make them one
person In order to create your dream man?

317
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,463
Okay, they're not that different.

318
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:19,268
My mystery caller is brave and selfless,
and so is Clark...

319
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:21,506
in his own way.

320
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:25,401
I can't believe how difficult this must
have been for him to carry his secret...

321
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,408
all this time.

322
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,360
I just want to tell him
that it doesn't matter to me.

323
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:42,085
But... maybe coming clean
isn't the best idea, either.

324
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,938
Right now, Clark has this
really big decision to make.

325
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:49,865
And more than anything,

326
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,268
I just want to help,
but I'm not sure how.

327
00:22:59,942 --> 00:23:01,524
Wait.

328
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,625
I know what I have to do.

329
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,463
Thanks, doc.

330
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:06,648
You're a gem.

331
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,984
There's got to be something
to this therapy stuff.

332
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,928
Clark, hey.

333
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,464
Don't worry- the twittering twosome
have sung their last song.

334
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:25,867
As we speak, they're in watchtower,
taking down The Blur's blog.

335
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:28,216
You seen today's news?

336
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:31,006
Don't tell me you're taking
that blowhard seriously, Clark.

337
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:33,942
You know he's just gunning
for the mayor's office.

338
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,928
You are, aren't you?
Clark, why?

339
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:40,443
The last time you had a coming-out
party, it was a disaster. What changed?

340
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:45,120
I've changed. I'm wearing
my father's shield now.

341
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,122
And I've worked hard to give
people a symbol of hope,

342
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,059
something that they can believe
in, that will inspire them.

343
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:52,713
I am the shield.

344
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,163
I know you want to honor
your father, Clark.

345
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:57,733
But if you sacrifice yourself,
there is no shield.

346
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,502
I won't just do nothing while the
D. A. drags down my father's crest...

347
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,837
and everything that it stands for.

348
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:04,228
That's exactly what you
have to do. I'm sorry.

349
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:07,275
Look, this guy's gonna call you
a menace and a coward,

350
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:09,278
and probably a threat to the city.

351
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:12,180
And you have to let people
believe his lies.

352
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:14,950
Your father lives on through you...

353
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:17,143
not your shield.

354
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:28,778
Ladies and gentlemen,
District Attorney Sacks.

355
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:36,888
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for joining me.

356
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:42,429
If you're out there, Blur... come.

357
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,281
Come join me at this very podium,

358
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:51,765
and take your place as a role model
in this great city of ours.

359
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:56,986
A true hero would not hide.

360
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:00,128
He would show himself...

361
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:03,999
And take responsibility
for mistakes he's made.

362
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:07,402
Out of my way! Excuse me!
Move it or lose it.

363
00:25:08,938 --> 00:25:11,001
Zip it, counselor.

364
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:17,646
I'm Lois Lane from the Daily Planet, and
I'm here to tell you that I know The Blur.

365
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:26,218
The D.A. says that a true hero
would come forward.

366
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,692
Well, The Blur can't.

367
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,962
It's because he knows that the best
way for him to protect you and me...

368
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:40,128
is to steer clear
of all this political hoopla...

369
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,924
and remain the one thing
that you and I need most.

370
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:50,116
A light in the darkness,

371
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:55,362
A symbol for us to believe in
when all other hope is lost.

372
00:25:57,385 --> 00:26:00,389
I've looked into The Blur's heart,

373
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:06,628
and I can tell you
that his intentions are good.

374
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:11,265
Let The Blur be the hero
he needs to be.

375
00:26:47,804 --> 00:26:51,321
When you said you had looked
into The Blur's heart,

376
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:55,271
I had no idea how close
a relationship you had.

377
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,580
Not that it's any of your business.

378
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:02,684
Oh, the safety of this city is
always my business, young lady.

379
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:07,222
Now, tell me
the true identity of The Blur,

380
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:09,891
and I'll overlook
your annoying antics.

381
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:12,848
You talk a good game, counselor.

382
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,786
But you don't believe a word of it.

383
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:21,094
All your shady back-room deals with
organized crime have just come home to roost.

384
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:24,658
I've picked out a nice little
font for my exposé.

385
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,909
"Shady Sacks sucks the city dry."

386
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:32,605
Well, well, well.

387
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,387
I actually had another headline in mind.

388
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:43,699
And you're standing right on top of it.

389
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:54,277
"The Blur murders Lois Lane."

390
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,759
Has a nice ring, doesn't it?

391
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:01,309
Nobody will ever believe you.

392
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:05,318
Honey, when The Blur
decided not to come forward,

393
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:07,953
he put the ball back in my court.

394
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:11,075
I can make him
whoever I want him to be.

395
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,548
It just takes a little doubt.

396
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:18,627
You don't give people enough credit.

397
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:21,853
Why would The Blur suddenly
turn into a murderer?

398
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:27,569
Because you just announced
in front of millions of people...

399
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:32,468
that you're the only person
who knows his true identity.

400
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:40,374
You're the one who's hiding in the
shadows, not The Blur, you coward!

401
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,172
Unfortunately, that's not a
story you're gonna get to write.

402
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,324
No!

403
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:51,593
All right, let's get out of here.

404
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,527
Hey Clark, you've got to see this!
Grab your camera!

405
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,399
Hurry!

406
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,221
I'll call you back.

407
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,090
Hey, there's a woman
hanging from the building!

408
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,107
Lois.

409
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:31,000
Lois?

410
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,520
Hold on, I'm coming.

411
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:45,993
- Lois?
- Clark!

412
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,391
Grab my hand.

413
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,066
I can't!

414
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:52,234
All right, hold on.

415
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:09,084
Come on, stretch.

416
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,652
You can reach!

417
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,855
It's too far!

418
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,192
- Oh!
- Lois!

419
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:39,994
Hey, J.
So, what's going on?

420
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,718
The Blur's in even deeper,
and it's all our fault.

421
00:30:42,786 --> 00:30:45,454
- Well, then what are we waiting for?
- We can't just ditch Chloe.

422
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:48,124
We promised her we'd lay low
till this all blows over.

423
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:50,693
She said sometimes
you need to save a hero,

424
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,887
even from himself.

425
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:57,268
Dad always used to say we're
stronger when we stick together.

426
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:03,606
Powers, activate.

427
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:08,902
Lois, hold on.

428
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:13,382
Let me go.

429
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,618
That's insane, Lois.

430
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,921
You can't reveal yourself
to the cameras.

431
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:22,158
You mean too much
to the city...

432
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:24,592
to the world.

433
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,997
Clark...

434
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:32,777
I know that you've been living two lives
and having to lie to me about it every day.

435
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:35,100
Lois, you're not making any sense.

436
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:43,171
It's gonna be okay.

437
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:44,883
Just hold on.

438
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:50,435
I've always known, deep down,
that you were a hero.

439
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,125
Lois!

440
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,612
All right, let's go.

441
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,034
Lois?

442
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,473
You're alive.

443
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,708
Thank you.

444
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,816
I'm flattered, Lois.

445
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:56,703
I wish I could have been
the one to rescue you,

446
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,588
but I'm not that fast.
I took the elevator.

447
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,727
Even after all this,
you still can't tell me.

448
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,542
Just stay here.

449
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:28,260
Next time you take on the D. A. of
Metropolis, remember to watch your step.

450
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,220
But that was just -

451
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:34,590
Hope I made up for not calling.

452
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,395
Lois, who was that?

453
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:44,733
The Blur.

454
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:51,591
Yeah, the D.A. is down!

455
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:54,990
- The Blur is back on top!
- This makes up for everything.

456
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:56,862
I have you to thank for that.

457
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,167
Oh, my god.

458
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:02,729
It's him.

459
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:07,734
I put my shield out there to inspire people
to step up and be their own heroes.

460
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,296
And you did.

461
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:12,874
We believe in you, master B.

462
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:18,170
Don't believe in me. Believe in
the shield and what it represents.

463
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:22,351
Most importantly,
believe in yourselves.

464
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:30,139
But... we're not the hero.
You are.

465
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,262
That depends on you.

466
00:34:33,497 --> 00:34:35,257
Metropolis doesn't need more Blur fans.

467
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,633
It needs people who are willing
to do Exactly what you did today.

468
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,768
But you do need to be more careful.

469
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:47,861
Heroes don't get second chances,
and people need you

470
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,363
to make life-and-death
decisions every day.

471
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:53,815
There's no room for mistakes.

472
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,000
Ever?

473
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:03,024
Not when the world is watching.

474
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:18,040
I am happy to see that you're alive, Lois.
After what I saw on the nightly news...

475
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,959
And I never would have guessed that your
mysterious caller was none other than...

476
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:26,047
Metropolis' famous Blur.

477
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:29,694
I can't believe I was so stupid.

478
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:33,913
I must have been crazy to look at
Clark through Blur-colored glasses.

479
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,158
Lois, you are not crazy.

480
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,692
That's the point of therapy -
to learn about yourself.

481
00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:42,870
But just looking
at the facts -

482
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,877
what's easier to believe?

483
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,977
That there was some phone glitch,

484
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:52,213
or that the farm guy who sits across
from me every day is a superpowered hero?

485
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:56,535
It's perfectly natural, Lois,

486
00:35:56,784 --> 00:36:00,782
to project the heroics of the
unattainable men you tend to fall for...

487
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,051
onto someone close to you.

488
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,001
But it would be so much easier
if they were the same person.

489
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:14,872
When I heard The Blur's voice again,
something stirred inside of me.

490
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:21,353
But my thoughts...

491
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:28,598
I keep going back to Clark.

492
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:37,835
That scared guy who stepped down
onto that ledge to save me.

493
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:47,897
Hey.

494
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:51,125
Cheers - for earning another strike today.

495
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,509
Where'd you get that?

496
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,003
The street vendor on the corner.

497
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,386
It also comes in t-shirts
and key chains.

498
00:36:57,621 --> 00:37:00,932
I had to be the first one on the
block to get the superhero swag.

499
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:05,288
Next thing you know, your wonder
twins will be a household name.

500
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,691
Thanks to the fog and dog duo,
Sacks is on his way to the slammer.

501
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,968
You know, with some training,

502
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:13,221
they may be able to give The Blur some
much-needed backup in the halls of justice.

503
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,816
I guess I have more backup
than I thought.

504
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:19,954
How'd you pull off the whole
Blur-impersonation thing?

505
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:22,086
Just your typical
sleight-of-the-ear stuff.

506
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:24,189
Now you hear it,
now you don't.

507
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:28,308
Hello, Lois.

508
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:31,395
Pay no attention to the blonde
behind the curtain.

509
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:35,226
Relax, Clark. I'm not exactly
the great and powerful Oz.

510
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:39,448
I just created a program where
everything I type in here comes out Blur.

511
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:41,917
How'd you know
when to make the call?

512
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,133
And how'd you know what to say
to convince Lois?

513
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:48,626
I hacked into the security
cameras on the rooftop,

514
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:51,526
And I've been monitoring all cell
communication in Metropolis.

515
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:55,263
You've been eavesdropping on my
personal calls with Lois, haven't you?

516
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:57,822
Chloe, there's keeping
a bird's-eye view,

517
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:00,001
and then there's playing Big Brother
with people's private lives.

518
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,305
Easy on the dress-down, Clark, okay?

519
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:07,862
If I hadn't stepped in, Lois would still be
beating down the "Clark is a superhero" door,

520
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:09,684
and believe me,

521
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,222
Once the bloodhound Lois
is at your door,

522
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,828
you'd better find a better way
to disguise your superhero scent.

523
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,509
Your eyes still closed?

524
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:33,120
This isn't what I had in mind when you
said you wanted to meet in the copy room,

525
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,303
but, hey, I'm open.

526
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:38,690
You said I had a secret.
You're right.

527
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:40,742
I was dangling 100 stories
above the pavement.

528
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,011
I think I get a free pass on that one.

529
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:47,075
Let's see what you've got.

530
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:53,454
I'm a bit nearsighted.

531
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:57,614
I've been trying
not to wear them.

532
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:01,914
They're very...

533
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:11,665
Clark Kent.

534
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:16,739
I guess you're not the only one
who's a little shortsighted.

535
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:21,578
It's just sometimes I feel like I see a
whole other side of you than anyone else.

536
00:39:21,713 --> 00:39:23,618
- Lois?
- It's okay.

537
00:39:23,686 --> 00:39:27,149
It's my hero complex to resolve.

538
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:31,860
I take the nicest guy that I know, and I
weigh him down with all this shining armor.

539
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,154
And it's not fair.

540
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:36,474
Nobody can be two different people.

541
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,263
I wish I could.

542
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:46,094
Is this your long-winded way
of saying that you hate these?

543
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,102
Personally...

544
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,639
I don't mind the bump
in your geek factor.

545
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,931
But, professionally,

546
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,976
there are these newfangled
things you can try.

547
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:03,291
They're called contacts.

548
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,863
It means a lot that you thought
I had it in me.

549
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,736
Don't worry, Smaville.

550
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,896
I'll only call you four-eyes
every once in a while.

551
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,220
But just so you're clear
on one thing.

552
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,557
Lois?

553
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,903
Lois!

554
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:16,143
