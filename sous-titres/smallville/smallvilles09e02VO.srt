1
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:04,753
Clark?

2
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:06,555
Anyone home, sweet home?

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,961
Guess not.

4
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:21,170
Mrs. K wouldn't approve.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,281
Shelby!

6
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,216
Hey.

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,753
Don't tell me Clark's ditched you, too, hmm?

8
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,288
I know.

9
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,824
Smallville isn't the same
without Smallville, is it?

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,932
So, if he's still on his whirlwind walkabout,

11
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,834
who's been feeding you, huh?

12
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,177
Hey, beautiful.

13
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:03,545
Are you still at the office?

14
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:04,847
No, no.

15
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:07,349
Sitting behind a desk just isn't the same

16
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,852
without those pretty brown eyes of yours... 

17
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,720
I don't know... glaring at me.

18
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:13,455
Since you didn't want to grab dinner tonight,

19
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:16,225
I spent the time... searching out news.

20
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:19,428
And you'll never guess what I found.

21
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,830
If I do, will you take me off your speed dial?

22
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,132
Very funny.

23
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,234
Your favorite freak's been at it again,

24
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,035
and this time, the story's mine.

25
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,303
Take it, sticky fingers.

26
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,972
There are plenty of headlines to go around.

27
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,907
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:36,178
Never thought you'd be willing
to share the Blur, Lois.

29
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:38,480
We should celebrate... over coffee.

30
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:40,048
Your place or mine?

31
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,250
Or neither.

32
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:44,052
Besides, I'm not exactly being generous.

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,088
You know, the Blur catches
more bad guys before breakfast

34
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,556
than most cops do in a day.

35
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,691
Hell, that's the problem. He's not a cop.

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,194
He's a vigilante... with superpowers

37
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:55,330
and a thing for the letter "S."

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,734
Well, then, he's done a super job

39
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,569
cleaning up Metropolis.

40
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,938
Thanks to him, the city can sleep at night.

41
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,239
What if he screws up?

42
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:06,108
How do you hold him accountable?

43
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:07,810
No one's even seen his face.

44
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,179
John, after everything
the Blur's done for the world,

45
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,046
how can you be such a cynic?

46
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:12,347
Well, apparently,

47
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:15,784
I don't suffer from the same softhearted...

48
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,686
Hero worship you do.

49
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,521
At least I have a heart.

50
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,323
You got to lighten up, John.

51
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,792
Spend a little less time
on the dark side of the street.

52
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,830
There's another side to the Blur,

53
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,199
and I'm gonna expose it.

54
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,438
Okay.

55
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,134
Hello?

56
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,710
Hello?!

57
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,116
Aah!

58
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:56,818
Aaah!

59
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,356
Aah!

60
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,216
No!

61
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,831
Hey, shel.

62
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:09,999
Thanks for the wake-up call.

63
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:15,605
These dreams are like midnight
movie madness in my head.

64
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:19,776
Okay.

65
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:27,150
At least I can rise and shine to a better world,

66
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,751
courtesy of the Blur.

67
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,425
Okay, Lois.

68
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,493
Whew.

69
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:43,366
Uh, Lois...

70
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,436
Why is Clark's dog welcoming me home?

71
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,238
Oh, I dropped by the farm yesterday,

72
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:50,440
and I found Shelby all alone with her wheaties.

73
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:53,610
I thought Clark secretly
came back and didn't tell us.

74
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:55,879
So you decided to call him out

75
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,047
by dognapping his furry friend?

76
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,684
Lois, I'm sorry.

77
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:03,887
I'm the one that was on pooch patrol.

78
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,455
Clark still isn't back yet.

79
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,458
I know... I called Mrs. K,

80
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,527
and she said he's visiting
cousins in Poughkeepsie.

81
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:14,330
I mean, how long can you stay in Poughkeepsie?

82
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,566
Sounds like someone misses him.

83
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:20,136
Please. I don't miss Clark.

84
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:24,374
I just can't stand the new
guy that's at his desk.

85
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,075
He is a textbook hero-hater.

86
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,946
Oh, come on. Who hates the Blur?

87
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:31,981
Anyone who reads can see how great he is.

88
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,921
It looks like he really is
spreading his wings, doesn't it?

89
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:39,455
Yeah, I just hope he's not...

90
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:40,823
spreading himself too thin.

91
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,425
I mean, he sounds a little lonely.

92
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,593
I can hear it in his voice.

93
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,196
His voice?

94
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:48,998
Did he call you again?

95
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,905
Well, I am his one and only contact at the paper.

96
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:59,509
So it was work-related, then.

97
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,810
Not really.

98
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:03,112
I mean, he calls when I'm at work,

99
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,481
and... he relates things to me.

100
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,850
But I think sometimes he just calls to chat.

101
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:11,554
I think maybe I'm the only person in his life

102
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,022
that he can really turn to.

103
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,559
Wow.

104
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,194
That's incredible.

105
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:19,996
I know, right?

106
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,300
Anyway, can we table this tell-all till later?

107
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:25,735
I have to get ready.

108
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:29,038
It's time to step back into
the ring with a certain C.E.O.

109
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,141
Bye.
Bye.

110
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,021
Shelby?

111
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:48,891
Shelby?

112
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:49,892
Hey.

113
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,461
How you doing?

114
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,771
Lois stopped by and found Shelby here alone

115
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,039
with a dish full of food.

116
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,941
Now, don't worry... I covered for you.

117
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:07,010
But you should know
that you're now on her radar.

118
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:10,580
Thanks. I'll be more careful next time.

119
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,182
Dressed like that?

120
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,618
Clark, what if I was Lois?

121
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,253
She would take one look at you

122
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,055
and realize that Clark Kent is the Blur.

123
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:21,525
I told you... there is no Clark Kent.

124
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:24,828
No disrespect to your Kryptonian calling, but...

125
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:27,597
coming back to feed the dog
is about as human as it gets.

126
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:32,202
Are you still reaching out to Lois as the Blur?

127
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,638
She told you?

128
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:36,239
You're supposed to be training with Jor-El.

129
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:37,874
Does he know you're still talking to her?

130
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:39,609
Jor-El doesn't need to know.

131
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:41,745
So you're lying to him.

132
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:43,146
You said you're turning your back

133
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:44,748
on all your human attachments, Clark,

134
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,217
but apparently, only when it suits you.

135
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:50,554
You're talking this all too personally, Chloe.

136
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:52,689
And I understand you're
still angry about Jimmy.

137
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:54,024
We both sacrificed a lot

138
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,159
so that you could become
the hero you're meant to be.

139
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,895
Now quit backpedaling, Clark.

140
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:02,265
Commit to what you started
before more people get hurt.

141
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:12,742
Oh, God, it hurts.

142
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,711
Oh, get it out of me, please.

143
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,348
Okay. Cooler heads, people.

144
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,318
Let's get a trauma panel, U.A.,
type and cross for four.

145
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,053
I want more film on his chest and arms.

146
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,588
I'm Dr. Hamilton. You are?

147
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,890
I'm in a nightmare. Look at me.

148
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:34,264
All right. Who did this to you?

149
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,167
I don't know. I, uh...

150
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,469
I got hit... by a truck...

151
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:42,439
and when I woke up, this... this was in me.

152
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:44,307
What is it? What is all this?

153
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,443
My initial assessment... 

154
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,579
someone has surgically implanted
a bionic matrix in you.

155
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,247
Oh, geez.

156
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,749
It appears to be powered by...

157
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,417
a fragment of... of meteor rock.

158
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,253
So, you can... you can take it out of me, right?

159
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:59,589
I'm afraid not.

160
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:01,124
They removed your heart.

161
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,893
No. No.

162
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,096
This apparatus is the only
thing keeping you alive.

163
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,332
I got... I got to go.

164
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,934
His epi levels are spiking.

165
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,471
I need a sedative now!
No! No sedatives! No!

166
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,339
No! No! Get off me!

167
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:45,318
Seriously...

168
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,853
what is it with you and physical violence?

169
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,990
The last time you and I saw each other,

170
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:54,727
things did get a little... physical, didn't they?

171
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,862
And then what happened, Tess?

172
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,931
Inquiring minds want to know.

173
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,200
You don't remember?

174
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:03,769
Well, a three-week concussion can do that to you.

175
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:07,073
But I think that you bonked me on the head

176
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,141
and then held me somewhere.

177
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:10,309
Held you?

178
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,712
That's wishful thinking, Lane.

179
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,514
When I came to, you were already gone.

180
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,317
We never did get to finish
what we started, though.

181
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,154
Little rematch?

182
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:24,457
I won't fight you, Tess.

183
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:25,925
I just came to tell you

184
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:27,927
that I'm not leaving the Daily Planet.

185
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,295
You were never leaving, Lois.

186
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:30,863
I fired you.

187
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:32,431
Well, I'm not gonna get into the whole

188
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:36,268
"she said, she said" thing with you.

189
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,904
But I do have friends at the inquisitor,

190
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,540
and they would just love to run a story

191
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,809
about Luthorcorp's C.E.O. and her plans

192
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:46,512
to launch a hostile alien takeover of the world.

193
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:54,186
Except no one would ever believe you.

194
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:55,654
Maybe.

195
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,889
Maybe not.

196
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,428
But do you really want the attention?

197
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,602
I'll see you at the office.

198
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,609
Shouldn't you be in school?

199
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,048
She's got a little fire in her.

200
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:24,383
Stuart.

201
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,951
What is it?

202
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,255
Um, it's about your missing Kryptonians here.

203
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:32,591
I extrapolated a dozen potential destinations,

204
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,327
and I think I know where they're
pit-stopped in Metropolis.

205
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,244
I understand it took Chloe... years

206
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,113
to get used to your entrances.

207
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:57,216
I heard what happened on the police
scanner. Is it a meteor freak?

208
00:14:57,284 --> 00:15:00,486
No. The man that did this is
something far more disturbing.

209
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,988
I'd loosely classify him as a cyborg... 

210
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:04,490
part man, part machine.

211
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:05,825
Someone built him.

212
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,093
Against his will.

213
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,728
I've seen this before.
Lex had similar projects.

214
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:12,731
Not like this.

215
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:17,503
Clark, they took his heart... 
evidently to make room

216
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,873
for his bionic body's new energy source,

217
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:23,008
a meteorite fragment.

218
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:25,244
And the synthesis between meteor and machine

219
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:26,946
clearly increased his strength,

220
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,714
but it also boosted his adrenaline,

221
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,116
intensifying his emotions.

222
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,785
I fear the longer that rock powers his body,

223
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,787
the more it'll poison his mind.

224
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,289
We have to do something to help him soon,

225
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:38,891
or he could turn homicidal.

226
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,826
He already put one of my orderlies in a coma.

227
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,331
I need to find him before he hurts anyone else.

228
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:47,766
He didn't give me his name, but he did...

229
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,301
leave this behind.

230
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,403
It must have dropped out of his pocket.

231
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,342
These are given to every new
employee at the Daily Planet.

232
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,710
He must work at the paper.

233
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:00,579
Well, then, he won't be hard to find.

234
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,815
The green glow's hard to miss.

235
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,186
Emil, I need a favor.

236
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:24,904
Hello?

237
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,573
Your favorite freak's been at it again,

238
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,675
and this time, the story's mine.

239
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,477
Well, then, he's done a super job

240
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:32,878
cleaning up Metropolis.

241
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:37,016
What if he screws up?

242
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,722
Thanks to him, the city can sleep at night.

243
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,626
This apparatus is the only
thing keeping you alive.

244
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,198
No, no.

245
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,336
There's another side to the Blur,

246
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,938
and I'm gonna expose it.

247
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:00,439
Becca.

248
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,539
I don't know.

249
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:37,710
I don't know how this happened... Becca...

250
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:41,413
and I don't know who did it, but...

251
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,549
I know... why.

252
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:50,422
It's a gift. It's a gift.

253
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:55,995
I thought I just wanted to unmask...

254
00:17:57,564 --> 00:17:58,998
The Blur,

255
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,768
but now I know what I've
wanted to do all along is...

256
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:04,270
is kill him.

257
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:12,745
And now I can do it with my own two hands.

258
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,764
I don't know how you did it, Lane,

259
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,332
but H.R. just made it official.

260
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
Welcome back.

261
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,435
Where's Corben? I got an assignment for him.

262
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,203
You mean God's gift to journalism?

263
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,139
5 bucks says he's out stalking the Blur.

264
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:35,340
Keep it for cab fare.

265
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:37,008
I need you to head down to the hospital.

266
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:38,309
Cover his story.

267
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:40,945
Patient went on a rampage... destroyed the E.R.

268
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:43,148
You're giving me Corben's leftovers?

269
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,616
Make a meal of it, Lane!

270
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,726
Daily Planet. Lois Lane,
your first choice in reporting.

271
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:56,494
Lois...

272
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:58,329
I need some information.

273
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,833
It's you.

274
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,035
Something just happened at
Metropolis General in the E.R.

275
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,303
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

276
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,838
I'm covering the story.

277
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:08,239
Got any leads?

278
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:09,641
Not yet.

279
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:12,644
I don't know the man's identity,
but I do have his keys.

280
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,579
I think he works at the Daily Planet.

281
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:17,515
He works here?

282
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,686
Hey, do you want me to find
out who's missing their keys?

283
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:23,722
No. I...

284
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,424
Just wondering if you may
have noticed anyone who's... 

285
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,659
I am so on it.

286
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,360
No, Lois. Listen to me.

287
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:30,929
This man is dangerous.

288
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,032
He's some sort of superhuman cyborg,

289
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
and I don't want you to get hurt.

290
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,070
You really do care about me, don't you?

291
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,940
Lois...

292
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,374
Okay, okay.

293
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,443
I'll just keep my eyes open. I swear.

294
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:46,945
But if I do see anything,

295
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:49,280
it's not like I can call you from the bullpen.

296
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:51,983
Then I'll call you at our phone booth.

297
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:54,619
You think of it as "our phone booth," too?

298
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:57,956
Just be there at 7:00.

299
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,502
Hey.

300
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,270
I need to get into the archive room,

301
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:14,439
but forgetful Lois forgot her keys.

302
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:16,107
Can I borrow yours?

303
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,878
Make sure you return them, Lane.

304
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:22,347
I just remembered where I stashed mine.

305
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:24,849
Hi.

306
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,051
I'm doing a special-interest piece.

307
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,487
They say you can tell a lot
about a person from their keys.

308
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:30,555
May I?

309
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:35,326
Is that a foot?

310
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:37,095
For luck.

311
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:40,165
Superstitious and disgusting.

312
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,212
Chloe?

313
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,580
Lo!

314
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,049
I was just checking my e-mail.

315
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,385
You know, when I asked
if we could table our talk

316
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:02,854
about you-know-who, I meant until I got home.

317
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:05,056
Actually, the only table I'm here about

318
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:07,058
is the kind they serve lunch on.

319
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:09,460
I was thinking maybe we could
celebrate you getting your job back.

320
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:11,196
I would love to,

321
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,231
but I'm kind of already on a job.

322
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,533
I'm working for you-know-who.

323
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:16,935
The Blur?
Mm-hmm.

324
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,303
Doing what, exactly?

325
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,738
Hunting down a real-life terminator.

326
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,707
Lois, that sounds dangerous.

327
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,042
Why is he not doing that himself?

328
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:25,543
Oh...

329
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:27,946
Sometimes, heroes can't do it
all on their own, Chloe.

330
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,380
That's why they need sidekicks.

331
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,849
Rain check on lunch.

332
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:38,256
These were all stolen

333
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:40,458
from different Luthorcorp
facilities over the last week.

334
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:42,727
Your "visitors" managed to hack
into the low-rent alarm system.

335
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:44,329
Shocker.

336
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,531
Security didn't notice anything
was gone until this morning,

337
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,867
but I tracked the container's gps.

338
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:54,105
This technology was meant
for several unrelated projects.

339
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:00,044
What were they building?

340
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,816
Maybe Frankenstein's monster.

341
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:06,851
I scaled a few of the firewalls over at Met Gen,

342
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,486
and I found some pretty sick X-rays.

343
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:15,293
Not exactly your basic bypass surgery.

344
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:18,096
Luthorcorp has the best scientists on Earth,

345
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:21,065
and none ever thought
to put these pieces together.

346
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:28,273
It's impossible to put this much
turbocharged hardware

347
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,041
into one person.

348
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:32,543
The equipment alone requires
a massive power source.

349
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:35,013
Why did he give someone
such a major power-up

350
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,180
and then just let him go?

351
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:51,329
Maybe it was a test... 

352
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:53,031
to see if it would work.

353
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,235
They could still be monitoring him.

354
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,473
Zod and his people are one step closer

355
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,142
to getting their powers.

356
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:16,421
Well, it looks like the night
shift finally clocked in.

357
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,757
What happened... try to shave in your sleep?

358
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,760
Why do the electronic records in
this place only go back a year?

359
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:25,063
Hello. Lois.

360
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,497
Banter, banter, banter.

361
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:27,765
What happened?

362
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,968
Did your snappy patter set with the sun?

363
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,569
Where are the records?!

364
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:33,771
Little less snap and a little more patter, please.

365
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:38,309
Okay. It's a new system.

366
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:41,079
They haven't transferred it all over yet.

367
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,548
There's a hard copy of
everything in the archive room.

368
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:44,949
What are you looking for?

369
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,252
The Blur.

370
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:51,389
He didn't come out of nowhere, Lois.

371
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,524
There must be some kind of origin story.

372
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,495
Maintenance crew's already been through there.

373
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,997
Don't forget your keys.

374
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,868
I need to borrow yours.

375
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,639
You don't have your keys?

376
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:15,346
I must have lost mine.

377
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,718
Keep them.

378
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:24,022
I'll get them in the morning. It's late.

379
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,124
I should go.

380
00:24:33,065 --> 00:24:35,800
Please call.
Please call.

381
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,135
Please call.

382
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,540
Hello?

383
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,275
It's me.

384
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:45,943
Look, I know who he is.

385
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,445
The man from the hospital... 

386
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:49,147
his name is John Corben.

387
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:50,882
Lois, I asked you not to.

388
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,150
Please be careful.

389
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:54,185
Corben has a supersized grudge against you,

390
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:55,987
and if he's as powerful as you say he is... 

391
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,688
I'll be fine.

392
00:24:57,756 --> 00:25:00,324
Just promise me that you're headed
home and not back to the office.

393
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:03,361
Lois?

394
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:06,898
Lois?!

395
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:09,567
Lois?

396
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,775
Corben.

397
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:29,912
Chloe, Lois has been kidnapped.

398
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:31,179
I need your help.

399
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:33,348
Tell me this isn't because you let her chase down

400
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,083
That sinister cyborg all by herself.

401
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:36,952
I told her not to get involved.

402
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,087
Clark, what did you think she was gonna do?

403
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:40,322
This is Lois.

404
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:44,593
You know, she was just referring
to herself as the Blur's sidekick.

405
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:46,094
I should have never called her in the first place,

406
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:47,462
but I can't let anything happen to her now.

407
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,231
Well, Dr. Emil told me about this guy,

408
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,233
and he said he has a kryptonite heart, okay?

409
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:54,036
You're not gonna be able to get close
enough to him to do anything about it.

410
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,304
He gave me this.

411
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:57,039
This is an E.M.P. grenade.

412
00:25:57,106 --> 00:25:58,807
It'll blast an electromagnetic pulse

413
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,010
and stop any electronic device within 50 yards.

414
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:03,712
I'm hoping it'll stop him long enough

415
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,047
for me to get Lois to safety.

416
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:08,250
Yeah, well, will it work against meteor rock?

417
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,052
It's a chance I'm willing to take.

418
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,754
The guy's name is John Corben,

419
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,222
and he works at the Daily Planet.

420
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,325
I haven't been able to find him anywhere.

421
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,460
Clark, I wish you had come to me with this.

422
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:21,263
Lois doesn't have any experience
dealing with these things.

423
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,732
Things have been easy with Lois lately.

424
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,769
Talking to her just felt right.

425
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,547
Hey, sis, I got your care package.

426
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:40,215
It's, uh, it's funny, you know.

427
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:42,284
I always thought it sounded
ridiculous when people said it,

428
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,220
but i... it's kind of like having a piece of home.

429
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,155
Saw the dvds and the notes that you sent me.

430
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:49,091
Awesome. Um... 

431
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:53,095
I miss you.

432
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:55,330
Oh, and you better be practicing foosball also,

433
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:56,999
because I'm taking my title

434
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,867
as soon as I get back there, all right?

435
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:05,240
Listen, do me a favor, okay?

436
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:07,009
Just be safe.

437
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:08,877
And be careful in the city, all right?

438
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,445
I... it's not like home.

439
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:11,813
All right?

440
00:27:12,982 --> 00:27:14,583
Love you.

441
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:16,385
I love you. Bye.

442
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,262
That's his sister... Rebecca Corben.

443
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,498
She was murdered in her
apartment in Metropolis

444
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,133
three months ago while he was overseas.

445
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:33,602
Wait a minute.

446
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,304
He... bought the building just a few weeks ago.

447
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,208
Maybe that's where he took Lois.

448
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,276
Thanks, Chloe.

449
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:43,011
Wait... Clark...

450
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,780
be careful.

451
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,494
Look, I know you're new at the Planet, John,

452
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:02,731
but I'm pretty sure H.R.
frowns on this kind of thing.

453
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,633
I heard you...

454
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:05,734
Lois.

455
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:07,069
I heard you talking to him.

456
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:08,603
So, just tell me who the Blur is...

457
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:11,573
and I'll let you go.

458
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:13,075
I promise... I'll let you go.

459
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,277
I already told you... I don't know.

460
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,048
Since when did you become a living lite-brite?

461
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:29,424
What happened to you, John?

462
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:30,592
Huh?

463
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:42,671
I'll show you.

464
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:47,776
Okay, take it easy there, chippendale.

465
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:50,479
I... I think I want the shirt back on.

466
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,484
Who is he?

467
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:58,587
Lois... who is he?

468
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,855
I don't know.

469
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,090
Who is he?!

470
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,569
Get away from her!

471
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,656
It's you.

472
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,927
The Blur.

473
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,796
I don't want to hurt you, John.

474
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,298
You already have.

475
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,868
My sister's dead because of you.

476
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:54,743
A prison bus... crashed.

477
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:57,445
All the men inside would have
died, but you saved them all.

478
00:29:57,513 --> 00:30:00,515
And in the confusion, a
cold-blooded killer escaped.

479
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,784
And he murdered your sister?

480
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:06,521
What...

481
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:09,858
gives you the right...

482
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:12,494
to interfere with our lives

483
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,497
and to change our fates?!

484
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:21,102
I'm sorry about your loss, John.

485
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,038
What happened to your sister was tragic.

486
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:26,174
But you need to control yourself.

487
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,443
The meteor rock is causing
an... an adrenaline rush.

488
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,811
You're not thinking straight.

489
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,180
Control myself?

490
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,451
That's easy for you to say.

491
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,055
It doesn't take... much to stay in control

492
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:42,891
when you watch from the shadows.

493
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:47,529
You stand apart from the world...

494
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,531
while the rest of us live in it.

495
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:53,869

it breaks your heart.

00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:23,258
Now I'm gonna show you
what it feels like

502
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:24,526
to lose somebody you love.

503
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:30,465

504
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,923
What's the matter...

505
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:56,725
Blur?

506
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,060
A little meteor rock got you down?

507
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:03,898
Who knew the mighty... Goliath
could be taken down...

508
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:06,434
with a simple stone?

509
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:08,503
John... no!

510
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,837
You're safe now, Lois.

511
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:44,506
I'm here.

512
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,399
It's you.

513
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:14,636
You saved me.

514
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,772
After all our phone calls,

515
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,708
I finally have you standing right in front of me,

516
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:22,777
and I don't know what to say to you.

517
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,655
Please let me see your face.

518
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:02,341
Lois, I'm just glad you're okay.

519
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:04,376
I'm coming home right now.

520
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:06,778
Okay. I'll see you soon.

521
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:15,020
Clark.

522
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:17,889
This view really puts things in perspective.

523
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,996
Jimmy knew exactly what he was
doing when he bought this place.

524
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,340
I really miss him.

525
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,917
I took the easy way out, Chloe.

526
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,188
I should have been there
when you needed me.

527
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:53,725
I'm sorry.

528
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,067
Clark, there's nothing easy

529
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,836
about burying everyone you love in your past.

530
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,476
I'm afraid I haven't even done
a very good job of that.

531
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,348
I'm trying to fill the void

532
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:19,551
by hanging out on rooftops,
eavesdropping on people... 

533
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,520
people who are connecting...

534
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:22,921
and living.

535
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,960
Thinking, what's the point of protecting life...

536
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:31,930
If you've lost your sense on how to live it?

537
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,602
Maybe I can't do this, Chloe.

538
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:43,575
Maybe I can't completely stay away.

539
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:45,043
Stay away from her, you mean.

540
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:55,520
Lois means something to you... something more.

541
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,492
So, does this mean

542
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,894
that Clark Kent is coming back for an encore?

543
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:06,798
I don't know.

544
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,468
But I can't let that life interfere
with my training again.

545
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:14,206
Clark, lurking around
building edges at midnight,

546
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,441
pining after the life you gave up

547
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:20,479
isn't exactly amping your
hero performance, either.

548
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:23,148
You know...

549
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:26,785
maybe I was naive to think

550
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:29,087
that you just turn a corner and never look back.

551
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,193
But either way,

552
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:38,130
Kal-El needs his human disguise
now more than ever.

553
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:39,664
Why do you say that?

554
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:42,534
Went to the Daily Planet
to look at Lois' computer

555
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:44,569
and found that Tess had loaded it up

556
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,471
with serious spyware.

557
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,840
You mean, she didn't rehire Lois
out of the goodness of her heart?

558
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:51,810
She wanted to find out where Lois
has been the last three weeks.

559
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,178
Now, if she figures out...

560
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:54,780
She was in the future

561
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:56,982
and brought back a Kryptonian
who says I'll end the world...

562
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:59,785
Tess already knows way too much about you.

563
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:02,754
We can't let her get to
Lois' memories before you do.

564
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:27,379
Heartless bastard.

565
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:51,036
I'm gonna be needing that.

566
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:55,474
Clark Kent. You're back.

567
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,676
I was beginning to think

568
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:59,945
your family lived on some distant planet.

569
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:04,049
Must have really missed me.

570
00:39:05,284 --> 00:39:06,852
Uh...

571
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,987
only because the guy who sat in your desk

572
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,589
was a certifiable psychopath.

573
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:12,123
Otherwise, I've been so busy,

574
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:13,758
I didn't even notice you were gone.

575
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:18,530
Missed you, too, Lois.

576
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,871
Anything exciting happen while I was gone?

577
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,376
Well, you'll never believe it,

578
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:34,946
but I helped the Blur
stop a homicidal maniac.

579
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:36,414
Really?

580
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:41,353
You know, I would love to hear about it.

581
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,588
Okay.

582
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:46,057
Well...

583
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,094
It all started when this guy showed up

584
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,163
with this major grudge against the Blur.

585
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,132
He also happens to have these bionic arms

586
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,635
and a big, glowing rock for a heart.

587
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:58,537
But that's way later on in the story.

588
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:08,547
to think such a small rock could
give someone so much power.

589
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,415
Can he be revived?

590
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:14,052
The subject's operation has
left him more machine than man.

591
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,555
His vital signs have simply gone offline.

592
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:21,660
You have the coolest stuff.

593
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,062
Wha... wh... 

594
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,363
Hey.

595
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:26,431
What?

596
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:27,699
You work for me now,

597
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,834
which means you knock before you enter.

598
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:34,606
Did you find the Kandorians?

599
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:36,441
Check it.

600
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,677
Look.

601
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:41,246
These symbols appeared all over the world

602
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,948
the same night that Zod arrived.

603
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,817
Now, I don't have a definitive
translation for them yet,

604
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:48,620
but... the design shares similarities

605
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:50,889
to Kryptonian words

606
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:53,491
for "blood," "nobility," and "family."

607
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:58,930
Like a family crest.

608
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,999
So there are more of his people out there.

609
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,534
How many of these did you find?

610
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:04,569
Hundreds, okay?

611
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:07,038
And I think you might recognize this one.

612
00:41:11,877 --> 00:41:13,778
There's more. Look.

613
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:27,724
