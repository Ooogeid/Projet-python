1
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Javier, if the boss
catches you resting...

2
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,599
He's gonna do what --
Fire me?

3
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:33,799
Francisco, the guy
doesn't even pay us.

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,666
I didn't come to america
to be a slave.

5
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,267
I came to be with my mom.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,100
I have a plan.

7
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,033
If we run fast enough,
we can escape.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Everyone who's tried to run
has disappeared.

9
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:47,834
Francisco, you've known me
your whole life.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,867
<i>Have i ever let you down?</i>

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,333
You just got to trust me.

12
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:03,734
Francisco, come on!

13
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:05,967
¿Está bien?
¿Necesita ayuda?

14
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,567
Somebody call a doctor!

15
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,567
What's happening here?

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,233
Get him some water.

17
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,400
You two, come on,
back to work.

18
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,433
Let's go!

19
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,200
Francisco,
if you stay here,

20
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,967
You're gonna end up
like that guy back there.

21
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,900
Let's go find my mom.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,101
Hurry, francisco.

23
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,166
Come on.
Let's go.

24
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,067
What?!

25
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,400
I don't know.
What was that?!

26
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,467
Shh! Shh! Shh!

27
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,266
Run.

28
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,567
Come on.
Let's go!

29
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,001
Hurry, francisco.
Run faster!

30
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,367
Come on.

31
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,667
Francisco?!

32
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,734
Francisco?!

33
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,900
Francisco?!

00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:07,200
* i've made this whole world
shine for you *

38
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,834
* just stay

39
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,900
* stay

40
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,700
* come on

41
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,901
You didn't get much sleep.

42
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,901
Neither did you.

43
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,901
It's kind of become
a pattern lately.

44
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:39,601
You mean
since you proposed?

45
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,834
Lana, i don't want you
to give me an answer

46
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,033
Until you're ready.

47
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,834
To be honest,
i wish i could take it back.

48
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:53,868
Look, i'm usually...

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,434
More calculated
and strategic.

50
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:01,133
But with you,
you never make me see clearly.

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,633
I do everything
out of impulse.

52
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,267
You're not the only one.

53
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,433
Things have just moved
so fast.

54
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:12,967
Take as much time
as you want.

55
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:19,066
Thank you.

56
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:23,466
Um, are you sure
that the board can't survive

57
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Without their boss
for one more hour?

58
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:29,433
Believe me, if i could stay
with you, i would.

59
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:33,066
Look, just because i'm stuck
in an office all day

60
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,833
Doesn't mean you can't be
off having fun.

61
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,500
Three lost vermeer paintings
were discovered last month.

62
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,633
You should go
to the opening.

63
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,500
At metropolis museum?

64
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,967
Actually,
it's a bit farther.

65
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,567
The rijksmuseum.

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,066
In amsterdam?

67
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,066
Lex, that's 4,000
miles away.

68
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,833
And one of the most romantic
cities in the world,

69
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,133
Where you'll feel
very lonely

70
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,700
And realize how much
you miss me.

71
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,767
Nice strategy, boss.

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,867
Only if it works.

73
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Hey!

74
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,934
Wait. Hold on.

75
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,233
What happened to you?
Are you all right?

76
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,333
You should get those cleaned up.
Why don't you come inside?

77
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,099
I promise, no one's
gonna hurt you.

78
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,567
Wow. Slow down.

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
What do you want to drink
with that?

80
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:11,500
I think we have milk,
orange juice...

81
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,166
And, uh, lemonade.

82
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,133
Guess this would be easier
if i spoke spanish.

83
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,233
Orange juice, please.

84
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,433
Orange juice.

85
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,500
Your english is perfect.

86
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,034
I watched a lot
of american tv.

87
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,900
Oh.
And what's your name?

88
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,133
Javier.
I'm clark.

89
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,934
So, javier...

90
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,667
Why don't you tell me
how you got all scraped up

91
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,833
And why you were hiding
in our barn?

92
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:45,300
Please promise you won't
call the police.

93
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,034
Why would i call
the police?

94
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:53,066
Because i ran away
from that farm down the road.

95
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,967
What, jed mcnally's?

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,233
If i ever wanted to see
my mom again,

97
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,900
I had to escape
from that place.

98
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:03,867
You talk about that farm
like it's a prison.

99
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,166
It is.

100
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,233
No one was allowed to leave.

101
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,500
There was barely enough
to eat.

102
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,767
My friend and i, francisco,
tried to escape.

103
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,133
But we started running,

104
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,366
And there was this
really loud noise.

105
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,533
Then he was gone.

106
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:26,233
Look, um, i'm sorry.
I will have to call the sheriff.

107
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,066
No! You can't.

108
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,667
I'm here illegally.
They'll send me back to mexico.

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,800
Mexico?

110
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,466
That's a long way
from smallville.

111
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,133
How did you get here?

112
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,867
Last week, a coyote smuggled
15 of us across the border

113
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,533
In the back of a truck.

114
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,433
I was supposed to be sent
to see my mom.

115
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,867
Instead i ended up
at that farm.

116
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,867
Where's your mom now?

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,533
She works at a laundry company
down in granville.

118
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,266
When my dad died,
she moved up north.

119
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,433
Saved up money for two years
to get me here.

120
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:10,099
Your mom must really
miss you.

121
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,800
Yeah.
See this?

122
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,767
She gave me this...

123
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,633
To keep me safe.

124
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:24,600
I should've given it
to francisco.

125
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,466
We did everything
together.

126
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,366
He was like a brother
to me.

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,633
Well, don't worry.
We're gonna find your friend.

128
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,533
Hey, there, clark.

129
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:08,667
Mr. Mcnally.

130
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,233
Well, it's been
a long time.

131
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,967
Your farm looks great.

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,133
Thought your crops
were nearly destroyed

133
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,633
During the last
meteor shower.

134
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,333
It may sound strange,

135
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,567
But i've come to think of that
meteor shower as a blessing.

136
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,533
Taught me,
with a little hard work,

137
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,366
Anything is possible.

138
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,366
What did the deputy want?

139
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,300
Looking for
illegal aliens.

140
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,800
You better believe that all
my workers have their papers.

141
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,633
I'm sorry to hear
about your father, clark.

142
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,600
How's your mom holding up?

143
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,967
She's okay.
Thanks.

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,967
Our tractor,
on the other hand --

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,667
We broke an axle.

146
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,934
I was hoping you might have
a spare pivot pin.

147
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,867
Pivot pin?
You know, i just might.

148
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,767
Let me check the barn.

149
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:09,366
Excuse me.
I'm looking for francisco.

150
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,800
Do you know francisco?

151
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,333
El árbol grande
a la cinco.

152
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,500
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

153
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,733
El árbol grande
a la cinco.

154
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:29,300
Found one!
[ Laughs ]

155
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,333
You're in luck.
Still in the wrapper.

156
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,500
Thanks.

157
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,333
Give my best
to the senator.

158
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,800
Sure.

159
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,867
<i>You know how i stand.</i>

160
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,366
Our budget issues
shouldn't get in the way

161
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,833
Of one single classroom.

162
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,166
Thank you.
You won't regret it.

163
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,199
Bye.

164
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,366
Mom, you're home early
from topeka.

165
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,934
The vote was postponed,
which isn't so bad.

166
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,066
Gives me time
to shore up support.

167
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,900
Is everything all right?

168
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,066
Um...

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,633
Afternoon, senator.

170
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,400
Hello.
Is there a problem?

171
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,934
Well, a motorist saw
a latino boy

172
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,467
Running across highway 54,

173
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,100
And he might be
an undocumented worker.

174
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,243
Have you seen anyone?

175
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,709
I just got home.
Clark?

176
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,799
It seems like
an awful lot of trouble

177
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,367
Just to catch one person.

178
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,567
Well, not if he's
in the country illegally.

179
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Do you mind
if i look at your barn?

180
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,316
No.
Go ahead.

181
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,183
Do you really have to search
our property?

182
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,850
Clark, it's fine.
We don't have anything to hide.

183
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,817
Then i'll go with you.

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
No one seems
to be here.

185
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,501
Well, it's best
to be thorough.

186
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,534
You'd be surprised
where people can hide.

187
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,567
You know, this kid
isn't hurting anyone.

188
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,267
Why not just let him be?

189
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm just doing my job,
clark.

190
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,033
If you want to get
into the country,

191
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,833
You need to do it the legal way,
like my parents did.

192
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:12,167
If you see anything,
give us a call.

193
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,733
Will do, deputy.

194
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,367
You can come out now.
He's gone.

195
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
How'd you know
i was in there?

196
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,200
I used to play a lot of
hide-And-Seek when i was a kid.

197
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,134
Why didn't you tell
the police?

198
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,066
Because i know what it feels
like to be out of place.

199
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,866
Besides, i'm not
from around here, either.

200
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,000
Where are you from?

201
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,200
It's a place a lot
further than mexico.

202
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,133
Listen, javier,
i need your help.

203
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,200
All the workers at the farm
are too scared to talk,

204
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,734
But one of them
said this to me.

205
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,600
Can you translate it
for me?

206
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:08,100
"Big tree 5."

207
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,166
There's a huge willow tree
at the farm.

208
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,066
I'll go check it out.
You just stay here, all right?

209
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,899
You're not going
anywhere, clark.

210
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
We have no choice.
We have to call immigration.

211
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,600
I told javier he'd be safe here,
and i meant it.

212
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,832
I want to help this boy
as much as you do,

213
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,666
But i took an oath
to uphold the law.

214
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,566
All he's trying to do
is find his mom.

215
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,267
I know,
but we have to go through

216
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,867
The proper legal channels.

217
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,034
Was it legal when you forged
my adoption papers?

218
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm an illegal
immigrant, mom.

219
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,167
You've been harboring me
for over 17 years.

220
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,666
Your situation
was entirely different.

221
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,100
We had to protect you!

222
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,900
And i need to protect javier.

223
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,900
If i don't defend him,
who will?

224
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:05,334
Clark...
there's a mother out there

225
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,566
Who hasn't seen her son
in over two years.

226
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you really want to stand
in the way of that?

227
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,467
I thought you of all people
would understand.

228
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:17,334
I-I'll take him
to chloe's, okay?

229
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,467
Just give me 24 hours
before you call the deputy.

230
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,666
I got to go somewhere,
mom.

231
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,733
Are you francisco?

232
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,733
Do you know
where i can find him?

233
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,467
La tierra lo tragó.

234
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:49,334
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

235
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,700
He says the ground
swallowed him,

236
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,100
Like all the others.

237
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,566
Diablo de bajo
de la tierra.

238
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,800
There are three laundry services
in granville.

239
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,833
Your mom must be
at one of them.

240
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,267
All right.

241
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,367
As soon as clark finds
francisco, we can go find her.

242
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,367
One second.
Write those addresses down.

243
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,167
Hi.

244
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,034
Brace yourself for the date
of a lifetime.

245
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:59,467
Start with a fancy dinner
complete with a snobby waiter,

246
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,600
Extra forks,
inappropriate footsie.

247
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:02,833
Jimmy.

248
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,533
Then a moonlit stroll
down main street.

249
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,234
Hand-Holding optional,
of course.

250
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:09,767
And then we conclude
the evening here...

251
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,933
With dessert.

252
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,000
Uh...

253
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,867
Hey.

254
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,100
Uh, who's your friend?

255
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,566
Javier, meet jimmy.

256
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,833
Javier is clark's friend
from mexico.

257
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,067
He's only been in the country
for a couple weeks,

258
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,767
And we're hanging out
until clark gets back.

259
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,867
Sorry.

260
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Well, let's get
this party started.

261
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,167
[ Loudly ]
javier...

262
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,700
You have not experienced
america

263
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:50,933
Until you've experienced
pepperoni pizza.

264
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,367
Isn't pizza from italy?

265
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,666
[ Normal voice ] well, that's
a-A common misconception.

266
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,900
Um, we came up
with the cheese angle.

267
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I'm gonna go order.
Okay.

268
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,566
Is that your boyfriend?

269
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,300
Yeah, i'd like to order
one pepperoni pizza, please.

270
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,633
Yeah. Large.

271
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,533
Define "boyfriend."

272
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,833
Hey.

273
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,733
Clark.

274
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,100
Did you find francisco?

275
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:34,933
Um, i'm still working on that.

276
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,666
Chloe, can i talk to you
for a second?

277
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,800
Just a second.

278
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,067
Clark,
what did you find?

279
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,933
Chloe, that place
is a graveyard.

280
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,800
There's bodies buried
everywhere.

281
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,334
I called the sheriff.

282
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:55,501
He's on his way
to mcnally's farm.

283
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,566
I took a look at the farm's
property records.

284
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,267
Guess which fortune 500 company
so graciously came in

285
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,800
And purchased the land
after it had been pummeled

286
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,633
During the last
meteor shower.

287
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,200
Luthorcorp.

288
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,967
Would you watch javier?
I'll be right back.

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,767
Of course.

290
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,900
I thought i told you
you're no longer a welcome guest

291
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,401
At the mansion.

292
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:34,533
Trust me, lex --
I don't want to be here, either.

293
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,200
But after
what you've done --

294
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:38,134
And exactly
what did i do?

295
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,933
Did i swat at a fly
with too much force?

296
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,367
I know you want to make money,
lex, at any cost,

297
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:45,666
But exploiting and murdering
migrant workers?

298
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,633
Is that really worth
the bottom line?

299
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,700
Clark, if you're going to
accuse me of murder,

300
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,767
You might want to have the facts
to back it up.

301
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,067
Last year, luthorcorp bought
jed mcnally's farm,

302
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,700
And any illegal immigrant
who didn't want to be used

303
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,800
As forced labor
was buried in a cornfield.

304
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,833
I don't know
what you're talking about.

305
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,401
But then i could quote you
"the farmers' almanac,"

306
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,434
And you'd still call me
a liar.

307
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,267
What do you think lana would do
if she found out about this?

308
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,501
Well, we could ask her,

309
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,933
Except she's on her way
to amsterdam on my jet.

310
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,900
I wasn't able to clear
my schedule.

311
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:23,666
You should know i've told
the sheriff about this,

312
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,467
So you can save your lies
about luthorcorp for him.

stuffed crust.

314

run off to?

in love with you.

00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:26,634
They were too scared
to report it.

355
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,767
What's gonna happen
to the others?

356
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:30,767
They'll be detained

357
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:34,000
And sent back
to their country of origin.

358
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,966
The good news is,
though,

359
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,267
Thanks to your tip, clark,
mcnally can't hurt anyone else.

360
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
You sure there's no other field
we should check, mcnally?

361
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,033
Be in your best interests,
sir, to tell us now.

362
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:56,200
That punk who got away --
He got to you, didn't he?

363
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,767
Mr. Mcnally,
why did you do it?

364
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:01,567
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

365
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,567
This farm
is my livelihood.

366
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,300
So you brought in
slave labor

367
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,334
Then killed them
when they tried to leave?

368
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,567
I wasn't about to let
a couple of lazy potato pickers

369
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,933
Turn me in.

370
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:18,033
I guess i did that
for them.

371
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:23,233
Well, then you and that boy
will pay for it!

372
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:24,933
Get him out of here.

373
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,467
When i told you
to keep me informed

374
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,133
Of jed mcnally's activities,

375
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,801
I thought you might include
such trifling details

376
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,033
As mass murder.

377
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:11,300
Sir, i had no idea

378
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,966
That he was killing
his workers.

379
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,200
You might want to get
a stronger prescription

380
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:16,734
For those glasses,
dr. Bauer.

381
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,434
They found corpses
on that farm.

382
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,133
All that i knew

383
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,334
Was that the meteors
gave him the ability

384
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:26,267
To displace minerals
and burrow through earth.

385
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,000
I didn't spend millions
on research

386
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,933
For the test subject
to end up in jail.

387
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:32,667
Find mcnally
before the authorities do.

388
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:36,866
Mr. Luthor, you and i both know
the man could be anywhere.

389
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,267
Then i suggest
you start digging.

390
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,434
I want him back.

391
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,800
Hey, clark,
what happened?

392
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,634
Javier is not the only one
who escaped.

393
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,534
The police had mcnally
in custody,

394
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,500
And all of a sudden he
disappeared into the ground.

395
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:03,233
Makes sense,
seeing as jed mcnally

396
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:05,799
Is 100% certified
meteor freak.

397
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,600
<i>I checked
into the planet's archives,</i>

398
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,467
And it looks like
our farmer friend

399
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,400
Was buried under a mountain
of kryptonite.

400
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,167
That's why he went missing
for three days,

401
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,833
And it may explain his ability
to move underground.

402
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,500
Being a human rototiller

403
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,233
Definitely helps
with the harvest.

404
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,699
In the last year and a half,

405
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,666
His farm has tripled
in productivity.

406
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,966
It sounds like he was being
his own personal border patrol.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,066
I mean, if anyone
ever tried to leave,

408
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,200
He made sure they wouldn't live
to tell the authorities.

409
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,500
The same jed mcnally who used to
go fishing with my dad

410
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,001
Is now a murderer.

411
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:37,767
If anything could turn
a law-Abiding citizen

412
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:39,500
Into a card-Carrying
serial killer,

413
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:40,634
It's kryptonite.

414
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,100
Man: unit 12.

415
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,467
Suspected stowaway on bus
headed toward granville.

416
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,467
Suspect male,
hispanic, early teens.

417
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,434
No i.D.
Javier.

418
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,167
I've been monitoring the police
scanner in granville.

419
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,367
Absolutely could be...

420
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,500
Hurry, clark.

421
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,734
Come on, kid,
the police are coming.

422
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:11,068
Let's do this
the easy way, huh?

423
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,500
I got to get to my mom.

424
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,367
Leave him alone.

425
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,901
Mind your own business,
kid.

426
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,167
He is my business.

427
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,467
How'd you do that?

428
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,400
Javier, promise me you won't
tell anybody about this.

429
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:43,734
Don't worry.

430
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,701
I've become an expert
at keeping secrets.

431
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:48,267
All right,
get in the truck.

432
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,467
Let's get you home.

433
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,801
So, i'm assuming that
a behind-The-Scenes tour

434
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:07,167
Of a laundry wasn't exactly
on your dream-Date itinerary.

435
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,900
I wouldn't rule it out.

436
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,267
A stack of towels
could be awfully cushiony.

437
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:13,668
Easy.

438
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,050
Uh, excuse me.
Hi.

439
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,816
I'm just looking
for esperanza ramirez.

440
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,016
Are you esperanza?

441
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,916
We know your son,
javier.

442
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:29,549
Javier?

443
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,349
He's in america?

444
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:33,783
Yeah.
He's looking for you.
Where is he?

445
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,716
At our friend's house.
We can take you there.

446
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:37,583
Yes.

447
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:40,883
Chloe:
we found her.

448
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,183
Great. Thanks.

449
00:28:42,217 --> 00:28:43,683
That was chloe.

450
00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:46,150
Your mom is her way
to my house right now.

451
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,083
Oh, i can't believe it!

452
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:51,116
After two years,
i finally get to see her.

453
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,950
You never told me
about francisco, clark.

454
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,549
Just tell me. Please.

455
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,583
Javier, i'm sorry.
He's dead.

456
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:20,616
The sheriff i.D.'D his body.

457
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:21,849
Look, i know it's tough.

458
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,100
I've lost people
close to me, too.

459
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,050
Stop the car.

460
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:25,450
Javier, i --

461
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:26,950
Please, just stop the car.

462
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:39,217
Javier!

463
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:44,150
Javier, i got to get you
out of here.

464
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:47,016
I never should have brought
francisco with me.

465
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,016
Why didn't i give this
to francisco?

466
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,616
If we hadn't
tried to escape...

467
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:16,649
It's not your fault,
javier.

468
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,117
Come on.

469
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,983
Let's go see your mom.

470
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,749
Clark!

471
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:30,450
Clark!

472
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,166
Clark...

473
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
You're all right.

474
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,233
I think this is yours.

475
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:27,267
Come on.
Let's go see your mom.

476
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,834
Mamá!

477
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:52,066
Javier.

478
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,834
Are you okay?
What happened?

479
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,867
Clark saved me.

480
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:01,700
Javier should get to a hospital,
be checked out.

481
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:05,001
No. We can't.
No hospitals.

482
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:07,800
Hopefully you won't have to
worry about that anymore.

483
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:11,267
I'm doing everything in my power
to get your family legal status.

484
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,400
Mom, you can do that?

485
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,734
I'm working on it.

486
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,300
I've been talking
to esperanza.

487
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,333
Javier seems
like an amazing boy,

488
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:22,467
A boy i'd be proud to see
as a citizen someday.

489
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,734
What about your position
on the senate?

490
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:30,433
Sometimes when you're dealing
with extraordinary people,

491
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:33,166
You need to take a risk.

492
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:37,767
That's a lesson
i learned from my son.

493
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,700
Hey.

494
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:58,667
Hi.

495
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,433
How was your trip?

496
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,567
A small-Town girl
from kansas

497
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,734
In the presidential suite

498
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:09,133
With a stretch limousine
at her beck and call --

499
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,300
It was definitely
a change.

500
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,300
I'm sorry
if you felt uncomfortable.

501
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,333
Not at all.

502
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,667
Actually,
i thought it was amazing.

503
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,800
Yeah, it's easy
to get used to, isn't it?

504
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,300
Lex, there were 2,000 people
in line for that art exhibit,

505
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,467
And suddenly
the ocean parted,

506
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,767
And i was escorted
past everyone.

507
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:38,066
I realized that money
isn't just luxury, lex.

508
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
It's power.

509
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,734
And that power can be yours,
too, now.

510
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,001
Think of all the good
we can do in the world.

511
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:06,867
And i know exactly
where i want to start.

512
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,467
"Huge 1-Bedroom, dsl ready.
Sprawling views of downtown."

513
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,966
If that doesn't scream
chloe sullivan --

514
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,866
Jimmy, i'm not screaming
for anyplace to live.

515
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,433
Okay, well, this one
is well-Lit, secure parking.

516
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,333
Jimmy,
i have an apartment.

517
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:51,400
And, yes, my roommate might
blast metallica in the bathroom,

518
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,000
But i'm happy there.

519
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:55,066
Chloe,
it's in smallville.

520
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,966
Look, i just don't feel
too comfortable

521
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,367
With my...friend
living in a town

522
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,033
Surrounded
by murderous freaks --

523
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,267
A chick who sprouts vines,

524
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,367
A serial-Killer farmer
with a dirt fetish.

525
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,233
I mean,
who knows what's next?

526
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:11,000
Jimmy, your "friend"
has been living in smallville

527
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,467
For the past 10 years.

528
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,534
And believe it or not,
she is still standing.

529
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:16,699
Then you must have
one dedicated guardian angel.

530
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:19,066
Jimmy, look,
smallville got me stories,

531
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,766
And those stories
got me hired

532
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,766
At one of the best newspapers
in the world.

533
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:27,666
Are you sure your looks
had nothing to do with it?

534
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,467
Aren't you two
still on the clock?

535
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,534
C.K.

536
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,933
Just the man
that i wanted to see.

537
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,766
Look,
i'm a straight shooter,

538
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:42,467
So we should probably just
get this out in the open.

539
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,500
I know that you got
your issues with me.

540
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:49,634
What do you mean?

541
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,699
The whole
chloe-And-Me thing.

542
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,933
And, hey, you know what?
I get it.

543
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:56,500
But what i'm about
is working through it.

544
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,400
Do you play hoops?

545
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,400
Great. Cool.

546
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:03,634
Then we will, you know,
go play a little one-On-One,

547
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,433
And we'll just leave it out
on the court

548
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,733
'Cause i'm your bro,
not your foe.

549
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,000
Ring that bell.

550
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:15,033
There it is.

551
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:22,100
[ Laughing ] please don't ask
any follow-Up questions.

552
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,100
Nice byline.

553
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,133
Hey, thanks.
Yeah.

554
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:30,699
It wouldn't have a happy ending
if it wasn't for you, though.

555
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:38,100
Come on, clark,
you put a psycho killer away,

556
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,367
And you reunited a mother
with her son.

557
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,066
I mean, there are
only so many hours in the day.

558
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,066
Well, see,
that's the thing.

559
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,066
No matter how many people
i save,

560
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,567
I can't solve
the world's problems.

561
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,267
I don't know anyone else

562
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,066
Who does more for this world
than you.

563
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,799
Clark?

564
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:19,966
I thought
you were in amsterdam.

565
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,233
I'm back.
Is your mom around?

566
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:24,066
No, she's in topeka.

567
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,833
Um, well, i brought by
some paperwork for her.

568
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:28,833
Should i leave it
in the house?

569
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:31,367
That's all right.
I'll take it.

570
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,966
I'll make sure she gets it.

571
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:38,534
This must be
pretty important

572
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,167
If you're hand-Delivering it
yourself.

573
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,699
Luthorcorp wants to sponsor
the residency

574
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:45,167
Of the workers
on your neighbor's farm.

575
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,600
They'll all be given jobs
at the plant.

576
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:50,066
You realize the only reason
lex is doing this

577
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,333
Is to wash his hands of it.

578
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,500
Lex had no idea

579
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,799
What was going on
on that farm.

580
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,600
Lana,
you don't believe that.

581
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:02,600
Unlike some people i know,
lex doesn't lie to me.

582
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,766
Or he just wants his name clear
of murder and slavery,

583
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:09,467
So he sends a messenger
to do his cleanup work.

584
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm not lex's messenger,
clark.

585
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,799
This was my idea.

586
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,200
I resent the fact
that you think i'm some puppet

587
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:19,500
That he can manipulate.

588
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:20,900
I didn't mean it
like that.

589
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:24,200
It's exactly
what you meant.

590
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,534
Mcnally remains
in a low-Level coma.

591
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,699
Put him with the others.

592
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:22,600
