1
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,660
- Lana,what's wrong?
- There's someone in the room.

2
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,240
Clear.

3
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,150
It's all clear,sir.

4
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,990
Lex,over there.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,890
Check the roof and initiate a full
perimeter sweep of the grounds.Brady.

6
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,560
Yes,sir.

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,420
Lana...what did this guy look like?

8
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,180
I-I don't know.
I didn't see him,but...

9
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:05,620
I could,uh,just sense that
there was someone in the room with me.

10
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,960
C-could you close the window?

11
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,340
Yeah.

12
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,660
So you didn't actually see or hear anyone?

13
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,040
No.

14
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,200
With the press tracking our every move,
it's easy to geta little paranoid.

15
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,950
Maybe you're right.

16
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,790
Maybe I just imagined the whole thing.

17
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm going to go downstairs,
get some teato calm your nerves.

21
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,810
The paparazzi's at a fever pitch,

22
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,490
and lex jets off on a business trip?

23
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,390
It's not like he left me unprotected.

24
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,480
That explains why lex's robocops
are patrolling outside.

25
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,160
I can't believe
he would just leave the country,

26
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,040
knowing that some demented stranger
broke into your bedroom.

27
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,440
I let him believe that
it was paparazzi-induced jitters.

28
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,510
You lied to lex?

29
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,230
I couldn't show him the photo that was sent to me.

30
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,700
Okay,first of all,
you're staying here until we catch norman bates.

31
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,690
And second...

32
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,760
I need to see that phone.

33
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,290
Lana,it's the only way
we're going to be able to track this guy down.

34
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,030
I don't think lex would have minded
a picture of you in your lingerie.

35
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,570
It's the chisel.

36
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,330
I think lex stabbed clark with it
after the engagement dinner.

37
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,170
So,all of this secrecy is
about that which we do not speak of?

38
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,470
Chloe,I just...

39
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,090
I just want your help catching this guy.

40
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,850
I'll find out the explanation
about clark on my own.

41
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,370
You're okay. Come on.

42
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,460
Clark?

43
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,950
What are you still doing out here?

44
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,470
Well,I'm still doing my chores.

45
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,390
Well,you usually finish those
in about two minutes.

46
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,610
How is it that I drove to metropolis,
attended the children's foundation dinner,

47
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,090
and made it back before you finished?

48
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,190
'Cause I'm doing them the normal way.

49
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,470
Ever since I landed on the paparazzi's list
of ex-boyfriends to hound,

50
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,160
I feel like someone's looking over my shoulder,

51
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,450
like I'm being watched.

52
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,530
I spent so much time
trying to stay out of the spotlight

53
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,710
that pushing lana into lex's life...
put me right in the middle of it.

54
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,440
Well,it's got to be a lot warmer
in that spotlight than it is outside.

55
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm going to go insideand make some hot cocoa

56
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,420
to thaw out the two of us
who can feel how cold it is.

57
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,360
Thank you,mrs. Kent.

58
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,170
Chloe,you look half frozen.

59
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,050
Yeah.

60
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,790
Shouldn't you be nextto a fire somewhere,
warming up next to jimmy?

61
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,060
I'm on a mocha-mint runfor lana...

62
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,680
at least that's whatI'm letting her believe.

63
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,570
She is hiding outat my apartment.

64
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,790
From what?

65
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,900
Somebody who has takento breaking,entering,

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,830
and making obligatorycreepy phone calls.

67
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,740
What's lexdoing about it?

68
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,870
She...has somevery compelling reasons
for keeping himout of the picture.

69
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,380
All right.I'll go back with you.
We can figure out a way

70
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,330
no,clark. She's fine,she's safe.
She's got lex's security guardsthere. Believe me.

71
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,060
No one's going to go near her
without them knowing about it.

72
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,390
- There's got to be something I can do.
- There is.

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
I traced the text message to a lowlife
shutterbugnamed louie esposito.

74
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,940
Now,there's nopermanent address,
but jimmyreally knows that world,

75
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,370
so,can you call himand ask him about it?

76
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,540
Call jimmy?Why don't you call him yourself?

77
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,180
I can'T.

78
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,280
We sort of broke up.

79
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,100
Does this have anythingto do with me,
keeping my secret?

80
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,920
No.

81
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,430
And yes.

82
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,110
I can't let this happen,chloe.

83
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,610
My lies have alreadypushed lana away,
and now --

84
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,950
she's a lot closerthan you think,clark.

85
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,590
This is a picture
that creepsent lana on her cellphone.

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Anything look familiar?

87
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,950
That's my dad's chisel.

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,560
Did she see lex stab me?

89
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,210
She doesn't knowwhat she saw.

90
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,590
But,clark,she's been orbiting
your secret for years,

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,280
and I think she may finally
be coming in for a landing.

92
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,000
Brady?

93
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,140
Brady?

94
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,380
I want you to wear this...

95
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,880
When I kill you

96
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,370
There she is!Miss lang! Miss lang,miss lang.

97
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,210
Lana,right here!

98
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,970
Lana!Lana!Lana!

99
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,380
Miss lang! Right here!

100
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,670
There you go. There you go.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,770
Miss lang,what are you doing?

102
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,600
There's someonein the building.

103
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
That's impossible,okay?

104
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,550
My men are guardingthe building.

105
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,540
Then how do youexplain that?

106
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,020
Whoa.I live here,remember?

107
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,400
What's going on?

108
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,020
We gota serious problem here.

109
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,790
Jimmy.

110
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,980
Hey,clark,uh,chloe's not here.

111
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,290
I know. You're actually the one
I've been looking for.

112
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,090
I had a feelingthis was coming.

113
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,810
Look,clark,despite our differences,
I think thatyou're a decent guy.

114
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,400
Chloe obviously thinks
that you can walk on air,so...

115
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,580
who am ito stand in the way?

116
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,130
Jimmy,hold on.

117
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,920
But if you hurt her...

118
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,350
I don't care
how impossibly gigantic you are,

119
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,210
I will chop you downlike a cherry tree.

120
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,530
And that...ain't no lie.

121
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,590
It's nice to see that you'd riskending up
in traction to protect chloe's honor.

122
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,990
A girl like that --

123
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,580
worth spending the restof my life in a body cast.

124
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,230
I feel the same way.

125
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,720
As her friend,nothing more.

126
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,540
I swear.

127
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,220
All right,now thatyou know that for sure,

128
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,080
maybe there's somethingbetween the two
of you you'd like to reconsider.

129
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,240
Is that what you came hereto tell me?

130
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,490
Well,that,and I need your help.

131
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,340
Lana's in trouble.

132
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,310
So,what's the "sitch"?

133
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,830
There's this paparazzi.
He's a little too into his job.

134
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,660
I need to track him down
beforehe causes any more damage.

135
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,160
You've worked with thesekind
of guys before,right?

136
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,870
Yeah,it took a week to
wash off the slime.

137
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,350
All I have is a name.
Can you help me track him down?

138
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,620
Anythingfor a friend of chloe'S.

139
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,180
I turn on the news,
and this is what I see?

140
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,720
My fiance scaredhalf out of her mind?

141
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,570
We have the situationunder control,
mr. Luthor.

142
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,940
Well,I'm sorry if I don't
share your optimistic assessment.

143
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,950
I'm cutting my trip short.
Get lana to luthorcorp plaza.

144
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,830
If anyone you don't recognizegets within
100 yards of her,you put a bullet in them!

145
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,010
Understood,sir.

146
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,800
Miss lang,we have to go.

147
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,420
- Go where?
- Luthorcorp.

148
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,240
It's the only place
that I can guarantee your safety.

149
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,640
Don't you thinkthat whoever's behind this
will think that'sthe first place I'd go?

150
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,440
Yeah,that's the first placeI would look.

151
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,790
Miss lang.

152
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,210
The only place I'll be safe is
the last place anyone would think I'd go.

153
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,350
Change of plans.Get the car ready.

154
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,480
- But mr. Luthor --
- isn't here.

155
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,080
So unless you're planningon kidnapping me

156
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,840
and holding me against my will,
I'm going to go where I want.

157
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,750
And if you're interestedin my protection...

158
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,940
then you'll followmy orders now.

159
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,140
Uh,the room is secure,miss lang.

160
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,370
The rest of the team
is postedout on the grounds.

161
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,670
Thank you.

162
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,090
I'm going to be right outside
if you need anything.

163
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,830
I'm sorry.
I know thisis a terrible intrusion.

164
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,240
If you're takingthe luthor name,

165
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,790
I guess armed guardsand dodging
the press go with the gold ring.

166
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,290
Yeah,well,I'm hoping it
won't always be that way.

167
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,190
Well,in this case,
that's not such a bad thing.

168
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,010
Is there anything elseI can do for you?

169
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,930
No,thank you.I'm just going to turn in.

170
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,370
Are you surethat clark won't mind?

171
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,730
I think he'll survivea night on the couch.

172
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,750
See you in the morning.

173
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,700
- Good night. - Good night.

174
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,930
Incoming call...restricted

175
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,320
Who is this?

176
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,190
You can't hide from me...

177
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,430
not even in clark kent'sbedroom.

178
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,480
I know everythingabout you.

179
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,600
I don't care
what you knowor how you know it,

180
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,970
but there's an armybetween us,

181
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,790
and you're never going to
get close enough to touch me.

182
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,710
I'm closer than you think,princess.

183
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,830
Brady.

184
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,700
Why are you doing this?

185
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,670
Because you deserve it.

186
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,170
Hi,sweetheart.You're okay.

187
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
You're in the hospital now,
and you're in good hands.

188
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,910
Mack called dr. Langston.

189
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,230
That was quite a fallyou took,
miss lang.

190
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,840
- All I care about is --
- the baby will be fine.

191
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,210
- Would you excuse us,please?
- Yes.

192
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,930
I'll be outside.

193
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,600
The only thing I'm concerned about
is your blood pressure,

194
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,860
which is running a little higherthan
I'm comfortable with,

195
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,530
so I'm going to give youa mild sedative,
and that'll bring it right down.

196
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,660
No.

197
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,820
No,it won't hurt the baby.I promise.

198
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,400
- Thank you,nurse.
- You're welcome,sir.

199
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,350
How is she?

200
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,880
Just a little shaken.

201
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,270
I want her transferredto a secure room.

202
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,780
Her life's still in danger
until we catch this guy.

203
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,850
Uh, there might be a place
we can use in the old wing.

204
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,800
Your team could completely secure that area.

205
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,040
Do it.

206
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,300
You sure this is the place?

207
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,300
According to my sources,this is the rock
that esposito crawls under at the end of a long day.

208
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
It looks like the parasitebusiness
doesn't pay very well.

209
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,300
Hey,don't shed any wet ones for esposito.

210
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,500
He's probably pulling in
a couple hundred "k" a year.

211
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,700
Just for taking pictures of people
who want to be left alone?

212
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,500
Who you going to blame more

213
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,300
the guy snapping the pics or the general public
that eats it up?

214
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,600
Just 'cause there's a marketdoes not make it right.

215
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Hey,check this out.(October November December)

216
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
February

217
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,200
Here,try this one.

218
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Looks like espositois definitely our guy.

219
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,500
Wait a minute.

220
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Isn't that your barn?

221
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:58,400
Uh,you two must havesomething special,C.K.

222
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,300
Mom,hi.

223
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm in metropolis with jimmy.

224
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I'll be right there.

225
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,200
What's going on?

226
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,400
Esposito attacked lana.
I got to get to the hospital.

227
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,200
Okay,well,we should grab the pics
'cause we might need themfor evidence.

228
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
C.K.?

229
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,300
Hello? Lana,it's chloe.

230
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,300
Hey,I heard what happened.Are you okay?

231
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Yeah,yeah,I'm fine.
I just don't knowwhere anyone

232
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,100
Lana.

233
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,100
What are you doing here?

234
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Your job.

235
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,000
You okay?

236
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah.

237
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,600
What happened?

238
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,600
He had a piecehidden on him.

239
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,100
I didn't have a choice.

240
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's over,miss lang.

241
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,900
Let's get you back home where you belong.

242
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,400
Lex's plane'sin the air now,
but he won't be backuntil tomorrow.

243
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
With the storm,the plane was rerouted.

244
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,900
Thank you...for everything.

245
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,900
If it wasn't for you,

246
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,800
I don't even want to think about
what would have happened.

247
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,500
I hope I'm not crossing a line,
but,honestly...

248
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,100
lex never should have left you alone.

249
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,800
When did you start calling him
by his first name?

250
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,500
Uh I'm sorry.

251
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,100
It's been a rough night.

252
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,300
Yeah,I know.

253
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,300
I don't think I've eaten
since this whole thing started.

254
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,500
Could you ask the kitchen to
bring something up for me?

255
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,500
I sent the staff and the rest of the team home.

256
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,700
I-I didn't want them
to get caught in the storm.

257
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,700
I know I should have asked you first,
but,uh no,no,it's okay.

258
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,100
It's actually very considerate.

259
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,100
Like something you'd do.

260
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,700
It's true.

261
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:25,100
You're not like all the other girls
that lex paraded in and out of here.

262
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,900
Do you remember that line?

263
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,000
Been crossinga lot of lines lately.

264
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,800
All for you,princess.

265
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,100
I watch over you every day...

266
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,400
and you never even notice.

267
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,400
You took that picture of me in my bedroom.

268
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,400
You're the one who's been calling.

269
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,800
You killed brady.

270
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,600
I wasn't supposed to.

271
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,000
He figured out that it had to be some one
on lex's security team.

272
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,600
I couldn't let him stop me from saving you.

273
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,100
Saving me?From who?

274
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,500
That photographer you killed?

275
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,500
Was he just a part of all of this?

276
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,600
He had a part to play,
but your ex messed it up.

277
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Look,I --I wanted to show you how far
I was willing to go.

278
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,600
You wanted to shoot him in front of me,didn't you?

279
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,100
But clark stopped him before you could get there.

280
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Lex is infecting you.

281
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,500
You're starting to talk like him,think like him.

282
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,200
It makes me sick what he's doing to you.

283
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,500
But I can stop it.

284
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,300
I can give you your life back.

285
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,200
You're right.

286
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,800
I never wanted any of this.

287
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,100
I didn't know what I was getting myself into.

288
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,400
And now I can't get out.

289
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,000
Please...

290
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,700
...help me.

291
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,900
It's going to be okay.

292
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I promise.

293
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,100
I'm going to save you.

294
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Why did you do that?!Lana!Lana!!

295
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,800
Lana certainly is persistent.I'll give her that.

296
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,200
Kind of like you were when you were trying
to figure out my secret.

297
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,400
It just makes me wonder if she had an ulterior motive
in hiding out in your bedroom tonight.

298
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,300
Do you think that's why she went to my house?

299
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Well,I'd like to believethat
she fled there because she feels safe there,

300
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,700
but you don't spend this much time with lex
without picking upa trick or two.

301
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,100
I mean,look at all of these pictures esposito
took of her sneaking around at your barn.

302
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Wait. What was that?

303
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,300
That one right there?

304
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,400
The children's foundation benefit.

305
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,300
My mom was there last night...

306
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,700
in metropolis.

307
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,100
So if esposito took this...

308
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,900
then he couldn't have taken that picture
of lana in her bedroom.

309
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,400
Then who did?

310
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,900
There's nowhere to go.

311
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,300
It's too late to save you,lana.

312
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,300
You were a good person once.

313
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,400
That's how I'll remember you when you're gone.

314
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,800
Clark.

315
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,200
What happened?

316
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
How did you...

317
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,900
you're safe now.

318
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,200
That's all that matters.

319
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,600
No,it isn'T.

320
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,300
You're here after...everything.

321
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,200
Why are you still watching over me?

322
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Maybe for the same reason you've been watching me.

323
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,600
So it's funny how the main streets from here
to smallville miraculously thawed out overnight.

324
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,700
You have anything to do with that?

325
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,900
Nature'sa mysterious creature.

326
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,900
Have you talked to lana?

327
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
No.We danced to this tune before,clark.

328
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm not playing pickle
in the middle anymore,remember?

329
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,900
This time it's different.

330
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,700
Lana's getting too close
to finding out my secret.

331
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
What am I supposed to do?

332
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,100
Clark,lana risked her life by not showing
that photograph to lex.

333
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,700
Royou.

334
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,100
I think she's proven where her loyalty lies.

335
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,100
Yo,C.K.

336
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,900
Thanks for fixing me up with the sucker's cocktail
in esposito's darkroom.

337
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,200
I help you out,
you leave me holding the bag for a felony.

338
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,100
That's great.

339
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,700
Jimmy,after I found out what happened to lana,

340
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,000
I had to make sure she was okay.

341
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah,I can understand that urge.

342
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,600
How is she?

343
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,900
She's good,thanks to you.

344
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
You really came through.

345
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,800
Yeah,thanks.

346
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,100
You guys should catch up.

347
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,000
You know,he's not such a bad guy.

348
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,500
Yeah.

349
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,000
But he's no jimmy olsen.

350
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,100
Does that mean that you miss me?

351
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,100
I know.

352
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,000
Me too.

353
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,100
God,I'm a lucky man.

354
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,100
Lana...

355
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,100
I can't tell you how powerless
I felt not being able to help you.

356
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,400
Everything's okay.

357
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,900
We're okay.

358
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,800
My security chiefat luthorcorp plaza said
you never made it there.

359
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
What happened?

360
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,700
I went to the kent farm instead.

361
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,600
Lex,you weren't here,
and I had to trust my instincts.

362
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,600
You taught me that.

363
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,000
And those instincts led you to the place 
your ex-boyfriend happens to live.

364
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,200
I went to the kent farm because I thought
it was the last place anyone would look for me.

365
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,700
That's the only reason.

366
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Then that's good enough for me.

367
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,500
Lana...

368
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,400
above anything else,I trust you.

369
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,200
And I love you.

370
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,200
Looks like you're working out some issues there.

371
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,900
Just doing a little honest work,lex.

372
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,500
You should try it sometime.

373
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,900
Why start now?

374
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,700
My life's perfect.

375
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,700
What do you want?

376
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,500
Nothing.

377
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,100
I just wanted to take a little sleigh
ride down memory lane,

378
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,400
visit the scene of the crime.

379
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,100
Hey,here's where you took my fianc after
kidnapping her...

380
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
right before you tried to kill me.

381
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,700
I wasn't myself that night.

382
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,700
I'm sorry.

383
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
Sorry?

384
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,300
What,that you didn't finish the job?

385
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,000
You know,I'm still a bit fuzzyon the details
what with you trying to choke the life out of me,

386
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,700
but what fascinates me is how after all that,

387
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,900
lana could still feel safe coming here.

388
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,900
That was her choice.

389
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,900
I had nothing to do with it.

390
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,700
You never do.

391
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,000
That's all right.

392
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,200
You see,I understand the all ure of trying
to unravel the mystery of clark kent.

393
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,800
I suffered from it once,too...

394
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
when I thought you mattered.

395
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,500
Are we done?

396
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,500
Nothing left but the formalities.

397
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Ms.Lana Lang and Mr.Lex Luthor

398
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,800
Don't look so surprised,clark.

399
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,600
Lana still cares about you.I know that.

400
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,400
And I know what it would mean
to her having you there.

401
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,300
Is that really what you want,lex?

402
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,500
What I want?

403
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,800
What I want is to make lana happy
for the rest of her life.

404
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,800
And I want you to be there on our wedding day...

405
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,400
to see what you lost.

406
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,600
Make sure you rsvp.

407
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
We need a head count for the reception.
