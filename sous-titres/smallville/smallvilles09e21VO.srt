1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,751
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,918
When you saw my fate, what did you see?

3
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:07,958
You will lead this generation,
a silver age of heroism.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,003
I started the training
Jor-El always planned for me.

5
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,879
- Do you believe in fate?
- Only the kind you make happen.

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,564
Blue Kryptonite takes
away my abilities, too.

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,229
- No strings, no ribbons.
- It's just a gift.

8
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:26,083
<i>- I've been talking to The Blur.
- The question is am i enough?</i>

9
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,197
You can't protect us
if we know who you are.

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,116
<i>Then you shall be the Savior of Kandor.</i>

11
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:38,328
The last thing we remember is
our blood being taken in Kandor.

12
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,488
How did we get here?

13
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,634
- I'll be in touch.
- There are aliens here on our planet.

14
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,337
You get to write a
story with Perry White.

15
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,095
You lied about having
powers. How'd you get them?

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,208
From your blood.

17
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,978
The time has come to
share in your birthright.

18
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:57,300
Zod's been looking for something that wields
great power. Who knows what he will do?

19
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,766
The humans killed the
mother of my unborn child.

20
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:02,343
The last time that I saw
Faora, she was with Zod.

21
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:05,796
- Why should they believe you?
- The Book of Rau isn't here.

22
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:09,303
You say you're saving the planet
but you only care about yourself.

23
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,096
The Book of Rau can
transport the Kandorians

24
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:14,865
to another plane of
existence, including you.

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,767
- I need your help.
- Anything.

26
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:19,203
I finished tracing our
rogue Blur. It was Zod.

27
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:23,004
If anyone calls claiming to
be me, don't believe them.

28
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,446
Kneel before Zod.

29
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,878
Soon, the world will need
all the help it can get.

30
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:33,737
<i>Now the season finale of "Smallville."</i>

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,450
If you remember,

32
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:45,839
I'm the one who said 2012 would be
just another y2k scare and I was right.

33
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:48,954
Not to fear, White. If there's
a scandal in the Pentagon,

34
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,470
<i>yours truly will be the one to find it.</i>

35
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,031
Seven calls from the State Department
confirmation on your flight to Jordan,

36
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:01,594
fruit basket from the Dalai
Lama and Clark's at the deli.

37
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,415
He wants to know if you
want pastrami or roast beef.

38
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,019
Clark would forget his head if
it wasn't attached with a necktie.

39
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,878
There's something else.

40
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,932
Luthor is making a
play for the oval office

41
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:19,962
and White has me playing dodge ball

42
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:22,481
with armchair quarterbacks
at the Pentagon?!

43
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,214
I can't believe it!

44
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,241
News helicopter lost power!

45
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,972
<i>It's heading straight
for The Daily Planet!</i>

46
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,421
You had better be getting
every pixel of this.

47
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,318
Look, up in the sky!

48
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,324
Your fate is utterly binding.

49
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:55,180
You will lead this generation
as hawkman once led ours.

50
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,188
Smallville 9x21
- Salvation

51
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:58,383
Synchro : Flolo

52
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:36,942
For Seriessub.com/soustitre.eu

53
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,523
I thought you said
we'd never talk again.

54
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,779
I'm glad you broke radio
silence, but why now?

55
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,863
<i>How can you be The Blur?</i>

56
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:27,579
That alien snatcher, Chisholm, shot you.

57
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,792
I saw the wound.

58
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,293
My powers cured me.

59
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,516
Clark Kent's mild-mannered FBI friend

60
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,841
is the guy who's always saving my butt?

61
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:46,697
You were willing to risk
your life to save me.

62
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,556
<i>You are my hero.</i>

63
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,210
My hero told me not to trust
anyone that said he was The Blur.

64
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,651
I know I did.

65
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:02,158
But I had no one else to
turn to. Lois, please...

66
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,333
I need your help again.

67
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:12,563
Someone is becoming dangerously close
to discovering who I am, if they do,

68
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,999
they could destroy
everything I've worked for.

69
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,128
It's Clark Kent.

70
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,124
I'm sorry. I think all that
superspeeding has crisscrossed your wires,

71
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,176
because Clark would never harm anyone.

72
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,224
I know you don't want to
see it, Lois, but it's true.

73
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,686
It's why he told you
to stay away from me.

74
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,058
It's why he took away
the charm I gave you.

75
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,234
He knows what we mean to each other.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,709
I will admit that Clark's played
the jealousy card once or twice.

77
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,451
But you're wrong about him.

78
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,709
You don't have to take my word for it.

79
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:56,157
You are the best
investigator I've known.

80
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,958
Now, you dig a little deeper...

81
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,414
but I guarantee you'll find that
Clark Kent is not who he says he is.

82
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,263
Even though Watchtower's
back in the game,

83
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:16,543
I'm still coming up empty-handed
on the Kandorian front.

84
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,791
It's like they vanished into thin air.

85
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,732
That might have something to do
with the fact that they can fly.

86
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:24,107
Sarcasm noted.

87
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,785
<i>How do we know these people
aren't half a galaxy away already?</i>

88
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,701
Zod doesn't want to play Thunderdome
on a planet that is desolate.

89
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,688
He needs people to rule over.

90
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:35,458
I have a feeling that is
coming soon to a planet near us.

91
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,631
<i>I'm heading back to Watchtower.</i>

92
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,945
<i>If a war breaks out, i want
to be in the foxhole with you.</i>

93
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,831
<i>Because...</i>

94
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:50,833
Right, because we need to
protect Watchtower's database.

95
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,203
<i>Yeah, the database is, is important.</i>

96
00:07:57,964 --> 00:07:59,686
<i>Over and out.</i>

97
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:04,421
Everyone's mobilizing.
They're all out on the field...

98
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:07,359
Kryptonite weapons? That's
only gonna stall them.

99
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,296
We're no match for the Kandorians,
even when we work together.

100
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,965
It's only a matter of time
before Zod commands his soldiers

101
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,868
- to bring the world to its knees.
- Then let's move on to plan "A."

102
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:18,949
I assume you brought the
infamous secret weapon.

103
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:26,684
I still don't understand
how the Red Queen of the Kent

104
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,799
<i>farm knew about the Book of Rau.</i>

105
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,974
My mom inherited the Kryptonian
library when Lionel died.

106
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,554
It's no surprise that Zod would lie.

107
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,512
The Book of Rau is not a bible.

108
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,692
It was created by Jor-El to send
the Kandorians to another world.

109
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,812
A world they could call their own.

110
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:44,829
Let's fire up this
intergalactic subway token

111
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,525
and send our visitors on
a fast train to Nirvana.

112
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,838
I can't.

113
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:52,953
Once it's activated, it sends
all Kryptonians to the new world.

114
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,410
Including you.

115
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,378
I know my destiny, and it's here.

116
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:01,790
I've seen it. Dr. Fate has seen it, too.

117
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,917
And Jor-El has sent me
on trials to prove it.

118
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:08,139
I finally know who I am

119
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:11,316
and what I'm meant to do here
on earth. I'm not leaving.

120
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:18,522
No one wants to see you reach
your true potential more than I do.

121
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:22,311
I've been with you through every
bump along this insane ride.

122
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,604
But what if every trial

123
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,358
has just been a preparation for
you to make the ultimate sacrifice?

124
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:32,091
Then why would my father have
gone silent in the fortress?

125
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:36,468
If this was a trial, my father would never
skip on any chance to give me a lecture.

126
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,072
<i>Because this isn't a trial.</i>

127
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,987
And maybe your father disappeared on you

128
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,957
because he knew you needed to
make this last mile on your own.

129
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,102
Then it's up to me

130
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,619
and I think there's
another way to save Zod.

131
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,933
<i>Jor-El did not tell you to
stay here and be our guardian.</i>

132
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,323
Are you saying it's selfish
for me to try to save people?

133
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:56,052
<i>You think I want you to go?</i>

134
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,037
I can't imagine being in
this world without you.

135
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:03,475
You've inspired an entire team of
heroes who will be here to protect us.

136
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:07,870
And maybe your true purpose
is to lead your own people.

137
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,682
You've refused to speak to me, Jor-El.

138
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:22,919
Now I'll make sure you'll
never speak to your son again...

139
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,457
and share the secrets of Rau with him.

140
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,008
You're not welcome here.

141
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:39,278
I've been playing hide-and-seek with
this ice castle for over two years.

142
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:43,418
So the least you can do is just
give me a minute to take it all in.

143
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,649
- It's breathtaking.
- How did you get here?

144
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,210
I flew.

145
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,619
Icarus flew to where he didn't belong.

146
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:59,822
And he fell to his
death from the heavens.

147
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,876
Icarus was on an ego trip.

148
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:08,053
But I have a higher calling.

149
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,712
I was made to see the error of my ways.

150
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,798
I'm here...

151
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,273
to redeem myself.

152
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,308
It's too late.

153
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,316
My people discovered
you had the Book of Rau

154
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:29,646
and hid it from me.

155
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:32,648
I won't forgive that deception.

156
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,902
It's not your forgiveness
that I'm looking for.

157
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,496
I've seen the future.

158
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,103
And you enslave this planet...

159
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:50,417
and destroy anyone
that ever opposed you!

160
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,422
Including Clark.

161
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,742
And the Red Queen made me realize.

162
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,885
I won't let you kill him.

163
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:08,157
You touched the sun when
you freed me from the orb.

164
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,218
You're about to learn what
it feels like to get burned.

165
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:28,209
I know that you told me to save Zod...

166
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,704
but I won't.

167
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:34,404
Not if it means leaving
everyone I promised to protect.

168
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,759
Now, my destiny is here on Earth.

169
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:40,795
And if everything that
you've trained me for

170
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,255
was for another purpose,
then it was a waste,

171
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,263
because I'm staying.

172
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:50,197
There must be some
other way to stop Zod.

173
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:02,784
Your father can't help you anymore.

174
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,806
I made sure of that.

175
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,376
My people are overtaking this planet,

176
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,415
and you can't stop me.

177
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,625
You want war, but it
doesn't have to be like this.

178
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,670
Have you taken a look around
you? It's always like this!

179
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,506
Might makes right!

180
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,633
Only the strong survive!

181
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:26,805
Have you learned nothing from the
natural world in which you love so much?

182
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,596
What I've learned is that no matter how
much someone has hurt you or betrayed you

183
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,858
or how much it seems
that someone is evil,

184
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,896
at their core, everyone is worth saving.

185
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,566
What exactly do you think
you're saving me from?

186
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,235
From making another mistake like Faora.

187
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:50,609
Do you really think there's
redemption for what I did?

188
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:53,081
- It's never too late.
- How would you know?

189
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,584
Because I killed my own father.

190
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:01,660
<i>My Earth father warned
me not to play God...</i>

191
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:04,202
not to reach for power that's not mine.

192
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,554
But I tempted fate, and
because of that, he died.

193
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:13,344
You have to forgive yourself.

194
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,272
My entire team is equipped
with Kryptonite weapons.

195
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,662
Hardly a match for my battalion.

196
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,651
Too many people will die.

197
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,404
You need to end this now.

198
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,814
You can't win.

199
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,825
I know my destiny.

200
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,785
And I know mine.

201
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,478
You never give up, do you, Perry?

202
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:52,155
I'm so sorry...

203
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,167
I tracked... Corben to
locate your fortress.

204
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:01,714
And I did it only to save you from Zod.

205
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,280
I have the Book of Rau, Tess.

206
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,203
But even if I wanted to use it, I can't,

207
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:10,132
because Zod destroyed the
console in the fortress.

208
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,722
You don't need the fort-tress.

209
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,581
When the Kandorians...

210
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:20,126
were building the Rau Tower...

211
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:23,982
they put together these
crystals as an energy source

212
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,029
when they were trying
to turn the sun red.

213
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,795
And I think these crystals will also...

214
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,699
power the Book of Rau.

215
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,784
I aready destroyed the tower.

216
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:39,831
I pulled the console from the rubble...

217
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,714
and moved it...

218
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,794
to your crow's nest a-above the city.

219
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,244
This is my last chance

220
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,830
to atone for my sins.

221
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,502
You...

222
00:16:57,627 --> 00:17:00,352
are the only one that can save us.

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,063
And you've run out of time.

224
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,099
The war has already begun.

225
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,591
I think we have a little bit more
time before the U.N. gets involved.

226
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,150
All our Queen Industry sources

227
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,666
say that our military friends
believe this is just some hoax.

228
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,292
Any new activity?

229
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,028
<i>This is Stargirl online
from the nation's capital.</i>

230
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,172
<i>No sign of the Kandorians
after te attack.</i>

231
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,508
<i>Black Canary here.
Story's the same in Athens.</i>

232
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,735
<i>All I found in Giza are mummies.</i>

233
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,970
<i>We need to flush these aliens out.</i>

234
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,639
<i>I've been around long enough</i>

235
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,642
<i>to know the best way to win
a war is to strike first.</i>

236
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,084
No, that's the best way to win
a bowling tournament, Tweety.

237
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,230
We're dealing with
superpowered soldiers here.

238
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,882
<i>Just as expected, Mr.
Green jeans has gone yellow.</i>

239
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:32,660
The Kandorians are Clark's people.

240
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,585
So we're not gonna
take any sort of action

241
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,638
<i>- until he's with us.
- Watchtower's right.</i>

242
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:39,925
<i>I agree with Hawkman. We wait too
long, they'll have the advantage.</i>

243
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,147
- We hold off until Kal- El has a chance
to. - how long we gonna wait, Martian.

244
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:46,083
<i>- long enough from them to wipe us out?
- We wait, the Kandorians win.</i>

245
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,267
<i>Zod's symbols say one
thing, he wants a fight.</i>

246
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,338
<i>I say we move now and cause some pain.</i>

247
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,872
At what cost?

248
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,178
Your abilities allow
you to come back, Carter.

249
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,322
After you die but what about
the others on both sides?

250
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:04,392
<i>So you want us to play nice?</i>

251
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,556
The Kandorians have
been led astray by Zod.

252
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,602
I don't want to see them die

253
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,650
any more than I want
to lose any one of you.

254
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,737
I will use the Book of Rau...

255
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,325
to send them all away.

256
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,203
I've made my decision.

257
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,666
Once I lead my people to another
world, I'll never be able to come back.

258
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:36,297
<i>- You need to think about this.
- What about your life here?</i>

259
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,705
<i>- There's got to be another way.
- With us by your side,</i>

260
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,468
<i>you don't have to do this alone.</i>

261
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:43,428
This is the only peaceful
way to eliminate the threat.

262
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:47,201
Without a war, a war
that no one will win...

263
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,488
once the Kandorians are gone there
will be other threats to mankind.

264
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:54,190
The world will need you.

265
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:59,062
You'll have to work together to become
the team that you were meant to be.

266
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:04,709
I once believed that my
destiny was here on earth,

267
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,621
but now you need to
accept that destiny for me.

268
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:12,918
<i>Clark's right.</i>

269
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,239
<i>We'll protect the world... As one.</i>

270
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:19,893
It has been my honor to serve
alongside each and everyone one of you.

271
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,794
<i>The honor was ours, Kal-El.</i>

272
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,485
I'm proud of you.

273
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:43,157
You got to let her go, Clark.

274
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,221
She's trying to be strong, you know?

275
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:51,499
When your oldest friend leaves forever,
there's really no way to say goodbye.

276
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,764
That said, I think we both know there're
someone else you need to see one last time.

277
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:03,150
Considering everything Lois
and I have been through,

278
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,125
I don't think that's such a good idea.

279
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,139
You owe her the truth.

280
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:11,950
I want to open up to
her more than anything.

281
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:16,397
But why tell Lois who I really
am, only to rip it away from her?

282
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,901
Wouldn't that hurt her more?

283
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,863
I wouldn't do that to her.

284
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,490
That doesn't mean you
can't at least say goodbye.

285
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,774
General.

286
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:45,310
Have you retrieved the Book of Rau?

287
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:49,957
Sir, if Kal-El still holds it,

288
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:53,752
- you said he'd use it to kill us all.
- Do not question my resolve.

289
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,405
I will not fail.

290
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,525
I will destroy the Book of Rau. Do
you not have a mission to complete?

291
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,676
Kal-El's comrades have been lured
to your crests, just as you ordered.

292
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:08,809
So they have to have been
dispersed around the world,

293
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:11,445
and Kal-El is alone in Metropolis.

294
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,539
Our soldiers have cut
off their communications.

295
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,351
All their satellites
have been destroyed.

296
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,857
Then by dawn, we'll
have the Book of Rau.

297
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:28,887
And this planet will be ours.

298
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:40,226
We lost all satellite
communication. I can't reach anybody.

299
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:42,442
It's like everyone I sent
out there is a sitting duck

300
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,893
and Zod's about to call
a start to hunting season.

301
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:47,992
Take a breath. You've stared
down the barrel of a gun before.

302
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,960
We're dealing with like 100 Clarks here. I
don't know if I can dodge this speeding bullet.

303
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:55,039
You're not in it alone. We're
a team, right? You got me?

304
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,334
Trust me.

305
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,607
Thank you.

306
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,738
But I don't think talking me off a ledge

307
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:05,095
is gonna help us solve
our technical difficulties.

308
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,741
<i>Okay, then maybe this will.</i>

309
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:10,098
When Tess broke into our
little clubhouse here,

310
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:14,116
I had Queen Industries launch an
orbiter dedicated to Watchtower.

311
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:17,667
Wait a minute.

312
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,975
<i>We have our own satellite?</i>

313
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,417
Yeah. Why didn't you
tell me this before?

314
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,318
It was sort of a gift.

315
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:30,628
I guess giving you a sweater for your
birthday Is sort of out of the question now.

316
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,308
The satellite's up and running,

317
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,829
but the transponders haven't
been initiated for downlink yet.

318
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:38,961
I'm gonna need to flip
a couple of switches

319
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,720
at the earth station in order
to be able to spy from the sky.

320
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:44,616
Then we should just stay in
touch the old-fashioned way.

321
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,159
I mean...

322
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:48,628
If Zod has been trying to
destroy satellites from space,

323
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,924
he's definitely not gonna be happy that
you're putting another satellite online.

324
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:56,401
Do me a favor, okay?
Just keep a low profile.

325
00:24:03,214 --> 00:24:06,303
I'm wearing green leather,
so I'll do my best.

326
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,852
How could a guy who kept a journal
in High School ever hurt anyone?

327
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,286
I've been looking all over for you.

328
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:01,454
Funny. Me too.

329
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:05,270
I have something I need to tell
you. And if I don't tell you now...

330
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:10,691
I never will. I know that things
have been rocky between us, but...

331
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:14,804
I'm listening.

332
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:19,542
My whole life has been full of
relationships that have ended too soon.

333
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,568
And then when I went
away last fall, I...

334
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:27,545
Lois, I felt so lost.

335
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,304
When I came back to the bullpen...

336
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:35,968
you were there waiting for me.

337
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:41,220
You jumped out of your seat,
you threw your arms around me

338
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:44,357
and the way that your eyes
sparkled when you smiled, I just...

339
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:46,961
I knew.

340
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:52,264
I just knew that you were the
one that I've always needed.

341
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,393
And I needed you to know that.

342
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,558
What is it?

343
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:07,844
He's offered me a job at
the foreign desk in Kenya.

344
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:27,672
That's great. Congratulations.

345
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:32,048
I'm not sure I'm going.

346
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,089
Lois, your...

347
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:38,860
your career is so important to
you, what would make you stay?

348
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,704
<i>For you.</i>

349
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,102
<i>I would stay for you.</i>

350
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,383
Clark, as important as
my career is to me...

351
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,991
you are more important.

352
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,151
I would give up Africa...

353
00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:00,451
to be with you.

354
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:06,907
But only if we stop keeping
secrets from each other.

355
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:15,675
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,113
Yeah, you do, Clark.

357
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:26,180
Come on.

358
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:31,315
<i>I need you to be honest with me.</i>

359
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,297
Lois, there's nothing to tell you.

360
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,207
I think you leaving
Metropolis is the best thing...

361
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:43,099
for you right now.

362
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:53,963
Just now that wherever you
are, I'll be watching over you.

363
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,156
I'll be thinking of you.

364
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:04,450
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,265
I should go.

366
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,703
Doctor!

367
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,747
- Her blood pressure's dropping.
- Oxygen.

369
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,987
Hurry up. We're losing her.

370
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:34,879
- 10 mil epi...
- charge to 200!

371
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,237
- Charging.
- Clear!

372
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:38,799
- No pulse.
- Charge to 250.

373
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,332
Clear!

374
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,258
No response.

375
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:45,808
Let's call it.

376
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,952
Time of death... 3:33 P.M.

377
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:53,383
Call the morgue. Have them send
somebody up to collect the body.

378
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:16,491
- Houston, we got a problem.
- Are you at the satellite station yet?

379
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,785
Yeah, I'm way ahead of
you, but I'm a little lost.

380
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,254
I need you to be my own personal
mapquest if you don't mind.

381
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:27,056
- All right, what's your 20?
- I'm inside the air ducts right now.

382
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,467
Access to the main grid is
through one of the routing panels.

383
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:33,288
Mole man, just think happy
thoughts and keep on tunneling.

384
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:35,830
Let me know when you've reached the "t."

385
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:37,981
I hate small spaces.

386
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:42,980
Completed the first
level. I'm at the "t."

387
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:45,598
Now, halfway through the second tunnel,

388
00:29:45,723 --> 00:29:48,530
on your left-hand side, you're
gonna find three panels. The one with

389
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:51,622
JJ-910-60
is...

390
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,597
the one in the middle, yeah, I got it.

391
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,839
You got to admit, I know how
to treat a girl on date night.

392
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,801
Next week, do you think maybe we could
grab some thai food and catch a movie?

393
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,711
That sounds like a good plan,

394
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:11,237
but for tonight, you're gonna have
to settle for stream satellite video.

395
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,761
The link is up!

396
00:30:15,886 --> 00:30:19,176
Why don't you make your way home? I'm
gonna see if I can access the building

397
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:22,403
schematics and find you a
less cramped return trip.

398
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,540
The station's motion
sensors have picked you up.

399
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,244
No. You've got visitors.

400
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,835
There's a whole swarm of them,
and they're closing in on you fast.

401
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,088
<i>You need to get out of there now.</i>

402
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:41,328
If they find the signal,
they'll trace me back to you!

403
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:44,033
- I got to go!
- No, Ollie, no!

404
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:49,583
I love you!

405
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,770
<i>I love you!</i>

406
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,772
Chloe, they're not Kandorian!

407
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,521
<i>I knew i could count on you.</i>

408
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:44,276
I still can't believe you
were right about Clark.

409
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:47,978
Just when it seems that
you're out of my life for good,

410
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,771
you turn out to be the one
person I can believe in.

411
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,911
My only regret is I
can see your heartbreak.

412
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:01,490
It's not broken.

413
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,099
It's shattered.

414
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:10,900
I know how hard it is to
discover the person you love...

415
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:14,666
is not what you think they were.

416
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:23,320
I will never deceive you
like Clark did... ever.

417
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,113
Now I need the Book of Rau.

418
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:36,082
I can't.

419
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:38,152
I hid it.

420
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,689
I was worried that
Clark would follow me.

421
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,794
Where is it?

422
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,552
I hid it where I confessed to you

423
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,534
that you were the most
important person in my life.

424
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,973
This is not a game.

425
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:02,646
You're not really him.

426
00:33:09,217 --> 00:33:13,221
I should've known better than to
deceive The Blur's most devoted follower.

427
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,150
<i>- Just who the hell are you?
- Unlike The Blur,</i>

428
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,842
I'm someone who doesn't
care whether you live or die.

429
00:34:32,007 --> 00:34:35,239
Can you ever forgive me
for thinking he was you?

430
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,378
Please say something.

431
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,783
Anything.

432
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,500
You can't stop me. We're
leaving this planet.

433
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,753
<i>I'm not going anywhere.
And neither are they.</i>

434
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,853
Having others finish a
fight that you started

435
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,946
only proves what a coward you are.

436
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:29,182
My soldiers know I have never
wavered in the face of death.

437
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:31,415
All you've ever done
is hide in the shadows.

438
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,563
You've hidden, too...

439
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,722
the truth from them.

440
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,955
The Book of Rau will not destroy us!

441
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,101
It will lead us to a better place...

442
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:44,799
another planet where
we can live in peace,

443
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:47,384
where we an build a new home.

444
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:50,995
<i>Krypton will live again.</i>

445
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,017
This is just another one of his deceits.

446
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:56,590
We all know where his allegiance lies.

447
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,821
<i>What about your deceptions?</i>

448
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:01,713
If they knew the truth,
they'd never follow you.

449
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,127
My men willingly follow me.

450
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:07,307
And what about Faora? All
she wanted was to leave you.

451
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,061
- That is a lie!
- And she paid for it with her life.

452
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,836
Faora never should've trusted you.

453
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,931
But she wasn't the only one
who paid the price, was she?

454
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,404
Faora was a traitor.

455
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,672
Do you think I wanted
to kill my own child?

456
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:48,432
Your sister was a traitor.

457
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:58,905
She would've betrayed us al.

458
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:09,674
Wait!

459
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:14,374
We will deal with him
once we're on our own soil.

460
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:24,197
Kal-El, take us home.

461
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,393
Blue Kryptonite.

462
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:17,646
I told you. I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,195
You knew the blue Kryptonite would
prevent you from ascending like the others!

464
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,295
Better to rule in hell
than to serve in heaven.

465
00:39:36,237 --> 00:39:39,751
Seeing as you love the humans so
much, let's see if you fight like one!

466
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,935
Unlike you, I will lead from
a throne, not from the shadows.

467
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,968
Every human, including the woman
you love, will kneel before Zod!

468
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,617
You already destroyed my first
home. I won't let you take this one.
