1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,133
<i>Previously on "smallville"...
we've come from the 31st century.</i>

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,801
We are the legion.

3
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:07,133
- Arrow...
- canary, impulse...

4
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:10,067
watchtower is officially online.

5
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,667
Tess mercer, acting
c.e.o. Of luthorcorp.

6
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>You're my boss?</i>

7
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,400
We'll always be there for each other.

8
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:16,434
Forever.

9
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,100
I have put up

10
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:19,868
with you taking someone
else's side over mine ...

11
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,534
first clark and then davis?

12
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,300
I won't kill clark if i'm with you.

13
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:25,434
The darkness ...  it doesn't
come out when chloe's around.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,033
She makes me...human.

15
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,400
Please don't try and find us.

16
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:33,701
I will find a way to save you.

17
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,834
I took lex luthor's life.

18
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:39,534
You're responsible for the explosion.

19
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,033
You got good instincts, jimmy.

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,367
There's an opening on my staff,

21
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:44,501
and something tells me
you'd be perfect for it.

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,934
Say that clark kent, the
unassuming journalist...

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,234
steps out of the shadow
into his red and blue,

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,667
creating two completely
separate identities?

25
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,400
When i'm ready to tell
the world my secret,

26
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,734
you'll be the first to know.

27
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,968
I'm only a phone call away.

28
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,467
I destroyed the legion ring.

29
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,501
Controlling time ... it's too dangerous.

30
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,133
Be careful in the days ahead.

31
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,400
There is a savior among us.

32
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,901
And until you fulfill your destiny,

33
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,901
he won't have his great
challenge to overcome.

34
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,067
I am not some problem to be solved.

35
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,100
I get it. It's too early.

36
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:24,100
Why are you so determined
to see davis bloome die?

37
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,300
An entire civilization's
survival depends on it.

38
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:31,067
<i>And now the season
finale of "smallville."</i>

39
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,534
Thanks for meeting me.

40
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,234
I'm not the one who had to travel

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,434
1,000 years to get here.

42
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,667
Yeah, well, i just hope
that i'm not too late.

43
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:57,968
For what?

44
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,567
The future.

45
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:04,133
Now, i know that anytime we travel back,

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
we take the chance of disrupting fate.

47
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,400
And to be honest with you, kal,

48
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,200
after coming back here and
trying to change the future,

49
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,100
i might not have one to go back to.

50
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,434
Look, i don't understand.

51
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,100
You said the future would be safe

52
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,501
if we got rid of brainiac.

53
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,300
Yes.

54
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,667
Everything is safe.

55
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:25,801
Brainiac is gone...

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,734
... but so are you.

57
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,367
When you saved chloe's life,

58
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:36,334
you saved her connection to doomsday.

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,267
She stopped you from sending
him to the phantom zone.

60
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:40,734
She made him invulnerable

61
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:43,234
by trying to kill him with kryptonite.

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,968
And now because of chloe,
you cannot defeat him.

63
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:52,334
I'd never take back
my choice to save her.

64
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,133
I believe yours got a little...scorched.

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,567
Use the ring.

66
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,801
Send doomsday to the future.

67
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,367
The legion's there, and
we are ready to fight him.

68
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,868
<i>The legion didn't
unleash doomsday. I did.</i>

69
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,234
Kal-el!

70
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,067
You need to understand that
there is nothing on this earth

71
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,634
that will stop him from killing you.

72
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:32,200
My father always told me i
was sent here to save mankind.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,601
Maybe this is my true destiny.

74
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,567
How much time do i have?

75
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,501
Tomorrow is the day you die.

76
00:03:54,567 --> 00:04:01,901
Smallville 822 Doomsday

For Serieessub.com

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,234
maybe it's sleep deprivation,

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,301
but i can't exactly see

81
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:52,234
a toga-clad woman in
the stars up there.

82
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,367
It's demeter.

83
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:57,934
And her daughter, persephone,

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,234
was taken by hades to the underworld.

85
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:05,834
And demeter ... she
enlisted the gods' help

86
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,301
to find her daughter,

87
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,700
but when hades offered persephone

88
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,201
her chance at freedom,

89
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,800
to everyone's surprise,

90
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:18,501
persephone chose to live underground

91
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,501
with the dark prince.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,201
We're actually gonna
pull this off, aren't we?

93
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:35,468
Find someplace to...slow
down, build a life together.

94
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:39,633
As long as we can keep
the gods from hunting us.

95
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,034
Tell me you have a
lock on their location.

96
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,034
We traced the radiation left on bloome

97
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,534
after he attacked neutron,

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,700
but we've got another problem.

99
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,434
What the hell.

100
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,767
Oh, my god.

101
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,267
We heard an explosion.

102
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,167
Then the security
cameras and power pulsed.

103
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:15,501
We thought a transformer
had blown outside.

104
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:18,000
The orb ... someone stole the orb.

105
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,101
No one could have broken
in here without ...

106
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,067
you just said that the system went down!

107
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:23,700
Only for a few seconds.

108
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,767
But, miss mercer, you should know

109
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,000
that our security believes

110
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:33,201
the door was blown off from the inside.

111
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:38,767
You have no idea how
many lives are at stake.

112
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,434
Find that orb.

113
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,067
Chloe's missing with some beastie boy,

114
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:18,534
and you're doing what exactly?

115
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:25,067
No one wants to find
chloe more than i do.

116
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,067
Except maybe me.

117
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:28,934
Clark, i haven't slept in days,

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,401
and i am dangerously
close to a caffeine o.d.

119
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:34,101
I hadn't noticed.

120
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,733
Okay.

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,501
Do you want to at least tell me

122
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,667
about this little
novella you're working on

123
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,067
that's so important?

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,733
No.

125
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,834
Great.

126
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,167
Another ricochet off the
impenetrable force field.

127
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,401
Forget it.

128
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,468
Hello.

129
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,967
Miss lane.

130
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:30,267
It's you.

131
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:33,468
I've been searching
for your cousin chloe.

132
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,301
I am gonna find her.

133
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,900
How did you even know she was missing?

134
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,834
I've been keeping an eye on you.

135
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:52,900
To be honest, i...was...

136
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,067
kind of hoping for that.

137
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,767
But i didn't know how to call you,

138
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,267
and then now, all of a sudden,

139
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,667
here you are out of ... out
of nowhere to save the day,

140
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,468
and i just ...

141
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,000
i'm rambling again.

142
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:10,700
You just make me so, um...

143
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,101
i don't know

144
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,167
how i'll ever be able
to repay you for this.

145
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,733
You could do me a favor.

146
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:27,167
I need you to publish a letter for me.

147
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,667
What letter?

148
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,201
You're here, aren't you?

149
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,000
You're not supposed to open it yet.

150
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,334
Can i count on you
to publish that letter

151
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:57,101
if anything happens to me?

152
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,501
"Goodbye"?

153
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,568
What do you mean "goodbye"?

154
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:09,633
Sometimes, we can't outrun our destiny.

155
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,301
But i thought you were invincible.

156
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,267
So did i.

157
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,800
I want to meet you.

158
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,867
I have to see your face.

159
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,800
I have to see you.

160
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,800
I-i want you to show me what
you can't show anyone else

161
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,800
you can trust me. Please.

162
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry. That's not a good idea.

163
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,534
Look, you can come through this.

164
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>You have to.</i>

165
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:50,234
And when you do...

166
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,468
how do you feel about phone booths?

167
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,633
They're fine.

168
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,534
Um, there's one on 4th and main.

169
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,201
Let's say midnight.

170
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:05,600
I'll be there.

171
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,067
I hope you'll be there, too.

172
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:12,633
And thank you.

173
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,067
If anyone can save chloe...

174
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,767
i know it's you.

175
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,467
What's the 911?

176
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:46,434
Thanks for meeting me.

177
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,400
I thought bart was supposed to be ...

178
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,968
present and accounted for.

179
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,667
Were you able to get the schematics?

180
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:55,100
What do you think?

181
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,234
Geothermal facility

182
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,601
care of queen industry and luthorcorp.

183
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,767
All right, what's with the black hole?

184
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,100
Rokk said nothing on
the face of the earth

185
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,434
could destroy the beast.

186
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,868
So let's put him under it.

187
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,000
The geothermal facility

188
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:25,033
created one mile of tunnels
beneath the earth's crust.

189
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,701
So it's the final resting place
for the bony space invader.

190
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,701
If i can manage to get him down there,

191
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,901
can you access the
detonators in the shaft?

192
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,133
I can override it.

193
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,534
Are we really gonna bury him alive?

194
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:36,801
Not all of him.

195
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:39,567
There's still a side
of davis worth saving.

196
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:48,167
Bart, this is for you.

197
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,934
It's a rock.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,534
Careful with that.

199
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,601
It's a very special meteor rock.

200
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,367
It can split the kryptonian
from the human side of davis.

201
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:02,033
And what if that doesn't work?

202
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,634
What if you end up unleashing
a monster that's unstoppable,

203
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,267
that doesn't have a conscience?

204
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,100
This is the only option.

205
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, what about the option of
getting rid of a serial killer

206
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,801
before he has a chance to beast out?

207
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:19,100
You've never wanted to admit it...

208
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,534
but there is a darker side to humanity.

209
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,367
I know there is.

210
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:29,033
I'm looking at it right now.

211
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,434
Not everyone's worth saving.

212
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:34,501
We need to take care of davis bloome.

213
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,467
And by "take care of," you mean murder?

214
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,634
Okay, dudes, you guys have
got, like, some [chuckles]

215
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,467
some ...  some serious
tension going on here.

216
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,601
Ollie, what's he talking about?

217
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,234
Oliver crossed the line.

218
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,968
He killed lex luthor.

219
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,567
You're making a big mistake.

220
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,033
You're not one of us anymore.

221
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,734
Is that right?

222
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:31,567
I'm in.

223
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:34,000
Oliver: do you have the decryption key?

224
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,033
Yeah.

225
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,334
Hope you have better luck than i did.

226
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,767
Call me when you have chloe's location.

227
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,200
Jimmy, you stepped on my hand!

228
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,501
Next time, don't leave your
hand on the floor under a desk

229
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,267
in an office you're
not supposed to be in.

230
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:00,634
I'm sorry ...  did i just get
a lecture from jimmy olsen?

231
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,400
Who were you talking to?

232
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,000
No one.

233
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,701
Lois, what are you doing here?

234
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,367
I'm looking for chloe and davis.

235
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,834
The head of tess' security

236
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,033
has been staked out at
the talon apartment ...

237
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,601
creepy but telling.

238
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,200
The only problem is

239
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:17,300
her 8-gig mini brain is encrypted.

240
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,701
Not anymore.

241
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:28,667
Tess is definitely
tracking chloe and davis.

242
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:31,067
Most of this is from
a couple of days ago,

243
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,901
but if i can just get in....

244
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,167
bingo.

245
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,400
Looks like chloe and davis

246
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,200
are on the outskirts of
edge city, and so am i.

247
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,567
Don't take your eyes off of them.

248
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,634
Let me know if they move.

249
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:01,000
<i>Tess, lex already tried</i>

250
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,167
<i>to break down the
technology of that orb.</i>

251
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:07,934
<i>Hey, lex knew that orb
wasn't from this earth.</i>

252
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,434
<i>It called to me.</i>

253
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,767
<i>There's life inside that can't be freed</i>

254
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,434
<i>until the traveler kills the beast.</i>

255
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:21,767
<i>What you're unleashing...</i>

256
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:26,968
<i>...it could be the end of the world.</i>

257
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,033
Clark, we found them.

258
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,934
I'm uploading their location.

259
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,033
Dinah, bart.

260
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,033
What's going on?

261
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,467
Sorry, clark. We
couldn't risk losing you.

262
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,033
Don't do this.

263
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:48,067
Don't worry, clark. It won't kill you.

264
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,300
It'll just get your ego out of the way,

265
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,868
so we can do what needs to be done.

266
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:55,701
You're making a mistake!

267
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,668
I kind of miss the maid costume.

268
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,334
I've stopped cleaning up after you.

269
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,700
You could have fooled me.

270
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,534
I expect from my reporters a
little better reconnaissance,

271
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,467
but then again, the bar's always been

272
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,434
a little bit lower for you, hasn't it?

273
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,900
Look, i know family loyalty
means nothing to you,

274
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,700
but i would do anything to find chloe.

275
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,267
If that means you need to fire me...

276
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:34,568
pull the trigger.

277
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,601
I plan to,

278
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:40,934
but this actually has very
little to do with chloe.

279
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,401
You saw it, didn't you?

280
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,067
Seriously, you have a
significant deficiency

281
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,201
of pronoun modifiers going on.

282
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,401
Lois, where is the orb?

283
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,800
What orb?!

284
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,733
The alien technology from my vault.

285
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:08,733
Oh, that orb.

286
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,534
I guess asking for severance
is out of the question.

287
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,934
I didn't want this.

288
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,467
No...

289
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,467
you just want to take over the world

290
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,367
with some alien nation.

291
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:19,867
<i>I am trying to save the world.</i>

292
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:22,634
What's wrong with greenpeace?

293
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,301
What's going on?

294
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,934
Sorry about the tranq, beautiful.

295
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,267
It, uh, kind of snuck
up on you super fast.

296
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:29,867
Where's clark?

297
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
You found a way to kill him, didn't you?

298
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:42,501
And clark wouldn't go along with it.

299
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,867
No.

300
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,967
He wanted to play devil's
advocate with the actual devil,

301
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:49,100
split the kryptonian from the human.

302
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,733
Black kryptonite.

303
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,900
Only one glitch in his plan
... the whole beast part.

304
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,134
Last time we checked, he couldn't
control his thornier alter ego.

305
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,134
But i can.

306
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:03,234
As long as i stay with
him, he doesn't change.

307
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,967
Please don't do this to him.

308
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,334
They have to.

309
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,467
Chloe, it's not working anymore.

310
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,733
Chloe, wait.

311
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:23,000
Davis, just focus on me, okay?

312
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:26,067
We'll get through this together,
just like we always have.

313
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,601
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,568
It's too late.

315
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,733
We need to go now.

316
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,634
Chloe, no!

317
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,467
Jimmy...the dart.

318
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,833
Check this out!

319
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:12,134
Your cut...

320
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:13,668
it's gone.

321
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,601
No.

322
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,534
No, i'm not buying it.

323
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,767
That whole "you're here one second,

324
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,668
and then you're not"?

325
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,301
You took a bullet, and the
next day, you were fine.

326
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,767
I mean, i-it's like you're
some kind of super...

327
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:37,668
... guy.

328
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,800
I am the red-blue blur.

329
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,000
You were right.

330
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,634
About me and about davis.

331
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,367
You were the only person
to put it all together.

332
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,668
I'm sorry that i lied to you.

333
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,668
I knew it.

334
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:09,000
I was so right!

335
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,867
Look, jimmy, i need your help.

336
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:16,534
Do you still have that wedding gift ...

337
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,967
the one for chloe that you
said you never gave to her?

338
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:23,067
Yeah, i couldn't bring
myself to get rid of it.

339
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:25,733
All right, well, i need
you to give it to her now.

340
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,367
And whatever happens to me,

341
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,601
you need to make sure that
davis and chloe are safe.

342
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:37,201
Jimmy, do you trust me?

343
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:42,000
Always, c.k.

344
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,767
That is so cool.

345
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:09,301
Hey, are you okay?

346
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,600
I think so.

347
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,667
What happened here?

348
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:16,433
Exactly what you wanted, clark.

349
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,600
I split him.

350
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:21,134
I unleashed the beast.

351
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:22,400
Where did he go?

352
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:45,767
I'll get him back here,

353
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:49,034
but i still need you to
detonate the explosives.

354
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:49,167
Oliver: clark, you get
him down that tunnel,

355
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:51,800
we'll take care of the rest.

356
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,101
Can i trust you?

357
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,600
Yes.

358
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:16,700
Mom! Mom!

359
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,667
Mom!

360
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,433
Mom!

361
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,167
It's okay.

362
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,767
It's gonna be okay.

363
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,167
Thank you.

364
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,834
Clark said you'd bring
us somewhere safe.

365
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:06,067
What is this place?

366
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,901
It's your wedding present.

367
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:14,901
Well, it was.

368
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,600
I was gonna give it to you
after the reception, but...

369
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:20,301
my wedding present?

370
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,967
It needs some work. I know.

371
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,533
But...

372
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
so did we.

373
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,268
I just...

374
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:34,834
i saw us here, you know?

375
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:37,034
Starting our life together,

376
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:38,400
taking something

377
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:42,034
that the rest of the world
had forgotten about and...

378
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,901
making it ours.

379
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:57,134
You can see all of metropolis from here.

380
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:01,034
From anywhere in the city,
you can spot this place.

381
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:03,034
I thought that no matter where you were,

382
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:05,433
you could look up, and..

383
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,268
you could see our home.

384
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,500
You could see me watching over you.

385
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,734
I don't know how you do it.

386
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:28,934
You always seem to come through.

387
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,600
You're always there
doing the right thing,

388
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,067
saying the right words.

389
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:36,001
Jimmy, there's so much
that i want to tell you.

390
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:39,368
I know about clark.

391
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:40,700
What?

392
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:44,700
What exactly do you know?

393
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:48,734
<i>The what.</i>

394
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,901
I saw him.

395
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,800
And i saw what he can do, who he is.

396
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,800
And now i see all kinds of things.

397
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:03,700
I see what you have sacrificed for him.

398
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,400
For everyone, really.

399
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,634
That's the reason i went with davis ...

400
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,634
to protect clark.

401
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,500
That's the only reason.

402
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,167
It all makes sense now.

403
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:17,934
But the way i see it,

404
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:21,500
you are as much of a
hero as he's ever been.

405
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:25,268
What you have gone
through, what you've risked.

406
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:27,600
And what i've lost.

407
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,800
I've lost so much.

408
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:34,167
The only thing i really miss is you.

409
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:37,667
Well, now you found me again.

410
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,567
I'm so sorry i left, jimmy,

411
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,334
but i promise ... i never left you.

412
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,800
So, um...

413
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:30,134
this whole time that you were with me,

414
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:32,234
it was for clark?

415
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Davis, just put that down.

416
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,967
How could you do this?

417
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:40,500
I loved you.

418
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,301
You're the only one...

419
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:48,268
who ever loved me.

420
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:50,268
Why?

421
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,101
Why?!

422
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:55,667
I thought i did.

423
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,368
Okay?

424
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:59,700
But really, what i wanted to do

425
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,201
was save you.

426
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:03,567
Save me?

427
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,268
There is nothing left...

428
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,800
to save!

429
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:38,800
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

430
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,934
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,201
No.

432
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:50,301
I love you.

433
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:35,100
He restoreth my soul.

434
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,934
He leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness

435
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,868
for his name's sake.

436
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,033
Yea, though i walk

437
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,000
through the valley of
the shadow of death,

438
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:45,167
i will fear no evil,

439
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:48,400
for thou art with me.

440
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:53,634
May henry james olsen rest in peace.

441
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,567
You must be jimmy's little brother.

442
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:51,567
Well, i think that this belongs to you.

443
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:58,367
He would have wanted you to have it.

444
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:01,701
Thanks.

445
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,267
Who knows?

446
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:07,567
Maybe someday, you'll
follow in his footsteps.

447
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,868
You're alive.

448
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:43,634
How did you survive the
geothermal explosion?

449
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:49,067
Just before dinah pressed the button...

450
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:56,634
i don't know.

451
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:59,100
I got out... before the blast,

452
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,234
but not fast enough to save anyone else.

453
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,534
I've searched everywhere.

454
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,868
There's no sign of lois.

455
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:25,200
I saw someone tacking her photo

456
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:26,701
on a missing-persons report.

457
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,801
And i keep thinking that maybe,

458
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:34,334
you know, maybe i haven't...

459
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,501
lost everyone.

460
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:49,734
You were there today,
clark, weren't you?

461
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:55,801
I really needed you.

462
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:58,133
Why didn't you come to me?

463
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:04,133
I'm the reason jimmy's dead.

464
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,634
Oliver was right.

465
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,467
I put humanity on a pedestal.

466
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,801
It wasn't a kryptonian
beast that killed jimmy.

467
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,801
It was a human.

468
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,801
I was standing right here, clark.

469
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:36,501
I know full well who killed jimmy.

470
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:45,000
This place, chloe...

471
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:47,868
just get rid of it.

472
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,868
Just walk away and don't look back.

473
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:53,200
You don't get it, clark.

474
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,834
Jimmy is here.

475
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,634
He's watching over me.

476
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,000
He knew me so well,

477
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,601
he knew this place would be perfect.

478
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,033
Jimmy wanted to know

479
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,167
that no matter where i was in this city,

480
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:10,734
i could look up here
and see this beacon...

481
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,968
the watchtower.

482
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:19,367
And look ...  dinah, oliver,
and bart all disappeared.

483
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:23,033
Maybe it's up to us to
bring them back home.

484
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,767
Home?

485
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,534
I don't have a home.

486
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:32,234
I don't like the way that sounds.

487
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:38,234
I've always tried to
forget i was an alien.

488
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:44,767
Or a creature.

489
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:48,000
I've always tried to
pretend i was human.

490
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,400
I was raised to believe

491
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,434
it was my kryptonian part
that was dangerous, chloe,

492
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:54,234
but i was wrong.

493
00:39:57,033 --> 00:39:59,167
It's my human side. It...

494
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,801
it's the side that gets attached,

495
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,100
the side that makes
decisions based on emotions.

496
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,167
That's my enemy.

497
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,133
And davis proved that to me.

498
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,133
So, because of some psychopath,

499
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,434
you're gonna cut the rest
of us out of your life?

500
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,968
Human emotion is what made you
the hero that you are today.

501
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:29,534
They're what's stopping me
from being the hero i could be.

502
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,234
<i>It's what the world needs now.</i>

503
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,634
What are you saying?

504
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,801
Clark kent is dead.

505
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
Goodbye, chloe.
