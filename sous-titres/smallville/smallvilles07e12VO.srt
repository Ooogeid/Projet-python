1
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,306
This weather sucks.

2
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,167
What are we doing, Lex?

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,680
No one asked you
to be here, Lois.

4
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:27,923
Trust me, I never planned on
being your Sundance kid,

5
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:30,733
especially in the armpit
of Motor City.

6
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:34,406
What makes you think
Kara's here?

7
00:00:34,506 --> 00:00:36,674
Her necklace emits a GPS signal.

8
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,851
She's somewhere within 100 yards.

9
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,955
- You lojacked her?
- She has amnesia.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,835
Who knows where she could wander
if she blacked out again?

11
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:48,972
Right.

12
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,558
Well, sail on, Columbus. I'm gonna
chart my own course to find her.

13
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,886
Kara!

14
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:32,866
Are you okay?

15
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:36,053
You know me?
You know who I am?

16
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,574
You really don't remember, do you?

17
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,710
This guy - Finley - He locked me in
this room, saying he's protecting me.

18
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,901
Can you get me out of here?

19
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,237
Does MacGyver blush
every time he walks past me?

20
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,803
I'll get something to jimmy the lock.

21
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:04,182
- This is none of your business.
- Finley, put the gun down, okay?

22
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,863
Let her go!

23
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,459
Cool man, look, is it really
worth killing her to get to me?

24
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,440
Rhetorical question, Lex!

25
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,713
Finley, don't do this.

26
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:19,821
I won't let you get hurt, Linda.

27
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:59,314
Lex!

28
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:11,319
"Somebody save me"

29
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,749
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

30
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,714
"Somebody save me"

31
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,348
"I don't care how you do it"

32
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:31,220
"Just save me, save me"

33
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,041
"Come on"

34
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,696
"I've been waiting for you"

35
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:47,042
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

36
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:51,078
"Just save me, save me"

37
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:53,906
"Come on"

38
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:57,955
SMALLVILLE 7x12 "FRACTURE"

39
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,889
I'm just gonna grab some money.

40
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:12,127
And when I come back,
we'll figure out what to do with her.

41
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,565
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?

42
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:21,870
You okay?

43
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,446
Sure. What's not to regret
about waking up this morning?

44
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,818
You called me Kara.

45
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,084
Kara Kent.

46
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:30,592
I'm your cousin's friend Lois,

47
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,971
whose jeans you've borrowed
on more than one occasion.

48
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,772
Right. Lois.

49
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,386
Look, I know you've got amnesia.

50
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:40,540
You must if you think your type
is jailhouse chic. What's going on?

51
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,006
Finley's just a busboy, that's all.

52
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:46,129
Great.

53
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,601
This doesn't exactly look like overtime.

54
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,539
How did we end up here?

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,129
About...

56
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,287
a month ago, I lost my memory.

57
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,482
I wandered off the streets and
into a diner where I met a waitress.

58
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,390
She gave me her couch,
got me my job.

59
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,021
Everyone at the diner
took me in like family.

60
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,203
Seems like Finley
wants more than a sister.

61
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,958
He was usually so nice.

62
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,781
I had no idea he could just snap.

63
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,106
I can't believe Lex is dead.

64
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,917
Well, he is.

65
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:30,334
And if we don't find a way out of here,
we're next.

66
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,217
Lionel, how is he?

67
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,614
He's, uh, in a coma.

68
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:52,502
Thank god we got him medevaced
back here from Detroit.

69
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:57,413
The neurosurgeon
managed to remove the bullet.

70
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,827
He says that there is a very
strong possibility that...

71
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:05,741
Lex may never regain consciousness.

72
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:13,199
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,747
We never had a really close relationship.

74
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,319
A lot was said.

75
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:26,870
A lot went unsaid.

76
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,268
Clark, I know for a fact that every badge
in Michigan is on this case, and still,

77
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,703
no suspects, no witnesses.

78
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,883
I find it hard to believe...

79
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,004
the shooter would leave Lex in a ditch
and no one would see anything.

80
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,867
Listen, I got a friend
in Detroit, a cop.

81
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,587
He called me
when I found out about Lex.

82
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:51,450
He let me borrow this.

83
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,261
Kara's alive?

84
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:00,000
That picture was taken
less than 12 hours ago.

85
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,689
Excuse me, Mr. Luthor?

86
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,073
Yeah.

87
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,422
Clark, this is Lois' phone.

88
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:11,300
Lois, Kara, and Lex?
Not exactly "three's company. "

89
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,761
Kara's wearing a bandage.

90
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,565
She may be hurt, which means
she doesn't have her powers.

91
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:18,243
And whoever Lex was dealing with
wasn't playing around,

92
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,249
which means that if Lois
and Kara were with him...

93
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,670
Then they're in danger.
We need to find them.

94
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,745
I'll use my healing powers on Lex, and
he can tell us where Lois and Kara went.

95
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,880
Chloe, the last time you used your powers,
I pulled you out of a morgue refrigerator.

96
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,101
Yeah, and then I walked out of there with
a clean bill of health and some cold feet.

97
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:38,183
Chloe, if you use your powers again,
you could die, permanently.

98
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,500
Or I could just be adjusting to the
growing pains. I mean, we don't know.

99
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,899
Nothing happened when I healed Jimmy.
We have no choice.

100
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,339
The only clues we have to where they
might be are trapped inside Lex's mind.

101
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,969
I couldn't figure out
what Lex was doing in Detroit,

102
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,153
but I may have found
something even more helpful.

103
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,365
Project intercept?
Is it military?

104
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,398
LuthorCorp developed it
for the military...

105
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,203
to interrogate terrorists by getting
inside of their heads, literally.

106
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:16,290
The entire project
was spearheaded by Lionel.

107
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,825
Intercept links a suspect
and interrogator's brain waves,

108
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:23,962
exposing the interrogator to all
the suspect's memories and thoughts.

109
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,913
You're saying someone could
actually go into Lex's mind?

110
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,538
Where is this thing?

111
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:39,635
LuthorCorp still owns all the equipment,
but it was mothballed six months ago.

112
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:43,259
Well, I can see why.
How's this for fine print?

113
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,436
"The project worked several times... "

114
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,917
"but then was abandoned after three of the
interrogators died during implementation. "

115
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,991
"Autopsies revealed that their central
nervous systems were completely fried. "

116
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,925
They're not like me.

117
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,510
I can do this.

118
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,149
Clark, your body may be invincible,

119
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:18,536
but who's to say your mind
isn't vulnerable somehow?

120
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:20,194
It's my fault that Kara's missing.

121
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,967
But using technology
built by Lionel Luthor?

122
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,672
- God only knows why he created that thing.
- Lana, there's no other choice.

123
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,451
Clark, just be careful, okay?

124
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,523
I watched three field officers die after
their brains went into electro-neural shock.

125
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,082
This machine is a deathtrap.

126
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:39,331
I pay you a small fortune, doctor, so
please withhold your negative opinions.

127
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,140
Ladies, would you please wait outside?

128
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:01,334
If Lex wakes up, he'll never know
I was in there, right?

129
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,078
In the few successful cases, the terrorists
had no memory of the process.

130
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:09,728
Now, the freshest memories will
most likely be the first ones in.

131
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,919
The deeper you get,
the greater the risk.

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,309
If your brain waves show any sign of duress,
I will pull you from the procedure.

133
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,486
I don't plan on staying in there very long.

134
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,095
The software has been encoded
with what you will see as a red door.

135
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,899
That is your emergency exit.

136
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:27,461
That red door, Clark - you must
never lose track of that.

137
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,343
If we get disconnected,

138
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:33,837
it's the only link between
Lex's subconscious and reality.

139
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,231
Let's get this over with.

140
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:44,547
Right. You just relax and stay still.
The procedure is painless.

141
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,758
HOST ENGAGED

142
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,966
He's in.

143
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,971
He's entering further
into the cerebral cortex.

144
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,098
I'm sorry that Frank screamed at you.

145
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,615
It's no big deal.
I'm used to it.

146
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,117
I grew up with an old man like that.

147
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:13,581
Well, you're sweet
for covering, Finley.

148
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,213
I owe you one.

149
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,776
Kara?

150
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:26,178
Kara.

151
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,670
- Can I warm you up?
- Sure.

152
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,174
I'm starting to see you more
than some of the regulars.

153
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:39,903
Blame it on the pie. It's by far
the second best I've ever had.

154
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,022
Second best?
I'll pass that along to the kitchen.

155
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,078
Give them some incentive.

156
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,016
Lex.

157
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,851
Linda.

158
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,349
Linda?

159
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,798
Doesn't suit you.

160
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:59,573
Really?
Who do I, uh, look like?

161
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:01,549
I don't know.

162
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,216
Someone who doesn't belong here,
that's for sure.

163
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,536
See? There I go again
with my opinions.

164
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:09,621
What do I know?

165
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,309
Well, more than you realize.

166
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:17,947
You know, some days,
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

167
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,449
Well, leave.

168
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:23,730
That apron's not chained to the counter.

169
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,996
I don't know where else to go.

170
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,557
It's sort of embarrassing, but...

171
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:35,258
about a month ago, I lost my memory.

172
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,470
I'm sorry to hear that.

173
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,298
Actually, this bracelet's the only part
of my past I have left.

174
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:48,252
Look, I'm not sure you'd be
interested, Linda, but...

175
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:52,142
I know some of the best
researchers in the world.

176
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,188
Maybe one can help you.

177
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,556
You think they can help me
get my memory back?

178
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,451
What are you doing here, Clark?

179
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,083
You can see me?

180
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,410
You shouldn't be here.

181
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,749
Lex. Please.

182
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:19,011
Get out of my head.

183
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:21,295
Lex.

184
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:23,485
Get out of my head!

185
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:29,290
He's been trying to kill me
as long as I can remember.

186
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,037
Who are you?

187
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,645
I'm Alexander.

188
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:36,988
Come on. We got to go.

189
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:42,450
Why would he want to kill you?
You're the good part of him, aren't you?

190
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:46,668
He says I make him weak.
And if he finds us, he'll kill us both.

191
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,861
Look, I don't have much time.
I'm looking for two women.

192
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:00,371
Kara Kent and Lois Lane.
Do you know where they are?

193
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:04,558
No, but I'll start looking.
In the meantime, you need to hide.

194
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,479
This is a place Lex never visits.
You'll be safe in there.

195
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:15,071
Trust me, Clark.
You're my best friend.

196
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,222
There is psycobrain wave activity.
To do high.

197
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:35,075
He appears to be going in deep.

198
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:38,369
If Clark's gone in too far,
he might never find his way out.

199
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:40,828
Blood pressure is gone thin.

200
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:43,466
I've never seen this before sir,
I don't know what's going on.

201
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,475
Alexander Luthor!

202
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,958
What is the rule
about my briefcase, Alexander?

203
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:21,303
- Don't ever, ever touch it?
- Ah.

204
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,250
And you know I can tell
when it's been opened.

205
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,618
Did you open it?

206
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:30,726
Did you?

207
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,735
No. I swear.
Dad, I didn't touch it!

208
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,843
Don't lie to me, Lex.

209
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,542
Don't make excuses.
All right.

210
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,177
You be a man, Lex,
and admit what you've done.

211
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,724
- Admit it!
- But I didn't do it!

212
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,827
I don't care about your work!

213
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:59,453
All right, Lex. All right, if it wasn't you,
then who was it, hmm?

214
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:03,890
Answer me.
Who opened my briefcase?!

215
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:05,904
Answer me, Lex!

216
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,000
Mom.

217
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:16,512
I saw her in your office
going through your stuff.

218
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,696
She told me not to say anything.

219
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,224
You let go of him.

220
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,674
I had to know the truth.

221
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:29,807
Veritas - what is it?

222
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:35,009
- Lillian, go. Go on, Lillian.
- I'm tired of the secrets.

223
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:37,585
Disappearing in the middle
of the night to your meetings.

224
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:38,766
Please!

225
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:41,376
What are you keeping from me?!
What are you doing?!

226
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,511
Veritas is not your concern!

227
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,444
You keep out of my business, Lillian.

228
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,533
Mom?

229
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,905
Are you okay?

230
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:04,231
- I'm sorry.
- Don't, Lex.

231
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,653
You've said enough.

232
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:14,004
Don't go.

233
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,858
It's beautiful.

234
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,276
St. Anthony?

235
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,436
The patron saint of lost souls.

236
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:58,195
You know, Finley said all
you really care about is money.

237
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,819
But it's people, isn't it, Lex?

238
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:04,381
I did my research.

239
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:09,581
You're a humanitarian.

240
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:12,361
All the hospitals you've built,
the scholarships you've funded.

241
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:15,983
And along the way, I've seen a lot
of people get the help they need.

242
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,965
Look, everything
has been arranged.

243
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:20,572
My jet's on standby
to take you to your treatment.

244
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,822
So, this is really happening, then?

245
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,606
Guess we'll find out
if I have a fear of flying.

246
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:31,683
Whatever you find out, I'll be by
your side every step of the way.

247
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:35,387
I just - I want this to work.

248
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,263
Trust me.

249
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:40,523
There's nothing that's lost
that can't be found again.

250
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:48,908
I'm... I'm gonna go thank Finley,
say goodbye to everyone.

251
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,908
Quite the charmer, aren't you?

252
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,454
You're a little out of your way
for a club sandwich, Lois.

253
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,516
What the hell are you doing here?

254
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,528
Well, I figured you weren't in Detroit
for the electric-car show, but...

255
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,515
I never would have guessed a secret
rendezvous with Clark's cousin.

256
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,049
I'm helping her.

257
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,878
I never heard that one before.

258
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:25,402
Look, I don't expect you
to understand.

259
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,233
You're right.

260
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,576
I work better with visual aids.

261
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,206
And now that I think about it,
Clark does, too.

262
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:37,669
What the hell are you doing?

263
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,996
- No!
- Kara.

264
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,050
What is it? What's happening?

265
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,400
The e. g. it's showing delta-wave
entrainment. They're in phase.

266
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,161
You're nervous. Why?

267
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:55,070
The subject is in too deep.

268
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:57,626
We've never been able to get
anyone back from this point.

269
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,585
All right.

270
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:02,653
All right, all right.
Terminate the procedure.

271
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:04,763
Pull Clark out - now.

272
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,407
I already tried.
He's trapped, Mr. Luthor.

273
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,569
As long as their brain waves are
synchronized, I can't separate them.

274
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,832
Now it's up to Clark
to exit on his own.

275
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:17,152
>> IN PHASE <<

276
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:24,485
I always knew there was a voyeur
lurking behind that telescope.

277
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,689
Look, I don't want any trouble.

278
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:30,103
Forgive me.
I've been a terrible host.

279
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:32,487
Let me give you the grand tour.

280
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:48,905
Wait.

281
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,113
It's just getting good.

282
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,689
I will always love you.

283
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,026
You hear that, Clark?

284
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,477
She'll always love me.

285
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:38,976
Clark!

286
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:42,061
I found your friends!

287
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,427
- Don't lie to me.
- Come on. Come on, Clark!

288
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:53,603
- Don't lie to me.
- hurry!

289
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:31,668
Alexander!

290
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:33,836
I know where they are!

291
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,589
Clark.

292
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,649
He'll... kill me.

293
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:47,934
You want to kill him.

294
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,168
You are pitiful.

295
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:55,604
Let go! Let go!
I don't want to go with you! Don't!

296
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,576
Let go! Clark, help!

297
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,830
Lex is fading. If we lose him,
we lose them both.

298
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:11,888
We have four minutes to bring
him back before brain death.

299
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,374
No.

300
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:16,586
Charge. Clear!

301
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,351
No, let go!

302
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,505
Let go!

303
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,915
Clear!

304
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,529
What's taking so... long?

305
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,058
Oh, my god.

306
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:34,843
- Charge. Clear!
- You shouldn't be in here, Miss Sullivan.

307
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,031
What's happening?
Why are they not waking Clark up?

308
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:39,102
He's in Lex's mind.
He's trapped.

309
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:42,326
If Lex dies, then Clark dies with him.

310
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:44,808
Sir...

311
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:47,959
we've lost him.

312
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:54,577
I can save him.

313
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,778
How?

314
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:00,674
Just trust me, Mr. Luthor. I can.

315
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:27,507
You're holding me back, Alexander.

316
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:30,229
Stop. Please.

317
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,904
- Lex!
- It's time to say goodbye.

318
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,393
No!

319
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:12,138
Go now! Run!

320
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,109
Clark!

321
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:37,101
Don't go.

322
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:39,413
I have to.

323
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,503
But you're the only friend
I've ever had.

324
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,274
All right,
let's make a promise.

325
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,173
Promise me that we will
see each other again.

326
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:00,850
I promise, Clark.

327
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:03,834
Promise me this, too.

328
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,667
That you will never stop fighting.

329
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:13,792
You're stronger than you think.

330
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,950
How do you know?

331
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:25,013
Because you're my friend.

332
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:29,817
And now I know you're here,
so I will always keep an eye out for you.

333
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,758
I'll always be here for you.

334
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:10,321
I know where they are.

335
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:18,921
Miss Sullivan!

336
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:20,734
What happened?

337
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:24,235
- We need a doctor.
- No, no, no. No doctors.

338
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,277
Just get her to her apartment.

339
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:28,681
Clark, she's barely alive.

340
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:31,068
Trust me, doctors can do nothing for her.

341
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,302
Just get her home.

342
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:40,921
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

343
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,532
When your dad locks your car in
storage because you snuck out...

344
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:47,224
to see your boyfriend's band,
you learn a few tricks.

345
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,321
Bingo.

346
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:06,306
Oh, my god, he's back.

347
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:09,311
We're gonna have to find
another way out.

348
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,151
I think the gate's up ahead.

349
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,309
After everything that I have done for you?

350
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,742
Look, before you get
all trigger-happy again,

351
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:35,270
- ...let's be rational.
- I am rational.

352
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:39,014
But I just killed a man.

353
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:43,315
This isn't how it was supposed to happen.

354
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:47,519
Linda, I just wanted to protect you.

355
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,363
I know what it's like to start over.

356
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:54,427
People take advantage of you.

357
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:57,886
They look at you different.

358
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,225
I am different.

359
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,748
And I'm not Linda.

360
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:08,454
What are you doing?

361
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:11,271
If you want to kill Lois,

362
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,417
you'll have to kill me.

363
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:18,414
If you don't come with me,
guess you're gonna turn me in.

364
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,883
And I can't go back to prison, Linda.

365
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,155
You had us worried today.

366
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:30,809
How you feeling?

367
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:35,058
That's the problem, dad.

368
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,408
I feel fine.

369
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:40,982
What's going on?

370
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:43,616
I'm admitted here with
a bullet in my head,

371
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,957
and now there's not so much
as a scratch on me.

372
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:49,555
You can thank your friend
Oliver Quenn.

373
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,961
The healing technology developed
by Quenn laboratories.

374
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,069
You of all people should remember that.

375
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:58,590
I was under the impression
that all the serum was destroyed.

376
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:02,752
Yeah, all but a single dose,
which I salvaged...

377
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:07,061
for myself,
if I should ever need it.

378
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,319
But you gave it to me?

379
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,882
You sound surprised.

380
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:17,330
You're my son. You think I'd
stand there and watch you die?

381
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,362
Honestly, dad, I -

382
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,267
I don't know.

383
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:39,767
Today, I realized when...

384
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:53,644
There is something I was afraid that I
would never have the chance to tell you.

385
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,505
Yeah?

386
00:33:57,622 --> 00:33:59,232
And what's that?

387
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:05,859
I love you, Lex...

388
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:08,041
my son.

389
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,932
Here you go.

390
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:38,936
Thanks.

391
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:43,790
Lois didn't...

392
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:47,262
see me, you know, dead, did she?

393
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:51,467
She had to shoot back to the Planet to write
a story about what happened in Detroit.

394
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:55,455
Yeah, Lex will kill that story
in a heartbeat.

395
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:01,420
Speaking of heartbeats, you
didn't have one for over 18 hours.

396
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,392
I was hoping we could skip the lecture and
go straight to the "welcome back" dinner.

397
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,354
I'm starving.

398
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:15,304
It's 15 hours longer
than the last time, Chloe.

399
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,113
I've been sitting here, literally, trying
to think about what to say at your funeral.

400
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,102
Well, let's both be glad
that I'm alive,

401
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,878
'cause I know how much
you hate giving speeches.

402
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:31,839
Chloe, I appreciate what you did
for me. It goes beyond friendship.

403
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:33,248
But you can never do it again.

404
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:36,073
Clark, I have the power
to save people's lives.

405
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:39,761
Now, obviously, I am the last person
who thought she would drag Lex back...

406
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:43,291
from the clutches of death, but
it was my decision to make.

407
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,445
Of course it was.

408
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,531
But, you know, you're not wrong.

409
00:35:56,713 --> 00:36:00,743
I mean, as great as this power is,
it does come with a lot of consequences.

410
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:07,479
And I think that one of the
responsibilities for both of us is...

411
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:10,516
staying alive.

412
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:15,728
Maybe I am pushing my luck
with this whole death thing.

413
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:19,829
I mean, it is death, after all.

414
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:28,387
Does that mean you're never
gonna use your abilities again?

415
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,861
It means I'm more confused now than ever.

416
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,405
Out of the entire catalog
of meteor abilities,

417
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:46,496
why was I the one chosen to be
in charge of such an amazing gift?

418
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:12,035
It's like a reflex. I see you
and start defending myself.

419
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:15,021
That's what guilt
does to a person.

420
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:18,257
Now, what were you doing
in Detroit with Kara?

421
00:37:18,677 --> 00:37:20,527
I was trying to help her.

422
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:23,234
And she ended up kidnapped?

423
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,746
You knew she had amnesia.

424
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:30,377
Sure, once she told me.

425
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:32,789
That's when I volunteered my help.

426
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,691
Did it ever occur to you
to pick up a phone and call me?

427
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:38,764
I did call - twice.

428
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:42,160
Lana hung up on me
before I could get a word out.

429
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,785
Do you even know
when you're lying anymore?

430
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,647
You know, I've stopped pretending to
care whether or not you believe me, so...

431
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,817
so why don't you?

432
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:01,710
Because I do care, Lex.

433
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,466
And there's a side of you
that knows what's right.

434
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:09,200
Wow.

435
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:12,419
Now, what would I do without
Clark Kent, voice of reason?

436
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:15,595
That voice isn't me, Lex. It's you.

437
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:20,182
There's still good inside of you.
Let that voice lead you back to it.

438
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,776
I didn't know it would only take a brush
with death to see your softer side.

439
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:31,408
Trust me, Lex, there's nothing
that's lost that can't be found again.

440
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:51,045
SAY IT AGAIN

441
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,029
Anything good?

442
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,147
I don't know. Supposedly, this
is one of my favorite songs,

443
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:06,377
and I don't even remember how it goes.

444
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,915
Lex, I saw what happened.

445
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,329
You were bleeding.

446
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,922
I told you, I know some talented doctors.

447
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,486
Obviously you do.

448
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:31,417
So, I guess I used to work here.

449
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:33,992
I wonder if they'll
give me my job back.

450
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,134
Well, I think the owner
will understand.

451
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,345
Thank you for meeting me.

452
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:47,737
- I mean, home isn't feeling very...
- Familiar?

453
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:50,395
Yeah.

454
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:54,094
I mean, Clark seems like a
really nice guy and everything, but...

455
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:56,974
I can't help but feeling
he's hiding something from me.

456
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:02,867
As his former best friend,
I know the feeling all too well.

457
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,421
See, Clark didn't even mention
that you guys were friends.

458
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:11,779
What happened?

459
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:15,436
I grew up.

460
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:22,464
Kara, I'm not interested
in keeping secrets.

461
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:28,386
This treatment will help you get
your memories back, and with it,

462
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:30,477
we'll get the truth.

463
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:35,689
Once and for all.
