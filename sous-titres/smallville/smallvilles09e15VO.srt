1
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:07,831
Okay, clark, we have a
car-jacking over on samson street.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,624
<i>On my way.</i>

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,358
Bad day for that guy.

4
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:13,766
Now we have a mugging on halpert.

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,286
<i>- Got him.
- Nice one.</i>

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,347
And just around the corner, there's a...

7
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:20,476
<i>Done.</i>

8
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,194
That was fast, even for you.

9
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:25,363
Okay, cowboy,

10
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,709
looks like we're all clear
on the western front for now.

11
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,782
<i>Then I'm handing the
reins over to john jones.</i>

12
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,572
<i>He's going to patrol while
i'm out on the town with lois.</i>

13
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:37,117
Don't worry. I think metropolis can
handle one weekend without the blur.

14
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:39,560
Now, The real question
is Can the blur handle

15
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,255
two nights with lois?

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,914
<i>I think i'm up to the challenge,</i>

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,247
<i>but I'll have my cell,
so if anything comes up.</i>

18
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,218
It's one weekend. Enjoy it.

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,606
<i>I heard bart's in town.
You two should hang out.</i>

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,435
Thank you for the
not-so-subtle contribution

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,228
to the chloe sullivan charity case,

22
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:58,238
but lois already made a
kind donation in your name.

23
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:00,209
I'm hanging up now.

24
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:01,194
<i>Bye, chloe.</i>

25
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>- Have fun.
- You too.</i>

26
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,167
Thanks.

27
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:20,405
Perfect timing.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,599
Articles are in, phone
calls have been returned,

29
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:25,178
I am officially ready for
our magical mystery weekend.

30
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,727
So let's escape before randall sends
you on an assignment. Where's your bag?

31
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:31,541
Since you insisted on
being a man of secrets,

32
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,625
I had to cover all my bases.

33
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:38,049
There's snow angel,
surfer girl, city chic.

34
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:40,314
How about countryside
bed-and-breakfast?

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,182
Good choice.

36
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:45,209
But since I'm assuming you don't
mean the french countryside...

37
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:47,121
no.

38
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,789
It's kind of scottish,

39
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:50,804
some place called the mcdougal inn.

40
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:03,571
I have your room all ready, mrs. Green,

41
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:06,341
except you didn't say
what size bed you'd prefer.

42
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,416
Make it a queen.

43
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:14,467
Welcome to the mcdougal inn.

44
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,534
I got it.

45
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:28,731
Smallville -
9x15 - Escape

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Synchro : Flolo

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,661
For Seriessub.com/Sous-titres.eu

48
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,337
did you see the latest crime rating?

49
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:27,998
Lowest it's been in years.

50
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:30,571
I just feel safer knowing he's around.

51
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,448
Tell me a story, daddy.

52
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:34,955
- All right. What about?
- The blur.

53
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,861
I know it's called
a bed-and-breakfast,

54
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,653
but missing dinner is a
definite bust. I'm starving.

55
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:01,610
And I already ate the granola bar that's
been at the bottom of my bag since...

56
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,119
I don't know when.

57
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,773
We wouldn't be lateif we hadn't
driven 40 miles out of our way

58
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:07,746
to see the world's largest ball of yarn.

59
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:10,082
You'll thank me later.

60
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,136
Yes, can I help you?

61
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,086
Sorry about that.

62
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,599
We're late. The
reservation's under kent.

63
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,075
I apologize, but thanks to the
storm, the room you reserved

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,562
sprang a leak. I tried to call,
but the line wouldn't connect.

65
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,729
Cell reception is horrible around here.

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,438
That's fine.

67
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,920
We'll, take any room
that you have available.

68
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:43,066
There Isn't one.

69
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,061
Before I realized the pipe had burst,

70
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,828
I gave the last room away.

71
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,783
Okay, well,

72
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,796
let's, hope that,

73
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:55,568
Mr. And Mrs. Green didn't
quite finish unpacking

74
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:58,547
because the only inn they're gonna
be staying at is called holiday.

75
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,939
Lois. What room is it, exactly?

76
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:03,469
Maybe I can fix the pipe.

77
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,872
If you'd like to try,

78
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:09,224
it's the last room on the left.

79
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:57,985
Great.

80
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,851
That's what you get for
not packing light, lois.

81
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:05,969
Sorry.

82
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:09,072
If you ask me, great-great-great-uncle
bevan had it coming.

83
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,965
So, what did he do to deserve
getting his face scratched off?

84
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,381
Usurped his sister siobhan's birthright,

85
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,941
took her crown and castle,
and then killed her.

86
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,967
For a country that prides
itself on men wearing skirts,

87
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,327
you'd think they'd be a little
more progressive than that.

88
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,172
According to legend, siobhan felt
so robbed of her life on earth

89
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,985
she wanted to return from
the underworld and live again.

90
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:35,316
She was granted her wish, at a price.

91
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,307
Since she was betrayed by a man,

92
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:42,122
she was cursed to kill men...
Any that crossed her path.

93
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,286
Murder, misogyny, and mayhem.

94
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,905
I can see why you left
that out of the brochure.

95
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:53,103
How about a cup of tea while
you wait for your boyfriend?

96
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,043
How about we just take
mr. And Mrs. Pda's room

97
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,627
because, you know, they
obviously don't need it?

98
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:06,553
Just kidding.

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,364
I'll go check on clark.
He is used to baling hay,

100
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:14,043
but I'm sure he's just
bailing buckets to stay afloat.

101
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,545
Clark, I don't care how bad it is.
I survived a tent in guadalajara.

102
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,231
I can handle a...

103
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:53,460
Soggy room.

104
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,179
Turns out the leak wasn't
as bad as she said it was.

105
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,600
I fixed the pipe.

106
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,909
Clark kent, my hero.

107
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,362
Too much?

108
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,234
You're perfect.

109
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,940
Is that the side of the bed
that you like sleeping on?

110
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:09,999
Why? Is this your side usually?

111
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,153
'cause that would be totally fine. I...

112
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:14,081
No, I just thought that you...

113
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,847
I just want you to be comfortable.

114
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,197
I will be.

115
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:22,333
I mean... I am.

116
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,234
Bedtime.

117
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,631
So...

118
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,916
don't let the bedbugs bite.

119
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:45,945
Sweet dreams.

120
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,302
What the hell was that?

121
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:25,040
It's nothing to worry about, everyone.

122
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,190
What could have made that noise?

123
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:31,511
There are wolves in the forest.
Maybe it was one of them.

124
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,008
Go back to bed. Everything's okay.

125
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,055
Twist.

126
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,226
How can you be so "eh" about this?

127
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,699
This is chloe and
oliver, together, here.

128
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:06,102
Did you know they were dating?
No, of course you didn't.

129
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,813
<i>I didn't even know they were dating.</i>

130
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,751
We should sit with them.

131
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,902
Or we can give them some space.

132
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,931
They obviously came out here to escape
from everything, kind of like we did.

133
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,015
I know that I ran a
verbal marathon last night

134
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,056
and then I fell asleep, but I promise.
Tonight is about the two of us.

135
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,512
I waited for you to get
ready for three hours.

136
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:28,576
If it means being with
you, I can wait forever.

137
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,028
Forever's a long time.

138
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,473
- Really?
- No.

139
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,668
Oh, god.

140
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,506
You know what we could do?

141
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,687
We could pretend not to see them.

142
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,205
Oh, come on, ollie. Throw
out the white flag. It's lois.

143
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,637
She makes susan b. Anthony
look like a quitter.

144
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:57,633
Hey, guys, come here.

145
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,648
Sit with us.

146
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,602
Quiet weekend at home, huh?

147
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:06,180
Trust me. We had no idea
the two of you would be here.

148
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:09,045
<i>And we had no idea there
was even a "you two,"</i>

149
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,171
which I think is perfect. I think
fate has brought us together.

150
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:14,096
Well, it's...

151
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,543
it was a little less fate, actually.

152
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:21,184
More fame. I like fame.

153
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:24,119
This inn is so far off the beaten
path that even the society pages

154
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,787
couldn't find star city's
most eligible bachelor here.

155
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:28,496
You mean ex-bachelor.

156
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,012
Okay, enough about that.

157
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,555
How did you guys manage to
find the road less traveled?

158
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,111
I found the brochure for the
inn at the apartment. I figured

159
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:37,226
- lois wanted to come here.
- What brochure?

160
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,103
That wasn't lois' brochure, clark.

161
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,385
That was mine.

162
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,812
How was I supposed
to know that oliver...

163
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,008
You weren't.

164
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,773
That's the point.

165
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,978
Don't look at me. I
learned a long time ago

166
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,151
not to assume what belongs
to who in that apartment.

167
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,699
You got to use context clues.

168
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,659
Yeah, speaking of clues,

169
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:13,894
let's talk about Mr. Green
in the bedroom with my cousin.

170
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,233
There it is.

171
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,086
Lois, I think they came here for brunch.

172
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:18,862
Good point.

173
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,407
Look, chloe, there's food.

174
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,213
Little jellies.

175
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,972
Okay, look, lois, I know
what you're gonna say...

176
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:35,113
That with ollie's
less-than-perfect track record,

177
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:36,944
I should really just cut my losses.

178
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:39,543
Or I could say that this
is one for the "win" column.

179
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,361
I think it's great that
you and oliver are together.

180
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:43,904
You do?

181
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,727
Yeah, and the best part is

182
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:47,691
now we can double-date.
How awesome is that?

183
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:50,507
Before you book us up
for the next two months,

184
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,520
<i>oliver and I are not a couple.</i>

185
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,403
Okay, sure. Then what are you?

186
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,718
We're Having fun.

187
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,785
And we're not complicating things

188
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,840
by using labels and definitions.

189
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,701
This is a relationship,
chloe, not a spelling bee.

190
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,617
I'm glad that you have found
someone that makes you happy,

191
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:10,570
but we're not all cut out for coupledom.

192
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,760
And with ollie, I don't
have to worry about that?

193
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,239
We're no flowers.

194
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:17,369
We're no presents, no
pressure, no strings.

195
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:20,400
And with you, we're no comment.

196
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:36,215
So...

197
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:38,877
You...

198
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,022
Save any orphans

199
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,317
recently, old ladies,
maybe, anything like that?

200
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:44,809
I did stop a bank robbery.

201
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,854
Yeah. That's nice. That's fun stuff.

202
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:47,958
Thanks.

203
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,656
- How about you? Anything new?
- No. Just,...

204
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:54,414
there's a new compound
bow I'm trying out.

205
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,244
Yeah, seems pretty good.

206
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,671
See how that works.

207
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,803
I know it's not my place
to say anything, but...

208
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:01,628
Then don't say anything.

209
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,096
But after everything
chloe's been through,

210
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,987
I don't want to see her get hurt.

211
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:07,730
That's good.

212
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,897
She's stronger than you
think she is, though, so...

213
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:14,084
one of her strengths is giving people what
they need and sacrificing what she wants.

214
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,582
How do you know this
isn't what she wants?

215
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,499
Just don't take her for granted.

216
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,206
Your choice of meeting
place is revealing.

217
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,689
Even when he's gone,
clark rules your mind.

218
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,679
And yours.

219
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:46,358
And since we have no common
ground, I thought it only fitting

220
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,985
that we meet in the home of
the one person that unites us.

221
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:51,741
Whether you want to
admit it or not, major,

222
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,039
we all want the same thing...

223
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:57,788
A better world.

224
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,758
You crave a man that's your equal.

225
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:13,621
But everyone you've ever
let in has betrayed you...

226
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:18,065
and will never trust you.

227
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:24,719
Well, sometimes trust
comes at too high a price.

228
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,657
Obsession can cost you more.

229
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:33,202
Come with me.

230
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:36,581
We'll go to cyprus, rule the world,

231
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:40,040
drink wine, swim in the sea.

232
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:44,473
You sound like a man
without a care in the world,

233
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,463
not your usual goal-oriented self.

234
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,063
I still have goals.

235
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,231
But do you still have secrets?

236
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:01,725
Not from you.

237
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:04,438
Really?

238
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:32,925
I don't remember you telling me
that you discovered your powers.

239
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,878
How did you find out?

240
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,976
You're a soldier dedicated to his cause.

241
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:41,436
There's no way you'd run off to
cyprus unless your war was won.

242
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,644
Your instincts are remarkable.

243
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,334
So is your ability to heal.

244
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:49,586
You were shot a few weeks ago, but
I just checked, there's no wound.

245
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:54,524
My little experiment proves
that my instincts were right.

246
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:04,006
And if you were wrong...

247
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,703
Your experiment would have killed me.

248
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,171
Some risks are worth taking.

249
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:20,849
And some aren't.

250
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,756
You know my secret.

251
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,869
I can't afford to let you share it.

252
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:34,583
What would you do if our
positions were reversed?

253
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,416
In every relationship,

254
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,937
one person stands while
the other one kneels.

255
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,853
I will not be forced down again.

256
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,734
I wouldn't want you to be.

257
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,260
I must say,

258
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,664
Your taste in wine is almost
as good as your taste in women.

259
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,015
Why, thank you.

260
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,789
You have a little bit of
pinot right there, actually.

261
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,105
Look at that. I got it.

262
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:55,141
Unless christmas came early this year,

263
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,076
that better not have my name on it.

264
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:00,036
Maybe you've just been
especially good this year.

265
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,176
Maybe a guy shouldn't take
someone like you for granted.

266
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,279
I didn't think you were, ollie.

267
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,517
Clark said something, didn't he?

268
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,493
It's just a gift.

269
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,222
No. It's a slippery slope.

270
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,070
"Just because" gifts
are never just because.

271
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,539
There's always some unspoken part, like

272
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,914
"i'm sorry" or "i feel
very strongly about you,"

273
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,521
both of which are complicated.

274
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,895
I wanted to keep things simple,

275
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,570
with, like, no strings or ribbons.

276
00:20:38,352 --> 00:20:40,822
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm going for a walk.

277
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,741
When I come back, can we
just hit the "reset" button

278
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,176
and play our favorite indoor game again?

279
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:25,823
Hello?

280
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:47,656
So much for a relaxing
walk to calm my nerves.

281
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:06,115
Definitely not calm.

282
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:21,263
Unexpected, but useful.

283
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,083
Just give me 10 minutes.

284
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,019
Then you'll get a surprise.

285
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,704
Something tells me you'll
never stop surprising me, lois.

286
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,815
10 minutes.

287
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,668
Well, hello to you, too.

288
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:08,302
I can't tell you, lois.

289
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,980
What are you doing in here?

290
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,348
I thought I would join you.

291
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:21,584
Yeah, I can see that.

292
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,984
At least, I'm trying not to see that.

293
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:28,173
You know, i'm done here,

294
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:30,241
so the shower is yours.

295
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,589
It's not the shower I want.

296
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:35,947
Chloe, how much wine did
you have to drink at dinner?

297
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,857
Why, you want to share another bottle?

298
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,207
Or maybe we could just go for
a moonlit walk in the woods.

299
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,503
I don't think that oliver
would appreciate it.

300
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,981
Clark, I just...

301
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:52,887
Oh, my god.

302
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:55,913
I can explain this, sort of.

303
00:23:56,796 --> 00:23:57,809
You do that.

304
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:00,772
Try to explain it over
breakfast maybe next century.

305
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,943
This... I won't be needing.

306
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:25,545
<i>- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?</i>

307
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,381
- Where are my clothes?
- I don't know.

308
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:28,811
What's going on?!

309
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,939
You got any bagpipes to go
with that outfit there, lassie?

310
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,594
That means you guys are
having a little fun. It's cute.

311
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,726
Listen, I'm looking for chloe.

312
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:59,397
She took a walk a while ago.

313
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:01,885
She hasn't returned, and I'm
getting a little worried about her.

314
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,580
I was just with her, actually.

315
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,430
You were? Okay.

316
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,580
Oh, right. Yeah, okay. So, just

317
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,009
lay it on me.

318
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:16,205
Why don't I take you
to see chloe, instead?

319
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:21,227
You will never win a woman's heart
by waiting for her to come to you.

320
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,714
You lead the way.

321
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:34,118
The truck is still there. At
least lois didn't drive home.

322
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:37,013
Oliver's not in our room.
We're definitely being roasted,

323
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:39,558
not toasted over a bottle
of mcdougal's finest tonight.

324
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:41,968
What possessed you to come
into the bathroom like that?

325
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:44,931
I don't remember. I just
completely blanked out.

326
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:48,215
You don't remember seeing...

327
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:51,715
<i>No, god, I definitely
don't remember seeing that.</i>

328
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,928
What... Wait a minute.
Was I... Did you see...

329
00:25:55,642 --> 00:25:56,825
Oh, god.

330
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,844
This is our last couples
vacation together.

331
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,746
If I don't find lois, this will be
the last vacation I take with anyone.

332
00:26:01,981 --> 00:26:04,244
Okay, so, not that I haven't seen enough

333
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:08,009
of clark kent's private...
life tonight, I...

334
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,302
- I don't like where this is going.
- You took lois

335
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:13,179
on a romantic getaway to some
sort of a bed-and-breakfast.

336
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:15,201
While I doubt that the
whole breakfast part

337
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:17,163
poses any problems.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

338
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:20,286
I seem to recall you having some
kind of a concern about the beds

339
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:23,719
and non-powered people

340
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:27,418
and what would happen in the beds
with the non-powered people if you...

341
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,377
stop.

342
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:29,728
Thank you.

343
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:33,225
My training with jor-el

344
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,714
has helped me to
manage my powers better.

345
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:40,820
Let's just say that I'm in control...

346
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:42,642
Of everything.

347
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:47,014
But you weren't

348
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:49,732
when you decided to throw me
a surprise party in the shower.

349
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,880
And then you passed out, only
to come to with no memory.

350
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:54,921
What was the last thing you do remember?

351
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:57,202
Oliver and I were having a talk,

352
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:00,201
thanks to someone's overdeveloped
protective instincts,

353
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,290
and I decided to go for a walk.

354
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,027
Where?

355
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,417
Over here.

356
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:21,311
This is the lantern I brought from
the inn. I must have dropped it here.

357
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:29,515
<i>Unless something made you drop it.</i>

358
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,119
Oh, god.

359
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:39,748
<i>This is so not the
weekend I had in mind.</i>

360
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,954
You were out here, chloe. Do
you think you could have...

361
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,964
Gone norman bates?

362
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,544
Wait a minute. I wasn't
the only one out here.

363
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:54,714
There was a... A face, like a phantom.

364
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:56,460
What did it look like?

365
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,183
Black, white, and weird all over.

366
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:02,130
And since this is where
my memory hits a roadblock,

367
00:28:02,255 --> 00:28:05,614
i'm guessing that spirit
started driving this dune buggy.

368
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:07,522
I must have been possessed.

369
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:09,419
You obviously aren't now.

370
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:11,522
But if that spirit is
responsible for this murder,

371
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:13,748
we need to find it
before it kills again.

372
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:25,212
Who told chloe to go
walk in the woods, anyway?

373
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,278
Was it hansel and
gretel, do you suppose?

374
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:28,724
It's not much farther.

375
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:31,175
I hope she left a trail of bread
crumbs 'cause if she didn't,

376
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,044
we might never find our way out of here.

377
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,438
<i>I'll be leaving these woods.</i>

378
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,435
But you won't.

379
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,864
The legend of siobhan
is just a ghost story.

380
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:58,599
It's not real.

381
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:02,315
You've got a confused coed in your
living room and a dead body in your yard.

382
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,535
Now, we need to hear the
rest of siobhan's story.

383
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,151
You really think a centuries-old spirit

384
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:08,871
has come back for revenge?

385
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:11,423
We've seen weirder things.

386
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:18,412
After siobhan was killed,

387
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:22,133
her soul was sent to the underworld
where she was given great powers.

388
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,367
What kinds of powers?

389
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:29,538
Uncommon strength and...

390
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:33,395
the ability to slay any
man that hears her wail.

391
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,904
Superstitious villagers
also gave her a new name...

392
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:39,081
The silver banshee.

393
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:42,844
Okay, the last time I checked, the
underworld was still underground.

394
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:46,880
So, how is it that this wailing
wonder has gotten topside?

395
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,686
Legend tells of a portal

396
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:51,080
through which her spirit
could return to this world.

397
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,678
It was said to be a relic
created in siobhan's own image.

398
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:58,618
But after several deaths
in the village, bevan feared

399
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:01,040
that he would soon be
silver banshee's next victim.

400
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,982
So he conducted an
ancient scottish ritual

401
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,660
and covered the relic in
siobhan's spilled blood,

402
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,578
sealing the portal shut.

403
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:10,123
A relic in her image?

404
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:12,100
Like a statue or an engraving?

405
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,728
Or a painting.

406
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,488
There's another portrait
painted under this one.

407
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,196
Bevan didn't just use blood to
paint over his sister's image.

408
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,121
He used it to paint his
own portrait over hers.

409
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:34,689
And then lois must have
accidentally opened the portal

410
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:36,439
when she scraped it.

411
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:38,943
Chloe, you need to figure
out how to close that portal.

412
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,506
I'll find out who
siobhan inhabited next.

413
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,252
I was denied vengeance,

414
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,590
just as I was denied power.

415
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,984
But now I shall have both.

416
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm all about the girl power, really,

417
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:24,721
but I got to be honest with you...

418
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:27,157
I don't see you breaking
through any glass ceilings

419
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:28,718
with that hair.

420
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:36,810
Siobhan!

421
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:41,147
You know who I am.

422
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,040
And I know your story.

423
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:45,866
But killing men won't make
up for what was done to you.

424
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,369
Maybe not.

425
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:51,033
But it does make me feel better.

426
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,704
Tell me you found something.
How about bevan's diary?

427
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:30,511
I don't suppose you read gaelic?

428
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:34,958
I may not have believed all the ghost
stories but I'm still a mcdougal.

429
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,984
"We banished her soul
with blood and flame,

430
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:41,555
then burned her body so her
spirit could not walk again."

431
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:46,494
We burn her body and burn her blood.

432
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:49,635
I think we close this portal with fire.

433
00:33:38,923 --> 00:33:42,378
You're remarkable and beautiful...

434
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:45,441
Strong...

435
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:49,420
Able to spar with me
on an equal footing...

436
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,606
almost kryptonian.

437
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:57,108
How did you weaken me in the barn?

438
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:02,427
You have your secrets...

439
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:04,657
And I have mine.

440
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,503
Now we're even.

441
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,329
I waited a long time to savor

442
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,638
the power of my kryptonian birthright,

443
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:14,063
and I will do anything
it takes to protect it.

444
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:15,822
You must know that.

445
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:20,147
In case you haven't noticed, zod,

446
00:34:20,272 --> 00:34:22,393
there are few that could stop you.

447
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,766
Which is why the information
you have is so valuable.

448
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:28,641
You talk like we're on different sides.

449
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,191
You tell me.

450
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:32,585
We are partners, after all.

451
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,003
I doubt that you've only used
your powers for seduction.

452
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,921
They certainly come in useful,

453
00:34:40,566 --> 00:34:43,956
especially when it comes to keeping an
ear and an eye out for my competition.

454
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:50,112
If you're referring to clark,

455
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:53,104
you may have met your match but...

456
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,410
He's not your competition.

457
00:34:57,656 --> 00:34:59,235
<i>He's one of you.</i>

458
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:04,005
But he stands apart.

459
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:07,039
Read your own newspaper, tess.

460
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:09,377
With the help of a
certain lovely reporter,

461
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:12,348
the blur has become
humanity's new messiah.

462
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:15,828
Now, I may be able to fly,

463
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:19,323
but the world would
willingly follow him on foot.

464
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:21,958
You're jealous.

465
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:26,159
I want to know what
gives him that power.

466
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,352
And I want to know
what will take it away.

467
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:37,079
But you'll never tell me.

468
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,397
Information is also power.

469
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:06,013
But you understand
that better than anyone.

470
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:37,434
It's a spoon.

471
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,174
I bought you a spoon,
one of those little...

472
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:46,232
People collect them. I
thought about getting you,

473
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,756
some of those little decorative soaps.

474
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:52,015
But ultimately, You didn't really
need either one of them, did you?

475
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,899
I don't know about that.

476
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:56,594
I'm more partial to sporks, myself but

477
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,137
a girl can never have
too many... Spoons?

478
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,335
Yeah, I never should have

479
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,267
wrapped up that pandora's box to begin
with and second-guessed myself or us.

480
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:07,670
From now on, I won't.

481
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,482
Maybe we should just say that next time,

482
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:12,521
you won't take advice about
relationships from clark kent.

483
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:16,575
You know, speaking of clark...

484
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:20,410
For future reference and, you know,

485
00:37:20,692 --> 00:37:22,689
strictly for environmental purposes...

486
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:25,597
The next time you want to take a shower
with someone, you can just ask me.

487
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:28,990
I can't remember blacking out,
I wish I could forget waking up.

488
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:31,089
Really? It couldn't have
been that bad, right?

489
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:33,699
Wasn't there a time when you would
have given just about anything

490
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,088
to stare at that farmer's
tan in all its glory?

491
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,080
That was a long time ago like

492
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,864
in a smallville far, far away.

493
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,529
I mean, okay, yeah,

494
00:37:44,654 --> 00:37:47,074
I did love clark... A lot.

495
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:49,668
And I waited for years
for him to see that,

496
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:52,060
to see... Me.

497
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:55,397
But even with his x-ray
vision, he never did.

498
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:59,642
<i>I think more than that I just
wanted someone who would get me.</i>

499
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:06,416
And as good a friend as clark is,
he's never gonna be that person.

500
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:10,171
Which is fine. Really.

501
00:38:11,234 --> 00:38:14,351
Those wounds healed over
a thousand supersaves ago.

502
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,919
Now there's just scars.

503
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:22,806
It's clark's loss.

504
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:28,087
What about your loss?

505
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:30,708
I'm sure that lois didn't
have to drag you into the woods

506
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,735
kicking and screaming.

507
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,397
Yeah,

508
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,308
that's... The funny thing
about scars, you know.

509
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,696
They're always there.

510
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,490
It doesn't mean they haven't healed.

511
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,541
Sometimes they can be kind
of cute, too, you know.

512
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:58,921
You have one in particular
that I'm partial...

513
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,482
as incredible as that
r-and-r attempt was,

514
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:19,328
<i>I think we should skip the
old b-and-b's for awhile.</i>

515
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:22,142
For our first weekend away together,

516
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:23,975
it could have been worse.

517
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,646
I was possessed by a 300-year-old
scottish banshee, I almost killed you.

518
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,451
But we did get to see the
world's largest ball of yarn.

519
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,460
That made the whole trip worthwhile.

520
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:35,222
All thanks to my stellar
sense of direction.

521
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,730
Let's face it, clark...
Without me, you'd still be lost.

522
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,126
What?

523
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,247
It's my cellphone.

524
00:40:02,372 --> 00:40:04,313
Just let it go to voicemail.

525
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:07,458
Yeah, why don't you answer it,
lois? What if it's important?

526
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:17,903
- A little privacy, please?
- Just pretend i'm not here.

527
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:23,385
I can't do that.

528
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:29,213
I guess i'll just have to get
used to sharing you with the world.

529
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:34,354
Lois lane, at your service.

530
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,539
Hello, lois.

531
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:38,584
It's you.

532
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:41,754
I was wondering. Hoping
that you'd call again.

533
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:44,503
- I need your help.
- Anything.

534
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:47,109
I need you to get
information on tess mercer.

535
00:40:47,885 --> 00:40:50,083
You've come to the right girl.

536
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:53,087
Just give me the question.
I'll find you an answer.

537
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:55,983
No matter what it takes, i'll do it.

538
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:58,057
I want to help.

539
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:01,513
I'll get the information you need.

540
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:05,033
But you can't tell anyone about it.

541
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:08,979
Promise me you won't.

542
00:41:11,574 --> 00:41:13,636
I promise.

543
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:18,938
I wouldn't ask, lois if it
weren't a matter of life or death.
