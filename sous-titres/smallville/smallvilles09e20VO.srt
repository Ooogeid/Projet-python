1
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:12,160
The book of RAU isn't here. I know
you just came across that footage,

2
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,201
but there's got to be
something more on it.

3
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:17,420
I'm looking at it now. Jor-El
put it in the north wall.

4
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:20,400
I wish I could give you more but
thanks to Tess' little break-in,

5
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,893
Watchtower can barely run
a game of "Donkey Kong,"

6
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:25,184
let alone an image-enhancement program.

7
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:28,193
If that book really holds unimited
power, then we need to find it.

8
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:31,004
This could explain
why our favorite alien

9
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:34,419
nation has gone awol.
Maybe Zod and the Kandorians

10
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:37,155
are trying to track down the
Holy RAU grail before we do.

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,668
I got to go.

12
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:56,597
- I'm sorry. I thought you were...
- thief?

13
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:02,176
If you can't recognize my butt in a pair
of jeans then what are you thinking about?

14
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,907
I know. I've been distracted.

15
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:06,279
Excuse me for getting
between a man and his tractor,

16
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:08,697
but our unemployment situation
has just gone to Defcon 1.

17
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,486
It's not a matter of life and death.

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,780
Actually, it is.

19
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,747
My phone just got turned off because
The Planet stopped paying my cell bill

20
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:20,246
and half my wardrobe is being
held hostage at the dry cleaner's.

21
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:23,045
To top it off, it's as if you're
expecting me to single-handedly

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,427
save our unemployed derrieres, which,

23
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,601
lucky for you, I have.
I have found a story

24
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,964
that will get us corner offices
at The Planet with parking on P1.

25
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:34,270
- We have to start now.
- I appreciate the offer

26
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,231
but I can't drop everything right now.

27
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,389
I have been pounding back
double-double espressos,

28
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:43,939
just trying to keep us
on some kind of a masthead

29
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,770
and you've bee doing what, exactly?

30
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,823
I just have some responsibilities
that I can't ignore.

31
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:52,360
Here's something I can't ignore.

32
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,322
I need a purpose...

33
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:57,621
Some kind of bigger mission in life.

34
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,035
You don't seem to need that.

35
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,925
You're under a lot of stress right now.

36
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,237
I understand that, but maybe
you're just overreacting.

37
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,105
To what?

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,631
My life falling apart?

39
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,550
Just give me a break.

40
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,463
You want a break?

41
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,930
Maybe we should take a break.

42
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:26,479
A break from this relationship.

43
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,164
Mom!

44
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,305
What a surprise.

45
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,369
<i>I thought you'd be at The Planet.</i>

46
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,581
I'm working from home.

47
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,457
What are you doing here?

48
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:49,834
I need excuse to see my own son?

49
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,385
Lois, You'll stay for dinner, I hope.

50
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,551
I've got plenty for the four of us

51
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,887
"the four of us"?

52
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:04,197
I don't know why you
need all these clothes.

53
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:06,977
<i>With my help, you
won't be wearing any...</i>

54
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,023
You remember Perry White?

55
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,234
<i>The Perry White?</i>

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,622
Smallville -
9x20 - Hostage

57
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,710
Synchro: Flolo

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,876
SeriesSub.com/Sous-Titres. Eu

59
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:34,024
I think about him every day.

60
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,506
<i>Your father and I had our
first date in this barn.</i>

61
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,849
I made a surprise picnic,

62
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,573
but his truck broke down So...

63
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,451
we ate it in here.

64
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:50,174
I'm glad you made it home, mom.

65
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,404
The Senate broke early
for recess, and...

66
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,571
the truth is...

67
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:03,464
I couldn't face the memories.

68
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,124
It's hard coming back to this place.

69
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:12,242
I'm just glad you're here now.

70
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,615
About Perry,

71
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,877
I hope you don't mind. I bumped
into him at a committee hearing

72
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,540
a few months ago.

73
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,992
It's okay, mom.

74
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:30,069
As long as he doesn't
start looking for a story.

75
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:32,416
I've had my hands full
with the Kandorians.

76
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,960
I'm so proud of everything
you're doing to help your people.

77
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,152
It hasn't been easy.

78
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,965
More than ever, I've
been living two lives.

79
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,676
One of those lives is full of sacrifice,

80
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,577
so I'm glad to see the
other one hs Lois in it.

81
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:50,433
I sleep better knowing you have
someone special in your life.

82
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,274
Oh, my God. You have got to forward this
to my high-school journalism teacher.

83
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,481
Check it out, Mrs. Kreitzman, me and
Perry White. Who's sorry now, biotch?

84
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:09,245
Sorry, kid. Last thing I need
is a Mrs. Kreitzman on my ass.

85
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,944
By the way, I've, uh,
read some of your stuff.

86
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,343
You and Clark are a regular
Woodward and Bernstein.

87
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,965
Thanks.

88
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,307
We aren't really writing
together at the moment.

89
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:25,129
- Is that your next big story?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:28,387
I've been traking this one
for months. Big players.

91
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,681
This thing is my white whale, kid.

92
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,767
Sorry I can't share any details.

93
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,887
Too bad, Ahab...

94
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,271
'Cause I've got something
pretty big on the line, too.

95
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,440
It's gonna cause quite a splash.

96
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,307
If it's as huge as you say it is,

97
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:44,528
good luck reeling it in all by yourself.

98
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:46,992
That's true.

99
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,560
I don't have Clark right now
to help with the heavy lifting.

100
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,272
But this puppy sells itself.

101
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,325
It is gonna kick your story
back to Arts & Leisure.

102
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:08,699
You've got to be kidding me.

103
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:12,181
This is a goth guy on a
trampoline in a jogging suit.

104
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,434
No, it's the real thing.
I got a call from...

105
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,896
a guy who needed my help.

106
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:23,150
And whe I started investigating
this shady redhead,

107
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,495
I found the mother lode.

108
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,114
There are aliens here on our planet.

109
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:33,002
<i>And they are looking for this.</i>

110
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:36,877
The book of RAU.

111
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,168
The book of RAU.

112
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,411
Really?

113
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,211
I've seen this before.

114
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:47,362
You got to give some to get some.

115
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,265
All right, lane. Here's what I've got.

116
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,099
A secret government complex in the
Rocky Mountains was blown to bits.

117
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,163
When I tried to investigate,

118
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:03,418
I was blocked by an operative
even the FBI doesn't know about...

119
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:05,813
code name: Red Queen.

120
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:09,324
Now, I think she's shadowing a
secret organization called Checkmate,

121
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,074
which is fighting some
kind of terrorist invasion.

122
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:16,412
And it's all somehow
connected with this.

123
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:21,167
<i>Maybe our two stories
are really the same story.</i>

124
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:24,454
This is your lucky day, kid.

125
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:27,552
The big break most
people only dream about.

126
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,302
You get to write a
story with Perry White.

127
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:10,746
Damn it!

128
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:15,472
What did you do to this place?!

129
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,439
Where is the book of RAU?

130
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:49,580
I've got to hand it to you, Mrs. K.
running Senate subcommittees by day,

131
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,503
cooking rockin' meals by night.

132
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,405
You put the "m" in "modern woman."

133
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,551
Me, I put the "t" in "takeout."

134
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,540
So, tell me all the news.

135
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,333
How are you and Clark?

136
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,562
You know, everything's... peachy.

137
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:08,608
You know us, chocolate and peanut
butter, Yin and Yang, Tarzan and Jane.

138
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:13,435
Okay, maybe not the "pulling
hair, jungle love" of it all.

139
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,075
Perry mentioned you aren't writing
together. Is everything okay?

140
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,119
Yeah.

141
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>Have you ever wanted to do something
really important with your life?</i>

142
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,062
Right.

143
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:33,257
The Senator thing kind of says it all.

144
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:38,638
It wasn't easy for me to leave
Clark and go to Washington.

145
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,392
But a part of me really
needed to take that next step.

146
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,437
That is exactly how I felt
when I was talking to...

147
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,445
this friend.

148
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,530
We used to work together.

149
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,384
And when I helped him...

150
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,673
it was like I had a higher purpose.

151
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:06,044
Like I was...

152
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,115
saving the world.

153
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:16,745
You know, after the glow
of my wedding wore off,

154
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,133
<i>I wondered if I'd made a huge mistake</i>

155
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,466
following Jonathan to a small
town where I didn't fit in.

156
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:26,140
I went from a city socialite
headed for law school

157
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:30,235
to being a farmer's wife,
marooned on an island of corn.

158
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,423
Sounds like Smallville."

159
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:35,841
You can imagine how I felt

160
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:39,111
when I was offered a job
interning for a federal judge.

161
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:42,088
I just jumped at the chance.

162
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:45,413
It was such an exciting tme in my life.

163
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:50,084
But in the end... you didn't stay.

164
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,292
I came home on a rainy weekend

165
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:57,372
and discovered the River was rising.

166
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:59,738
So I pulled on work boots

167
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:02,597
and went down to the
River with Jonathan.

168
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,476
And we started throwing sandbags.

169
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:09,072
We worked all night holding
back a wall of water.

170
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,126
When the sun rose...

171
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:17,080
I got to tell 20 families

172
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:19,655
that it was safe to go home again.

173
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:24,007
The city girl saves the day.

174
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:28,599
I didn't know what my purpose
really was until that rainy day.

175
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,785
I just needed to look inside myself.

176
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,095
Listen, Clark, the
Kandorians are still M.I.A.

177
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:46,849
What about the book of RAU? I've
searched the entire farm. It's not here.

178
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:49,533
Yeah, lucky for us my
mini-watchtower-that-could

179
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:52,727
is actually pulling off
a monster-wide Web search.

180
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:56,293
So if there's any mention of the
book of RAU anywhere in this...

181
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,429
Bad news, Clark.

182
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:07,408
It looks like I just got a
Red Queen virtual smackdown.

183
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:10,715
Red Queen? That sounds like Checkmate.

184
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,871
Yeah, despite her handle, the Red Queen

185
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,006
isn't actually a figure
on Checkmate's board.

186
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:18,899
In fact, the rumor has it that her name
has been filed under big, bad Nemesis.

187
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,081
I'll be there as soon as I can.

188
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:26,722
I'm sort of held hostage here
until after my mom's family dinner.

189
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:33,096
Come on. Sit. Join me in a drink

190
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,410
club soda. Since that little

191
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,156
wake-up call of yours years ago,
I'm a teetotaler. And an utter bore.

192
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,681
Still chasing down stories, I see.

193
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:53,392
This is just a little freelance
project, I'm doing on the side...

194
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:56,049
with Lois, actually.

195
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,130
I hope I'm not overstepping.

196
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,686
No.

197
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:04,868
<i>There was this one story she
wanted my help on, but I...</i>

198
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:08,211
Looks like she's traded up for a more...

199
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,308
experienced partner.

200
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,647
I'll let you in on a little
secret. Experience is overrated.

201
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:20,418
I spent the first 20 years of my career

202
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,757
living out of a carry-on bag,
chasing every story that moved.

203
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:25,659
I was saving the world.

204
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:27,922
That's a big job for a simple reporter.

205
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:29,590
Yeah, well...

206
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,693
Two ex-wives and an ex-dog
later, it finally sunk in.

207
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,292
What matters most is having someone
around to share your life with.

208
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,594
Someone like your mom.

209
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:48,486
Clark, here's the thing.

210
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,182
I'm gonna ask your mother to marry me.

211
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,396
I'd like your blessing.

212
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,946
Mr. White, I don't want to
get in the middle of anything.

213
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:11,661
I'm not sure she's gonna give
you the answer you're looking for.

214
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,929
Lois, we need to talk.

215
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:28,577
I don't want to take a
break. I still believe in us.

216
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:30,575
I want to believe in us, too.

217
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,015
But there's a lot I have to figure out,
I can't keep lying to everyone about us.

218
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,310
Mom! Everything smells great.

219
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,563
Thanks, honey. Could you
two help me with the...

220
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,449
Mom, what is it?

221
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,163
Who's up for a crackling fire?

222
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,920
What did I do?

223
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,465
That was my dad's jacket.

224
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,046
What a spread.

225
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,744
You really outdid yourself, honey.

226
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,251
All right, you lovbirds.

227
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,700
Tell us what it's like
working together and dating.

228
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,986
It's never been better.

229
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,402
It's kind of like being on a chain
gang with your ball and chain.

230
00:16:56,801 --> 00:17:00,686
Sometimes our job gets in the
way but we always work it out.

231
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,942
Except when we don't.

232
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:12,874
<i>Didn't I read an engagement
announcement in The Daily Planet?</i>

233
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,911
I thought we weren't
gonna bring that up, dear.

234
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,386
Lois and I got our signals crossed.

235
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:26,587
Yeah, I don't know how
that "I do" slipped out.

236
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:32,009
We're having so much fun, we're
enjoying taking it slowly now.

237
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,466
<i>You don't hear that very often.</i>

238
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:37,014
I think it's nice to be
a little old-fashioned.

239
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,838
Yeah. People are in
such a hurry these days.

240
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,104
<i>How's that working out for you, Lois?</i>

241
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,485
Well...

242
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,700
Mrs. K., I can't keep lying to you.

243
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:05,254
<i>Clark and I aren't working together
at The Daily Planet. We were fired.</i>

244
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,255
And we aren't taking it slow.
We're actually taking a break.

245
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,176
The truth is, Clark...

246
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,973
I need to find a way to make
a difference with my life.

247
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:22,685
And I realize now that
I can't look to you...

248
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,816
or even The Blur to
make that happen for me.

249
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,569
I need to do it on my own.

250
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,738
So maybe what we need right now...

251
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,062
Isn't a break.

252
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,996
It's a breakup.

253
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,778
Excuse me.

254
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:03,888
Don't do this.

255
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,719
If you care about me...

256
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:10,295
Then let me go.

257
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:23,684
Don't worry. I'll see
that she gets back safe.

258
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,375
I got a story that's
just come up, anyway.

259
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,514
- Here. Let me help you.
- Yeah.

260
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,922
Thanks for dinner.

261
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,184
Oliver. Are you okay?

262
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,145
I'm gonna be great.

263
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,417
Zod. He burned you.

264
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:13,354
We have to get out of here. Did
this guy tell you what he wants?

265
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,980
I don't know what the hell he
wants. He said something about

266
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:18,759
someone named the Red Queen and
a gold disk, a bunch of aliens.

267
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,554
Really great stuff. It
sounded right up your alley.

268
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:25,872
Wait a minute.

269
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,649
This whole thing's an act,
right? You had me hauled in here

270
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:32,909
so you could get information
about this RAU thing.

271
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,944
It's you. You're the Red Queen.

272
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:46,064
- Talk about a recipe for disaster.
- It's all my fault.

273
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:49,334
The last thing I wanted to do
was ruin your wekend with Perry.

274
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,062
<i>Perry didn't leave because of you.</i>

275
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:57,180
I thought I was ready, but
maybe it's still too soon.

276
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,301
<i>I guess we were all pretending
things were better than they were.</i>

277
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:03,339
I'm sorry I wasn't more
honest with you, mom.

278
00:21:03,786 --> 00:21:07,152
Even for a weekend, I just wanted
things to be the way they used to be.

279
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:10,978
But they're not. We both
need to face that fact.

280
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:14,065
Anyway, I'm not the person
you should be worried about.

281
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:18,699
I know. I really messed things up
with Lois. It's just so complicated.

282
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:21,326
<i>Right when we got fired from The
Daily Planet, I started having</i>

283
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,372
problems with the Kandorians, and I...

284
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,171
just couldn't stop lying to her.

285
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,836
Sometimes the hardest save to make
isn't a stranger in a burning building,

286
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:33,592
it's the person closest to you.

287
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:36,872
Maybe you need to be honest with her.

288
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,576
I sort of tried to tell her who I am,

289
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,536
but she thought it was more
important I protect my identity.

290
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:46,582
Talking to her as The Blur...

291
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,821
I've seen a different side of her.

292
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:54,445
And it's made me fall deeper...

293
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:58,733
and it's just not a side she's
decided to share with Clark Kent.

294
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:05,527
If you want her back,

295
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:08,661
you're going to have to take the
next step in your relationship.

296
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:12,331
Otherwise, you'll have to let her go.

297
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,931
Thanks for all your help Perry. I needed
to get my head into a story right now.

298
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:26,387
Either you've been robbed or
I missed a hell of a party.

299
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:29,522
My parties are never that good.

300
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:31,894
You know what this means, don't you?

301
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,395
We are officially a threat.

302
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,135
They really did a number on your closet.

303
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,229
No, no. It's always like this.

304
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,674
Hope this gets us to the Red Queen.

305
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,874
She showed up around the
same time Waller disappeared.

306
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,501
Maybe she's taken over
Checkmate's network.

307
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,763
Taco Dan's. What can I get you?

308
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:55,918
I know this phone is a direct line
of checkmate so this is my order.

309
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,753
Red Queen. Nothing
on the side, just her.

310
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,157
<i>Ma'am, this is a Mexican restaurant.</i>

311
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:04,598
Right. Taco Dan's? That the
best you can come up with?

312
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:06,762
I thought all you spy guys went to Yale.

313
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,898
<i>Lady, you have the wrong number.</i>

314
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,264
<i>No, Austin powers. I have your number.</i>

315
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,003
I know that you work
for a covert organization

316
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:17,082
dedicated to defending the
planet from an alien invasion,

317
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,445
that your boss was Amanda Waller.

318
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:23,778
And that that little chateau of yours
in the Rocky Mountains was blown to bits

319
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:26,549
probably by aliens
after the book of RAU,

320
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:29,294
which is why you better stop
with this guac-and-chips act

321
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:32,121
and get us some face time
with the Red Queen right now!

322
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,024
Or else we'll yank her
majesty off the chessboard

323
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,320
<i>and put her on the front
page of The Daily Planet.</i>

324
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:48,804
<i>Maybe that really was
a Mexican restaurant.</i>

325
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:53,015
Between this and the dinner disaster,
it looks like we're both 0 for 2 tonight.

326
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,567
Queen's at 37.318

327
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:03,064
minus 97.998.

328
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,854
Your move.

329
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,156
We just got the coordinates
to meet the Red Queen.

330
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:21,313
Vala! I need your help.

331
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:23,421
You killed my sister.

332
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,319
You don't really believe that, do you?

333
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:29,634
What do you want from me?

334
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,962
Everything you know
about the book of RAU.

335
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:35,624
It's the Kandorian bible.

336
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:38,754
And it has all the
knowledge and power of RAU.

337
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:43,378
<i>It will destroy our life on Earth.</i>

338
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:48,195
Does Zod have it?

339
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:50,732
He's cast a wide net.

340
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:54,076
But someone called the Red Queen
keeps blocking all of his moves.

341
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:57,204
This Red Queen
- do you know who she is?

342
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,255
I'm picking up a lot
of high-level chatter.

343
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,157
There's some big meet
and greet going down,

344
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:18,517
and the top of the guest list
is Lois lane and Perry White.

345
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,728
Who's hosting?

346
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:24,398
Our pal the Red Queen.

347
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:27,818
Vala thinks the Red
Queen is Tess' new handle.

348
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:31,740
If this is Tess gone rogue, then Lois
and Perry are about to get buried.

349
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,158
And I don't mean on page 10.

350
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,087
Where is the book of RAU?

351
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,547
Tell me now, or I kill him.

352
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,770
I can't believe you're
doing this to me, red.

353
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:52,471
I'm not this Red Queen!

354
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:59,625
Please don't kill him. He
has nothing to do with this!

355
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,386
<i>I am not asking again.</i>

356
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,119
You know, as much as
I hate you for it...

357
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,245
You were always the one.

358
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,328
I love you.

359
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,719
Nice try.

360
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,943
You know, you had me going
until you made Oliver confess.

361
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,648
You just had to go
that one step too far.

362
00:26:57,773 --> 00:26:59,660
We know you have the book of RAU.

363
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:04,078
You try any more head games,
and my torture won't be virtual.

364
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:16,650
You were right. It didn't work.

365
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,035
So, is this what it was like when
you busted the Star City strangler?

366
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,587
Did I do that? In the'90s.

367
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:37,581
Those were my fuzzy-navel years.

368
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,976
I've blacked out most of that decade.

369
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,589
Bogey, 12:00 high.

370
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,969
Looks like we've got an
audience with the Queen.

371
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:22,827
Look, Lane. If for some reason
I don't make it and you do...

372
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,695
Don't talk like that.

373
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,168
It's not pretty, but it has to be said.

374
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:29,240
I think I deserve first
position on the byline.

375
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:30,960
Come on, Perry!

376
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,643
Great Caesar's Ghost.

377
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,783
Perry, just hang on, okay?

378
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:05,306
That's what I tried last time.

379
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,131
Okay, just grab the cable.

380
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,863
Hang on, Perry!

381
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:02,320
I Got you.

382
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:17,989
I think I could get used to this.

383
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,796
The book of RAU... where is it?

384
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,370
This isn't over, Tess.

385
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,027
Any sign of Tess Mercer? Her reign
as the Red Queen is about to end.

386
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:15,548
While you were being krypto-knighted
by our mystery majesty,

387
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,693
Tess Mercer was being treated
for cracked ribs at Met Gen.

388
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:26,892
Then we still have
to find the Red Queen.

389
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:29,195
When will Watchtower be up and running?

390
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,654
I can't exactly call the geek squad.

391
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,057
And I haven't really had much time to...

392
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:37,163
I've seen you overhaul Watchtower
in one night. What's the holdup?

393
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:40,138
Watchtower's ready to go.

394
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,625
<i>I'm not.</i>

395
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,684
I found that footage of Jor-El
and the book of RAU one months ago.

396
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,077
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm sorry.

397
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:54,452
I got tangled in my own
little worldwide Web,

398
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,846
and I just lost track
of what was important.

399
00:31:58,156 --> 00:32:00,241
When you disappeared from my life,

400
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,461
I retracted into Watchtower.

401
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:05,091
And as I became Big Brother...

402
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,906
I guess more like big sister.

403
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,161
It's easy to think that
having all the information

404
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:13,544
is the same as having all the answers.

405
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,520
But I can't be the
eye in the sky anymore.

406
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,724
And now that I have Ollie...

407
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,596
I want to plug in to the real world.

408
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:39,923
Virtual reality bites.

409
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,727
What you've created here...

410
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,132
it's bigger than both of us.

411
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:53,180
It'll go on to serve future generations.

412
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,984
I'm not the hero here.

413
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,695
You may not be saving
people from train wrecks,

414
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,091
or shootouts but you are just as
much of a hero as the rest of us.

415
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,418
We're on the brink of war
and the world needs you.

416
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,575
<i>I need you.</i>

417
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,870
I just want you to know
that even when I hurt you,

418
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,962
I was trying to protect you.

419
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,174
Protect me.

420
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:42,737
The Red Queen, I presume.

421
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,424
Don't turn around.

422
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,893
Slowly set the disk on the floor

423
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:56,893
and slide it back to me.

424
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,878
Sorry that I sent your
mind reader packing.

425
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:10,408
Don't be.

426
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:13,404
I'm not a fan of his tactics,
but he got the job done.

427
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,982
You meant for me to get away.

428
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:23,119
How did you know I'd come here?

429
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,088
You're predictable.

430
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:30,626
You may be really good at staying
one step ahead of Checkmate,

431
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,091
but you don't know the
first thing about me.

432
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,609
You say you're saving The Planet,

433
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,011
but you really only care about yourself.

434
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:42,982
You figured out Maxwell's charade
because you knew in your heart

435
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,708
that Oliver's declaration
of love was a lie.

436
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,156
You can't comprehend what it means

437
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:53,683
to truly protect someone you love.

438
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:56,989
And stay away from Clark Kent.

439
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:59,597
If you're not careful,

440
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:02,924
you'll end up on the wrong
side of the coming apocalypse.

441
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,947
Oh, my God. Perry...

442
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,629
You've raised the dead.

443
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:33,861
You have single-handedly brought
my flatlined career back to life.

444
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:37,071
It's no big deal. I just put in
a good word with your boss, Stern.

445
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,039
I will never forget this.

446
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,496
And neither will Clark.

447
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,372
Make a good team, kid.

448
00:36:49,497 --> 00:36:51,908
I got a line on the Red Queen Nairobi.

449
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,819
I'm flying out tomorrow.

450
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:56,078
Tomorrow? What about you and Mrs. K.?

451
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:58,181
I'm not giving up on her yet.

452
00:36:58,306 --> 00:37:00,845
Martha's one story I'm
not sharing with anyone.

453
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:05,092
So what do you say, kid... Africa?

454
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:08,534
Normally, I would jump at the chance

455
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,908
at running away from my problems.

456
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:14,868
After one day in the
trenches with Perry White,

457
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,865
I realized I don't have to go anywhere
to find my higher calling. I just...

458
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:23,117
I needed to find the hero inside myself.

459
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:28,053
Goodbye, Lane. You're the real deal.

460
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,665
See you, chief.

461
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:33,774
And tell Clark we're even.

462
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:37,108
I owed him one from a long time ago.

463
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,773
I can't believe you have to go
back to being Senator Kent today.

464
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,586
When it's just the two of us here,

465
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,846
I'm your mom and nobody else.

466
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:41,517
I wish you could come
back and visit more often.

467
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:44,587
I had to let go of
this place for a while,

468
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:48,202
<i>but I never let go of
you. I'll be back soon.</i>

469
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,840
Maybe next time you can
ease up on the Kryptonite.

470
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:58,663
What on earth are you taing about?

471
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:00,720
You kept me in the house for dinner

472
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:03,293
so your people could
track down the book of RAU.

473
00:39:03,514 --> 00:39:05,861
Once you knew that Perry
and Lois were onto you,

474
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:07,888
you had to throw them off the trail.

475
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,047
You're the Red Queen.

476
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,355
Why didn't you come to me with this?

477
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,323
Because I didn't want
you in the line of fire.

478
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,993
So you dragged Perry
White along instead?

479
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:32,501
I had no idea he was on the trail.

480
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:36,347
He makes me laugh. He makes me feel like

481
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:39,019
everything's gonna be okay.

482
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:42,463
But I can't afford
that luxury right now.

483
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:49,472
I'm sorry But I'm gonna
need the book of RAU.

484
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:56,027
It was left here by Jor-El
for me to save this planet.

485
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:00,954
That's what you and dad raised me for.

486
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,027
It's my destiny.

487
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:08,036
Your father and I always trusted
you to do the right thing.

488
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:12,451
It seemed easier then.

489
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:16,505
But now, what you're up against...

490
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:26,088
When I went to Washington,

491
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:29,435
I found there were forces
working against you.

492
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:32,265
I wanted to protect you.

493
00:40:33,386 --> 00:40:36,032
But I couldn't do it as Martha Kent.

494
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,404
So I became the Red Queen.

495
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:51,951
The book of RAU.

496
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,992
Are you okay, mom?

497
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,178
It's just...

498
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:09,667
I told myself the world needs
Clark Kent even more than I do.

499
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:13,991
But the truth is, I was
so afraid of losing you.

500
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,505
You'll never lose me. I'll
always be here for you.

501
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,145
You don't understand.

502
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:23,388
The book of RAU can be used
to transport the Kandorians

503
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:25,854
to another plane of existence.

504
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,321
That may be the answer we need.

505
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:34,208
If the book of RAU is used
to send the Kandorians away,

506
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,569
all Kryptonians will
be exiled from Earth...

507
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,041
including you.
