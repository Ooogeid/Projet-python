1
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:33,804
Wait. I have a surprise for you.

2
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:39,149
Well, I like surprises.
But I don't like to wait.

3
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:45,324
It'll be worth it. Trust me.

4
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:05,181
No!

5
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:08,359
Come on! Get out of the car!

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,697
Hey!

7
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,921
Get out!

8
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,895
Shut up!

9
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:21,214
Come on!
Get up!

10
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,270
Come on!

11
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:33,891
Yeah.

12
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,374
Come on!

13
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,956
You want some of this?

14
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,703
They don't,

15
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,920
but I do.

16
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:28,282
Oliver?

17
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:40,022
Okay, I'm pretty open-minded, but kinky
hide-and-seek really isn't my game.

18
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,901
Okay, you win.

19
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,800
Ollie, Ollie, whatever, whatever.

20
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,781
Okay, Oliver, this isn't funny.

21
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:01,482
Where are you?

22
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:10,793
Good one, Lois.

23
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:17,191
Don't worry.
The cops will have a key.

24
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,033
Surprise.

25
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,462
"Rage"

26
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:46,600
Mom, I know I have a big appetite, but you got enough food here to feed a small army.

27
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,312
I thought it'd be a good idea to invite a few
people over for Thanksgiving this year.

28
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:53,791
Actually, I was hoping
we could keep it low-key.

29
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,193
I'm not feeling very thankful this year.

30
00:04:56,225 --> 00:05:00,881
Well, I know it's gonna be a hard day, Clark,
especially after what just happened to Raya, but

31
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:02,950
company could help.

32
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:06,202
Mom, it was dad's holiday.
He carved the turkey.

33
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,292
I can carve this year.

34
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:15,282
Mom, he was the one who made sure
we all said what we were thankful for.

35
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:20,592
He always made sure that I was thankful
for my abilities. But you know what? He was wrong.

36
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,971
If I was normal, 
he would still be here...

37
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,173
carving the turkey with
grandpa's old carving knife.

38
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:33,672
Hey.

39
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,141
So you can scratch Oliver's name
off the Thanksgiving guest list --

40
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,073
Or any other guest list, 
for that matter.

41
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:44,183
I'm solo.

42
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:46,111
Well, that's too bad. What happened?

43
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:50,113
Last night he pulled another one
of his trademark disappearing acts --

44
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:52,320
smack in the middle of a date.

45
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:54,630
Well, I'm sorry, Lois.

46
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:59,122
Oh, don't be. I mean, who's kidding
who here? We had no future.

47
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:04,630
He's a world-renowned billionaire, and I am
a nail-biting, talon-doling tabloid reporter.

48
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:07,961
Lois, I'm sure you'll find someone
who's better suited for you.

49
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,913
Yeah, I know, I know--Life goes on.

50
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:14,570
At least for some people.
Have you heard the news?

51
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,040
The Green Arrow was shot last night.

52
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:20,363
It's in today's Planet.

53
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:26,823
A man found him bleeding and ran for help,
but when the cops finally got there,

54
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:29,001
all that was left was a bloodstain.

55
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,210
Lex?

56
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:45,661
I found the charitable organization
I want to focus on.

57
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:48,652
It's second chance halfway house.

58
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,743
I have the time, and I heard you
mention their name on the phone,

59
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,913
and then I found this brochure.

60
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,363
What an amazing program.

61
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,033
I don't see why they can't be
in every city in this country.

62
00:06:59,057 --> 00:06:59,860
Lana,

63
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:04,400
you'd be in contact with violent
criminals just released from prison.

64
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,923
Maybe from time to time, but
mostly I'd be at the central office.

65
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:13,910
Look, why not channel your energy into the youth
foundation or the center for victims' rights?

66
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,222
Because this is what I want to do.

67
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,403
I'm just trying to protect you.

68
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:23,902
What is it with people feeling
like they have to protect me?

69
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,390
Lex, I don't need to be watched over.

70
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:31,113
I didn't say you did.
I want you to be safe.

71
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,402
Well, this isn't about what you want.

72
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,570
This is about what I want.

73
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:39,131
Pick any other project.

74
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:41,463
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,302
Looking awfully healthy.

76
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,201
It's called exercise, Clark.

77
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,082
It's something we mere mortals
have to do from time to time.

78
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,773
According to the daily planet, the
Green Arrow was shot last night.

79
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:23,273
If  I was shot, don't you think I'd
be laying in a hospital or a morgue?

80
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,422
I'm not bulletproof like you are, Clark.

81
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:26,511
Besides,

82
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:30,570
you of all people should know better than to
believe everything you read in the newspaper.

83
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,471
It's the daily planet, 
not the inquisitor.

84
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,083
A witness saw you
lying in a pool of blood.

85
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:38,752
Well, maybe it was someone
else with a preference for green.

86
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:47,403
What's your Green Arrow gear doing
out in the middle of the room?

87
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:51,331
I'm uploading a video.
Check this out.

88
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:56,513
See that?

89
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,932
Now I've got footage of the scumbags,
so if they try to get away,

90
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:02,270
I can track them down.

91
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,233
Oliver, you're getting sloppy.
Your gear's in the middle of the room,

92
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:08,371
the door's unlocked. That could have
been Lois coming through the door.

93
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,360
Hey, you know what? I've had
a lot on my mind lately, all right?

94
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:13,821
Apparently, you were too busy
using your powers to bale hay

95
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:16,310
than to realize there's
a crime wave in Metropolis.

96
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:19,261
Let me ask you a question.

97
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,253
Are you ever gonna get off your ass
and finally do something for a change?

98
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,541
I didn't come here to be insulted.

99
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:27,340
There's the door. 
I don't remember you being invited.

100
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,151
Oliver, what's going on with you?

101
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,183
Clark, I don't need to
take advice from someone

102
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:34,803
whose only worry in life
is to protect his own identity.

103
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,240
That's a lie. You know it.

104
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:39,323
Let me tell you something. When I'm out on the streets, I'm protecting people, all right?

105
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:43,450
I got much bigger things to
worry about -- Like staying alive!

106
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:53,523
You okay?

107
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,570
- I'm fine. Just get out of here.
- You sure?

108
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:57,491
Go!

109
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,682
Come in.

110
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:48,760
Wow.

111
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,980
Since when did you turn the
apartment into a florist shop?

112
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,742
They're from Oliver.

113
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:58,621
Wait a second. The guy smothers you with
flowers, and you forget everything he's done?

114
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,860
Please. I'm not that gullible.

115
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:05,461
The whole botanical overkill is just
a lame attempt to beg forgiveness.

116
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:09,030
Well, if he shows up in person to beg
for forgiveness, don't answer the door.

117
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,843
Lois, I went to talk to
him at his apartment.

118
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,260
You didn't.

119
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,401
- What were you thinking?
- I was looking out for you.

120
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:20,432
I have 20/20 vision, Smallville.
I look out for myself.

121
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:24,053
When I was in his apartment,
I found a needle and a syringe.

122
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:28,110
Unless they're doctor-prescribed,
I think Oliver's doing drugs.

123
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:30,901
This actually explains a lot.

124
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,251
All those times he disappeared.

125
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,712
I should have known.

126
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,831
He said that Thanksgiving
was a hard time of year --

127
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,621
Made him think about his parents.

128
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:44,323
Lois, I think you might
want to keep your distance.

129
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:49,440
He has a substance-abuse problem, 
not leprosy.

130
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:52,200
I am not going to abandon
him when he needs me the most.

131
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:54,703
He's  not himself right now,
and based on his behavior,

132
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,920
I don't think he's someone
you want to be around.

133
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,990
Well, see, that's the difference
between you and me, Clark.

134
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,223
I don't desert people
when they need help.

135
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,301
You're a miracle worker, Doc.

136
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:13,023
We need to talk, Mr. Queen.

137
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:14,561
We certainly do.

138
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:18,493
I finally found myself injured
badly enough to use the RL65.

139
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:21,190
And it works -- Perfectly.

140
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,242
And not just once -- I cut my hand,

141
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,060
And after one injection,
I was completely healed.

142
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, don't take any more.

143
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:32,740
Last time I checked, doctor, 
you work for me.

144
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,841
The lab mice have been exhibiting
irrational cognitive behavior.

145
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:38,384
And more troubling, violent tendencies.

146
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,036
I'm not a mouse. I feel fine.

147
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:42,612
Do you? No lapses in judgment?

148
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,922
No sudden outbursts of anger?

149
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:47,602
Not really.

150
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,762
But I am starting to feel
one coming on right now.

151
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,942
It's not worth risking
possible psychosis

152
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:55,653
just so you can climb mount Everest
or parachute out of your Learjet.

153
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:58,721
This isn't about my
recreational activities, doctor.

154
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:02,701
We're on the verge of a medical
breakthrough that could save countless lives.

155
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:06,111
I'm more than honored
to be the guinea pig.

156
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:17,141
Trust me. I can handle the
occasional temper tantrum.

157
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,560
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you
after the break, senator.

158
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,711
You have a happy
Thanksgiving, too. Bye bye.

159
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:42,133
Hi. Come on in. 
I was just about to call you.

160
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:44,122
I didn't get your rsvp.

161
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,830
Ah. Well, that is why I'm here. 
I, um...

162
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:56,061
...came in person to, uh, tell you
That I, uh, won't be coming for

163
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,010
Thanksgiving dinner.

164
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:02,092
Well, that's too bad. I was really
looking forward to seeing you.

165
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:08,952
After Lillian died, I somehow decided
that I would stop celebrating Thanksgiving.

166
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:13,223
Why don't you make an exception and celebrate
with us? We'd really love to have you.

167
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,633
I don't think Clark would agree.

168
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,331
The holiday's going to be, uh,

169
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:24,323
difficult this year without
extra complications for him.

170
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:27,203
You're not a complication, Lionel.
You're...

171
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:31,081
a part of my life now,

172
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,180
and I'm very thankful for that.

173
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,160
Do you know what that means to me?

174
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,691
Do you know what you mean to me?

175
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,401
Martha, I...

176
00:15:00,677 --> 00:15:03,772
I-I didn't mean to.

177
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:04,981
I'm...

178
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:08,650
sorry. I-I'm so sorry.

179
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,641
I take it this wasn't a party favor.

180
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:24,692
I broke into his apartment. There might
be some residue still left on it.

181
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:28,661
I'd call Oliver Queen a lot of things,
but I never thought I'd call him a junkie.

182
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:30,631
Chloe, I don't think he's getting high.

183
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,360
Come on, Clark. You of all people should
know that everyone has their secrets.

184
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:36,503
Besides, it's not that much
of a stretch to think that

185
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:39,143
a jet-setting billionaire might
have a little habit to hide.

186
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:41,743
Can  you just get it checked out?
We'll know for sure.

187
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:44,800
I'll text my biochem buddy at met "u."

188
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,990
Hopefully he hasn't left
for Thanksgiving already.

189
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:49,982
Hey, that Green Arrow story --
That victim actually see him get shot?

190
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:53,341
No. But the people that own
the car did come forward

191
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:55,933
and say that he saved them
from a carjacking that night.

192
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:58,020
He hasn't been spotted since.

193
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,881
Um, so I'm just gonna get
this syringe to my chemist.

194
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:03,402
Great.

195
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:07,111
Why don't you head out, and I will get
ahold of you as soon as I find anything?

196
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:10,411
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No! Why would I want to do that?

197
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:17,621
Lana.

198
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:18,952
Hi.

199
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,790
Us, girls were just gonna get some lunch.

200
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:26,702
That's great. Uh, have a good time.

201
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:34,260
Well, that wasn't awkward at all.

202
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:37,721
I tried to keep the heavenly bodies from
colliding, but there's only so much I can do.

203
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,831
I want you to check something
out for me before we go.

204
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:43,221
Okay.  My Google is your Google.
What do you need?

205
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,433
I'm curious about this halfway house
that Luthor Corp foundation supports.

206
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:50,173
I offered to get involved, but Lex won't let
me anywhere near it. He says it isn't safe.

207
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,970
Most halfway houses aren't
exactly amusement parks, Lana.

208
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,691
I don't think that's it.

209
00:16:56,566 --> 00:17:01,152
Lex swears that he's honest with me, but
lately he's--he's been a little secretive.

210
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,370
I don't know. 
Maybe I'm reading into it.

211
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:08,813
No, I think you're just being
cautious, which is smart.

212
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:10,781
Don't worry. 
We'll figure things out.

213
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,522
Are you all right?

214
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:16,843
Lana!

215
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:18,932
Lana?

216
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,262
Are you okay?

217
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,840
What happened?

218
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:27,121
From where I was sitting, it looked like
you fainted. Let's get you to a doctor.

219
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:30,321
No. It's okay. Can we keep
my little siesta between us?

220
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:32,191
I really wouldn't want
anyone worry.

221
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,161
Well, it's a little late for that, 
but yeah. Okay.

222
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:53,532
Surprise!

223
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,301
I didn't, uh --

224
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:49,432
Get away from me or I swear to
God I'll rip your green head off.

225
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:52,232
I'm calling the cops!

226
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,812
See? 911.

227
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:10,061
<i>Hello?</i>

228
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:11,923
Hello?

229
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:12,961
<i>911?</i>

230
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:16,911
I need an ambulance. Hurry.

231
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:21,382
Have you ever fainted before?

232
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:24,203
Three times, all in the last month.

233
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,820
And these headaches you've been having,
would you describe the pain as sharp or dull?

234
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:32,122
Sharp, like a knife.

235
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,372
And it's getting worse.

236
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:38,993
I have tried all of the over-the-counter
pain relievers, but none of them work.

237
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,942
They're just migraines, right?

238
00:19:43,736 --> 00:19:46,222
Just a few more tests,
we'll have a clearer picture.

239
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:03,163
Martha. I'm so glad
you came here.

240
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:06,042
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about...

241
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:08,210
about what happened. I...

242
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,041
I wanted to apologize for --

243
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:14,122
I didn't come here for an apology,
Lionel. You did nothing wrong.

244
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:15,081
I did.

245
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:18,021
I had no right to presume that I could --

246
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:18,913
Lionel, look.

247
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:22,240
There's something between us.

248
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:27,930
What it is, I don't think
either of us knows, but

249
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:31,001
I do know I'm not ready to find out.

250
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:32,770
Not yet.

251
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:37,012
I understand.

252
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,031
I don't think you do understand.

253
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,903
I value our relationship.

254
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:47,242
I really want you to be
with me for Thanksgiving.

255
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,312
Well, then, of course I will be there.

256
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:03,401
Lois, what happened?

257
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:09,933
Well, lucky for me, I walked in on Green Arrow
pulling a reverse Santa Claus on Oliver's apartment.

258
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:11,830
The Green Arrow did this to you?

259
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:15,912
I guess it was only a matter of time before
he hit up the new billionaire in town.

260
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:19,702
Luckily, I was able to get in
a few solid licks of my own.

261
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,890
He'll be nursing a couple
broken ribs, for sure.

262
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:25,352
Have you talked to Oliver yet?
Has he visited you here in the hospital?

263
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:27,672
No.

264
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,650
I tried him on all his numbers,
and he was nowhere to be found.

265
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,800
Clark, I'm nervous.

266
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:40,090
Either he's on some kind of crazy drug
bender or Green Arrow has gotten to him.

267
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,593
Lois, don't worry.

268
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:44,531
I promise I'll do everything
I can to track him down.

269
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,250
Yeah. That'll be a big help.

270
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:49,111
Look, I'll just call Chloe.

271
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:04,233
I'll take that.

272
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:06,153
I put a bullet in your chest.

273
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,473
And now you're gonna pay for it.

274
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:12,991
I don't think so.

275
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,672
Hey, buddy.

276
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:36,811
How did you survive that fall?!

277
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,350
Yoga. Now, let go of me!

278
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,491
Tell me how you were able
to heal or I'm calling the cops!

279
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,012
You'll call anyway.

280
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:45,240
You may be able to heal, but that
doesn't mean you don't feel pain!

281
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:49,563
- let go!
- You start talking!

282
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:52,250
There's this doctor comes
to the halfway house.

283
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:54,623
We get these shots they say are vitamins.

284
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:56,723
That's some kind of vitamin, huh?

285
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,212
What's the doctor's name?!

286
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:59,471
How am I supposed to know?!

287
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,042
What does he look like?!

288
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,831
It's not a he. She's a chick.

289
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:20,310
Waste not, want not.

290
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:23,703
What happened, doctor? Bad batch?

291
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,072
The project's shut down.

292
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:29,872
Look, I might have come
into this game a little late,

293
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,142
but I'm paying you a lot more than Queen.

294
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:34,002
He isn't shutting down anything.

295
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,753
You're right. I am.

296
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:38,843
And I could care less
about your petty rivalry.

297
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,970
This has gone beyond
one-upmanship, doctor.

298
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,670
Your research is now
a personal cause of mine.

299
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:48,873
Find another cause. I won't be
responsible for any more violence.

300
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:51,680
You should have thought about
that when you took my money.

301
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:54,683
I admit I was blinded by greed.

302
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:58,133
But now that people are getting hurt,
money means nothing to me.

303
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,511
I'm going back to the drawing board.

304
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,793
All existing RL65 is being destroyed.

305
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,160
I'm sorry, doctor.

306
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,523
I can't let you do that.

307
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,333
Hey, how's Lois?

308
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,871
Physically, she's fine,

309
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,961
but she's looking for Oliver.
I can't find him anywhere.

310
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:22,962
Maybe this will help.

311
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:27,541
My science geek analyzed the liquid
in that syringe and you're right.

312
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:29,620
No one's gonna take it and go to a rave.

313
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:34,423
It's a cutting-edge molecular modifier that
has something to do with tissue regeneration?

314
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:37,583
- So it has some sort of healing power.
- Conceivably.

315
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:42,172
But according to my Einstein, it also packs a mean punch to a part of your brain called the amygdala,

316
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:44,912
which triggers violent and aggressive behavior.

317
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:48,221
Now, why in god's name would Oliver
be injecting something like that?

318
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:51,812
I don't know. But we better find him
before he does something he regrets.

319
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:53,852
Who created the drug?

320
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:02,491
A woman named Pamela Black is the
only one doing that level of research.

321
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:07,801
She's a professor at Princeton and has been taking a recent sabbatical to work with Queen industries.

322
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:12,352
If she's supplying the drugs, then most
likely Oliver is gonna show up for more.

323
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,551
She's dead.

324
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,431
And her place has been
completely pillaged.

325
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:47,711
Look, drugs or no drugs, I can't
believe Oliver would kill someone.

326
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,722
I don't think it
was Oliver, Clark.

327
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:51,672
It was the Green Arrow.

328
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:58,213
Looks like our green hero has made the leap
from Robin Hood to cold-blooded killer.

329
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:01,691
I just don't understand why
a scientist was his target.

330
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:02,480
Chloe.

331
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:03,930
Clark!

332
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:14,312
These folders are from a halfway house
in Metropolis called second chance.

333
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:18,262
This doctor, she was giving the kids there
the same drugs that Oliver was taking.

334
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:22,422
Lex's foundation funds this halfway house.

335
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:25,500
Lex co-opted Oliver's scientist.

336
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,790
Those two have been at
each other since high school.

337
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:29,923
And the Green Arrow got in the way.

338
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:34,163
Ever the crusader for
the underprivileged,

339
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:37,070
he must have gotten wind of Dr. Black's secret
experiments and taken care of her his own way.

340
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:39,822
If the Green Arrow found out that
Luthor Corp was behind this,

341
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,683
Lex could be the next target.

342
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:04,173
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:07,710
I'm looking for Lex.

344
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:13,150
Uh... he's not here.

345
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,562
Are you okay?

346
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:24,883
Lana, what is it?

347
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:29,602
It's nothing. I'm fine.

348
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:35,312
You don't look fine.

349
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:41,533
You can talk to me. It's okay.

350
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:44,653
It is.

351
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:51,333
Do you ever wish that you
could go back in time and...

352
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,480
everything would be different?

353
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:01,572
All the time.

354
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,812
What happened? What did...

355
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,903
What did Lex do?

356
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,263
He didn't do anything.

357
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,903
If you're in trouble, Lana, I can help.

358
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,340
Clark, this has nothing to do with you.

359
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,681
Could you please just go?

360
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,543
Your car's ready, sir.

361
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:16,021
Sorry, Luthor.

362
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,712
Work's not over yet.

363
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,192
What is this?

364
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,351
Sign on the dotted line,
and all your assets

365
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,742
will be divided among the
50 global charities listed below.

366
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:31,620
Would you mind telling me
what I've done to deserve this?

367
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,963
After your lofty support of the
second chance halfway house,

368
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:36,721
I think it's a natural step.

369
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:38,882
I went by to pay the facility a visit,

370
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:43,290
and after some gentle prodding, the director told me what you and Dr. Black were doing to the residents.

371
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:44,512
She was lying.

372
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:47,871
I went to pay the good doctor a visit, 
and guess what.

373
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:49,650
She's dead.

374
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:55,780
I knew you weren't a saint, Luthor,
But killing a woman to cover your tracks?

375
00:29:56,738 --> 00:29:58,503
You're delusional.

376
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:00,821
Sign it.

377
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,293
What the hell are you doing?

378
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,121
It's out of ink.

379
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:15,741
Drop it!

380
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:21,481
You first.

381
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:25,330
What do you think is faster,
an arrow or a bullet?

382
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:29,621
There's only one way to find out.

383
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,301
Oliver!

384
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:04,490
What have you done?

385
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,602
He pulled a gun, Clark.
I had no choice.

386
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:09,011
Lex?

387
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:11,071
Lex?

388
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,590
Let nature take its course.

389
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,800
Oliver, that's the drugs talking.

390
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:19,082
It's not you.

391
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,090
That drug is the best thing that
ever happened to me, Clark.

392
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:24,343
I'm not bulletproof like you, 
all right?

393
00:31:24,387 --> 00:31:27,101
I got to do whatever it takes.
I need that drug.

394
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:29,193
Oliver, you're not a killer!

395
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,771
No, but he is, Clark

396
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:34,163
You  and I both know the world's
a better place without Lex Luthor.

397
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:40,421
That's not for us to decide.
Oliver...

398
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:42,880
Where are the drugs?

399
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,900
Lex -- He took it all.
He took it all from the lab.

400
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:02,831
Let him die.

401
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,091
You killed him.

402
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,072
You killed him.

403
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,520
Who am I dealing with, Jekyll or Hyde?

404
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:40,682
Just plain old Oliver today, Clark.

405
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,402
You haven't broken any glasses.
That's a good sign.

406
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:45,673
Right.

407
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:48,760
What made you
come to your senses?

408
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:52,331
Actually, you did.

409
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:58,372
This whole time, I just wanted be like
Clark Kent, you know? I wanted to, uh...

410
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:02,330
I wanted to have the ability to
bring justice to the world

411
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:05,261
without having to worry about
getting killed in the process.

412
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:11,702
And then something occurred to me, 
and I realized that, uh...

413
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:14,700
... Clark Kent would never
take another man's life.

414
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:18,720
I came within an inch
of doing just that.

415
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:25,603
I'm not even in your league.

416
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:30,241
Oliver, you do a lot
of good in this world.

417
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,552
You don't need to be
indestructible to be a hero.

418
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,583
Yeah. Well, you're right.
You're right. Yeah. Um...

419
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:42,151
I should be thankful for who I am, right,
and the abilities that I have. I know that.

420
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:45,063
Me too.

421
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:53,130
Now, come on. You can't be alone
on Thanksgiving. The bird's waiting.

422
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:57,252
Thanks, Clark. I appreciate the offer, 
but I can't. I...

423
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,321
Look, Lois is gonna be there,

424
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,532
and I'm pretty sure she doesn't even
want to be in the same ZIP code as me.

425
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,621
Now that you're back on track,

426
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:07,982
I'm sure Lois is gonna want you there.

427
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:09,900
Trust me.

428
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,252
Whoa. Trust you?

429
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:16,971
What happened to all the lectures about guys with secret identities not being able to handle relationships?

430
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,010
The truth is, you and I are different.

431
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,661
And Lois isn't Lana.

432
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:28,231
If you two are meant to be together,
then who am I to stand in the way?

433
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:48,781
Hey! Are you feeling any better?

434
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,633
Hanging in there.

435
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,923
Make yourself comfortable.

436
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:57,253
I did my due diligence on the second
chances halfway house, and I found --

437
00:35:57,285 --> 00:36:01,370
Chloe, um... I'm not here to
talk about the halfway house.

438
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:04,531
Okay.

439
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:09,273
But there's some stuff I think you
should know about, Lana -- about Lex.

440
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:13,003
I don't want to hear anything
more about Lex. I can't.

441
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:17,143
What's going on?

442
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:19,081
Lana, what happened?

443
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:23,783
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

444
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:30,350
Chloe...

445
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:34,061
... I'm pregnant.

446
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:43,401
Okay.

447
00:36:58,495 --> 00:36:59,363
There.

448
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:02,091
Did you cook that on the barbecue?

449
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:06,363
It's a little crispy on the outside,
but it's what's on the inside that counts.

450
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,952
I'm sure it's delicious.

451
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:10,350
Clark, would you put the
hot plate on the table, please?

452
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:12,610
Did you talk to Oliver today?

453
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:15,490
Don't go there, Smallville.

454
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,681
I think that's for you.

455
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:23,923
Hmm.

456
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:31,821
Jimmy says hi from his mom's house,
and ever the reporter, he sends news.

457
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:34,933
I guess the Metropolis P.D.
arrested Pamela Black's killer,

458
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:37,940
And you were right.
It wasn't the Green Arrow.

459
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:40,110
It was some kid from
the halfway house.

460
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:43,343
I'd bet anything that Lex
is somehow behind this.

461
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:46,351
Maybe. I doubt we'll be
able to prove it, though.

462
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:49,560
I guarantee you Lex's shredders
are doing some serious overtime.

463
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:51,331
Does Lana know about this?

464
00:37:52,307 --> 00:37:55,543
It's just I went by the mansion the other day,
and she was really upset about something.

465
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:56,542
Is she all right?

466
00:37:58,498 --> 00:37:59,311
Yeah.

467
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:01,863
Yeah. As far as I know.

468
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:03,521
She's fine.

469
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:12,273
Oliver.

470
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:16,011
Happy turkey day.

471
00:38:22,085 --> 00:38:24,653
Where you been?
I've been worried about you.

472
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,220
Yeah. Um...

473
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:29,610
Listen, that's all over now.

474
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:34,932
I'm like a walking
drug-free zone, honest.

475
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:41,002
So if I were to hug you right now, I wouldn't
stab myself on any stray needles?

476
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:43,433
Get over here.

477
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,121
I'm so sorry I ever hurt you.

478
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,111
- Ooh.
- Wow!

479
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,310
If I could have everyone's
attention, please, um,

480
00:39:13,347 --> 00:39:15,161
I'd like to make a
little announcement.

481
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,521
Our family has a tradition

482
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,490
That goes back way
before I was even born...

483
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,713
where everyone takes a moment to

484
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:30,802
say what they're most
thankful for in their lives.

485
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:39,320
I would just like to say
that I'm most thankful for

486
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:40,510
my mom and dad...

487
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:50,113
...whose faith in me taught me
to have faith in myself.

488
00:39:51,676 --> 00:39:52,542
Thank you.

489
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:02,111
Let's eat.

490
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,270
You haven't said a word all night.

491
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:14,250
Is everything okay?

492
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,302
Everything's fine.

493
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,520
Happy Thanksgiving.
