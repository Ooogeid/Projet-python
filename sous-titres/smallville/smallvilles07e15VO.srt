1
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,959
Quiet morning.

2
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,166
It's cold, still...

3
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,771
Bleak.

4
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,732
Almost reminds you of Krypton, doesn't it?

5
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,537
Who are you?

6
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,201
The answer to many
of your unanswered questions.

7
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:24,019
I seriously think you have
the wrong farmhouse.

8
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,901
I would have expected a girl raised by
such a stoic race to be a better liar.

9
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:31,520
But you're just as transparent as Kal-El.

10
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,036
- How do you know Kal-El?
- I've been watching.

11
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,981
I don't know what you want,

12
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,620
But that life is in my past.

13
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:50,795
Only because you have no option to
return, but you woul wouldn't you?

14
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,432
You have to miss the way
things used to be.

15
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,047
Getting memory back must have been...

16
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,703
A disappointment.

17
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,320
I like my life here.

18
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,912
And I think you should leave.

19
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,406
That's a valiant effort,

20
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:15,820
But it's not the truth.

21
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,744
What if I told you

22
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,403
That there was a way to go back...

23
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,616
To save everyone you loved?

24
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,920
I'd say you weren't the first Kryptonian
to use those memories against me.

25
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,772
And it won't work.

26
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,893
That's unfortunate...

27
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:44,297
Because I need you.

28
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,519
Sorry. At's not my problem.

29
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,070
Well, at least you can't say
I didn't ask nicely.

30
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,203
Just remember...

31
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,597
If we'd have done this my way,

32
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,887
No one would have gotten hurt.

33
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,820

36
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,369
Why didn't you tell me there was
another Kryptonian on Earth?

37
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,802
You were halfway across the country
with no memory. And he's not a guy.

38
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:36,103
He's a machine. He's a...

39
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,050
He's a computer.

40
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,312
Brainiac.

41
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,608
The last time I went up
against this thing,

42
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,270
He wanted me to release Zod.

43
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:53,159
But you destroyed Zod, right?

44
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,743
What is he after now?

45
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,870
Me.

46
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,570
Your father.

47
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:10,166
He made a lot of bad choices toward
the end. Is it possible that he and

48
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:13,074
- Zod were allies?
- Never.

49
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,106
If there's one thing
that our fathers agreed on,

50
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:18,096
It was their hatred for Zod.

51
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:20,856
Then why has he turned
his attention toward you?

52
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,270
I don't know.

53
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,636
But when we go up against him,

54
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,970
It would be helpful if we were all
on the same playing field.

55
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,431
Or should I say "sky"?

56
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,700
Aren't articles supposed to have words?

57
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:01,713
Well, I just start with the best
part and work backwards.

58
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,669
Well, my photo card has
an equally big blank spot

59
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,887
That's dying to be filled, and I was

60
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,815
just wondering if...

61
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:15,969
... well, If you needed some eye candy to
complement those pros, but it looks like...

62
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,969
Don't they put you guys on assignment?

63
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,747
Yeah, yeah. The, um, the little stuff.

64
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,610
But now that the news is brought
to you by Luthorcorp,

65
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,860
I need something really, really big
to stay off the gallows.

66
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:31,672
Don't worry. Lex couldn't hate you
more than he hates me.

67
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,206
So why not give him a double whammy?

68
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,335
Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen
in their big debut.

69
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:44,842
What about Chloe?

70
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,869
Well, I know this will shock
you, but Clark called,

71
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,413
And Chloe ran off
on some big secret project.

72
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,970
Okay. Better make sure that camera
is loaded with ammo

73
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:09,381
Because I got tomorrow's headline.

74
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:12,638
"Daughter of nobel-Winning
astronomer murdered."

75
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:15,670
That Swann woman they fished out
of the lake last night?

76
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,839
Yeah.

77
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,753
I thought that she drowned.

78
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,556
More like sank.

79
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:24,106
Kind of hard to swim
after you've been shot.

80
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,269
All the tracks have been
covered, Mr. Luthor.

81
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,172
No one will ever be able to
trace the locket back to you.

82
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:44,434
- I don't need to remind you.
- Absolute secrecy.

83
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,769
After this many years, trust me,

84
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,407
I understand the magnitude of this moment.

85
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,278
It's funny.

86
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,370
All those global treasure hunts
and cave excavations,

87
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,235
And the secret of veritas was
so much closer than I thought.

88
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:03,225
I suppose it's poetic in a way.

89
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,444
Most things we spend our lives searching for

90
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,709
Usually are right in front of us.

91
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,325
There is one thing I don't quite understand.

92
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,341
You say you've been
searching your whole life.

93
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:20,391
But I thought you didn't learn
about veritas until recently.

94
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:23,750
I've always known my father
was covering a secret...

95
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:28,057
A secret of cryptic symbols
and mystic stones.

96
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:30,859
I just didn't know it had a name.

97
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:32,870
And what was it?

98
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,702
The final piece?

99
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:39,970
My own memory.

100
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:44,770
After the first meteor shower,
there were years I blocked out.

101
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:52,551
I keep having flashes of things
that I'd forgotten.

102
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:55,022
And that's how you remembered that.

103
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,670
Come on, Patty. It's your turn.

104
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:14,869
But I just went.

105
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,474
Patty!

106
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:19,044
Okay, okay. I'll go.

107
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:32,770
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

108
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:35,388
Ready or not, here I come.

109
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:49,617
Dr. Swann has been very
open about the traveler.

110
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:53,220
Has he? I feel like I'm trying to solve
a puzzle fill with a few pieces,

111
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:57,227
- He's keeping things from us.
- Lionel! He's being cautious.

112
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:59,970
And from the... you're
suggesting, he should be.

113
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,683
Swann only tells us
what we need to know.

114
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:06,184
- It's safer that way.
- I understand, but

115
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:09,638
Suppose it's all been a trick, a ruse?

116
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,754
If we don't open that envelope,

117
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,869
Dr. Swann's conclusions could be as
mythical as the gods of mount olympus.

118
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,270
Virgil's gonna be here any minute.
I suggest you don't

119
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:22,743
Refer to his life's work as mythology.

120
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:24,770
Veritas...

121
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:28,318
Is the greatest secret the world
will ever know.

122
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,969
We form this group to use our wealth and power
to protect that secret, not expose it.

123
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,470
Is that Robert Queen talking,
or is that Virgil Swann?

124
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,932
- You're sounding more like him every day.
- Yes.

125
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,769
Dr. Swann made the discovery alone,

126
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,270
But that does not give him
the right to keep it to p mself.

127
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,270
Give me the envelope, please.

128
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,970
We promised that we
would meet the traveler

129
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,369
Before we decided to pursue
a way to control him.

130
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,870
Don't talk to me about promises.

131
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,370
You've been working in secret
with dr. Swann, haven't you?

132
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:58,170
And you, Edward, you and genevieve
gallivanting around the world.

133
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,969
You've been searching
for those magical stones.

134
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,557
Lionel, this is bigger than the Queens
or the teagues or the Luthors!

135
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,670
Long before our families united,

136
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:12,969
Men died protecting the secret of veritas.
If Edward's ancestors are right,

137
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,515
They've been sacrificing themselves
to prote it for centuries.

138
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,869
If dr. Swan prediction is correct,

139
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,988
The traveler is coming now.
We can't wait.

140
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,769
That envelope and the secret inside it

141
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,392
Will give us ultimate power.

142
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,313
You're afraid.

143
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:33,201
You don't trust yourself
with that, do you?

144
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:36,520
There isn't one among us

145
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,919
Who could resist that temptation.

146
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,920
We agreed we would not open that envelope

147
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,596
Unless the traveler proved to be a threat.

148
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,420
That's why Swann and I
are flying to Zurich ...

149
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,319
To make sure that the secret
is kept locked safely away

150
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,520
And ultimate power is left
in the hands of the gods.

151
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,132
Robert...

152
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,610
Find the bank this key belongs to.

153
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:43,719
Sir, that could take months.

154
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,819
Try 24 hours.

155
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,754
It's in Zurich.

156
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:31,839
Mr. Luthor, do you have any comment
on the death of Patricia Swann?

157
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,457
Put the camera down. Put it down!

158
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,796
Very Resourceful.

159
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,040
I realize that an appointment
or a press conference would be too

160
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,040
"Conventional"
for you, miss lane, but...

161
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,839
Oh, come on. You wouldn't take an interview
with me if your life depended on it.

162
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,039
So what makes you think
i'll respond to an ambush?

163
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,087
- This is your chance to tell the truth.
- The truth?

164
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:03,630
Before you're hauled away for murder.

165
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:07,139
I can't decide. Is it boundless courage you have,

166
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,962
Or is it incorrigible stupidity?

167
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,229
Potato, "po-Tah-To."

168
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,339
You were the last person
to speak with Swann

169
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,453
Before the poor woman ended up
sucking pond water.

170
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,860
All right.

171
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:25,990
This, uh, clever conversation is now over.

172
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:30,075
Suit yourself, but i'm not gonna be
the only one asking questions.

173
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,040
According to phone records,
you had five calls in one day

174
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,811
From a woman who was previously
questered overseas.

175
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,751
Just happened to be the day
that she ended up dead.

176
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:40,739
Business calls evidence of a business
transaction, which it was.

177
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,089
- Oh, I dont doubt that.
- Look.

178
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,584
Every photo ever taken of Patricia Swann
shows her weing this family locket.

179
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:51,296
Now, not only was this locket missing
when they fished her out of the lake,

180
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,568
But there was a burn,
Right here on her neck,

181
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,084
Where the chain was forcibly removed.

182
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,956
Very sad.

183
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,085
- My heart goes out to her family.
- Mr. Luthor ...

184
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,321
And now if that is all
from the dynamic duo,

185
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,481
Security will be very happy
to help you find your way out.

186
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,424
Easy as pie.

187
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,485
Clark, I know you sent Lana off to Isis
So she wouldn't see your maiden voyage.

188
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,339
When are you gonna stop stalling?

189
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,729
Not helping.

190
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,839
I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. It...

191
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,111
But it's just really easy.

192
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:49,666
Just up, up, and away.

193
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,763
- I don't have time for this.
- You saw Brainiac fly away.

194
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:06,624
- How do you plan on catching him?
- It won't matter if we don't find him first.

195
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,944
Instead, we're wasting time
with abilities that I don't have yet.

196
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:12,440
Fine. You cover the land,
and i'll cover the sky.

197
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,439
I wish it were that easy.

198
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,539
Chloe's been working overtime
trying to help me locate Brainiac.

199
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,048
Then he just shows up
with no warning.

200
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,016
There's got to be some way to track him.

201
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,333
Power.

202
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:33,017
Everyone needs to be fueled by something.

203
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:36,407
He's not affected by the sun like we are.

204
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,461
So what does he run on?

205
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,097
Maybe energy.

206
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,148
He's a computer.

207
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,566
Hello, Lana.

208
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,179
Let me go.

209
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,940
Chloe,

210
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,039
Why didn't you tell me
they found her last night?

211
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,158
I... just walked through the door.

212
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:34,040
Another member of
the veritas clan silenced.

213
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:38,207
Chloe, do you think Lionel's behind this?

214
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,840
I know he was throwing suspicion onto
Lex when you were captured,

215
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:43,439
But nothing I dug up reveals any links

216
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,186
Between Lex and the veritas clan
other than his father.

217
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,739
Looks like all the roads lead to Lionel.

218
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,739
What if she died...

219
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,870
Protecting me, Chloe?

220
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,384
Protecting my secret.

221
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,748
Clark, we don't have time
for guilt right now.

222
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,264
Look, I spent the entire morning

223
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,932
Sweet-Talking the centurion
at the department of water and power,

224
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,439
And he finall agreed to
fast-Track my password approval

225
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,067
So that we could scan the power grids
for any unusual surges.

226
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,639
Brazil, Honduras...

227
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,039
Florida.

228
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,262
God, Brainiac really gets around.

229
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,510
Oh, my god.

230
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,161
What is it?

231
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,634
A massive power surge flared up in
Metropolis right near the isis foundation.

232
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:55,639
- Save it for the police.
- Please, I came to see Lana.

233
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,439
I'd hoped that she could talk
some sense into you,

234
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,339
But we're running out of time, son.
You must listen to me.

235
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,839
You've already destroyed the life of
one son. You don't get a second chance.

236
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,112
The only real son you have
hates you just as much as I do.

237
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,022
That... That doesn't matter, but you've...
You've got to listen to me. Please!

238
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:15,258
You're right, It doesn't, cause you're just
gonna wash your hands of it, aren't you?

239
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,019
Just like you did when you murdered
dr. Swann and the Queens?

240
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,340
You haven't changed. Patricia told me,
and you killed her for it.

241
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,340
No. Clark, no. I'd never ...

242
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:31,741
All right. But it's...
It's not important

243
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:34,140
What you think of me, but I...

244
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:37,439
There are some things
that you should know.

245
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,839
I have kept your secret hidden
longer than you imagine.

246
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,839
I should have listened to my father.

247
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,595
I was stupid to think you could care
about anyone other than yourself.

248
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:49,047
You're less human than I am.

249
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,439
Clark, there's... There's! Something I...

250
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,206
I mus... Give you. Here, take this.

251
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,142
- Please!
- There's nothing you have that I want.

252
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,739
- Now, where's Lana?
- I don't know.

253
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,539
The receptionist

254
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,380
Said she had a visitor, and then she left.

255
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:05,229
A visitor.

256
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,243
Thank god you weren't at isis!

257
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,225
I was afraid Brainiac
had gone there to find you.

258
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:46,134
Lana, your hand.

259
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:00,240
No.

260
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,939
So much for team work.
Why'd you disappear on me?

261
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,527
I thought you were gonna check in with me
when you and Chloe found Brainiac.

262
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,448
Clark, what's wrong?

263
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,375
What happened?

264
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:33,148
It's Brainiac.
He's done something.

265
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:37,220
It was supposed to be me.

266
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,811
"Deliver Kara.

267
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:55,040
Daily Planet."

268
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,778
Lana please.

269
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,162
Well, It kind of takes the intrigue
out of breaking and entering.

270
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:29,586
So, why do you think that Lionel search
his deep, dark, murderous on Lana

271
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:33,618
He left his office and came
straight here. Just look around.

272
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,090
I am sorry, but this is really

273
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,888
Creepy.

274
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:02,656
Sexy.

275
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:23,247
No way.

276
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,052
Who is that?

277
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:28,759
Patricia Swann's driver/suspected
killer who's vanished.

278
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,492
Right.

279
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:33,889
And that's significant because...?

280
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,002
"Lana, I'm innocent. You have to
believe me. I need your help. Lionel."

281
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,304
The guy who killed Patricia Swann
wasn't hired by lionel.

282
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:50,183
He was working for Lex.

283
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,789
They're preparing the jet.
I hope you found the bank.

284
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,990
Sir, we traced the key to the
national depository of Switzerland,

285
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:17,289
But we hit a roadblock.

286
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,489
When we're this close, Ink it's fair to say

287
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,176
That persuading a glorified teller
should be the least of our worries.

288
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:26,489
If someone's holding out,
pay them whatever they're asking.

289
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:31,262
Sir, this bank held off the Third Reich, The Sicilian
mafia, and Al-Qaeda. With all due respect,

290
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,073
- I'm fairly certain they won't bow to you.
- I don't understand.

291
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:38,054
If they're requiring authorization,
that's not an issue. We have the key.

292
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:44,498
We have one key. Each safety-Deposit box in the
high-Security vault requires two.

293
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,278
Two?

294
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:50,389
We've already started trying
to track down the other, but...

295
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,388
We don't have any leads.

296
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:45,008
Hold on a minute, will you?

297
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,990
The divers... Did they
find anyone who survive?

298
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:51,324
No, sir. The Queens have
been confirmed dead.

299
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,435
- And their son... Oliver?
- Away at boarding school.

300
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,902
Their key... Do you have the key?

301
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:10,893
Your helicopter's waiting, sir.

302
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,474
Thank you.

303
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,547
I've got it.

304
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:21,690
No, well, we ...
We just need dr. Swann's.

305
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:25,589
No, all right.
Listen to me one more time.

306
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,490
The traveler is useless to us
unless we can control him.

307
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,190
Well the answer to that

308
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,521
Is sitting in a safety-Deposit
box in zurich.

309
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:41,952
Look, we'll talk later, all right?

310
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:55,390
Are you ready for an adventure, son?

311
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:57,829
Where's your tie?

312
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:01,990
Ah, okay. Here we go.

313
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,490
We are gonna fly in a helicopter

314
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:08,089
To a friendly little town just...

315
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,093
Just outside the city

316
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,490
Called Smallville.

317
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,321
Okay. Let's go.

318
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,766
I'm not sure we need to look
that far for the key.

319
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,396
Sir?

320
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:40,090
Like you said...

321
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,185
Most things we're searching
for are closer than we realize.

322
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,689
I can't let you do this.

323
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,521
What happened to Lana...
It's my fault.

324
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,930
Brainiac wants me.

325
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,570
But we don't know what for.

326
00:31:11,571 --> 00:31:15,445
- And I won't lose you and Lana.
- You won't have to.

327
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:21,179
What did you do to Lana?

328
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,162
A little adjustment
to her central nervous system.

329
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:28,690
Absolutely irreversible
by any human standards.

330
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,893
Completely reversible by me.

331
00:31:30,894 --> 00:31:33,248
Whatever you want me to do.

332
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,479
Just don't let Lana suffer.

333
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:39,575
I'm afraid that she is suffering.

334
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:45,416
There's a part of Lana that is completely
aware of what's happening around her,

335
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,068
But she has no control over her body.

336
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:53,150
Her motor skills, her speech,
ery breath she takes Is controlled by me.

337
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,870
Leave her out of this.

338
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,389
Did I mention that Lana
is in excruciating pain?

339
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,438
She just can't express it.

340
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:06,352
But you can end this.

341
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:11,310
Just come with me.

342
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,466
Kara? Kara, no!

343
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,420
It's a trap!

344
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:21,247
You can't trust him!

345
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,475
It's the only way to save Lana.

346
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,089
Miss Sullivan. You must talk to Clark.
I need you to talk to Clark.

347
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,789
A little late to mend that fence.

348
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,990
Amazing how a couple of cold-Blooded
murders can come between people.

349
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,756
No, no. I have taken moral responsibility
for every atrocity I committed in the past.

350
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:50,589
Past?! Try last week! Maybe even today.
Who knows with you?

351
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,689
I did not... Did not kill
Patricia Swann.

352
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,878
After you knocked off her father and the
rest of the veritas coven of yours,

353
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,708
I'm supposed to believe you why?

354
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,925
Because I was given a gift.

355
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:09,103
I was chosen by Jor-El to serve him ...

356
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,094
To be his vessel, his emissary.

357
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:15,065
And that changed me.

358
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,652
That made me a different man.

359
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,429
We're not stupid.

360
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,548
You preyed on Clark's inherent need
to find good in all people

361
00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:27,790
And his constant willingness for forgiveness.

362
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,390
But now you have cried wolf
one too many times.

363
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,071
Miss sullivan, please.

364
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,211
I'm begging you to listen.

365
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,260
Clark won't talk to me.

366
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,489
He's turned away from Jor-El,

367
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,848
And now he is vulnerable.

368
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:48,652
He is in terrible danger.

369
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,915
- If he's in any danger, it's only from you.
- No, I've repented!

370
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,389
That's right. You're
an intensely spiritual man.

371
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,172
You amassed all the power a human could
until you found out about Clark.

372
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,666
Be friending him is the closest thing
you'll ever get to seeing god.

373
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:11,370
Protecting him is the only way
I found to pay for my sins.

374
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,989
And isn't that what we all want?

375
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,454
To repent and be forgiven.

376
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,479
But none of that matters.

377
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,590
Because what's coming is so terrible.

378
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:32,178
- Another false warning.
- No!

379
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:35,704
- You seriously need to come up with a new line.
- No! It...

380
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,758
Hey. How is she?

381
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,278
- Clark, I'm so sorry.
- I really need to find Brainiac.

382
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,189
- Please tell me that you've got a lead.
- I wish I did,

383
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,699
But it's like kara and Brainiac
vanished off the map.

384
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,707
You can see her now.

385
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,179
I'll wait here for you.

386
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,384
It's me... Clark.

387
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:45,370
Kal-El.

388
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,948
You're too late, Kal-El.

389
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:11,740
