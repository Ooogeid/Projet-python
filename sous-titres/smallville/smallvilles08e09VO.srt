1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:02,432
Previously on "Smallville"...

2
00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:04,573
This is all because of Brainiac, isn't it?

3
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:07,192
Clark, for once, something good
came from something horrible.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,296
I'm choosing to look at this as a gift.

5
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:11,753
You have chosen to defy me.

6
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:15,587
This defiance cannot go
without consequence.

7
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:20,430
Since Jor-El created Brainiac,
I think he can cure your infection.

8
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:22,878
And I think I can re-create
Jor-El and the fortress.

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,844
I just need to get that crystal back.

10
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:29,398
After all these years of keeping
this secret, why are you telling me?

11
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:32,158
- I feel like you were sent to me.
- That's great!

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,963
Clark, you don't get how much of my life
I spend protecting your secret.

13
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,137
Chloe, we're done here.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,887
Chloe's knee-deep in these situations
that humans just don't understand.

15
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,747
As her best friend, make her
stop before she gets hurt.

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,359
Did you help me because of
some personal code of ethics, or...

17
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:54,811
was there more to it than that?

18
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,900
I think it's best
if I don't see you for a while.

19
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,046
- This will do.
- Lois.

20
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,582
You don't know who you are.

21
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,164
You arrived here
as genetic matter...

22
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,801
... containing our planet's
most powerful life-forms,

23
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:15,002
so that in time, you would evolve
to become Earth's ultimate destroyer.

24
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:21,218
Trust me, my son. That which
kills you makes you stronger.

25
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,701
Breakfast in bed
for my beautiful bride-to-be.

26
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:41,548
I even brewed you a special
"wedding-day countdown" cup of coffee.

27
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:45,081
Two kinds of beans blended together
in a tasty marriage of flavor.

28
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,935
- Ohh, thank you, Jimmy.
- No problem.

29
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:52,149
You know, it's one week until we
rendezvous at the altar, and we're,

30
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:54,346
Still getting RSVPS.

31
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:56,454
I bet you anything
these slow responders...

32
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:59,388
have never had to tackle
the challenge of a seating chart.

33
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:04,156
And one of our invited guests
continues to be conspicuously absent.

34
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,432
Who?

35
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:16,616
longtime friend, drama with Clark,

36
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:19,658
Left town in a hurry, apparently
never to be heard from again.

37
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,733
Right Lana.

38
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:24,677
I just didn't
I didn't hear you.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,952
Are you okay?

40
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:31,139
Yeah. Why?

41
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,305
You've been kind of forgetful lately.

42
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,221
If you forget the florist's name
one more time,

43
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,654
I think she's gonna stick us
with potted ferns.

44
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,377
Just distracted.

45
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:44,973
I guess it's a case of the,
pre-wedding jitters.

46
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:51,941
The hard part... it's over.

47
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:56,059
Just think of this wedding
as one big fiesta to us -

48
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:59,241
Kind of like the engagement party -
just with more people.

49
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,075
Okay?

50
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,914
How about we take a little break?

51
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:14,696
I thought the whole point of an engagement
party was to enjoy the "party" part.

52
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:17,893
I just want two minutes alone with you.
I've been hugged by so many people today,

53
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:20,419
I feel like I'm engaged
to everyone but you.

54
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:26,167
You're right the night has gone by faster
than a flash of a camera, hasn't it?

55
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,507
Well, that's why
we can't miss this dance.

56
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,615
I love you, Jimmy.

57
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:56,299
Jimmy, what's going on?
This isn't how it happened.

58
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,431
You okay? You blanked
out for a second.

59
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,797
You have a headache?
Do you want me to call a doctor?

60
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,077
Get out of my apartment.

61
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:39,546
Chloe. It's me. It's Jimmy.
It's your fiancé.

62
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,485
I think I'd remember my own fiancé.

63
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,734
I've never seen you before
in my life.

64
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:55,909
Smallville 809 : "Abyss"

65
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,139
Synchro : Flolo

66
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,065
For Seriessub.com

67
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,265
Code red, C.K.
My whole world just fell apart.

68
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,335
Jimmy, slow down. What's going on?

69
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:53,242
As Chloe's future husband,

70
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:56,595
I thought that I could steer her ship through
any storm, in sickness and in  health, but.

71
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:00,391
I just got hit With
a major bridal wave.

72
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,987
The wedding's a week away.
She's probably just stressed.

73
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,006
Yeah, that's what I thought, but...

74
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,400
she's been forgetting things.

75
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,389
It started out as small stuff

76
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,900
Miss a meeting, a name, a place
that kind of stuff. But today, she...

77
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,343
She didn't even recognize me.

78
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,301
She was actually afraid of me.

79
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:22,926
Did you notice any other symptoms?

80
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,982
Other than a selective amnesia?

81
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,326
Look, she calmed down As soon as
I showed her a picture of us together,

82
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:31,675
but I still don't think
that she remembers me.

83
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:34,286
Clark, Chloe she...

84
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,624
she used to have
this medical condition.

85
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,485
- It gave her this special ability.
- You mean her meteor ability.

86
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,566
Healing people.

87
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,933
I figured she would
have told you, but...

88
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:47,855
do you think that it left her
with brain damage?

89
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,935
I don't know. This could be
any number of things.

90
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:53,340
Look, we need to get
Chloe to a doctor.

91
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:56,125
Could you talk to her?

92
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:59,238
Her memory may have left me
at the altar, but...

93
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,548
she might still remember you.

94
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:16,768
Excuse me. Can you tell me how
to get to the hospital library?

95
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,888
- Are you an intern?
- Med student.

96
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:21,229
- Met U.
- Yeah, certainly don't miss those days.

97
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,905
- What lucky topic did you take up?
- Memory loss,

98
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:26,526
Synaptic shock-
You know, Your basic brain drain.

99
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,056
I was trying to find
some information online,

100
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:31,027
but it looks like most of the
cutting-edge research is here at Met Gen.

101
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:34,103
Yeah. Just down the hall
to the East wing, second floor.

102
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:35,581
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

103
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,744
I was actually thinking about you.

104
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:44,716
Davis. You look exhausted. You pulling
more night-after-night shifts?

105
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,241
These days, it's more like
"Night of the living dead. "

106
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:50,891
Well, careful that the zombies don't
try and eat your brain for breakfast.

107
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:53,361
Save yourself.
It's a little too late for me.

108
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,949
I was supposed to Look into
your past. Davis, I'm...

109
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,088
you know, my crystal ball
is just on the fritz.

110
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,032
Actually, I was thinking about it. I'd rather
you just cancel the whole stance altogether.

111
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:07,279
I decided to let the past
rest in peace.

112
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,403
But there's something else, Chloe,

113
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:13,077
Something I've been thinking
about since the day we met.

114
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,931
You know what, Davis, I would really love
to hear what you have to say, honestly,

115
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,130
but now is just not a good time.

116
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,562
Got it.

117
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,725
Is everything okay with you and Jimmy?

118
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:32,478
Oh, right fiancé. Yeah.

119
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,623
You've been there for
me a lot lately.

120
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:40,995
If you ever need anything,
I'm right here for you.

121
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:47,290
The truth is, my brain's
just a little fried...

122
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:48,951
literally.

123
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:51,644
- I'll talk to you later?
- Of course.

124
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,318
SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT
OF AMNESIC DISORDER.

125
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,792
I'm right here, Clark.

126
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,088
Chloe. Hey, I've been looking
all over for you.

127
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,774
Look, Jimmy says that
you're forgetting things

128
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:32,113
that this morning,
you didn't even recognize him.

129
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,028
Jimmy's overreacting.

130
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,505
- So you do know who he is?
- Of course!

131
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:41,387
Jimmy Olsen, reddish hair,
cute smile, photographer,

132
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:44,073
Likes to wear bowling shirts.

133
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,035
What about "fiancé?

134
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:51,058
Yeah. Right.

135
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,185
We begin our lives together
Saturday at 6:00.

136
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,423
Chloe, it sounds like you're
reading this all off a list.

137
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:00,575
Are you sure everything's okay?

138
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,298
I'm just... distracted, you know?

139
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,282
I mean, the last-minute
wedding plans.

140
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:11,325
Why did you close the bookcase
when I walked in?

141
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:16,227
Research.

142
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,026
Client/therapist privilege.

143
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,588
No, Clark.

144
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,004
Please, just don't.

145
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,001
Okay?

146
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,544
I'm really busy Right now.
I still need to pick the place settings.

147
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:37,558
I mean, who knew there were
90 ways to fold the napkin?

148
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,389
Clark, please.

149
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,323
Okay, I know this
looks a little weird.

150
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,238
What's going on, Chloe?

151
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:54,374
Jimmy's right. I have been...
drawing a few blanks.

152
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,822
A few?

153
00:10:55,823 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, yeah. But I've just been kind of
fusing this as Chloe Sullivan's crib sheet.

154
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:04,271
And whenever I forget someone
Like, you know, my fiancé.

155
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:07,194
I come here to remind myself
of how we're connected.

156
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:08,966
Chloe, listen to what you're saying.

157
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,507
You had to paste
your entire life on these walls.

158
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,468
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

159
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,301
I still remember you.

160
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,075
And that's about all I remember.

161
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,987
I've forgotten almost everyone, Clark.

162
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,452
And I'm having to fake my feelings
more and more with people.

163
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:38,862
Pretty soon, there isn't
gonna be any "I, Chloe. " Just... 

164
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,864
an I.Q.

165
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,010
We both know what's happening to you.

166
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:53,365
I'm being taken over by Brainiac.

167
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,962
Hey, Jimmy.

168
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,307
is that your RSVP?

169
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:34,437
Because there's a little thing called a
stamp that would have saved you a trip.

170
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:38,737
look, I'm sorry. I can't stick around,
and Chloe's not here, so...

171
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,421
Yeah, I ran into her in the city.

172
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:43,243
Your name came up, and
she acted kind of weird.

173
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,191
Is everything okay?

174
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:49,472
Yeah, sure. No, it's just a little temporary
detour on our way down the aisle.

175
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:56,965
You really love her, don't you?

176
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:59,084
Yeah.

177
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,413
Like Sinatra said -

178
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,005
"She's all I long for,
All I worship and adore. "

179
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,974
You know what I mean?

180
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:11,804
Yeah, I do.

181
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,810
Yeah. I do.

182
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm just sorry that
I won't be able to make it.

183
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,312
Well, you know, unlike
some of my extended family,

184
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,675
I'm not gonna enjoy putting your
reply card in the "regrets" pile.

185
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:28,835
Oh, no, I'm sorry that I won't be there, but...
could you do me a favor?

186
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:31,915
Would you mind just telling Chloe for me?

187
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,451
Yeah, yeah. No,
that's no problem.

188
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:42,844
She's an amazing girl.

189
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,654
Take care of her.

190
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:51,901
That's what I'm trying to do.

191
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,976
Brainiac's always got an objective.

192
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:01,331
do you remember anything from this morning
when you lost your last memory of  Jimmy?

193
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:04,500
Every time I try and think about someone
that I've forgotten, it's like this.

194
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,774
swarm of Kryptonian symbols
that I don't understand.

195
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,451
It's like times square
times 100 in my head.

196
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,603
Brainiac is replacing your
memories with Kryptonian data.

197
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,974
Yeah, and this one keeps repeating
itself over and over again.

198
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,813
This is the symbol for doom.

199
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:24,313
Do you think Brainiac
is sending me a message?

200
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,192
Whatever he's doing, Chloe,
we need to stop it.

201
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,381
Jor-El created Brainiac.

202
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,959
When Kara lost her memory,
Jor-El restored it.

203
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,223
If I take the crystal
to the Arctic...

204
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,424
and rebuild the fortress, Jor-El
might be able to help you, too.

205
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:39,993
Or he could strip you of your powers
or drop an ice castle on you.

206
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,921
It doesn't matter, Chloe.

207
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,806
- I have to do this.
- And I have to be honest with you, Clark.

208
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:47,382
This is exactly why I didn't tell you what was happening with me.

209
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,376
Because I knew that you
would just fly off...

210
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,636
without thinking about
any of the consequences.

211
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:55,387
Clark, last time you handled this crystal,
it zapped you to the Phantom Zone.

212
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:57,818
Now, for all we know,
Lex could have sent this to you.

213
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,911
I mean, he could still be trying
to control you from wherever he is.

214
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,430
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't tried to protect me.

215
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,650
Everyone who knows about my secret,
I've watched them either go away or die.

216
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,029
My dad, Pete...
Lana, Lionel, even Lex.

217
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:22,227
Chloe, I'm not gonna let my
secret destroy your life, too.

218
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:26,401
The night that I saw you catch that car
with your bare hands, it changed my life.

219
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,140
for the better.

220
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,761
Clark, thanks to you, I've actually
made an impact on the world.

221
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:34,576
I wouldn't trade that for anything.

222
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:51,173
Clark, get out of the way.

223
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,861
Oh, my god.

224
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,674
Chloe, snap out of it.

225
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,331
You okay?

226
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:22,363
Yeah. My head just feels like a
volleyball at the summer Olympics.

227
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,308
You blacked out again.

228
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,392
Come on. Let's sit down.

229
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,811
Did you lose another memory?

230
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:34,908
No, I think you snapped me out of it
before anything completely disappeared.

231
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:37,581
I guess the more
I think about someone,

232
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:40,946
the more my memory gives them
a complete mental makeover.

233
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,315
Before you trailed off,
you were talking

234
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:50,689
about the first time you saw
me use my abilities.

235
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,680
Abilities?

236
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:58,504
As in your ability to look both ways before you cross the street?

237
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,460
Clark, all I remember is hiding behind
some construction equipment...

238
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,675
and watching you stand
in the middle of the road.

239
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,744
You don't remember
an out-of-control car?

240
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,869
Were you hit by a car that night?

241
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,253
Oh, god. I'm starting to lose
things about you, too, now.

242
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:22,413
Do you remember the name Kal-El?

243
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,620
Should I?

244
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,672
- What about Krypton or Brainiac?
- Brainiac!

245
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:35,486
People used to call me that
when I was a kid.

246
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:38,174
Right?

247
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:45,695
What? I'm forgetting something
important now. What don't I remember?

248
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,365
Look, Clark...

249
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,142
this isn't gonna stop.

250
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,382
I'm losing everything.

251
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,934
Chloe, It's gonna be okay.

252
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,311
But I need you to trust me.

253
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,034
I know someone who can help us,
but you need to stay here and relax,

254
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:04,037
- ...and I'll go talk to them.
- No, Clark.

255
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:05,869
Don't go. Please, don't leave me.

256
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,901
What if I forget all about you
while you're gone?

257
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:14,355
Here.

258
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:23,074
Maybe this will help.

259
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:31,127
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, Chloe.

260
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,706
It's me. It's... Jimmy.

261
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:38,698
I brought some more pictures of us,
in case you still couldn't...

262
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,529
- ...place my face.
- Hey, Jimmy. I remember who you are.

263
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,060
You recognize me?

264
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,394
Sorry about the attack
of the bridezilla this morning.

265
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,523
I thought that I'd really lost you.

266
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,281
You're not feeling the love, are you?

267
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:28,156
The truth is, I'm not really feeling
much of anything for anyone these days.

268
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:31,220
It's like a bunch
of random facebook profiles.

269
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,213
I mean, Clark is one of the few friends
that I actually have memories of still.

270
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,968
I figured you would have
forgot something about him...

271
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,890
before you lost all your memories
about the guy you're about to marry.

272
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,454
But the most important thing is
that you don't have total amnesia.

273
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,339
Yet.

274
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,645
Chloe, you need to see a doctor.

275
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,010
I made an appointment for you
this afternoon with one of...

276
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:58,346
the best neurologists
in Metropolis.

277
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:01,308
Clark told me to wait here for him
while he went to get help.

278
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,579
No.

279
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,910
No, I don't know why he left you here

280
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,407
alone, but we're gonna get
you some real help.

281
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:11,591
He said to trust him.

282
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,906
Pictures.

283
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:19,649
They can't remind you of emotions,
but they don't lie, either.

284
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:22,005
Look at these.

285
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,425
There was a time when you
trusted me enough to marry me.

286
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,072
Please, Chloe.

287
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,202
Trust me now.

288
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:01,045
Welcome home, my son.

289
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:03,798
Home?

290
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:08,033
I wanted to see it that way, Jor-El.

291
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:13,639
I wanted to learn more about
my family, about my destiny.

292
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:16,493
And then you tore it all away.

293
00:22:16,494 --> 00:22:20,722
I programmed the fortress to remove
your powers and self-destruct...

294
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:23,368
If you became a danger to the planet.

295
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:27,919
When you sent me here, you had no way
of knowing how I would use my abilities.

296
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,725
You trusted me.

297
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:32,387
When I betrayed that trust,

298
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:36,342
you were willing to sacrifice
your only son to save this planet.

299
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:40,533
But now I know what it
truly means to protect people,

300
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:43,096
Not just my family and friends.

301
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:47,929
You've made great progress, my son.

302
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:51,855
One thing needs to change.

303
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:56,296
You call me your son,
but you treat me Like your enemy.

304
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,021
I think it's time you stop punishing
me and start trusting me again.

305
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:02,944
You've grown up, Kal-El.

306
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,628
Your trials have matured you.

307
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,182
My trials are not over, Jor-El.

308
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:10,712
Brainiac was not destroyed.

309
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:16,080
He managed to infect one of my friends,
and now he's taking her over.

310
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:18,698
I need your help.

311
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,842
I can translate the Kryptonian code

312
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:25,909
corrupting your friend's mind
back into human memories,

313
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:31,139
however, the being you call "Brainiac" is highly unpredictable.

314
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,401
It poses a tremendous
threat to all of us.

315
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,752
There is no way of knowing
what the outcome will be.

316
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:41,593
Are you willing to take that risk?

317
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,873
Got any advice for an MRI rookie?

318
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,535
It won't take long.

319
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,961
Your best bet just close your eyes and
think of a place that makes you happy.

320
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:09,266
All right.

321
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,480
Sweet setup, Clark.

322
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,249
Spend your nights spying on
any unsuspecting neighbors?

323
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:40,773
No, I like... looking at the stars.

324
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:45,991
I guess you truly are
a gentleman farmer.

325
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,444
Emerson and Thoreau
have nothing on you.

326
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:53,757
I spend way too much
of my time reading.

327
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:58,070
Actually... I love reading.

328
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:01,748
I don't have that much time
to make a lot of friends.

329
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:04,419
My dad keeps me pretty
busy with chores.

330
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,694
My mom left me when
I was really young.

331
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,447
After that...

332
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:13,823
I was afraid to make friends because...

333
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:17,652
I just thought
they'd all end up leaving, too.

334
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,898
So I buried my nose in books.

335
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:25,942
Although, I think I lost one
of my favorites when we moved.

336
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:28,637
"Tales of the weird and unexplained."

337
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:32,119
Something tells me I won't find much

338
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,466
of the weird or unexplained here,
in Norman Rockwell's neighborhood.

339
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,264
Smallville's more than just dairy cows.

340
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,696
We have a pretty good public library.

341
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,421
"TALES OF THE WEIRD AND UNEXPLAINED"

342
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,038
What was that for?

343
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,474
I know you've been
thinking about it all day.

344
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:06,361
So I figured we'd just get it
out of the way and be friends.

345
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:23,653
Oh, no. It's happening again.

346
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:44,409
I have to get you out of here
and into another memory!

347
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,649
- Dark Thursday.
- Chloe!

348
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:56,718
What's happening?
All the streetlights are out.

349
00:26:58,177 --> 00:27:00,957
Oh, my god.
No memory's safe.

350
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,281
Come with me!

351
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,402
I can't lose you, Clark.

352
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,063
Chloe, I'll never leave you.

353
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,594
Ms. Sullivan, are you okay?

354
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,560
What happened?

355
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,802
I don't know. Her brain waves
spiked as soon as she went in,

356
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:38,826
- ... and then the machine went haywire.
- What's going on? Where am I?

357
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:41,534
You're in the hospital.
You don't remember?

358
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,793
I don't remember anything but Davis.

359
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:46,996
I have to find Davis.

360
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:01,698
Oh, my god. Thank god I found you.

361
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,213
You might want to loosen that up.
I don't tie tourniquets this tight.

362
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,219
I'm in trouble, Davis. I need your help.

363
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,874
- Are you okay?
- No.

364
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,505
I'm nowhere near okay.
I'm completely lost.

365
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,724
I don't even know my own zip
code or who my parents are.

366
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:17,155
I can't remember anything
but my own name and you.

367
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:20,254
Okay. Just relax and breathe.

368
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,082
- Were you in an accident?
- I don't know.

369
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,343
I don't think so. No.
No, 10 fingers, 10 toes,

370
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,244
and I'm not in any pain. I just -
my memory's M.I.A.

371
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,971
- Yeah, but how would you know who I am?
- I don't know. I just do.

372
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:36,727
But you're the only one. It's like
you've become my entire world.

373
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:40,185
Listen, Chloe, we should call
your friends.

374
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:42,720
No, no, no! I can't remember
any of my friends!

375
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,164
Davis, I don't trust anyone but you!

376
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:48,303
I'm so scared.
What's happening to me?

377
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:51,944
Don't worry, Chloe.
You're safe now.

378
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:56,853
Thank you.

379
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:02,201
It's like I said this morning,
I will always, always be there for you.

380
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:10,179
Lawyer? No, you're not gonna
be hearing from any lawyer.

381
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,192
- You're gonna hear from an entire law firm.
- Jimmy, where's Chloe?

382
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:16,204
I took her to met general to get an MRI,
but the hospital lost her.

383
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,040
She ran away as soon as they
pulled her out of the machine.

384
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:19,847
Why did you take her out of the barn?

385
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:21,383
More importantly, why
did you leave her alone...

386
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,625
when her memory was shedding
pounds by the minute, Clark?

387
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:25,824
I went to go talk
to someone who could help.

388
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,086
Chloe was in no condition
to make the trip.

389
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:37,375
I should never have let
her out of my sight.

390
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:41,315
You did everything
you could to help her.

391
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:44,709
Don't beat yourself up over
something you can't control.

392
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:47,875
She could be wandering the
streets right now with no idea...

393
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:50,407
who she is or where she's from.

394
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:53,872
What if we don't find her?

395
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,803
We will find her, if we work together.

396
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,422
Look, I need you to call Metropolis
P. D. and ask for John Jones.

397
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:00,950
He'll get the word out.

398
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:04,643
In the meantime, I'm gonna go to Metropolis
and start searching the streets.

399
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:08,759
Right.

400
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:16,957
Thanks.

401
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:25,308
I think that they're closed.

402
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:30,751
You don't recognize me, do you?

403
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,300
Listen, it's okay. You live here,
upstairs. It's your apartment.

404
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:37,985
Why did you bring me here?
You promised me I could stay with you.

405
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:39,800
Chloe, it's okay. Clark is
one of your best friends.

406
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:43,864
- But I only remember you.
- It's okay. You're safe. Trust me.

407
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:46,315
Clark, I thought that I heard.

408
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:53,595
- I am so glad to see you.
- I don't know who you are.

409
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:56,882
- This is Jimmy. He's your fiancé.
- Just stay away from me.

410
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:03,717
- What did you just do to her?
- She has full-blown amnesia.

411
00:32:03,718 --> 00:32:06,464
I thought she was gonna run again.
I brought a sedative just in case.

412
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,394
- Any idea why she remembers you?
- No, but is lucky for us, she did.

413
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,577
When she found me, she was scared out
of her mind. I thought if she saw you,

414
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,667
it would jump-start her memory.

415
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,065
Thank you for bringing her home.

416
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:22,541
It's no problem.
This is where she belongs.

417
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:25,129
Looks like she's in good hands.

418
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,232
Call me if you need me.

419
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,351
- We need to get her to Smallville Med.
- You're right.

420
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:33,280
I'll take her to the car if you want to grab
some of her stuff. I'll meet you out back.

421
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,311
Yeah.

422
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:58,301
Time is of the essence, Kal-El.

423
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:02,758
Chloe never would have gotten hurt
if she wasn't trying to protect me.

424
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:08,165
I tried to warn you of the danger
in sharing your true identity.

425
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:12,201
Now that I'm taking more risks...

426
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,768
... it's even more dangerous for her.

427
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:22,781
Chloe deserves a life free
from the burden of my secret.

428
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:28,209
When you restore her memory, I don't want
her to remember anything about Krypton...

429
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,828
or my abilities.

430
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:34,747
I know this choice
is not easy for you, my son,

431
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,190
But it will be done.

432
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:48,787
You've been the best friend and
ally I could have had, Chloe.

433
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:54,265
The truth is, you've saved me more
than I ever could have saved you.

434
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:11,234
I'm sorry to go back
to hiding the truth from you.

435
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:20,315
But the best way that I know
to protect you is to let you go.

436
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,937
Jimmy, I'm impressed.

437
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:01,050
You managed to balance out
singles, couples, and families...

438
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:03,282
while keeping all of the exes
at different tables...

439
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:06,418
and still keeping the kids'
table away from the cake.

440
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,465
You truly are the Zen master
of seating charts.

441
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:11,982
More the master of musical chairs.

442
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:14,374
But now that this is over,
I don't want to see, sit, or stand...

443
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,297
on another chair for a good long while.

444
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,865
Well, then let's just live on the couch.

445
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:24,447
What?

446
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,353
You're amazing.

447
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:29,452
You had about the fastest
spontaneous recovery in history.

448
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:32,602
Yeah, I don't know exactly what I did.

449
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:37,570
I mean, one minute, I'm standing in
the Talon, not recognizing you or Clark,

450
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:40,127
and then suddenly, I feel
a sharp sting of a needle,

451
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:42,030
and the next thing I know,
I wake up in the hospital,

452
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:44,455
happy to see you both right by my side.

453
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,830
I wonder if Davis' knockout punch
had anything to do with it.

454
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,825
It definitely was a miracle,
plain and simple.

455
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:56,761
Clark Kent the best-looking
best man in town.

456
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:00,951
Second only to
my gorgeous groom, of course.

457
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,008
I'm just glad the bride is safe.

458
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:05,158
Everything's back
to the way it used to be.

459
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:12,667
I got to get to Metropolis to drop off
our check to the florist before they close.

460
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,474
I'll make a run
to the city for you.

461
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:19,540
Are you kidding me? That's like a two-hour
trip, and you drive like an old lady.

462
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:23,763
Are you sure you're feeling up to it?
Because I really don't mind coming along.

463
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,574
I'm perfectly fine stopping and
smelling the roses on my own.

464
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:33,719
Besides, there's a whole bunch of folding
tables he needs to set up at the farm,

465
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,471
And seriously doubt that Clark can
carry all of them by himself.

466
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:03,251
Hey, you! You sneaking up on me?

467
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:05,673
Don't have any hypodermic
needles up your sleeves, do you?

468
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,739
Oh, no, no. Not a needle in sight.
I'm sorry that I had to do that to you.

469
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:11,468
Are you kidding me?
If you hadn't hit me with your best shot,

470
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:13,723
I never would have gone
with Clark and Jimmy.

471
00:37:13,837 --> 00:37:17,847
by the way, I heard you're not
gonna be able to make it to my wedding.

472
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:19,846
I'm really gonna miss you being there.

473
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,667
Chloe, I lied.

474
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:24,519
They don't need me
at the hospital that day.

475
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:28,645
Please tell me that this isn't because
of all the drama I put you through.

476
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,938
- You know that I wasn't In my right mind.
- No, no.

477
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,821
It's not you. You're... beautiful.

478
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:40,218
There's a lot in my life that
I don't understand right now,

479
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:43,564
but the one thing that I'm sure of...

480
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:46,715
is how I feel about you.

481
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:52,857
I can't go to your wedding, Chloe, because
I can't watch you marry the wrong man.

482
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:56,869
Okay, Davis, you need to slow down
and put your ambulance in reverse.

483
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,004
I'll admit that when we first
met, there was an attraction.

484
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:03,736
I mean, you're kind
and you save people's lives...

485
00:38:03,737 --> 00:38:06,130
and you look great in a uniform,

486
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:08,711
so of course I'm gonna like you.

487
00:38:09,346 --> 00:38:12,405
- But I love Jimmy.
- Do you? Do you really?

488
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:15,908
I tried to be the bigger man.
That's why I brought you back to him,

489
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:18,840
even though all I wanted to do
was take care of you myself.

490
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:22,087
But then I thought about it.

491
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:25,497
When you forgot about
everyone else in your life,

492
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:27,422
who did you come to for help?

493
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:31,008
Not Jimmy. Not even
your best friend, Clark.

494
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,943
It was me.

495
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:36,881
You came to me.

496
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:38,402
Davis, I...

497
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,728
There is some sort of connection
between us, Chloe,

498
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:43,837
and I know that you feel it, too.

499
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:57,434
Okay, stop. Davis,
this connection, it was...

500
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:59,605
it was never this.

501
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:04,108
I understand.

502
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:08,775
But I am not ready to let you go.

503
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,708
I will wait for as long as it takes.

504
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:24,232
You know where to find me.

505
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,714
Jor-El.

506
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:45,751
I've come here to thank you
for what you've done.

507
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:51,016
Chloe's a lot safer now that she
doesn't remember the truth about me.

508
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:55,709
I guess I'm just starting to realize
how much I actually lost.

509
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:58,347
You made a difficult choice.

510
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:00,801
I am proud of you, Kal-El.

511
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,158
But something else is troubling you.

512
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:10,265
I know that we defeated Brainiac,
but we may have another problem.

513
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,502
When Chloe was losing
her memory, she kept seeing...

514
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:15,449
the Kryptonian symbol
for doom in her mind.

515
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:20,238
The symbol for doom represents
the ultimate destroyer.

516
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:25,642
Is a Kryptonian creature bred
for a single purpose- to kill.

517
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,406
It adapts and evolves to any attack.

518
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,467
It is virtually unstoppable.

519
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:36,962
and it appears it's made his way to Earth.

520
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:41,478
So Brainiac was trying to contact
this thing, using Chloe as a vessel.

521
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:47,015
If that is true, then it is likely
the creature will find her soon.

522
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,933
I don't care how powerful it is.

523
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:53,280
I'll take it on,
like I have everything else.

524
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:57,074
I am here for you, as well, my son.

525
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:01,817
Thank you.

526
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,080
father.

527
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:13,812
My son?

528
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,900
My son.

529
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,595
Your son is destined to fail.

530
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:23,684
Soon, a new age
will dawn on Earth.

531
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:26,501
An age of power and strength...

532
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:30,362
and the fall of the house of El.

533
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:35,193
Doomsday is coming.

534
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:40,320
