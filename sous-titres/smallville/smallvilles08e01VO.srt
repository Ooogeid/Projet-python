00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,420
It would be tragic if the dds decided chloe
was a threat to national security after all.

What the hell are you?

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,500
Kal-el, you must save yourself, or your
destiny will fall into the hands of another man.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,420
Sir, the last few teams
have all disappeared.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,830
We leave now.

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,560
You hold the future of the
entire planet in your hands.

- Lex, don't!

You actually believe you're qualified?

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,800
Lex believes it...

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,590
and that's all that matters.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,370
I want a complete inventory
of everything you've found --

39
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,760

tracks, any sign of an escape.

40
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,800

You're not getting lazy, are you?

61
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,340
I didn't realize lex's secretarial staff could
spot a speck of dust from across the room.

62

I'm as much a secretary
as you are a french maid.

I have been so looking forward to

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,340
Lex's 4:00 P.M. Booty call?

67
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,590
I realize mr. Luthor gave you
quite a bit of journalistic rope,

68
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,740
knowing you'd eventually hang yourself.

69
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,560
Me, on the other hand --
I'm a little less patient.

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm not here as a reporter.

71
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,650
I'm here to find my
cousin, chloe sullivan.

72
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,600
I doubt she's hiding
under the furniture.

73
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,780
Lex had her arrested by the
department of domestic security,

74
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,870
but the dds claims to
have no record of her.

75
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,200
I want access to lex's phone records
from the day he made the call.

76
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,900
I want that agent's name.

77
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,730
Mr. Luthor is a firm believer
in truth and justice, miss lane.

78
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,230
You can rest assured, if he had
your cousin arrested, she was guilty.

79
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,010
The only thing chloe's been guilty of
is standing up for what she belves in.

Okay, so, I'm smarter than the average,

to treat me like their own private guinea pig.

- You're special, chloe.
- No, I'm not!

97
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,500
All I am is a halfway decent hacker who took
a wrong turn down the information superhighway.

A hacker whose cognitive thinking
just beat our fastest supercomputer.

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,160
It's hard to believe that such a dramatic increase
in intelligence could occur practically overnight.

about no more games or puzzles

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,080
The day you hacked into the nasa mainframe

109
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,470
that was the day that
you gave up those rights.

Clark's not like us.

55-0...

171
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,170
there's three more.

172
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,120
These aren't the phone
numbers of bad guys.

173
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,280
You're not the dds.

174
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,310
What's the last telephone number, chloe?

175
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,080
No!

176
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,110
Find the third at all costs.

177
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,080
How are you feeling?

178
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,680
- Never better.
- Ready to get back to work?

179
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,890
You are really determined, aren't you?

180
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,090
I just want to go home.

181
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,470
Okay. Just tell us
where to ship your body.

182
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,520
I hear............

183
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,970
Who.....

184
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,320
*******

185
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,190
Ivan.......

186
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,160
He.............

187
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,110
Only........

188
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,030
What are you looking at?

189
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,450
You got a problem with me?

190
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,760
Is my presence here bothering you?

191
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,690
Yeah, it's starting to.

192
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,630
It's starting to?

193
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,510
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just roll with it.

194
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,080
Get up! What's the matter,
huh? Your batteries run out?

195
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,720
I got a little more juice left.

196
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,950
I'll take 100 cases of beluga, 50 cases of
osetra, and this pathetic little punk here.

197
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,500
I want the honor of finishing him off.

198
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,010
Be my guest.

199
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,200
- I'll throw him in for free.
- Very nice. Come on!

200
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,450
What took you so long?

201
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,420
How does an ice fortress
disappear into thin air?

202
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,840
I feel like there's a .

203
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,980
It's good for you.

204
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,050
It all must be part of my father's plan.

205
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,200
And as it turns out, his idea of
controlling me was taking away my powers.

206
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,240
It's better than lex walking around
with a remote control to a clark-bot.

207
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,230
Lex was there.

208
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,750
He knows everything. He knows my secret.

209
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,240
Well, clark, lex may be tenacious,
but there's no way he survived that.

210
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,680
I did... without my abilities.

211
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,620
After the avalanche,
did you see anything?

212
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,560
There was so much wind and snow, I
could barely see two feet in front of me.

213
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,210
I started hiking.

214
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,950
I went as long as I could, and then...

215
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,090
the next thing I know, I woke up on a fishing
boat in the middle of the arctic ocean.

216
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,140
Clark, you could have died up there.

217
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,430
Oliver, I really screwed up.

218
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,230
I took my eyes off lex
until it was too late.

219
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,430
I lost my friends, my powers.

220
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,050
Chloe's in dds custody because of me.

221
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,660
I've had an army of
lawyers on it, and, uh...

222
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,360
chloe sullivan was never arrested by
the department of domestic security.

223
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,030
It was lex.

224
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,490
Jimmy betrayed him,
so he went after chloe.

225
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,600
Well, if lex wanted to hide her, he's
got a research compound in montana.

226
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,010
It's called black creek. It's the
only facility we haven't hit yet.

227
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,950
Unfortunately, no one who's
ever gone in has ever come out.

228
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,020
We need to get her back.

229
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,290
The problem with that is both dinah and
A.C. Went off the radar, looking for you.

230
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,500
And you're kind of... useless.

231
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,160
With or without my powers, I'm not gonna
let my friend rot in a luthorcorp prison.

232
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,140
Neither am I.

233
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,710
Sir?

234
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,620
Change course. We're going to montana.

235
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,090
Yes,Sir.

1
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,500
It's a shame that lex
couldn't be here to see this.

2
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,400
The elusive band of terrorists
finally in captivity.

3
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,000
Lex was never able to find us.

4
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,900
How did his bozo zookeeper get so lucky?

5
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,800
Luck has nothing to do with it, miss lance.

6
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,100
I have a new secret weapon.

7
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,700
You weren't up there scouring the arctic for lex.

8
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,800
You were searching for someone else.

9
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,900
The traveler.

10
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Who's that, some frequent flyer?

11
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,600
He's an alien. He knows what happened to lex.
Who is he?

12
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,100
Look, the only reason we headed up to
that winter wonderland was to find lex.

13
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,600
You're lying through your gills, mr. Curry.

14
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,100
If you won't tell me what I want to know,
I'm guessing your hooded ringleader will.

15
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,100
The way I jammed the security system,
we've got 15 minutes max. Stay behind me.

16
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,500
No. We'll cover more ground if we split up.

17
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,300
And what are you gonna do if you get caught,
bite someone?

18
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,900
I'm not gonna argue with you.
Chloe's in danger.

19
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Fine, clark. You be the hero.

20
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
Just know I might not be there to save you.

21
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,200
I can't believe this.

22
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,100
One alarm-clock malfunction, and suddenly you're
demoted and shipped to deliverance territory.

23
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What the hell are you doing here?

24
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,600
- I...
- you know him?

25
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,000
- Y-
- no.

26
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,000
He wishes he didn't know me.
I thought I dropped you at your cell.

27
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
- We'll take him back.
- And send me to the sahara?

28
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,900
- One demotion this week is enough.
- I'll handle it.

29
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,500
What are you doing here?

30
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,500
I heard they had good espresso.

31
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,000
You disappear for a month
and come back with a sense of humor?

32
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,000
I've been tracking chloe down.
The question is how did you get here?

33
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,300
Feminine charm.
Yes, I do have some.

34
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,400
Great job protecting your short supply of it.

35
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,300
Why don't you give your stand-up a rest
and do exactly what I tell you?

36
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
That way, we can find chloe
and stay alive at the same time.

37
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,800
Sweet dreams?

38
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,400
More like my worst nightma

39
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,100
I've been hunting down innocent people for
luthorcorp. That's who you work for, isn't it?

40
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,700
Reading up on you in lex's files.

41
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,100
I knew you had a healing power, but your turbo I.Q.
Well, that was a pleasant surprise.

42
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,300
I'm not gonna help you.

43
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,800
So, I guess you're gonna have to kill me.

44
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,400
You know, you come from a talented family.

45
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,700
Your mom had a real gift for
making people do anything against their will.

46
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Lex had the foresight to draw as much spinal fluid
as we could from moira sullivan.

47
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,700
Add in a few million in research,

48
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,400
and we have ourselves a way of
making people do what we need them to do.

49
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,500
Now, I won't say it's perfect.
It doesn't last long, but...

50
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,400
it'll get the job done.

51
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Stay away from me.

52
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,100
Find the final three digits.

53
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,500
Target position acquired.

54
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,400
How thoughtful of him to come to us.

55
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,100
Well done, guys. Everybody okay?

56
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,200
freeze ***

57
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,800
Do whatever it takes to find
out what happened to lex luthor.

58
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,900
Would you mind not
pointing that thing at me?

59
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,400
God, clark. I'm not aiming at you.

60
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,000
What? I'm not.
Besides, it's only your kneecap.

61
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Well, that makes me feel a lot better.

62
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Look, I know that you're nervous, smallville,

63
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,900
but you got to remember I grew up around green
berets and navy seals, not cornstalks and jersey cows.

64
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,300
You stick with me, I'll protect you.
You'll be fine.

65
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
Chloe.

66
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,500
Out of the way, smallville.

67
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,700
- Chloe!
- Lois! Lois, look behind you! Watch out!

68
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,900
Clark, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

69
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,900
I'm sorry. I got held up in a russian work camp.

70
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm so glad you're okay.

71
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,500
- What happened to you? You're...
- human.

72
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,400
Turns out, when jor-el saidthere
was a way to control me...

73
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
he meant taking away your powers.
How are we gonna get out of here?

74
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,500
Don't worry. Oliver's with me.

75
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,900
Security's closing in on him.
They already have dinah and A.C.

76
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,100
- Watch lois.
- Clark, you have no way of defending yourself.

77
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll be fine.

78
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,800
Oliver, there you are.

79
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,400
I knew these guys couldn't touch you.

80
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,700
- Where's lex?
- Lex?

81
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,900
I told you. I have no idea.

82
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,300
That was a warning, clark.
The next one goes straight through your heart.

83
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,700
Answer me! Where is he?

84
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,100
I don't know.

85
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,900
Start talking, or the biography of clark kent
comes to a sudden, tragic end!

86
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Oliver... you're not yourself.

87
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll do whatever it takes to find lex.

88
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,600
I don't know!

89
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Oh, god.Oh, god.

90
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Clark, come on! I'm so sorry.

Oh, no! I can save him.

95
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,300
- I couldn't stop myself.
- Oliver, move back. I can save him.

96
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,900
No... chloe.

97

- It's gonna be okay.
- No.***

98
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,700
It's not working.

99
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,100

How does it feel to be whole again?

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,500
I was dying.

104
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
You saved me.

105
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,700
You brought me to some white light.

106
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The healing effect of the sun
brought you back from death.

107
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,000
I promised jor-el that I would
only be a watchful guardian,

108
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,400
but I could not stand by and let you die.

109
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,200
You shouldn't have had to.

110
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,700
Jor-el knew he was sending
you on an impossible odyssey -

111
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,400
to be given the power of a god...

112
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,700
yet exist among humans.

113
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Sometimes I feel like I need
to be two separate people.

114
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,000
Either way, I can't keep expecting you to save me.

115
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, that was the last time.

116
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,400
The burning sun may strengthen you,
but it has the opposite effect on me.

117
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,000
It stripped me of my powers.

118
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,100
And we both know...
that yours is a greater destiny.

119
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,100
But with the fortress destroyed,
you'll have to do it without jor-el's guidance.

120
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Or anyone else'S.

121
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,600
When I was dying, I saw my dad.
He was right there in front of me.

122
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,300
I saw my mom and lana.
They were there, too.

123
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500
So close, it was like I
could reach out and feel them.

124
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,600
I've written eulogies.

125
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,800
I've seen people walk away from me...

126
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,000
but I've never really said goodbye.

127
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,000
I've been holding onto a life on this farm
that hasn't existed for years.

128
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,100
So, what are you gonna do?

129
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,900
Let it go.

130
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,300
It's the only chance I have of finding a new one.

131
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,900
LUTH*******MISSING

132
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
Ms. Mercer... it suits you.

133
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,700
This desk belongs to lex, and finding him is
the only thing that matters right now. Am I clear?

134
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,800
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,400
This was retrieved from the excavation site
in the montana facility...

136
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,200
completely dismantled.
And the guests have been reassimilated.

137
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Any word on lex?

138
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,400
It's a footprint... found in the arctic.

139
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,900
But it's not mr. Luthor'S.

140
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,200
That'll be all.

141
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
What's happening to me?

142
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,200
Jimmy!

143
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,400
I've looked everywhere for you. I'm so sorry.

144
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,100
I should never have let lex get between us.

145
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,600
No. It's in the past.Now, there's a little, um...
leftover business about a ring.

146
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Please don'T.

147
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,900
All I want tonight is just to be with you.

148
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,200
That's kind of a big diamond elephant in the room.
Don't you think?

149
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,700
Okay.

150
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I jumped the gun in proposing to you,
and I've had a lot of time to think about it.

151
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,000
And, obviously, we're not in the same place.

152
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
Let's just pretend it didn't happen.

153
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,000
So, you're rescinding the offer?

154
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,000
No, I just...I don't want an answer.

155
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,900
I don't want things to change between us.

156
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,900
Yes.

157
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,700
Great.

158
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Things will go back to the way they were.

159
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,800
No, jimmy...

160
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,500
yes.

161
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,400
All that time alone in a cell, I realized that...

162
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:54,000
what I wanted in the past kept me from seeing
what I have right now. And that's you.

163
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
You're perfect.

164
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,200
I am so far from perfect.

165
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Which is perfect for me.

166
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,800
Clark, glad to be back from a little "r" and "r"?

167
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,500
Guess you had to pull your own weight for a while.

168
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,200
Seriously, though, I owe you all my life.
I don't know how to thank you.

169
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Well, you would have done the
same thing for any one of us.

170
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,600
And we can't take all the credit.

171
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,500
I heard those are some pretty sweet aerodynamics
your friend powered up back there.

172
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,500
Yeah, where you been hiding that guy?

173
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,200
It's a long story,
but I'm sure he'll be back one day.

174
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Well, unfortunately,
we've still got a minor problem out there.

175
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,800
Yeah, you're not the only one thawing out
from a little freezer burn there, boy scout.

176
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,500
- Lex.
- Yeah.

177
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,100
We sorted through all the arctic tests,
and there's no sign of any human remains.

178
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,400
We need to find him. He knows my secret.

179
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,000
It's not gonna be as easy as you think.

180
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,200
The new C.E.O. Of luthorcorp's even
more deceptive than lex ever was.

181
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,300
And now that our masks have been ripped off,
we're seriously hampered.

182
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,600
We might as well be wearing name tags.

183
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,500
- We need to split up.
- We? I'd be careful, clark.

184
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,200
Pretty soon, you'll be sporting a homemade costume
and leading a double identity just like the rest of us.

185
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,200
You might want to try something
a little more formfitting.

186
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,900
We split up and cut off contact with each other.

187
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,100
We lay low, find out what we can about lex.

188
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,900
Clark.

189
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this bothering you?

190
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,200
The chair or you in it?

191
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,900
Lois, I, um...

192
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,600
I wanted to say I thought you did well out there.

193
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,600
You really earned your stripes
at your dad's boot camp.

194
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,900
Thanks. And as for you...

195
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,900
you actually surprised me -
I mean, for your first attempt at heroism.

196
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
I better get going.

197
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,800
I'll see you bright and early monday morning.

198
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,400
Whoa, whoa. Why monday?

199
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
What do you mean "bright and early"?

200
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,800
Lois, you're the one who gave me the application.

201
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
You're looking at the newest
recruit to the daily planet.

202
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,400
That's great. What made you change your mind?

203
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,200
I guess I wanted to be in
the middle of the action.

204
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
Good for you.

205
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
So, are you gonna be starting
down in the mail room?

206
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,500
No.

207
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm gonna be a little closer to home.

208
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,700
Looks like we're gonna be neighbors, lane.

209
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,100
You've got to be kidding me.
