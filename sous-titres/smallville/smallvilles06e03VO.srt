1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,040
What are we doing here?

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,050
Well,I don't know exactly.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,960
I got this hot tip that there's
something weird going on up here.

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,830
I thought it might be a good story.

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,590
You mean two people at make-out
point not making out?

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,190
you're right.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,340
You know what?We're undercover.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,400
We should probably be a little more convincing.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,880
Are you putting the move on me?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,610
No,no.Come on.

11
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,840
Do you want me to?

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,440
Okay,look,I know we planted our flag
on the summit of intimate territory

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,380
back when we were interns,but...

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,650
I thought it was.I mean,wasn't it?

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,510
-No,it definitely was.-Okay,me,too.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,750
R-really.I mean,really.Definitely.

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,790
And it's not like I wouldn't mind
exploring that territory again...

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
one day.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,170
But I just thought maybe this time
we could take it a little slower?

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,850
Well,I'm slow.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,370
Slow is great.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,780
You'll barely see me move.

23
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,450
Let's go for a swim.

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,530
I didn't bring my bathing suit.

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,020
Neither did I.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,210
What was that?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,220
That came from the woods.Come on.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Oh,we should definitely go check
that out in the really dark woods.

29
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,420
Let's go.

30
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm sure they came in here.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
They were probably headed for the lake.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,150
This is a really bad idea.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,990
You know,maybe we should call someone.

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,590
Hello!

35
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,050
Is anyone there?!

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,590
No,I was thinking more like authority figures
who carry weapons,you know?

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,550
Thanks.

38
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,350
Looks like the naked trail ends here.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,530
Is that...

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,320
oh,my god.

44
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,450
Is that the invitation for the ball?

45
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,460
I just rsvp'D.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,260
I hope lex gets a good turnout.

47
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,980
I can't imagine anyone from metropolis's "who's who" list

48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,210
not showing up to help the families affected by dark thursday.

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,460
You know,I,uh -- I responded for two.

50
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,820
Thanks,mom,but costumes really aren't my thing.

51
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,870
Besides,it's not really the place for a reunion,you know?

52
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,540
How do you feel about the two of them together?

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,510
I don't know.

54
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,890
It's like they're different people.

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
We all have our own ways of moving on,

56
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,720
whether it's about growing up or just surviving.

57
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Mom,I've lost lana,dad,jor-el.

58
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,820
You don't see me as a different person.

59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,320
Well,in a lot of ways I do,clark.

60
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,100
All those things have shaped the person you are now...

61
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,760
and the person you'll become.

62
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,470
I already know what the device isn't,dr.Grohl.

63
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,340
Your job is to tell me what it is.

64
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,580
I want a report.

65
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,830
Lana: What's all this?

66
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,880
My god,your complexion is even more radiant than in the magazines.

67
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,520
This is monica.

68
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,830
She's helping us pick out the costumes for the charity ball.

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,250
She can help you put something together.

70
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,570
Um,well,thank you for coming

71
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,420
but I think I can dress myself.

72
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,770
Oh,come on,lana.

73
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,580
I thought you'd have fun becoming anyone you wanted.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,700
Well,I can tell you what I'm not...

75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,100
the next "lex girl.

76
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,620
" Monica,will you excuse us?

77
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,320
You saw this morning's paper.

78
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,490
Look,lana,I was raised in front of the cameras.

79
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,100
I know it can be hurtful.

80
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,810
When I was 13,a reporter caught me between classes at boarding school.

81
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,040
He asked me how I felt about my mother's death.

82
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,680
A mike shoved in my face in front of classmates I couldn't stand --

83
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,270
that's how I found out she died.

84
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,760
The press will tear us apart if we let them.

85
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,990
Well,they're right about the revolving door of women you've had.

86
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,580
Maybe.

87
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,170
But I've never asked any of them to move in with me.

88
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,380
Lex,I know you.

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,750
You desire what you can't have.

90
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,130
So,what happens when you get it?

91
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,700
I'd be lying if I said I didn't struggle against my nature every day

92
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,590
to let myself have this with you.

93
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,360
And I'm fighting mine to believe you.

94
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,830
Lana,I've given you time.

95
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
I've given you space.

96
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,110
But you still don't know what you want.

97
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,920
And you do?

98
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,570
I want us to stop pretending we're only roommates.

99
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,870
Lex,I just need to be sure.

100
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,080
I always trust people too much.

101
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,000
No,you trusted clark too much.

102
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,170
You can always come up with excuses why this won't work,but you have to decide.

103
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,920
You can either fight with clark's ghost or you can be with me.

104
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,340
I'm done paying for his mistakes.

105
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,260
-Hey.
-Hey,how goes life living with lois?

106
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,590
Closer to coffee,further from sanity,

107
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,210
but until metropolis university reopens,

108
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,820
I guess -- what is it they say about a gift horse?

109
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,860
"Stay away from the mouth,"
which is difficult because lois uses hers so much.

110
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,780
Right.

111
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,170
So,what's going on?

112
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,310
Okay,so,I found a body in the woods out at lone pine last night.

113
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,470
Girl and guy decide to make like the birds and the bees,

114
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,200
girl gets her wings cut,guy buzzes off.

115
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,140
You think he killed her?

116
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,080
I seriously doubt some freshly minted pimple popper
is physically capable of doing that.

117
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,300
I mean,the M.O.Wasn't exactly...

118
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,220
normal,if you know what I mean.

119
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,530
What do you mean?

120
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,260
Impaling people in trees in under five minutes isn't humanly possible.

121
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,750
Unless the guy was infected with kryptonite.

122
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,900
That's our only lead,and he's still missing.

123
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
What were you doing at make-out point?

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,980
What's up,C.K.?

125
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,760
Do you want the job or not?

126
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,470
Hey.

127
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,670
Hi.

128
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,540
Queen industries.

129
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,340
Must have caught a strong headwind.

130
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,930
Mrs.Kent's been waiting for this for weeks.

131
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,940
Thanks.

132
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,910
You're welcome.

133
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh,crap,I'm sorry.

134
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,650
Just so you know,with a face like that,

135
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,740
you can do a whole lot better than playing
errand boy to the rich and arrogant.

136
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,550
-Here.-Thank you very much.

137
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,220
- What is,uh
- your tip.

138
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,540
It's a tip?

139
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,240
Okay.

140
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,290
Seriously -- aim higher.

141
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,640
Listen,um --

142
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,930
I thought I heard the door.

143
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,020
Yeah,your pledge finally sailed in from queen industries.

144
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,820
Where's the man who came with it?

145
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,830
The courier?

146
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,920
Oh,I gave him his tip and sent him on his merry little way.

147
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,070
Handsome,chiseled feares,with a smile that could light up a barn?

148
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,530
Mrs.Kent,you have a crush on the courier?

149
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,090
You mean the billionaire ceo

150
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,310
who stopped by to talk about his financial support of my platform?

151
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
No,lois,I don'T.

152
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,890
I've never even met him,and now I probably never will.

153
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,550
That was oliver queen.

154
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,940
Sorry.They'd already organized a search party

155
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,100
and the police dogs from grandville will be here in another hour.

156
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,820
Chloe,where exactly did you find the body?

157
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,080
It was just up the road about a quarter mile.

158
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,180
Guess I'll meet you there.

159
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,520
You're not supposed to be here.

160
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm sorry?

161
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,900
I'm -- I'm with the search party.

162
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,120
Clark kent.

163
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,950
Gloria,park services.

164
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,730
They find anything yet?

165
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,220
No,nothing.

166
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,480
Have you?

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,830
It's a big forest.

168
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,940
Lots of green.

169
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,130
You must feel isolated out here working all alone.

170
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,680
There's no one for miles.

171
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,300
No,it's what I love about it.

172
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,230
We haven't met before,have we?

173
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,780
I think I'd remember.

174
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,800
So,you searched this whole area all by yourself?

175
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,410
Couple of times.

176
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,790
I haven't found anything that's not supposed to be here.

177
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,710
One more search wouldn't hurt.

178
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,370
I found him!Go get help!

179
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,850
-Clark,where are you?
-Over here,chloe.

180
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,630
He's alive!

181
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,790
Oh,my god.

182
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
Clark,you're bleeding.

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Okay,we don't have much time.

184
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,890
His mom's in the cafeteria.

185
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,260
Wow,this guy's pretty messed up.

186
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,130
Not as bad as his girlfriend in the tree.

187
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,050
Hey,what are these weird blob things on his lungs?

188
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,660
Beats me.

189
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,940
-Jimmy!-What?

190
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,070
Look,we have to get this in the paper.We have to warn people.

191
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,890
We don't even know what it is yet.

192
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,820
She's right.

193
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,650
A picture of some weird x-ray isn't exactly page-one material.

194
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,820
Yeah,well,maybe we'd have a better picture
if I was with you guys when you found him.

195
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,150
Okay,that was my call.

196
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,200
You're just so much more at home on the streets of metropolis.

197
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,810
I know the woods freak you out.

198
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,740
No,no,you know what freaks me out?

199
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,870
My girl traipsing through a forest when something like that can happen.

200
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,920
Your girl?

201
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,670
I mean,aren't you?

202
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,180
Guys,this really isn't the time.

203
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,010
Yeah,you're right,C.K.

204
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,080
I got to go take care of something.

205
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,080
So,we'll talk later when we're alone?

206
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,620
Okay.

207
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,950
Is he always that fired up?

208
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,060
You should see him when he's on his 10th cup of house-drip.

209
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,220
How are your hands?

210
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,520
Healed.

211
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,090
Which begs the obvious question

212
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,690
since not even obi-wan's lightsaber can ginsu your superdermis --

213
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,600
how did a little vine cut through it?

214
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,600
I don't know,but I didn't get weak,so it's not kryptonite.

215
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,990
Well,I sent a cutting of the vine to my botany professor at met.U.

216
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,640
If it's not meteor rock,what else could it be?

217
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,800
You know,lone pine ridge goes right up against the luthor estate.

218
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,510
There's a greenhouse that runs right near the property line.

219
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,110
******

220
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,150
Okay,call me the advocate of the devil,clark

221
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,790
but don't you think that pointing the pitchfork
at lex is a little bit of a stretch?

222
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,020
He had his hands on the kryptonian ship.

223
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,280
He was possessed by zod.

224
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,270
He nearly destroyed this planet.

225
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,130
-If the horns fit
-okay,fine.

226
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,780
I'm just saying you might want to check your personals at the door.

227
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,380
Seeds.

228
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,370
You've always had an eye for beauty.

229
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,070
Its latin name,formositas falsus.

230
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,480
"Beauty that belies a dark nature.

231
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,280
" So,even your plants have hidden agendas.

232
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,610
Well,I guess it all comes down to survival of the fittest.

233
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,150
Doesn't it?

234
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,850
A strange vine has cropped up over the ridge at lone pine.

235
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,510
It's attacking people.

236
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,210
And naturally you came to my little shop of horrors

237
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,380
to foil my ingenious plot to repopulate the planet with vegetation.

238
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,460
Sorry,clark.I'm all out of evil.

239
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,080
Lana must be a calming influence on me.

240
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,080
She's never gonna fit in your world,lex.

241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,910
Unlike you,I'm willing to do whatever it takes so she does.

242
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,610
You can keep fooling yourself that you've changed,but the closer you get to lana,

243
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,900
the closer she is to finding out who you really are.

244
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,920
The days of you showing up unannounced in my home are over.

245
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,820
You're not welcome here.

246
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,790
You found your way in.You can find your way out

247
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,970
Hey.

248
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,400
Hi.

249
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,410
Um,it was such a rush to evacuate the dorms
I guess I took a few of your things.

250
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,770
Thanks.

251
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,530
Oh,wow,I was really missing this,uh...

252
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,850
half-chewed eraser...

253
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,010
and your library book,which is two weeks overdue.

254
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,720
Lana.

255
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,140
I don't know why,but I felt like I needed
an excuse to come and talk with you.

256
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,270
Excuse accepted.

257
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,200
Let's go upstairs.

258
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,140
It feels like a lifetime since I lived here.

259
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,350
Yeah,well,a sprawling 17th-century mansion isn't a bad upgrade.

260
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,050
Well,actually,it's getting kind of crowded in there.

261
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,140
-Water?
-Please.

262
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,690
Lex seems to think that I'm dragging clark's ghost around with me.

263
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,600
And he didn't sign up for a threesome?

264
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,790
Chloe,I have this terrible feeling.

265
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,820
I feel like if I do this with lex,

266
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,190
I'm going to lose my identity.

267
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,530
Well,lana,if you don't trust him now,that dynamic's not gonna change.

268
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,850
It's just I keep blaming my trust issues on everyone else.

269
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,140
And the truth is the person that I don't trust is myself.

270
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,590
I keep --

271
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,740
I haven't always made the right decisions.

272
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,360
And when I realize that I have made the wrong ones

273
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,870
I'm too far gone to get myself out.

274
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,530
Lana,I don't know if lex is the right guy for you or not.

275
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,090
I mean,he certainly wouldn't be my first choice,but he

276
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,430
wouldn't even really be on my list.

277
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,890
You can't just sit safely by the water

278
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,430
and watch all the happy people splashing around.

279
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,930
I mean,eventually,you have to grow some fins and just dive in.

280
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,580
Oh,my god,you scared the blank out of me.

281
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,120
I thought I was the only one that felt safe out here right now.

282
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,450
No.No,no,no,not safe -- compelled.

283
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,890
By what?

284
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,490
A girl.

285
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,500
A photo.

286
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,620
My hope.Her respect.

287
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,190
Well,you have mine.

288
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,630
Since a girl made me drop a log.

289
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,620
Look,is there any chance you've seen
this weird vine that's fond of people?

290
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,450
Yeah,I think I can help you find what you're looking for.

291
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,550
Uh,I don't know.It's,um...

292
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,020
I don't know,but...

293
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,850
well,you know,I already got a girl,so --

294
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,360
I don't want to be your girl.

295
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,730
Then what are you doing?

296
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,230
I just want to wrap myself around you.

297
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,150
Miss,you cannot go in there.

298
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm sorry,mr.Queen.This woman does not have an appointment.

299
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,900
It's okay.She's expected.

300
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,240
I guess I really underestimated the mental powers of yoga.

301
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,210
Well,I find the focus benefits my work.

302
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,810
And,apparently,your premonitions.

303
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,840
After your lamentable blunder

304
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,740
it was either this or a good firing from your boss,right?

305
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,390
Although,I mut say,I didn't picture the fruit basket.

306
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,240
Yes,mr.Queen,I surmise that you're very busy with all your ...

307
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,550
bendy stuff,so I'll be really short

308
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,120
peanuts.I'm allergic.

309
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,200
I'll try and remember that.

310
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,310
Look,martha kent is a sterling senator,and,um,I would be devastated if...

311
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,320
childhood bobbing trauma?

312
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,820
Are you hungry?

313
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,140
No?Okay.

314
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,140
Look,I realize that I was very rude the other day

315
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,970
and I'm just trying to apologize.

316
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,800
And if you hold this against martha kent
it will be you who is missing out on the opportunity

317
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,120
of doing good work with a great woman.

318
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,080
Right.

319
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,780
Well,I guess I was prematurely accurate on my opinion of you.

320
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,290
Miss lane?

321
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,890
If you want my full and undivided attention
why don't you come with me to lex luthor's ball?

322
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,420
While I'm sure downsizing me for an entire evening would make great sport

323
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,100
I think I'll pass.

324
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,490
If martha kent's as amazing as you say she is

325
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,840
it's gonna take a lot more than a few minutes
of groveling to convince me that she's worthy of my support.

326
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,910
I don't have a costume.

327
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,230
You don't have a costume.

328
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,260
Right.

329
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,000
The telepathy.

330
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,030
Here you go.

331
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,550
okay.

332
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,120
Even in my size.

333
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,190
Mr.Queen,have you been rummaging through my drawers?

334
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,370
I have a good eye for sizing people up.

335
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,290
So,you were right.

336
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,370
The pods inside his stomach are seeds.

337
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,260
He's going into surgery in an hour.

338
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,740
Anything from your professor friend?

339
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,760
He was unable to identify the species
but he could break down the dna,and it's foreign...

340
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,110
to the planet earth,which explains why it could cut you.

341
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,410
It's alien?How did it get here?

342
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,370
I don't know,but while it can't gestate in our soil

343
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,180
the chemistry of the human body creates a perfect potting mix.

344
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,270
Find his mother!I'm issuing a code red.

345
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,210
Oh,my god.

346
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,440
We need to stop it.

347
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,030
Not it,clark -- her.

348
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,110
The plant's gynoecious -- it has a sex -- female.

349
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,980
It needed a male to reproduce
which is why the girlfriend was killed so quickly.

350
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,650
Woman: Coming through.Park ranger up at lone pine.

351
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,830
Hunter found her this morning.

352
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,560
I think I can identify her.

353
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,890
I'm sorry.There's been a mistake.That's not the park ranger.

354
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,530
Selena adams,28,went missing last week.

355
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,660
Only female ranger in the county.

356
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,100
Gloria.

357
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,030
Gloria!

358
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,880
I was hoping we'd meet again.

359
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,890
What are you?

360
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,980
I'm just a girl that loves nature.

361
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,480
You're not human.

362
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,690
You're not even from this planet.

363
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,820
No.

364
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,920
But I think I'm gonna like it here.

365
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,020
Wherever you're from,go back -- now!

366
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
I can'T.

367
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,620
My world is gone.

368
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,530
It was paradise.

369
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,240
It was lush and green and full of life.

370
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,100
But towers of steel replaced the forests,

371
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,010
upsetting the balance of nate.

372
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,580
So I tried to correct it.

373
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,390
At the cost of how many lives?

374
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,810
They didn't understand me,either.

375
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,930
They branded me a criminal.

376
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,710
They imprisoned me in a desolate wasteland
where the suns never set and nothing ever grows.

377
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,970
The phantom zone.

378
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,200
I knew I'd seen you before.

379
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,600
You're the kryptonian that opened the gateway.

380
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,070
How do you know that?

381
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,440
Because I was there.

382
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,340
The savages were attacking a girl.

383
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,590
Raya.

384
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,080
And you touched the gateway,and it all went white.

385
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,570
Looks like I'm not the only one that doesn't belong.

386
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,360
You could have learned to adapt like I did.

387
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,670
What do you think I'm doing?

388
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,600
There's a party nearby full of eligible suitors

389
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,280
waiting for me to spread my beauty.

390
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,280
Can you smell them?

391
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,770
You have to stop!

392
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,610
Says who?

393
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,850
I can't change my nature,and no one else will ever make me again.

394
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,640
Welcome to the first annual benefit ball for the victims of dark thursday.

395
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,140
On behalf of lex luthor,we'd like to thank everybody

396
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,070
for reaching into your pockets and supporting
the families affected by this disaster.

397
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,670
You guys rock.

398
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,750
I'm glad you came.

399
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,350
So am I.

400
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,260
I thought I might have frightened you off.

401
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,520
You'll have to come up with better scare tactics.

402
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,270
So,is this part of your sizing me up?

403
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,350
Well,miss lane,honestly,that was a miscalculation.

404
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,320
Well,that would be my polite comment on your choice of legwear for this evening.

405
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,700
You have a quick tongue.

406
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,790
I find that very attractive.

407
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,910
Well,keep it in your quiver,jolly green bandit.

408
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,410
So,is your fortune the do-it-yourself,steal-from-the-rich kind

409
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,760
or is it silver-plattered like our host's?

410
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,730
It belonged to my parents

411
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,160
and I,uh -- I inherited it when they died.

412
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,940
Well,I wasn't going to give it to you,but the tights

413
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,380
-- you're totally pulling it off.

414
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,230
You should see him in a tutu.

415
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,530
Lex luthor...

416
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,870
with a girl that he doesn't have to inflate.

417
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,460
Lana lang,oliver queen.

418
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,280
We went to boarding school together.

419
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,710
Talked to any of the old gang lately?

420
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,890
Enjoy the party.

421
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,610
I always do.

422
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,030
If that's a friend,I'd hate to see an enemy.

423
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,980
Senator kent!

424
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,960
Hi,I've been looking all over for you.

425
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,860
I would like you to meet oliver queen.

426
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,900
Mr.Queen,it's nice to finally meet you.

427
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,460
The pleasure's all mine.

428
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,900
So,lois has been telling me about your policy points.

429
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,210
We should get together and talk about how I can help you.

430
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,830
I'm looking forward to that.Thank you

431
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,770
Thank lois.

432
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,220
She can be very persuasive.

433
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,270
Chloe: Clark!

434
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Clark,I can't find you on my own!

435
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,670
You have to help me!Where are you?

436
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,960
Clark!

437
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,100
Chloe.

438
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,810
Chloe.

439
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,910
Oh,my god.Clark.

440
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,120
Come on.Come back.

441
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,890
I can't lose you twice in one month.Are you ok?

442
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,770
I will be in a second.

443
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,090
How'd you kill it?

444
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,020
Biology 101 -- electricity denatures enzymes.

445
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,570
We have to help jimmy.

446
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,180
-Jimmy?
-He's over there.

447
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,250
Gloria is headed to the mansion.

448
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,900
Go.I'll get help for jimmy.

449
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,940
Go!

450
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,090
So,tarzan and park rangers both love the wild.

451
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,240
And swinging on vines.

452
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,480
Ride's over!

453
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,950
Who the hell are you?

454
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,820
The gardener.Get out!

455
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,210
Kryptonians -- always so hard and cold.

456
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,190
You can't go home.

457
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,310
I can't let you stay.What are we gonna do?

458
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,340
We'll have to let nature decide.

459
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,560
You saved me from the phantom zone,clark.

460
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,760
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

461
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,640
Chloe: There are seedpods inside him that can only be killed with electricity.

462
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,490
-You're insane.
-No,please,listen to me.

463
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,630
You have to defibrillate him or he will die.

464
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,330
The guy is not in cardiac arrest.We will not defib.

465
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,610
Now back off.

466
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,600
Hey,what are you doing?

467
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,150
Back off!

468
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,480
They're hot.

469
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,570
Please don't let me kill him.

470
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,260
Did you just paddle me?

471
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,840
yeah

472
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,290
I have enjoyed courting you against your will this evening.

473
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,260
Hmm,only because I let you.

474
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,490
I'd like to kiss you now.

475
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,140
Um,you know

476
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,440
the lady requires a show of skill before awarding you with her favor.

477
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,160
Which is actually where I was going with the kiss.

478
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,010
Let's make it interesting.

479
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,610
Hit that can with your arrow...

480
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,490
and I'm yours.

481
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,160
You're that easy,huh?

482
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,180
It's that hard.

483
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,830
I'm gonna go for it.

484
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,280
All right.

485
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,090
Here goes nothing.

486
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,680
Better luck next time,hood.

487
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,320
This is definitely a night of firsts.

488
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,010
How's that?

489
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,000
Well,it's the first time I've ever
danced in my extremely pretentious fountain.

490
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,160
And it's the first time I've ever felt this...

491
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,740
satisfied.

492
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,790
I was half-expecting the word "happy" to come out of your mouth.

493
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,920
Happiness is just a feeling of euphoria.

494
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,970
It's your brain chemistry going in overdrive.

495
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,580
That's why so many relationships fail
when the honeymoon ends and reality sets in.

496
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,140
Wow,have you always been such a romantic?

497
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,880
If you were any other woman,I'd be saying
everything you expect to hear right now,

498
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,390
but you're not,okay?

499
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,760
You not like anyone else.

500
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,590
Well,careful

501
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,720
because I am dangerously close to being satisfied.

502
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,760
Then my evil plan is working.

503
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,780
So,what made you change your mind about gracing my arm tonight?

504
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,430
Life -- wanting to live it.

505
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,620
What are you doing?
