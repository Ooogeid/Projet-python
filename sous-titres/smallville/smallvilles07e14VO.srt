00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,199
Mr. Luthor.

2
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:17,813
You received another one, sir.

3
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,733
Thank you.

4
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:30,507
That's, uh, it for tonight.

5
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,033
Lana?

6
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,703
Take him down.

7
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:06,367
I can see why they want you.

8
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,875
Target acquired.

9
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:17,875
Smallville 714

12
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,349
Lana?

13
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,213
Hey. I came as soon as i got your...

14
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,566
Oh, my god. What happened?

15
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,968
I don't know.
I came home and clark was gone.

16
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,167
He talked about going to the fortress.

17
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,763
Last time he went to the fortress,
jor-El trapped him in ice for a month.

18
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:33,309
Why would he chance
the big chill a second time?

19
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,432
We just found out that kara
moved in with lex at the mansion.

20
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,175
Clark was hoping that jor-El would give
her back her memories and her powers.

21
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,701
Before lex uncovers her secret.

22
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:45,748
He wanted to get up there fast, but he
needed something from the loft first.

23
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,868
I don't think he got
what he came in here for.

24
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,513
This key opens the portal
to the fortress.

25
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,267
How did you know that?

26
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,133
I kind of followed him there
a couple of years ago.

27
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:12,266
- The key's still here.
- Then he never made it to the fortress

28
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,351
So something must have stopped him.

29
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,567
Stay in the center of your cell.

30
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,267
Where am i?!

31
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,434
What is this?

32
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:43,284
Come out here.

33
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:46,067
Come out here and face me!

34
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,112
You just experienced
a 20% increase in charge

35
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:12,067
From the meteor rock lining your cell.

36
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,300
Do it again,
i'll ramp it up 50%.

37
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:20,007
You try for three,
i'm guessing 100% will kill you.

38
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:06,667
Whoever would have guessed
that skinny little patty swann

39
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:10,208
Was the author of those
alarmingly cryptic messages?

40
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,501
It's patricia.
Nice to see you, lionel.

41
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:17,359
The last time i saw you,
you and lex were both children.

42
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,801
And your father, virgil swann,

43
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,632
He adored the great outdoors.
Then he shut himself away inside

44
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,629
That dank, musty planetarium.

45
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,000
We both know that those
family get-Togethers

46
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,044
Weren't about
the great outdoors.

47
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:37,202
When dad died,
i inherited his estate.

48
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:40,566
After a long probate, i've recently
received all of his research.

49
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,133
He was obsessed with one subject
in particular...

50
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,901
A traveler from another galaxy

51
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,734
Who came to smallville
in a meteor shower.

52
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,367
A great scientist
with a vivid imagination.

53
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,467
My father wasn't the only one
who believed in the traveler.

54
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,200
Four powerful families
would gather every summer...

55
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:02,689
My dad, the queens,
the teagues, and you.

56
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:07,541
According to his journals, the group
formed a secret society...

57
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,988
Veritas.

58
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,934
Veritas... that's right,
our astronomy club.

59
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,836
You were preparing to welcome the traveler.

60
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:18,267
The group planned on sharing
the responsibility

61
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,440
Of keeping him safe
once he arrived.

62
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,367
But everyone died...

63
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,452
... except you.

64
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,545
Where are you going
with this?

65
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,868
You killed edward teague

66
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,576
And robert and laura queen.

67
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,808
And i am sure that you had
a hand in my father's death.

68
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,234
A pity his brilliance was lost on you.

69
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,956
I have proof.

70
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:02,489
I found evidence my father collected
and stored with his journals.

71
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,437
You wanted the traveler all for yourself...

72
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,334
For your own personal gain.

73
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,634
Turn over the son of krypton,

74
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,258
Or i will release the evidence
linking you to their murders.

75
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,234
The traveler from another galaxy,

76
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,934
A clandestine cabal,
a series of murders...

77
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:27,496
That's quite a story. You be careful
who you tell it to.

78
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,701
Don't test me, lionel.

79
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:33,867
Take me to the traveler now.

80
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,634
You haven't changed.

81
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,834
You're still that bossy
little girl you used to be.

82
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,202
But this time, patty,

83
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,077
You're swimming
way out of your depth.

84
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:29,893
Hope you like your room.

85
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:35,001
I only moved in last night,
and it already feels like home.

86
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:37,567
Thank you for letting me
stay here, lex.

87
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,105
Taking another look
at your alleged biography?

88
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,997
Yeah, i thought i'd give it another try.

89
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I still don't feel like
i was ever this person.

90
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:49,131
Kara...

91
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:52,887
You should really consider having
the procedure we talked about.

92
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,159
I don't know. I mean,
i don't have my memory,

93
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,439
But i'm pretty sure
i don't like hospitals.

94
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,948
It would be done in my private clinic

95
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,767
By a team of the world's
top neurologists.

96
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,533
You said you trusted me.

97
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,434
Trust me now.
Let me help you.

98
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,368
Okay, lex.

99
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,369
I'll do it.

100
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,771
Good.

101
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:32,354
I'll pull my team together
as soon as possible.

102
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,434
Good night, kara.

103
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:02,167
We've been watching her
since she arrived, sir.

104
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:06,019
So far, nothing indicates she's anything
more than a pretty girl from minnesota.

105
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,830
I don't pay you to comment
on her appearance.

106
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:12,101
Besides,
looks can be deceiving.

107
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:17,201
Kara's agreed to do the procedure.

108
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:20,310
Sir, if i may,
we just started observing her.

109
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:24,743
Her mind may contain answers to
questions i've had for a very long time.

110
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:27,167
Now, i've waited long enough.

111
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:29,605
How soon can the lab be ready?

112
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:31,468
Tomorrow.

113
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,086
Keep an eye on her.

114
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:38,303
If she shows any sign
her memory is coming back,

115
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,301
Lock this place down.

116
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,596
Stop! You stop it now!

117
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,934
What the hell
are you doing?

118
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:13,964
I built that cell to contain him, not
for you to use as a torture chamber.

119
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:19,899
Mr. Luthor, you hired me because of
my experience with these freaks.

120
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:23,695
If anything happens to him,
anything at all,

121
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,034
Because of your appetite for cruelty,

122
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,234
You will be held responsible.

123
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,037
No.

124
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:54,147
Well, i don't agree with you.

125
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,548
Absolutely not.

126
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,929
Lionel.

127
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,968
I'll get back to you.

128
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,486
Lana. Miss sullivan.
I've got my people searching...

129
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,116
Discreetly, of course...
the government agencies.

130
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,463
If any of them are responsible
for taking clark,

131
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:12,977
- We'll know very soon.
- Maybe you could help.

132
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,300
Do you know what this is?

133
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,122
Believe it's an electrode.

134
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:24,413
Probably from a taser gun.

135
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,167
This is kryptonite.

136
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,445
We found it in the barn
after clark was taken.

137
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:34,232
As far as we know, everyone that knows
about clark's weakness is in this room.

138
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,565
It wasn't chloe,
and it wasn't me.

139
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,576
What about kara?

140
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:43,530
I told you and clark she'd been spending
time with lex. Now she's moved in with him.

141
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:47,055
- But her memory
- Might be coming back, little by little much.

142
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,926
Wouldn't take much.
Just a few simple words. Enough

143
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,567
For lex to work out clark's secret.

144
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,427
Oh, i'd hate to think that

145
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:57,195
My son is responsible for any of this.

146
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,533
This is clark's worst fear.

147
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,880
Wait a minute.
Lx dynamics.

148
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:05,773
Lx dynamics
has military contracts

149
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:09,101
Developing combat technologies.
I'll do some research,

150
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:12,171
See if any of it involves
electroshock or...

151
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,998
If he harms clark, i will kill him.

152
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,862
I'll deal with him, lana.
He's my son.

153
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:24,222
I want clark back safely
as much as you do.

154
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:37,440
I dug around for some
information on lx dynamics.

155
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:41,346
Lionel was right. Lex is having them build
experimental tasers for the military.

156
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,222
Actually, i've been wielding
my own shovel,

157
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:45,758
And i think i may have found
where clark is being held.

158
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,478
About a year and a half ago, luthorcorp bought
a abandoned airstrip just outside the city.

159
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:54,729
Now they've rebuilt the hangar.
Check out the construction manifest.

160
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,610
"Concrete reinforced plexiglas in a
ton of refined meteor rock"?

161
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:03,641
- Lex built another 33.1 lab.
- Wrong luthor.

162
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,740
According to all of these
records, this was all lionel.

163
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,950
Construction started around the same
time lionel found out clark's secret.

164
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:18,156
The department of water and power said they
turned the lights on for the first time two days ago.

165
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:21,308
Lionel's been planning
this kidnapping for months.

166
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,290
And if these specs are accurate,
the place is built like fort knox.

167
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,034
We need kara.

168
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:29,698
Chloe, kara can't help if she
doesn't have her powers back.

169
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,701
Clark was on his way to the fortress
of solitude to ask jor-El for help.

170
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,516
Now, maybe we can polar express
kara there ourselves.

171
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,366
The key... do you know how to use it?

172
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:39,539
If we can get her out of the
mansion, i can get her there.

173
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,016
She wanted to move in with lex. I don't
think it'll be easy getting her to leave.

174
00:17:43,017 --> 00:17:45,794
Lex probably quadrupled his
security since she moved in.

175
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:48,207
We won't be able to get past
the mailbox.

176
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,451
I'm thinking something
a little more stealth.

177
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:53,371
When i was married to lex, he showed me
these escape passageways

178
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,141
He had built in case
of another home invasion.

179
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:59,799
So use his secret way out
to sneak in.

180
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,326
It's good to see a friendly face
from my childhood.

181
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,513
What brings you to smallville?

182
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:14,039
I'm rarely in metropolis, but i have
some business there,

183
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,434
And i remembered
you'd moved out here.

184
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,834
Well, i'm glad
you came by, patricia.

185
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,934
I have to admit,

186
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,334
I don't recall much
from when we were kids.

187
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,583
After getting caught
in that meteor shower,

188
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:28,601
The years leading up to it
became something of a fog.

189
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:32,355
You were so young, lex.
It must have been traumatizing.

190
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,267
I survived.

191
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:39,531
What about you?
Where did you disappear to?

192
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:43,503
I spent most of my life studying abroad.

193
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:46,426
When dad died,
i decided to stay in europe.

194
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:49,501
I always admired
dr. Swann's genius.

195
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:52,063
I was sorry to hear about his death.

196
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,435
Thanks, lex.

197
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:57,240
I'm doing my best
to carry on his legacy.

198
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:01,091
That's a beautiful locket
you're wearing.

199
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,196
Dad gave me this
right before he passed away.

200
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,527
I've worn it ever since.

201
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,052
Actually, i have a gift for you.

202
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:27,236
A child's painting?

203
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:29,016
It's your painting.

204
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,567
I was going through some
of my father's things, and

205
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,255
I found it.

206
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,294
You gave it to me
when we were kids.

207
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,919
Well, i guess i thought
i could romance you with my abc's.

208
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:42,601
It's an insignia...

209
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:45,747
From when our parents would get
together with the queens and the teagues.

210
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,110
Really?
I don't remember that.

211
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,997
That "v" was the symbol
for their astronomy club.

212
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,250
You must have seen it once
and copied it.

213
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,821
They called
themselves "veritas."

214
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,901
While we were off playing,
they were discussing

215
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,911
Secret things behind closed doors.

216
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:06,364
Do you know
what they talked about?

217
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:08,204
No idea.

218
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:11,068
But considering your father's
the last surviving member,

219
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,339
He can probably explain it all to you.

220
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,964
You should tell him i say hello.

221
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:42,312
Where did you find this?

222
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,200
Patricia swann visited me today.

223
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:49,377
Apparently i made it while i was still
learning my way around a paintbrush.

224
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:53,134
Well, if you're looking for some validation
of your artistic talent

225
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,100
As a child, it's a little late, isn't it?

226
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:58,276
Patricia told me
it's the symbol for veritas,

227
00:20:58,277 --> 00:21:00,758
But she's not sharing
the whole story.

228
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:04,592
It's the misguided musings
of a few youthful idealists

229
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,834
With a little money and too much
time on their hands.

230
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,166
We took ourselves much too
seriously, i'm embarrassed to say.

231
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:13,693
What secret was so important that you
and your friends built a group around it?

232
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:18,100
Oh, think about it, lex.
Skull & bones, scroll & key, the delphic.

233
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:21,255
The rich have secret societies.
The others have poker nights.

234
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:24,433
Well, it seems life dealt your charter
members a poor hand.

235
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:27,364
Besides you, everyone else is dead.

236
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,309
Why'd you kill them?

237
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,067
Will you give it a rest, lex?

238
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,219
Let the whole business rest in peace.

239
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,971
Sorry, dad.
I can't do that.

240
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,100
Why don't you treat this sketch
for what it is?

241
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,951
A reminder of what you
could have become.

242
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,325
If you won't tell me,
i'm sure patricia will.

243
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,033
Yeah. He was just here.
He delivered your message.

244
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:16,934
I'm ready, patricia,
to make a deal.

245
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:22,167
Lex likes to keep his women
on a short leash.

246
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,840
Sounds more like a choke chain,
if you ask me. Let's get her out of there.

247
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:32,840
Okay, the passageways open up
onto a steep hill.

248
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:35,766
It's pretty far off the road. It's gonna
take us a while to climb up there.

249
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,495
If it means saving clark,
i'd climb mount everest.

250
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,834
Is she ready?

251
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,656
- Yes, sir. And so is the lab.
- Good. It's time to find some answers.

252
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,467
What happened?

253
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,277
- The feed's been cut.
- Lock this place down!

254
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,801
Now!

255
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,450
What are you doing?

256
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,018
Kara, you have to come with us right now.

257
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,600
We'll explain everything later.
Just trust us.

258
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:45,077
You're not getting out, you know.

259
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,067
I helped build this cage.

260
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,601
What do you want from me?!

261
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:53,894
I've seen a lot of terrible
things in your town.

262
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:57,831
How could a place called
smallville be filled with such

263
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,167
Death and destruction?

264
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:05,207
I think it has something
to do with you.

265
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:09,837
Maybe you want to reconsider
keeping me in this cage.

266
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:14,367
You work for the government?

267
00:24:14,802 --> 00:24:17,834
I was head security for 33.1.

268
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:21,043
I've tracked down a lot
of meteor freaks, but you...

269
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:24,234
You're in a category all to yourself.

270
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,901
The government wouldn't know
what to do with you.

271
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,634
But i do.

272
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:52,035
Enjoy your stay... freak.

273
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:07,174
What is this place?
It's freezing in here.

274
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:11,302
It's clark's fortress.
We're way up in the north pole.

275
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,767
Right, fortress, north pole.

276
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:18,133
And how did we get here?
Through the portal.

277
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,367
Oh, and if there's a sudden
shift in weather,

278
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,820
Just get out of here
as fast as you can.

279
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:26,404
That's reassuring.

280
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,451
Hello?!

281
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:31,954
Jor-El?!

282
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,480
Who are you talking to?

283
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,667
Clark's in trouble.

284
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,534
Now, i know that your brother
started all of this,

285
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:48,133
But right now, the only way
we can help your son

286
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:51,467
Is if you restore kara's memory and powers.

287
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:57,834
Whatever jor-El is, i don't
think he's here right now.

288
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:59,652
Jor-El!

289
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,434
Out of all the planets
across the universe,

290
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:06,321
You decided to send
your only son to this one! To earth!

291
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:08,612
You trusted us to protect him!

292
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:11,884
Now, please, jor-El,
i need you to trust me!

293
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:13,842
I love your son!

294
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:16,893
He's in danger
and he needs our help!

295
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:08,934
Chloe, why are we
in the fortress?

296
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:12,001
We have to save clark.

297
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,815
Patricia.

298
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:43,886
My lawyers now where I am, lionel.

299
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:45,689
If you kill me,
they'll know who did it.

300
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,346
Of course. Is that the evidence?

301
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:51,151
My father raised me
to keep my word.

302
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,180
Before i hand this over,
i need to see him first.

303
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,434
You put him in a cage?

304
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:16,467
What i have done is fulfilled
my part of the agreement,

305
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:19,088
And i expect you to do the same.

306
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,868
Not yet.

307
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:31,100
I want to meet him face-To-Face.

308
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:34,907
I need to verify
he truly is the traveler.

309
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:41,897
I hope you've said
your goodbyes, lionel,

310
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:44,325
Because if he is the traveler,

311
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:47,612
Leaving with me right now.

312
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:56,389
Put her on the plane. When she's on
her way to europe,

313
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,143
return Mr. Kendiscreet
to his home. I'll take it from there.

314
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:03,937
That monster
isn't going anywhere.

315
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:09,732
- What are you doing?
- You rich people...

316
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:11,921
Your money makes you stupid.

317
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:15,116
Anyone can see that thing
is dangerous. It could kill somebody.

318
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:18,167
For all we know, it might be
a threat to national security.

319
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,734
Pierce, listen to me.

320
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,856
You know, in all the time
that i worked for lex,

321
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:26,131
Not once did he put the interests of a
meteor freak above the safety of the world.

322
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:29,653
He knew when to terminate a project.

323
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,434
But you...

324
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,968
You're not your son.

325
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,734
And i'm gonna terminate it for you.

326
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:57,150
You don't know what you're doing.
Clark kent is not a threat.

327
00:29:57,151 --> 00:30:00,691
You really think after
everything that i have seen

328
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:04,600
That i'm just gonna let you and the
swann princess here just set him free?

329
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:08,028
He must be terminated.

330
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:10,755
No.

331
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,957
He's a human being, pierce.
You'd be committing murder.

332
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:36,079
It's nice having you back.

333
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,557
How could i have
ever forgotten you?

334
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:30,738
Here you go.

335
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:36,614
Somehow, i never pictured
the last son of krypton making coffee.

336
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,711
Just clark.

337
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,936
You know, my father thought
the world of you.

338
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,804
Dr. Swann was a great man.

339
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:50,722
I have something for you.

340
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,798
Dad's journal,
transcribed by his assistant.

341
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:59,438
It's actually the last of many
he kept throughout his life.

342
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:03,415
I want you to have it.

343
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,067
Thank you.

344
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:44,794
"The traveler will bring
great change to the earth."

345
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,131
All these prophecies
about the traveler.

346
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,888
I just hope i can live up to what
everyone thinks i'm supposed to be.

347
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,305
I've just met you,

348
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,800
And there's no doubt in my mind

349
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,334
That you're a force for good in this world.

350
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:14,167
What if that's not enough?

351
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:18,126
You're right, clark.

352
00:34:18,127 --> 00:34:20,300
And there are some people
out there like lionel luthor

353
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:23,350
Who are willing to destroy
others to get to you.

354
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:28,292
Lionel had robert and laura queen's
plane sabotaged so it would crash.

355
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:30,352
He poisoned edward teague,

356
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:32,972
And i think he did
the same thing to my father.

357
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:38,727
- Why would he do that?
- They were all part of a group

358
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:40,887
Who swore to protect the traveler.

359
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,767
Lionel wanted you all for himself.

360
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:47,269
He killed all those people
because of me.

361
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,228
My father often reminded me that
despite the power of the sun,

362
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:56,958
It's always night on half
the planet.

363
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,212
For all the good you do,
there will always be darkness.

364
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,919
People who would kill you

365
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,783
Or abuse your power
for their own gain...

366
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,101
Lionel luthor's just one of many.

367
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:17,201
Clark, i wish you would
reconsider coming with me.

368
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:21,403
As long as lionel luthor
is alive, he's a threat to you.

369
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,859
I'll deal with lionel.

370
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,500
Then i'll take an apartment
in metropolis.

371
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,633
I want to be there for you.

372
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,400
Just like my father was.

373
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,010
Someday,

374
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:42,483
I hope to see the traveler
change the world.

375
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,319
Clark, i...

376
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,209
I'm... sorry.

377
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,501
I'm sorry that you had to be
locked in that cell, but

378
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:30,468
It was the only way i could
be sure you were safe.

379
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,557
Safe from what?

380
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:35,820
I got... i got these letters,

381
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:39,174
You see. They... they threatened...

382
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,328
To...

383
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:44,067
Kidnap you,
to take you away.

384
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,264
I didn't know who was sending them
until i met with patricia swann,

385
00:36:46,265 --> 00:36:49,866
But i had no idea how many
people were involved or

386
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:53,594
How much they knew or what they
intended to do with you.

387
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,954
Why didn't you just tell me
there was danger? Lee my own decision.

388
00:36:56,955 --> 00:37:00,114
If i told you, you would have rushed
out to search for your enemies.

389
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:02,567
I couldn't take that chance
that you might get hurt.

390
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,533
So instead you shoot me
with kryptonite tasers.

391
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,047
You trap me in a kryptonite cell.

392
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:14,101
Why would you even
build that thing?

393
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:18,061
Clark, you're not the only
kryptonian who's come here.

394
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,300
Your fellow travelers are
violent... extremely

395
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:24,158
Violent. I built that cell for them.

396
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:32,866
- Then why imprison me?
- Clark, son...

397
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,713
You're not my father!

398
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:39,428
I spoke to patricia. She told me
about the veritas murders.

399
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:42,599
The truth can be
very easily manipulated.

400
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,975
You would know that better than anyone,
lionel. You've been doing it for years.

401
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,301
I'm different now.

402
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,533
I'm a different man.

403
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:05,067
No, you're not.

404
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:44,515
Hey, cousin.
Need any help?

405
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,984
You've already done
more than enough.

406
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,700
I have something for you.

407
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,788
I was saving it till you got
your memory back.

408
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:02,301
Thanks for saving my life.

409
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,773
I didn't do it alone. I mean, if it
wasn't for chloe and lana,

410
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:10,132
Lex would have dissected
my brain by now.

411
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,532
I can't believe i trusted him.

412
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,468
Don't be too hard on yourself.

413
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:20,148
You're not the only one
to be fooled by the luthors.

414
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:22,900
Lex and i used to be best friends.

415
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:25,234
And i thought lionel was my ally.

416
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:27,691
But it doesn't make
any sense.

417
00:39:27,692 --> 00:39:32,599
I mean, lex tried to save me in detroit.
His father saved both of us in washington.

418
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:38,065
Lex and lionel are only capable
of doing the right thing if it benefits them.

419
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,905
I want to see the good in people, kara,

420
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,677
But i think the luthors
are a lost cause.

421
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,134
Why have we stopped?

422
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:11,167
