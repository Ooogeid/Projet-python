00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,083
<i>Previously on "smallville"...</i>

2
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:04,794
- lex deserved to die.
- Are you listening to yourself?

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,159
Oliver killed lex luthor.
You're not one of us anymore.

4
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,718
You're making a big mistake.

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,362
Maybe i'm selfish.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,821
I can't share you
with the rest of the world.

7
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:19,167
You may be on
some death-wish fast track,

8
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,058
but i could really use
a little dose of hero about now.

9
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,486
You know that you're meant
for more than this. This isn't you.

10
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:27,443
"My name is oliver queen,
and i am..."

11
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,781
we have to get
these people out of here now.

12
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,990
Oliver's standing on a land mine.

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,076
How'd you know
the pressure plate wasn't real?

14
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,118
I didn't.

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,004
Is there any part of the person
i used to know still there?

16
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,324
Maybe not. I took a look in the mirror,
and you were right.

17
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,104
I've been running away from
myself for a long time now.

18
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,009
But now i know who i really am.

19
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:29,690
Now, that's the face of a guy
who's down on his luck.

20
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,901
I think my luck's
about ready to turn around.

21
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,185
I don't remember seeing you earlier.

22
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,964
Maybe not.
But i've seen you before.

23
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:42,066
Your type.

24
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,198
And what type is that exactly?

25
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,707
The player who can't find a game
to satisfy him.

26
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,568
I'll admit i've lost
a certain lust for life...

27
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:55,480
but luckily not other things.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,283
Then play a game with me.

29
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,722
I'm all in.

30
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,300
It's not exactly
the kind of game i had in mind.

31
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,781
You can only choose one.

32
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:42,032
You're not joining me?

33
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:44,457
Trips are more fun
when they're for two.

34
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,631
This is just for you.

35
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,443
I promise, it'll be worth it.

36
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,001
Of course, you do have a choice.

37
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,561
But...

38
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,059
what do you have to lose?

39
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:03,180
Absolutely nothing.

40
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,796
What the hell?

41
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:44,288
What the hell is...

42
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,352
Smallville - 9x05 - Roulette

43
00:05:57,663 --> 00:06:01,163
Synchro : Flolo

44
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:40,482
For Seriessub.com

45
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,246
about time you got home.

46
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,292
Shelby's great and all, but the
conversation. A little one-sided.

47
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:01,793
Shouldn't you be riding a mechanical
bull somewhere? It is friday night.

48
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,806
Correction. It's movie night.

49
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,694
I hope you like sharks.

50
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,823
We're gonna start
with my favorite one.

51
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:10,822
You have your hands full
with all your laundry.

52
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:13,176
Maybe we should make movie night
another weekend.

53
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,825
It's called "multitasking."
You should try it sometime.

54
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:19,397
I hope i have enough detergent.

55
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,417
How do you even have
anything left to wear?

56
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:25,736
Most guys wouldn't complain
if i suddenly found myself shirtless.

57
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,149
Poor clark. Here.

58
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,089
F.y.i....
that did not just happen.

59
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,924
Come on!

60
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,691
It is called "smallville"
for a reason.

61
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,672
What else do you possibly have
to do tonight?

62
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,188
It'll be fun.

63
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:09,896
<i>Stop! Stop it!</i>

64
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,289
You know what we need?
Some popcorn.

65
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,317
Don't forget the extra butter.

66
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:25,196
Please!

67
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:59,586
See? We're already having fun.

68
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,807
Can anyone hear me?!

69
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,695
Come on... think.

70
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,494
Just think.

71
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,824
Come on.

72
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:34,999
Come on.

73
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,210
Come on.

74
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:25,683
The last time i trust
a woman with a dragon tattoo.

75
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,934
You got to be kidding me.

76
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,385
It's a hell of a game
you're playing, winslow!

77
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,652
If the toyman wants to play,
you're gonna have to come out here

78
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:27,300
and face me like a man.

79
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,024
<i>Winslow schott isn't responsible,
mr. Queen.</i>

80
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:32,202
<i>Care to guess again?</i>

81
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:34,857
Enough. This ends now!

82
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:36,763
<i>If that's what you want,</i>

83
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:39,795
<i>just say the safe word
and the game will stop.</i>

84
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,348
What the hell are you talking
about? I didn't get a safe word.

85
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:44,038
<i>Because you didn't ask.</i>

86
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,537
<i>If you don't care enough
to learn the rules,</i>

87
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,310
<i>you can't complain
about the game continuing.</i>

88
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:50,911
Who is this?!

89
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,180
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

90
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:56,441
<i>Tell me, mr. Queen,
who did you destroy?</i>

91
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,778
"Destroy."

92
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,498
I've ruined a lot of lives.

93
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,846
<i>I better keep this simple.</i>

94
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:16,698
<i>Here's a yes-or-no question.</i>

95
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,110
<i>Have you had your rabies shot?</i>

96
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,790
Are you like this at the
movie theater, too?

97
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,904
These concession runs
are really sweet,

98
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,470
but you're up and down more often
than the cubs' batting lineup.

99
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:08,215
It's all the onscreen suspense.
I guess it makes me hungry.

100
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,541
What'd i miss?

101
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,368
There was this thing about a boat.

102
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,710
And then just lots
of dum-dum-dum-dum,

103
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,497
dah-dum da-da da-da-da-da dum.

104
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,251
All right. You show up with every
shark movie known to man

105
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,008
and 11 loads of laundry when i've seen
you take socks to the dry cleaner.

106
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,287
Are you okay?

107
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,272
I'm fine.

108
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,183
Why wouldn't i be fine?

109
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,525
I'm totally not fine.
Even if it is stupid.

110
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,201
But it's not stupid.

111
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,271
It's oliver's birthday today,

112
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,432
and we always go out
for beer pong on our birthdays.

113
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:57,127
But today is about to become
yesterday in t-minus...

114
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,256
negative minutes.

115
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,654
It's over. He totally missed it.

116
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,547
How does a guy with nine phone
numbers not return a phone call?

117
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,930
Probably just celebrating
with someone else.

118
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,361
Tall, dark, and single.

119
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,786
Go figure.

120
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:27,390
Do you know something?

121
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,439
You would tell me if you did, right?

122
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,476
I'm sure oliver's just fine.

123
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,007
But paying him a visit
wouldn't hurt.

124
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,626
Great idea. Anchors up, captain.
Let's go.

125
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,847
<i>- It's oliver. I really need your help.
- We're sorry,</i>

126
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,316
<i>but your call cannot
be completed as dialed.</i>

127
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,885
<i>- Come on!
- You come on, mr. Queen.</i>

128
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,611
<i>Did you really think
it would be that easy?</i>

129
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,770
Who the hell is this?

130
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:18,259
Just the woman i'm looking for.

131
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,183
I know exactly how you feel.

132
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,608
Don't make a scene.

133
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,659
The people who set the game
in motion are here.

134
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,145
If they realize you're here,
they'll kill you.

135
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,008
- And why should i trust you?
- Trust your instincts.

136
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,667
When the chips are down,
they're all you have.

137
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,018
All in?

138
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,795
Wait.

139
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,930
I don't even know your name.

140
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,876
It's victoria!
We don't have time for this!

141
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,179
We're gonna make time. Now, you tell me
who's behind the game!

142
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:22,000
I work for some nasty guys. They don't
exactly have an h.r. Department.

143
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,387
It's my job
to knock their targets out.

144
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,755
If you hadn't taken that pill,
they would have killed me.

145
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,471
I'm gonna help you out
of this, okay? Look at me.

146
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:32,459
In order to do that, i need to know
what these people want with me.

147
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,997
- You understand?
- I wish i knew. People hire them.

148
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,015
They never tell me the client's
identity or end game.

149
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:43,905
Hell, i guess you're the only one
that can answer that question.

150
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,388
Who did you hurt so badly that
they'd want to see you dead?

151
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,791
Pick a name.

152
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,082
My personal wars have left
a serious casualty list 'cause...

153
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:02,820
i kind of always figured it was easier
for me to hurt the people i cared about

154
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,864
than to stick around
long enough knowing

155
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:08,461
eventually i'd end up
disappointing them anyway.

156
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,425
They found us!

157
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,062
Come on.

158
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,824
Listen to me. Look at me.

159
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,560
Let me go.

160
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,411
This is the only way i'll be free.

161
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,496
You listen to me.
You got to fight, okay?

162
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,158
You got to hang on.
Look at me.

163
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,286
Hands up!

164
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,591
No, wait a minute. You got
the wrong guy, okay?

165
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,113
- Get up, now!
- Listen to me!

166
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,180
You got the wrong guy!

167
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,417
Pants on, birthday boy.
Party train's arrived.

168
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,654
I think people
would prefer "knock" over "pants on."

169
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,989
We've already checked his jet
and his apartment.

170
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,330
Unless he's under the couch.

171
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,155
Looks like his party train
already left the station.

172
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:35,100
Without me on board?

173
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:37,092
Doubtful.

174
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,014
Why don't you let me take you home?

175
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,694
Why would oliver want to relive the
night someone tried to hindenburg him?

176
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,905
We should respect his privacy.

177
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,482
I can't imagine what he was going
through just standing there.

178
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,858
He looks like he didn't even
know the bomb got defused.

179
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,483
But then why is he...

180
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:24,049
oh, my god.

181
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,924
<i>He didn't know.</i>

182
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:30,393
Oliver tried to kill himself.

183
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:32,782
Come on.

184
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,143
And you knew.

185
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,249
How could you keep something
this serious from me?

186
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:58,984
I was trying to protect him.

187
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:01,804
From who? His friends?

188
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,422
Wait.

189
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,931
I didn't think
he wanted anyone to know.

190
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,552
I'm not just anyone.

191
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,661
You lied to me.

192
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,215
You lied right to my face.

193
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,651
You said everything was fine.

194
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:30,413
Nothing about this...
is fine.

195
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:51,970
Let me get this straight.

196
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:55,563
You've no i.d., no witnesses,
and no alibi.

197
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,610
Why should i let a murderer
walk free?

198
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,314
The people she works for...
they came after us, okay?

199
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:05,062
- They shot her.
- Gentlemen.

200
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:09,588
This case just officially
became fbi jurisdiction.

201
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,681
Don't let me keep you.

202
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,036
Fbi.

203
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,162
I thought you could use those.

204
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:19,155
Thanks.

205
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:23,408
I apologize for the way
you've been treated, mr. Queen.

206
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,637
You know who i am?

207
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,672
And we know about the game.

208
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,942
We've been tracking this group
for some time.

209
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,177
Their m.o. Is to target
wealthy individuals

210
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:34,620
and eventually hack
their bank accounts.

211
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:35,994
Really?

212
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:42,121
I never thought i'd be happy
she didn't want me, just my money.

213
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,022
How they seem to get their kicks.

214
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,599
They toy with you, keeping you
distracted while they wipe you out.

215
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:49,718
I suggest that you check
your accounts immediately.

216
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:05,010
Nothing's
been touched. It's all here.

217
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,719
You're lucky.

218
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:10,895
Need you to fill out
some paperwork. Then you can go home.

219
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,050
Thank you.

220
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,529
They're taking everything!

221
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,621
They're draining my accounts!
You hear me?! Come on!

222
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,955
Come on!
Let me out of here!

223
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,013
Come on!

224
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,438
I found the invitation to roulette.
It's only a few blocks away.

225
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,435
I could hear you yelling.

226
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,426
What is all this?

227
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,073
It's game over.

228
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,077
I just got taken.

229
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,354
Oh, my god.
Are you okay?

230
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:38,433
South of there
by a few horror movies.

231
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,809
Someone's been using oliver
as a pawn in their game.

232
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,566
- We need to figure out who.
- Just tell me where to start.

233
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,415
The name of the club is roulette.

234
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,142
He met a woman there named victoria.

235
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:57,789
At the risk of taking a belly
flop into an awkward pool,

236
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,325
what kind of game
puts people through hell?

237
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,682
The kind that starts with being
buried alive and ends with bankruptcy.

238
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:07,648
That was quick.

239
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,536
It looks like the two clues
are one and the same.

240
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:14,130
Meet victoria sinclair,
a.k.a. Roulette.

241
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:18,577
Seems as though she's made
a career out of betting for high stakes,

242
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:20,434
i.e., everything you have.

243
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,367
Get my gear.

244
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:24,849
When you turned your back on us,
i locked up your arsenal,

245
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,983
hoping that one day you would
want it back but not like this.

246
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,622
This is my fight, chloe.
I'll handle it how i see fit.

247
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:32,891
Where'd that line lead you
last night?

248
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:37,221
I got into this mess
on my own. I'll get out the same way.

249
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:40,325
With my lawyers. Okay, scout?

250
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:44,181
He just needs to cool off
a little bit, okay?

251
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:46,227
Right now, you have bigger problems.

252
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:47,951
Trust me.

253
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,207
Now, my relationship with oliver
may have dissolved,

254
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,151
but i didn't lose everything
in the meltdown.

255
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:56,210
Our computers are still linked,
which is how i found this.

256
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:01,191
Oliver was watching this
on his laptop.

257
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:06,124
It's a long story about lois
and laundry and lacy things.

258
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:09,127
- Lois saw this video?
- Not only it, but me on it.

259
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,681
On a scale from one to chernobyl,
how big was the fallout?

260
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,063
Let's just say if there was an antilife
equation, i think i found it.

261
00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:21,663
Check this out.

262
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:27,136
That's the assassin
who attacked lois and i.

263
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,283
I buried her before this video was
taken. How could she be on it?

264
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:34,419
If we're looking
for a kryptonian assassin

265
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:37,589
who's from the future and supposed
to be dead in the present,

266
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:39,572
i'm out of answers.

267
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,562
Maybe jor-el won't be.

268
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:52,122
When you say "close," are you
talking feet or zip codes?

269
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:55,874
Mr. Whatever-your-name-is,
you're a gps tracking service.

270
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,228
You can probably see me
on your satellite,

271
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:01,118
how much farther
down pepper spray lane bdo i have to go?

272
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:04,788
Never mind. I found it.
Thanks.

273
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:20,798
If you're not lost,
then get that way.

274
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:23,201
I don't like smudge marks on my car.

275
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:26,676
Nice try, vice city. Go grand-theft
someone else's auto.

276
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:29,316
I've sat in that excuse
for a front seat enough

277
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,679
to know that this car belongs
to oliver queen.

278
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:34,758
If you know oliver,

279
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:37,249
then you know
he likes to give gifts.

280
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:40,449
This is one of them,
so i suggest you back off.

281
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:44,327
Sorry, but backing off...
not exactly my strong suit.

282
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:46,048
Where's oliver?

283
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,943
I prefer to make my own luck.

284
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,383
I guess your luck hasn't run out.

285
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:23,894
I'm disappointed.

286
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:27,215
You lack the killer instinct
after all.

287
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,791
Toss the gun.

288
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,598
True gamesmen...

289
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,886
they don't cheat
by stacking the deck.

290
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,428
Everything was aces
until your girlfriend showed up.

291
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:54,961
As always, i had to play
the hand i was dealt.

292
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,460
Why don't you just let her go?

293
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,113
You didn't play by my rules.
Why should i play by yours?

294
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:00,919
You were supposed to shoot her.

295
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,387
That's what i don't understand.
You could have killed her yourself.

296
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:07,857
You could have shot me when i walked
through the door. Why set the scene?

297
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,617
One can tie up loose ends
with a simple square knot or

298
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:14,854
one can choose
the more elegant cloverleaf.

299
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:17,389
It's all a matter of style.

300
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,942
I'd say i'm sorry
for taking your money,

301
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:23,138
except, in your case,
it hardly matters.

302
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:25,320
You can't take it with you.

303
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:32,036
How do i know this isn't
just part of your game?

304
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:35,677
Right.

305
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,953
Shoot her.

306
00:30:48,216 --> 00:30:51,064
She knows i won't,
not if there's a chance i'd hit you.

307
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:55,484
Gasoline.

308
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:58,273
I thought i'd torch the place
when we're done.

309
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,056
Clover knot.

310
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,857
I just like playing with fire.

311
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,726
Never bet against the house.

312
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,585
Help! Help!

313
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,385
Help me!

314
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,174
Help!

315
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,874
Oh, hell.

316
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:39,897
Help me!

317
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,888
Look at me.
It's all right, okay?

318
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,757
I'm gonna get you
out of here. Come on.

319
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,764
Why did you come?
You could have left me here.

320
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:54,537
After everything i put you through,
no one would blame you.

321
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,711
I'd blame myself. I don't care
what you did or who you are,

322
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,953
i'm gonna get you the hell
out of here, all right?

323
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:03,253
I'm not gonna let you die.
Now, come on.

324
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:26,352
What the hell is this?

325
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:30,032
You kept asking me
who did this to you.

326
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,768
My question was always the answer.

327
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:35,056
"Who did you destroy?"

328
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,265
I hear you're some sort of hero.

329
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:01,253
One that tried to bury
that part of himself.

330
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,534
You've just proven that that hero
is still alive.

331
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:09,732
Now it's time to resurrect him.

332
00:33:25,993 --> 00:33:28,134
Nice to play.

333
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:37,263
I just started asking myself
who knew about lex,

334
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,901
about toyman.

335
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,977
The things i'd given up,
what i tried to do.

336
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,632
Then it all occurred to me.

337
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,929
Dinah shattered
the glass in the warehouse,

338
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,363
bart rescued me from the car,
victor faked the computers,

339
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:53,146
and watchtower kept an eye
on the whole thing. Right?

340
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,326
You were living like you had
a death wish.

341
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:05,227
You had to face your demons if you
were ever gonna make it out alive,

342
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:08,124
and i had to push you over
the ledge in order to pull you back.

343
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:12,644
Did you have to push
with a 3-ton truck?

344
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,837
I didn't think a tricycle
would be a strong enough point.

345
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:18,130
You're a fighter.

346
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,349
You fought for yourself
and for a second chance.

347
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:27,108
I'm not the only one
you put at risk.

348
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:30,142
If you're worried about our
little club and lex, don't be.

349
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:32,070
I played my cards close to my chest.

350
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,257
And lois was what? She was,
just another ace up your sleeve?

351
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:37,868
No. I never meant
for her to get involved.

352
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,598
She was chasing after you

353
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:41,763
when she accidentally
ended up storming the field.

354
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:43,830
That's when victoria
went off script.

355
00:34:44,024 --> 00:34:45,748
I could have killed her.

356
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,497
No offense to your manhood,
but i made sure that your gun

357
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,170
was loaded with blanks just in case.

358
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,678
I trust you, just...

359
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:55,466
not that much.

360
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:00,094
Did clark know about this?

361
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,515
You can't be serious.

362
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,121
Clark would never in a million years

363
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:08,535
risk what needed to be done.

364
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:13,718
He's led a different life
than we have, hasn't he?

365
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,092
I can't expect him
to know me like you do.

366
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,527
The places that i had sunk to,

367
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:25,249
the depths you must have
had to go to bring me back.

368
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:31,169
Thank you.

369
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:34,082
You proved it to yourself.

370
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:38,097
Even with your face in the gutter,
you still had the hero in your heart.

371
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:45,117
You saved my life.

372
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:48,563
Both the myth...

373
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,313
and the man.

374
00:36:09,422 --> 00:36:11,370
What was that about?

375
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:13,855
I've seen that look before,

376
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,297
usually right before
you sock me in the jaw.

377
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:19,165
Tempted. But if you're unconscious,

378
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,591
you can't answer any questions like
who the hell was that dragon lady?

379
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:27,402
She was a psycho ex-girlfriend

380
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:29,477
who watched "fatal attraction"
too many times.

381
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:31,694
What am i, the bunny?

382
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:36,192
You really need to take a dip in
the sane-chick pool.

383
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:37,883
That dress...

384
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:40,590
that was a bigger red scare
than cold war russia.

385
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:44,701
Although, i thought
you wore it pretty well.

386
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,250
But...

387
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:55,203
you never should have been dragged

388
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:57,129
into this mess i made
of my life, and...

389
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,249
i'm sorry.

390
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:08,333
Was the mess so bad...

391
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,744
that cleaning it up seemed harder
than throwing it all away?

392
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,325
I saw the video.

393
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,693
That's enough to send anyone
on a binge.

394
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:22,822
Why didn't you come talk to me?

395
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,818
Pride.

396
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,422
Fear.

397
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:35,193
And...

398
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,879
regret.

399
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:43,644
The truth is, i've fighting my demons
for so long i just...

400
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:46,262
wanted this war to end.

401
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,315
And you felt...

402
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,749
like there was nothing in life
worth fighting for?

403
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:57,223
I never felt that way
when i was with you.

404
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:01,729
I mean...

405
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:04,774
i just, i think what i mean is i...

406
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:10,874
i lost sight of...
what was good in my life.

407
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:18,280
I know things between you and me
have changed, right?

408
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,407
Some things haven't changed.

409
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:28,679
Ollie, i will always
be here for you.

410
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:34,586
And if you forget that again...

411
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,190
i will knock you out.

412
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:46,994
Now, i believe there's
a certain birthday

413
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,162
tradition we have to uphold.

414
00:38:52,472 --> 00:38:54,353
Ready to get your ass kicked?

415
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:56,577
I'm ready.

416
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:11,790
I've got to stop giving out keys.

417
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:15,434
I take it jor-el knew something
about the alien assassin.

418
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:19,025
He recognized her. It turns out
the symbol tattooed on her shoulder

419
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,908
is her family crest.

420
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,762
Her name's alia.
She's kandorian.

421
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,904
I thought kandor exploded
with the rest of krypton.

422
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:30,784
So did i. But jor-el said if she's here,
there may be others.

423
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:32,849
And they'll have each left

424
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:35,267
a kryptonian symbol
marking their arrival.

425
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:37,370
We better start looking.

426
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:40,631
We can use watchtower
to run a search algorithm that

427
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:44,064
would cross-reference all the satellite
images with my kryptonian lexicon.

428
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:48,368
In other news, oliver's back.

429
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:52,994
It seems like more than
just a cooling off. What happened?

430
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,718
Maybe the scam artist
really did a number on him.

431
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,553
Or he just needed to get
some perspective.

432
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:04,509
Found one.

433
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:14,782
Alia definitely didn't come alone.

434
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:41,162
I heard you were back.

435
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:51,098
You do know, you look absolutely
ridiculous in that, right?

436
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:54,338
And i got a great tailor. Hook you up
with a little color maybe.

437
00:40:57,841 --> 00:41:00,956
Nice to see you finally discovered
something worth living for after all.

438
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,160
Yeah. More like
a rediscovery, actually.

439
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:08,878
You've done a hell of a job
keeping the world safe on your own.

440
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,176
I'm here to help you now.

441
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:13,994
Good.

442
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,559
Something tells me...

443
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,512
soon the world will need
all the help we can get.
