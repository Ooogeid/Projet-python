1
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:14,269
- Please don't send me away, father.
- This is for the best.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,970
Until this war is over,
you'll be safer on Earth.

3
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,283
The journey takes three years!

4
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:22,619
It's the only way. The council
destroyed all the remaining portals...

5
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:25,220
so general Zod and his men
couldn't escape.

6
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:28,337
What if I never see you again?

7
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,779
I'm your father, Kara.
Trust my wisdom.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,757
Everything and everyone
that I love is here on Krypton.

9
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,683
This crystal is your way back to us.

10
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:46,557
As long as you have it, the world
you know and love will be safe.

11
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,648
Why can't you come with me?

12
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:51,868
I'm needed here to protect Kandor.
You must protect the crystal.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,863
It contains instructions for what you must do
when you rescue your cousin Kal-El.

14
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,666
I don't want to go.

15
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:02,456
Remember, Kara, a true Kryptonian
embraces their destiny no matter what.

16
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,594
I love you.

17
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:16,725
You must go now.

18
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,529
Go.

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,172
I love you, Kara.

20
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:04,611
"Somebody save me"

21
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:09,034
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

22
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:13,987
"Somebody save me"

23
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:19,610
"I don't care how you do it"

24
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:24,472
"Just save me, save me"

25
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,290
"Come on"

26
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:29,938
"I've been waiting for you"

27
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,262
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

28
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:44,289
"Just save me, save me"

29
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:47,454
"Come on"

30
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:51,276
SMALLVILLE 7x06 "LARA"
Subtitles subspace

31
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:00,504
Support for the meteor-infected.
This is what was so urgent.

32
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:03,074
Right now, my worries should be
the least of your worries, Clark.

33
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,551
The FAA halted all air traffic
over Washington late last night.

34
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,303
Some commercial airline pilot
reported a near miss...

35
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:12,188
with an object that shot
into the sky in a red-blue blur.

36
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:13,268
No.

37
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:16,454
Yeah, they think it may have
been a ground-to-air missile,

38
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:18,587
but if y ask me,
I think we just found -

39
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,249
Kara.
Chloe, this is all my fault.

40
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:24,620
Clark, you're not the one who
played chicken with an airplane.

41
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,877
Besides, she's not your responsibility.
You're her cousin, not her father.

42
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,281
I pushed her away, Chloe.
I didn't trust her.

43
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,488
And now she's alone and angry.

44
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:34,926
I have to find her and bring her back
before she hurts someone.

45
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,694
Or uncorks the Kent family secret.

46
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,249
I mean, clearly, Kara
does not fly below the radar.

47
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:44,121
Hey, Clark. Did you hear from Kara?
And is she okay?

48
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,926
You guys look worried.
What's going on?

49
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,058
Apparently, Kara decided
to go to Washington, D.C.,

50
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,991
alone, and not tell anyone.

51
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,511
Maybe she's doing the tourist thing.
Postcards are probably already in the mail.

52
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:05,056
You know something, don't you?

53
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,682
Jimmy she's my cousin.

54
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,831
She's my family. If you know
anything, you need to tell me.

55
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:17,580
Kara asked to see a video that Lois took of
some so-called spaceship out in Granville.

56
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:21,033
The recording was ruined, but I managed
to get a partial image of equipment that...

57
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,144
pointed to the government.

58
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:28,453
And you didn't tell us this because...?

59
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,811
Because Kara asked me to keep it a secret.

60
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,507
She trusted me.

61
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,188
I'm sorry, C. K.
She said it was a hobby.

62
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,030
I had no idea that she'd follow
the lead all the way to Capitol Hill.

63
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:46,121
Thanks, Jimmy.
Chloe, if he's right,

64
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:48,600
the government might have Kara's crystal.

65
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:52,174
That's her last tie to Krypton.
She'll do anything to get it back.

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,458
Lionel...

67
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:10,299
- Welcome back.
- Clark. Oh.

68
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,444
I'm glad you're okay.

69
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,086
Yes, well...

70
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,375
In the darkest hour,
the soul is replenished...

71
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:23,828
and given strength
to continue and endure.

72
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:27,547
Luthors are survivors, Clark.

73
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,692
I hear that a new member of the
Kent family has turned up in Smallville.

74
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,058
- My cousin Kara.
- Kara.

75
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:40,383
You haven't mentioned her
before, have you?

76
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:42,283
Which side of the family?

77
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,505
- My father's side.
- Oh.

78
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:46,435
Which father?

79
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:51,008
My adoptive father.

80
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,902
Look, the reason I'm here...

81
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,455
I came across an underground
government lab.

82
00:05:57,611 --> 00:06:00,568
It's located beneath a silo in Granville.

83
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,062
You have a lot of contacts
in Washington.

84
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,269
I thought maybe you could
tell me something about it.

85
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:08,132
What were you doing
in a government lab, Clark?

86
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,375
Researching a story for a friend.

87
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:17,110
I believe that lab in Granville belongs
to the Department of Domestic Security.

88
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,067
Tell your friend that -
Tell her it's not a front-page story.

89
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:24,608
Domestic security?
I thought they dealt with terrorism.

90
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,464
Among other things.

91
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:31,647
You know, Washington has had a wary eye
on the heavens for decades, Clark,

92
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:34,366
watching for any threat
from beyond the stars.

93
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:37,876
I've heard they call
that program Starhawk.

94
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,313
They came to Smallville right
after the second meteor shower.

95
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:45,477
I've done everything I could to
divert their attention away from you.

96
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,302
Why didn't you say anything to me?

97
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,173
Your life is complicated enough.

98
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,899
I understood they were
about to leave Smallville.

99
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:00,886
They'd found no conclusive
evidence of an alien threat.

100
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,764
Do you think that something they discovered,
something in that lab, changed their minds?

101
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:18,538
Tell me everything you know
about Starhawk.

102
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:21,506
Initiating LIVS.

103
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,750
Microscopic analysis almost complete.

104
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:31,559
The LIVS shows crossed pieces...

105
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:38,001
Composition -
Beryllium...

106
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,369
aluminum silicate with fluorine...

107
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:44,704
7% material unknown.

108
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,413
Lock it down.

109
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,088
Give me a full report
as soon as possible.

110
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:02,869
Agent Carter, Mr. Luthor
has entered the building.

111
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,411
Quite the brain trust
you have here, agent carter.

112
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,178
This is a restricted facility.

113
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:17,397
You never told me you stole
something from that spacecraft.

114
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,289
Our work is classified -

115
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:21,562
For reasons of national
security, Mr. Luthor.

116
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:24,752
And you've obviously made
an effort to see it remains secure.

117
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,584
However, the term "classified"...

118
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,205
has never prevented me
from getting what I want.

119
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:32,631
That's right, you've got this...

120
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:36,768
angelic, blond saint watching over you.

121
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,368
In the halls of power,
you don't amount to much, agent.

122
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:50,371
It's only a matter of time before
I find out what it is you're hiding.

123
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,902
Reinitiating sequence.

124
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,655
Yes sir, unlocking containment field.

125
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:23,238
Reinitiating LIBS.

126
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,749
Laser and X-Ray photo-electro-
spectrographic analysis.

127
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:34,237
Starting external scan.

128
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,705
So, they put it to a vote.
You know, the redhead from Langley.

129
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:59,734
I'd rather be out in the field
chasing UFOS than stuck in a lab.

130
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:04,117
...buttons out of samples.
Half the stuff's hazardous.

131
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:05,571
That's what I'm trying to say.

132
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,932
I've been working so hard,
I haven't been able to get a...

133
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:09,374
date.

134
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,237
Nice choker.

135
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:19,154
You, uh, work for Domestic Security?

136
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:23,530
I know I've had a few,
but am I really that obvious?

137
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:25,129
You know what's sexy?

138
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,932
The thought of a government agent
keeping me safe.

139
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,229
I'm not really an agent.

140
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,117
Don't tell me you're just other pencil pusher
from the home office across the street.

141
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:37,622
No, I head up a team
of lab technicians outside the city.

142
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:42,936
But go out in the field a lot.

143
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:44,478
Good.

144
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,078
I was hoping you were hands-on.

145
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,076
Ever investigate anything -
I don't know - Extraterrestrial?

146
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,007
- Excuse me?
- You know,

147
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:59,200
UFOS, aliens, galaxies far, far away?

148
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:04,449
I - I can't really be talking
about what I do.

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,636
Life from other planets -
That's hot.

150
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,388
I would have loved
to have chatted about it.

151
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:12,901
Yeah.

152
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,720
Wait.

153
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:25,581
So, where did you find the ship?

154
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,092
Um, Kansas -
out in the boondocks somewhere.

155
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:32,193
I can't believe that you work
with real flying saucers.

156
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,536
It's such a turn-on.

157
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:38,948
What do you say...
we get out of here?

158
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:42,475
In these spaceships,
ever find anything in them?

159
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,692
We can talk more at my apartment.
It's not too far away.

160
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:48,434
Oh, come on,
secret-agent man,

161
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:53,351
tell me what was in that ship,
and I'll go wherever you want.

162
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:59,040
Oh, it's just some weird crystal.
We're studying it at the lab.

163
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:06,587
Seriously, do you really think that
I can wait till we get to your place?

164
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,350
Well...

165
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,549
Why don't we get
a bit more comfortable?

166
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,446
Hey, where did you...?

167
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,355
Can I help you?

168
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,634
- Yeah, I was hoping I could get a...
- Chloe!

169
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:13,557
Lana?

170
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,829
What are you doing here?

171
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,276
I stumbled across
the Isis foundation website...

172
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:23,774
and saw they were reaching out
to meteor victims.

173
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,869
I - I wanted to see
if I could get an interview.

174
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,372
Do you work here?

175
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,934
You could say that.

176
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:38,749
I actual kind of am the foundation.

177
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:44,009
When did you become such a champion
for the meteor challenged?

178
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,191
Lex ruined lives with 33.1-

179
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,627
Not just his victims,
but their families and friends.

180
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,479
I'm using the divorce settlement
to fight back.

181
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:59,042
Lana, this is a little more impressive
than just writing a check.

182
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:00,788
I mean, this is a major operation.

183
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:05,157
Right now, it's just me in an office. But
eventually, I'd like to open a free clinic,

184
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:08,910
start support groups,
set up a crisis hotline.

185
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,783
I'm so proud of you.

186
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,607
Why didn't you tell me?

187
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:19,532
I don't want anyone to know until I've had
the chance to build this into something real.

188
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:22,430
You're on the web.
You're already out there.

189
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:26,178
I launched the site so that people
that needed help could find me.

190
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:29,035
Grassroots is really
all I want right now.

191
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,053
Chloe...

192
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:34,976
do me a favor
and don't tell Clark, okay?

193
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:38,704
I thought you two were all about
full disclosure now.

194
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,798
Well, you know how he is. He's gonna
think that the work's too dangerous,

195
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:44,205
and he's gonna try
and talk me out of it.

196
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:52,018
Lana, I've interviewed enough people
to know when someone's bending the truth.

197
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,533
And as much as I love
what you're doing,

198
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,968
I'm sensing a right angle
in here somewhere.

199
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,860
That right angle is your imagination.

200
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:06,518
Please, Chloe,
don't tell Clark anything.

201
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:12,687
This conversation
is officially off the record.

202
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,477
Thank you.

203
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,187
- Hey!
- Give me back my wallet.

204
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,448
I will when you tell me the real
location of the crystal.

205
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:33,595
- Who are you?
- It wasn't in the lab.

206
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:36,244
- Where is it?!
- It's there! We never move it!

207
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,287
Let him go, Kara.

208
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,151
Give him his wallet back.

209
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,514
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Congratulations, you found me.

210
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:57,738
Is this the part where you
give me a stern talking to?

211
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,749
You're looking for the crystal,
aren't you?

212
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:02,013
That's my business, not yours.

213
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,166
You nearly took out an airplane, Kara.

214
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,059
Do you have any idea how many
people you could have killed?

215
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,098
My mind kind of wandered.

216
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:15,697
If you continue this way,

217
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:19,271
it's only a matter of time
before you get hurt or found out.

218
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:21,563
Why do you care?

219
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:24,043
You're my cousin, Kara.
I care about you.

220
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:26,202
Well, family believes in one another.

221
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,874
And you betrayed me.

222
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:30,098
You'd rather
talk to anyone else but me.

223
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,676
Kara, I'm really trying here,
but everything I've been told -

224
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:34,003
By who?

225
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:37,064
Your friend,
the Martian manhunter?

226
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:40,526
My father wasn't a traitor.
He didn't try to kill anyone.

227
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:42,979
He was a good man.

228
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:47,107
I'm gonna prove that to you.

229
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:49,470
Forget about the crystal.
It could be anywhere.

230
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:52,962
That crystal is the only thing
I have left from home,

231
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:56,057
- ...but you could care less.
- That's not true.

232
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:59,806
It's always about what you want.
You act like such a hero.

233
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,444
But really,
all you ever think about is yourself.

234
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:05,118
I'm not the one who took off and
didn't tell anybody where I went.

235
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,459
Was I supposed to give you
an itinerary?

236
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,985
We may be cousins,
but I don't have to like you.

237
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,226
Stay out of my life.

238
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,141
I'm not letting you leave.

239
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,935
You don't have a choice.

240
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:48,459
Kara!

241
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,112
You okay?
When did you get back from D.C.?

242
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:53,071
I just flew in.

243
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,952
You know, Clark was looking
for you. He was really worried.

244
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:00,259
You might want to think about diving into
the digital age and use your cell phone.

245
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:01,964
Don't worry about Clark.

246
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,378
Look, I hope you don't mind
me using your computer.

247
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,019
Just thought I'd check some stuff
against The Planet database.

248
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:09,021
No, no,
that's no problem at all.

249
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:11,189
Feel free to rev
your search engine here anytime.

250
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,806
Well, unless you're hacking
into national security networks.

251
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:23,442
Which is exactly
what you're doing.

252
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,675
Kara, this is top-secret information.
They can trace my I.P. address...

253
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,046
and arrest me for this.

254
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,106
No. Not after running it
through a torpark filter...

255
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:33,284
and rerouting it through
half a dozen servers.

256
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,909
You are a very mysterious girl.

257
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,193
I'm trying to find
who entered this one lab,

258
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,774
someone who could have stolen
something from it.

259
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,304
Have you ever heard
of LX Dynamics?

260
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,890
Yeah, they're a
LuthorCorp Defense contractor...

261
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,975
working assignment down
at one of their plants.

262
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,119
As in Lex Luthor.

263
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,250
Here, scoot over, and I will
pull up our file on them.

264
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:13,481
And here...

265
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,195
it is.

266
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:19,415
Kara?

267
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:29,121
ISIS FOUNDATION

268
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,761
I suspected that you a Luthor
were working together.

269
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:26,593
What are you doing?

270
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,053
I've been waiting for the chance
to use these restraints on you.

271
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:33,627
When I saw how that meteor rock
disabled your ship,

272
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,354
I figured it might do
the same thing to the passenger.

273
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,589
Tell your boss
I only want what's mine.

274
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,766
My boss is the United States of America.

275
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,817
We have some questions for you.

276
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,422
- What the hell are you doing?
- Step back, Mr. Luthor.

277
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:52,101
This is a matter of national security.
I said stand down.

278
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:54,683
You better have official
authorization to make an arrest.

279
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,000
- You're being recorded.
- I disabled the feed.

280
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:00,124
- My guards will be here in seconds.
- I disabled them, too.

281
00:21:00,797 --> 00:21:03,802
- What have you done to her?
- I know that you stole something from me.

282
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:04,861
I don't know what you mean.

283
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:08,018
Is it a coincidence you were in my lab
the same day she broke in?

284
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,623
What makes you think
she would break into your lab?

285
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,918
I know you've got my property
hidden somewhere in here...

286
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:16,322
but it doesn't matter anymore.
She's the real prize now.

287
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,643
So blinded by devotion, he couldn't see
the danger that you pose our planet.

288
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:59,203
Clark, it's Lana.
I know where Kara is.

289
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,850
I don't need a frank assessment, senator,

290
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,877
just your assurance Agent Carter
will be fired by morning.

291
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,248
Where's Kara?

292
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:11,082
Take it easy, Clark.

293
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:12,908
Where is she?

294
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:16,305
She was just arrested by the
Department of Domestic Security.

295
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:17,473
I swear to God, Lex, if you're lying -

296
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,108
I tried to stop the agent,
but he got the upper hand.

297
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,294
- I only want to help her.
- I wish I could believe you.

298
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,366
I swear.
She's been taken to a lab in Virginia.

299
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,970
Clark, why would they arrest her?

300
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:44,844
Why are you doing this?
You' hurting me.

301
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,062
Well, if I wasn't hurting you,
you'd be hurting me.

302
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:49,504
We humans - we call it
"survival of the fittest."

303
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:51,260
I am human.

304
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:55,089
Then how did you smash
into an impenetrable vault?

305
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,825
See, I talked to that lab tech,
the one you tried to seduce.

306
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,554
I know it was you.

307
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,190
This machine will reveal the truth.

308
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:08,011
Summerholt's created this technology
to force people to relive their memories.

309
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,725
But it was unstable.
Now, I can control the process...

310
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,419
by delivering the meteor-rock solution
directly into your veins.

311
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:21,130
I want to know
about your home planet.

312
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,472
You're on it.
It's called Earth.

313
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,236
Now...

314
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:29,778
Let's start at the beginning.

315
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:36,546
Where are you from and when did
you first arrive on this planet?

316
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,680
Kara?

317
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,176
Hi, aunt Lara.

318
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:44,049
You followed me?

319
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:46,916
Well, with the speed we have
on this planet, it wasn't hard.

320
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:49,090
Visiting me at home is one thing, Kara,

321
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,419
but sneaking through
the last remaining portal...

322
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,153
to follow me here was far too dangerous.

323
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:56,105
I had to get out of Kandor.

324
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:59,840
The war's been getting worse, and I can hear
the mines being bombed day and night.

325
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,922
Does Zor-El know you're here?

326
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,793
You know my father never
lets me out of Kandor alone.

327
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:09,584
But he's been spending so much time in
the lab that it was easy to sneak away.

328
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,580
Why are you here?

329
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:18,442
I...

330
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:23,640
I wanted to see where
my son may grow up.

331
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:26,357
What? But you don't have...

332
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,746
Wait. You're pregnant?

333
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,562
I'm so happy for you! I know how much
you and Jor-El wanted this!

334
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,119
He's our miracle baby.

335
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,004
I don't understand. I mean,
why would he grow up here?

336
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,339
Kara...

337
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:47,495
Krypton may never
see the end of this war.

338
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:51,446
Jor-El's brain-interactive construct
may very well save us, but...

339
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:54,517
I won't risk my son's life
on that chance.

340
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:58,733
Well, I'll be there,
and I'll protect him.

341
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:04,034
As much as this pains me,
it may be my only choice.

342
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,613
I can't let the destiny of my child
be dictated by the fate of our planet.

343
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:15,307
Well, aren't you worried about
your son growing up with humans?

344
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:18,131
I mean, they're so primitive.

345
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,770
Jor-El visited Earth many years ago,
and he chose this family...

346
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,808
because he was impressed
by their capacity for love.

347
00:25:24,832 --> 00:25:27,494
I hope it's more impressive
than the way that they live.

348
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:29,122
This place is a mess.

349
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:32,658
It's one of many structures,
Kara, it's not the residence.

350
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:35,739
- Come, let me show you.
- Okay, aunt Lara.

351
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:39,606
Amazing.

352
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,651
You were here
before the first meteor shower.

353
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,613
No. I'm hallucinating.

354
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:46,860
No, it wasn't a hallucination.
You came to Earth in 1986.

355
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:49,451
- It's not true! I never-
- Who did you visit?

356
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:52,540
- I didn't. I swear.
- That would be a lie.

357
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:57,953
So, I guess we could use
a little higher concentration.

358
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:05,687
I want you to go back to your first
journey here. Who did you contact?

359
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:07,930
What if we get caught, Lara?

360
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:11,704
Are these people here right now?

361
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:15,967
No, they're attending a spiritual
celebration called church.

362
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:18,572
It's one of their traditions.

363
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,312
Sure smells a lot better in here.

364
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:25,914
I believe they're cooking.

365
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,853
Sunday roast.

366
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:38,821
It is so peaceful here
compared to Krypton.

367
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,912
- It's a true home.
- I don't know.

368
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:45,943
It's kind of small and cluttered.

369
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,202
Careful, Kara.

370
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,866
We must leave no trace of our visit.

371
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:58,682
I don't want to influence them
in any way.

372
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:03,888
They're destined to raise my child.
It's important they feel secure.

373
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,090
Have you given your baby a name yet?

374
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:08,702
No.

375
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:12,896
With everything happening on Krypton
Jor-El and I have yet to discuss one.

376
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,453
He'll be so far from home.

377
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,083
Our sun will be nothing
but a distant star.

378
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,649
Maybe you could name him Kal-El.

379
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:31,375
And that way, when he looks at the sky,
he could think of us.

380
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,247
Kal-El.

381
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,136
Well, that's a beautiful name.

382
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,774
This must be her.

383
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,721
She'll make a good mother.

384
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:54,950
Kara.

385
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,383
Don't you want your son
to have a picture of you?

386
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,701
We better hide it somewhere.

387
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:16,258
Zor-El!

388
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:18,930
Father!

389
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,095
Get away from her!

390
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,458
Oh, my god.

391
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:34,815
You're one of them.

392
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:45,997
I figured there were more of you,
living among us, hiding in plain sight.

393
00:28:46,212 --> 00:28:48,569
She's been exposed too long.
You' killing her.

394
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,691
Extreme measures for extreme times.

395
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,185
I had to push her to her limit to learn
about your dangerous species.

396
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:57,375
If you disconnect her, I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

397
00:28:57,418 --> 00:28:59,623
Yeah, you will -
when I'm done with her.

398
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,606
Kara!

399
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,754
Kara,

400
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:11,370
wake up!

401
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,819
Father!

402
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,875
- Kara, I told you not to leave Kandor!
- It's my fault.

403
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:23,888
I thought Kara could learn something
about the world by coming here.

404
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:27,743
- It's not true.
- Kara, go wait outside.

405
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:32,915
There's no reason to be angry.
You know Kara is safe with me.

406
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:35,200
You always did watch out for her.

407
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,896
In fact, I'm relieved you're here.

408
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,541
We both know our planet
could be destroyed soon.

409
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:45,905
With the end so near,
there's no reason to return.

410
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,949
Stay with me here on Earth.

411
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,979
We could rule this planet
with strength as a family.

412
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,331
No! Jor-El -
He's my husband.

413
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,539
We're having a child...

414
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,305
a son.

415
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,297
Jor-El's blood runs too cold
to be a father.

416
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:12,017
You tried to kill him.

417
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,273
- What does that make you?
- Passionate!

418
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,392
My brother stole you from me.
He took away my life.

419
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:19,594
Jor-El didn't steal me.

420
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,872
He'll never feel the way I feel about you.

421
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,894
I know you love Kara.
I'll love your son as my own.

422
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,754
Zor-el, stop!
You're delusional.

423
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:31,986
We will be together, Lara.

424
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,510
If not here today,
then one day through my science.

425
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,659
Your science?

426
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,365
You -
You stole my DNA?

427
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:47,580
Your strands are safely
stored within a crystal...

428
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:51,985
that, like you, is full
of light and beauty.

429
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,383
I refuse to be your next
science experiment!

430
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:56,765
Oh, you're much more
than that, Lara.

431
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:58,990
Father!

432
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,984
How could you?

433
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:05,059
I told you to wait outside!

434
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,759
- What are you doing?! Stop!
- No!

435
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,386
You will forget everything about this day.

436
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:20,575
Kara?!
Kara, come back!

437
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,397
Kara!

438
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:32,644
Kara.

439
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:38,201
Sorry, Clark, I'd never told you about this
place if I'd known how dangerous it was.

440
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,646
Kal-El.

441
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:00,692
I'm so sorry.

442
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,382
It's okay.

443
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:04,861
Everything's gonna be all right.

444
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:28,609
I don't believe it.

445
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:30,939
After all this time.

446
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:37,642
That means that I really was here,

447
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:41,528
and everything that I saw is true.

448
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,216
When I saw my mother in your memory,
she was so beautiful...

449
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:50,969
just as beautiful as she is
in this picture.

450
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:55,611
You really loved her, didn't you?

451
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:58,152
I did.

452
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:00,838
Just like I loved my father.

453
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:05,951
Until now, I thought he was such a god -

454
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:08,571
a real Kryptonian hero.

455
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:15,222
But you're right,
he was nothing like that.

456
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:19,538
Your father did some terrible things.

457
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:23,729
but in his own misguided way,
I'm sure he loved you.

458
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,474
I don't know what's worse -

459
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:35,306
finding out the truth or
losing who I thought he was.

460
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:44,352
We're not defined by our parents, Kara.

461
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,688
One of the most important things
that my adoptive parents taught me...

462
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:50,422
is that we shape our own destiny.

463
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:56,984
Maybe it's time I stopped holding on
so tightly to my past and...

464
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,235
started looking ahead
to my life on Earth -

465
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:03,252
Find the kind of friends that you have.

466
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:06,870
I'm sorry, Clark. I was so obsessed
with trying to find the crystal...

467
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,835
that it put us both in danger.

468
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,585
I don't blame you for wanting
to find the crystal so badly -

469
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:15,937
especially now that I know
how important it is.

470
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:19,404
I said some terrible things to you.

471
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,438
Things that weren't true.

472
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,359
I'm happy you're in my life, Clark.

473
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,329
Well, I'm happy to be in your life, Kara.

474
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,106
Lara loved you very much.

475
00:34:41,858 --> 00:34:44,081
I'm glad you got to see
my memory of her.

476
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,335
Me, too.

477
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:52,792
I hope I can see her again someday.

478
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,055
Striving for complete isolation?

479
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,656
Dangerous choice.

480
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,439
No man is an island entire of itself.

481
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:19,189
Glad to know your son still ranks a spot
on your busy itinerary.

482
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,105
You know, I tried to use
the LuthorCorp jet the other night,

483
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:24,678
but you'd already taken it
to Washington.

484
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:28,337
I'm amazed you'd be traveling so soon
after your recent ordeal in the woods.

485
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,496
I' got some catching up to do.

486
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,352
Oh, I got a bit of news from my contacts
at the Department of Domestic Security.

487
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:40,851
There's a new girl in town...

488
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:44,743
and apparently,
you are fascinated with her.

489
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:51,175
If you're referring to Kara Kent,
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

490
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:54,295
She just works for me at the Talon.

491
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:58,468
First Lana, now Kara, don't you think
it's time to give up this...

492
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:01,624
fixation with Clark
and everyone connected with him?

493
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:05,939
So, that's it?
Your fatherly advice for the day?

494
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,272
Can't I take an interest
in my son's well-being?

495
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,113
Oh, and which son is that?

496
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:13,712
You spend as much time protecting
Clark as you do pushing me away.

497
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,848
Exactly whose father are you?

498
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:21,873
I wish I could say yours
and be proud.

499
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:24,858
Your treatment of Lana -
Come on, dad...

500
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,018
I learned from watching you with mom.

501
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:33,683
I was just... being a Luthor.

502
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:41,022
I don't know what you're being.
You have crossed a line.

503
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:43,387
Look...

504
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:47,148
I realize your first instinct
is to assume the worst, dad...

505
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,597
but believe me,
I'm not that person anymore.

506
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:53,694
You're right, you're not.

507
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:56,628
These illicit projects of yours-
you hide them like an expert.

508
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:04,505
I'm sure you can fool the people around you.
You can probably fool yourself.

509
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,412
But not me.

510
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:10,978
You can never fool me.

511
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:29,620
I think I owe you an apology
for running off last night.

512
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,189
I know what it's like
to chase a lead, Kara. I just...

513
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:35,592
hate to think that you only
want me for my computer.

514
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:39,189
I know, it just takes a lot to put a
frown on that face of yours James but...

515
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:43,325
I was so focused on tracking down spaceships
that I wasn't much of a friend.

516
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:46,355
You were there for me every time.

517
00:37:50,953 --> 00:37:52,180
- So, you noticed?
- Noticed?

518
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:54,963
If it weren't for you I wouldn't
have had any lead to chase.

519
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:59,526
Well, I don't know, Kara,
I saw how fast you went...

520
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,939
from computers 101 to
hacking the Pentagon.

521
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:07,471
I think you can do just about anything
once you put your mind to it.

522
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:12,532
Well, right now, all I want to do
is treat you lunch.

523
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,572
How about some more Chinese?

524
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,990
I'm getting the hang
of that whole chopstick thing.

525
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,393
I'll go get my jacket.

526
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:20,959
Okay, great.

527
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,755
Whoa.

528
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,512
Hey, you're looking chipper.

529
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,208
Really, I do?

530
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:40,809
It's nothing, it's just a...

531
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,541
beautiful day.

532
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:47,388
You know, even though we're not each
other's automatic plus-one anymore...

533
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:49,677
doesn't mean we still can't be friends.

534
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,224
Are you doing anything for lunch?

535
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,341
Actually, I - I have plans.

536
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,742
With Kara.

537
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:04,553
It's just lunch, Chloe.

538
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:11,526
Look, I know how this is gonna sound,
coming from me, but...

539
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:16,541
you and Kara are from different worlds.
just be careful, okay?

540
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:21,547
Chloe, Kara is from Minnesota.
It's not like she's from another planet.

541
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:31,924
After you.

542
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,916
So, what's the big surprise?

543
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:50,275
I wouldn't have found Kara
if it wasn't for you.

544
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,409
I'm glad you still have
those contacts in the mansion.

545
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:53,951
I'm just glad she's okay.

546
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:57,875
Well, when I found her, Lana,
she gave me this.

547
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,332
It's my birth mother.
Her name is Lara.

548
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:08,561
She's stunning.

549
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:14,644
Clark, this was taken in your house.
When did you -

550
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,586
It's a long story, Lana,
but there is more.

551
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:21,025
I told you I wanted to share
everything with you.

552
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,345
What's in that?

553
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,917
Inside this crystal...

554
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,461
is my mother's DNA.

555
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,621
