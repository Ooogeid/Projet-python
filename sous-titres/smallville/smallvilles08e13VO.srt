1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,167
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,267
You're too late, Kal-El.

3
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:05,637
Lana?

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,790
Miss Lang had a full recovery.

5
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:08,648
Where is she?

6
00:00:08,683 --> 00:00:11,835
Oh, she's already checked out,
but she wanted me to give you this.

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,801
But I knew that if I looked into your
eyes, I'd never be able to say it.

8
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:20,400
If I ever discovered that someone withheld
information that could help me find Lex,

9
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:22,480
I'd be forced to respond accordingly.

10
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:24,001
Nobody questions my loyalty.

11

LUTHORCORP EXEC MISSING

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,142
I can't believe it!
Lana, you're back!

13
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:29,786
Why are you staying?

14
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,190
Leaving is harder
than I thought it would be.

15
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,798
You still haven't told him
the reasons why you disappeared...

16
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,082
and what you plan
on doing next.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,528
Lex saved my life.
I owe him everything.

18
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:44,899
This is how a Luthor rewards
that kind of loyalty.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,564
You've been Lex's eyes and ears
for quite some time.

20
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:53,424
I've done everything.
But not anymore.

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,406
Goodbye, Lex.

22
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,465
What if the rest of the world
didn't have to come first?

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,650
- The world needs you, Clark.
- What about what we need?

24
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:20,166
Sir, it's not too late
to suspend the procedure.

25
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,971
Our orders
are to move forward.

26
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,676
At what cost?

27
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:26,855
I know Mr. Luthor wants to get back
on his feet as soon as possible,

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,849
but we are nowhere near ready
to attempt this on a human being.

29
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:32,757
The studies on mice
have barely even started.

30
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,667
It doesn't matter. Mr. Luthor wants us to
proceed, and that's what we're going to do.

31
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,256
Where are we
with the molecular transfusion?

32
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,500
- Prepared for absorption.
- And the subject?

33
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,641
Vitals normal. We're all set.

34
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,314
Begin the transdermal evisceration.

35
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,587
Stand by.

36
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:10,794
Energizing!

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,377
"Somebody save me"

38
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:42,552
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

39
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,433
"Somebody save me"

40
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,954
"I don't care how you do it"

41
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,921
"Just save me, save me"

42
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,609
"Come on"

43
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:03,608
"I've been waiting for you"

44
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:13,839
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

45
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:17,929
"Just save me, save me"

46
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,709
"Come on"

SMALLVILLE 8x13 "POWER"
Subtitles SubXpacio

48
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:31,201
We thought that we were
meant to be together, Clark.

49
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:35,687
But the truth is,
we were fooling ourselves.

50
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,101
I need you...

51
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,767
but the world needs you more.

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,334
And as long as I'm in your
life, I am holding you back.

53
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,674
Please, don't...

54
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,015
Clark...

55
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:58,092
you know you're bored when you resort
to watching a repeat of your breakup.

56
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:03,843
I needed to remind myself
that Lana left for a reason.

57
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:08,567
Did something happen
that made you suddenly forget?

58
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,434
Last night, we...

59
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:18,263
kind of kissed.

60
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:21,801
I know. It was a mistake.
I don't know what I was thinking.

61
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:25,462
Clark, you're acting like
you committed a crime.

62
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,547
Now, I'm not a lawyer,
but I really don't think...

63
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:30,468
that a little trip to first base
is exactly a felony.

64
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:33,414
But I'm digging up feelings
from the past that need to stay buried...

65
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:34,548
for both our sakes.

66
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:37,132
You know, you have an arsenal
of abilities at your disposal,

67
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:41,357
but suffocating feelings that want to come
up for air definitely isn't one of them.

68
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,385
Lana thought she was holding me back,
and you know what? She was right.

69
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:47,757
Look what happened after she left.
I got off the farm, I got a job,

70
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,633
I started using my abilities to help people
when they needed it the most.

71
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,348
Did you do that
because Lana left

72
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:56,326
or because you simply grew up and realized
what you wanted to do with your life?

73
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:01,408
Clark, maybe she isn't the liability
you're making her out to be.

74
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,970
How does she feel about it?

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,833
It's on that disk.
She doesn't want to be together.

76
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:08,301
She made that disk seven months
ago, Clark. People change.

77
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:10,246
You certainly did.

78
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:13,707
Look, stop playing the guessing
game and talk to her.

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,554
She's probably
at my apartment right now.

80
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,967
Lana?

81
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,872
Clark.

82
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,791
I didn't know it was you.

83
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,301
I didn't realize that breaking and
entering was one of your hobbies.

84
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:47,815
The damage was done when I got here.

85
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,387
Look, I was worried about Lana,
and I came to warn her, but...

86
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:52,419
I was obviously too late.

87
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,134
Warn her about what?

88
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,468
It seems that she's been...

89
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:00,034
poking around some classified
LuthorCorp technology.

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,949
The last time I checked, you
were in charge of LuthorCorp.

91
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:14,489
Everything but the nanotechnology
dedicated to sustaining Lex's life.

92
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,801
The bear may be hibernating,
but that does not mean...

93
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,500
that he's gonna sit around
and let his honey get stolen.

94
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,774
You think Lex is behind
what happened to Lana?

95
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,700
I don't think, Clark. I know.

96
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,140
And I am really concerned for her.

97
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:30,922
Since when did you and Lana
become close friends?

98
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,301
I will forever be grateful to her.

99
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,867
Lana's responsible for finally showing
me the monster that Lex really is.

100
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,408
The least that I can do
is repay the favor.

101
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,705
I knew Lex was still alive.

102
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,534
I had no idea he was capable of
kidnapping Lana from a distance.

103
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,434
It wouldn't be the first time
he's abducted her from afar.

104
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,618
She didn't tell you.

105
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:56,600
Tell me what?

106
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:01,014
Do you remember that DVD
she made for you last spring?

107
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:05,900
Did you ever wonder how Lana got
her hands on a video camera...

108
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,334
right after she awoke
from a deep coma?

109
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:12,533
As long as I'm in your life,
I'm holding you back.

110
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:19,067
Please, for both of us,
don't come looking for me.

111
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,098
I love you, Clark...

112
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:27,577
more than you will ever know.

113
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,734
Now let me go.

114
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,834
It's for your own protection, ma'am.

115
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,453
Is that what Lex told you?

116
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,733
You've been in a coma
for the past three months.

117
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,767
We're here to make sure
you stay safe.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
No! No!

119
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:43,767
No!

120
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,923
Get her in the van.

121
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,092
I'll meet you at the compound.

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,652
That disk was a lie.
Lana never wanted to leave.

123
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:55,403
She left because
she was escaping from you!

124
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:57,434
- Clark.
- You're no better than Lex.

125
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,609
If I had known what I know now,
I would have never been part of it.

126
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,167
Lex convinced us
it was for her own good.

127
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:04,067
How nice of him
to kidnap her.

128
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,067
Lex also said that she was
in that asylum because of you...

129
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:12,285
that your relationship was so dysfunctional
you were constantly hurting her.

130
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,964
Where are you taking me?

131
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,534
To a place where you'll be protected.

132
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,701
Here.

133
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:39,501
Lex has been watching me, hasn't he?

134
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:42,201
Waiting for me to wake up
so he can kidnap me.

135
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,799
Mr. Luthor just wants to help you.

136
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,054
I'm not feeling very well.

137
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,034
You're dehydrated.
You should drink that.

138
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,731
No, I think I'm gonna throw up.

139
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,755
Here.

140
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,633
Wait!

141
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,800
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Just calm down!

142
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,801
Leave the keys in the ignition
and get out of the van. Now!

143
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:46,634
The thugs that Lex used...
he could've used them again.

144
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,433
What are their names?

145
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,667
What are their names?!

146
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,365
They're both dead.

147
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,667
The people Lex employs now
are brand-new,

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,435
without any ties to his past.

149
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,164
What did you got there, Clark?

150
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,369
I'm not sure what it is.

151
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,630
It doesn't seem like Lana's taste.

152
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,548
It's not.

153
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,317
Have you seen this before?

154
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,737
My strategic advisor, Carter Bowfry...

155
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:49,401
it's his.

156
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,721
What did you do with Lana?

157
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,201
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Don't lie to me!

158
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:11,101
I found your medallion
in her apartment!

159
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:16,880
My medallion is right here.

160
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,518
They're exactly the same.

161
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,076
How do you know Lana?

162
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,961
Son, I suggest
you back down right now.

163
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,006
Lana has been kidnapped.

164
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,523
Look, if anything you know
may help me find her, please...

165
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,538
you can trust me.

166
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:42,034
You must be Clark.

167
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:45,219
How do you know my name?

168
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:50,784
I gave Lana that medallion
last spring in Edge City.

169
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:55,380
I don't know how she
tracked me down, but she did.

170
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:59,234
Money means nothing to me.
I'll pay you whatever you want.

171
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,920
I don't need your dollars, ma'am.

172
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,514
I'm just a retired teacher
living off his pension.

173
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,001
A teacher who trained
green berets and navy seals...

174
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:17,268
to withstand extreme pain and torture.

175
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,531
I've done my homework.
I need your help.

176
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,634
What I have to teach,
you're not ready to learn.

177
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,800
You'd be surprised.

178
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:36,631
Please, just give me a chance.

179
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,510
Well, you're not a soldier, and you're
definitely not a government agent,

180
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,840
so why are you here?

181
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,201
I want to be invincible.

182
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,399
Well, good for you.

183
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:53,418
Look... I'm all for girl power,

184
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:57,001
but you're gonna have to go find
yours on your own, okay, sweetheart?

185
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:59,901
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

186
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:07,107
If you help me, I promise
you'll be helping the world.

187
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,534
You were barely under.

188
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,670
It's too cold.

189
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,967
You're weaker than I thought.

190
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah, well, life hasn't exactly
been a walk in the park lately.

191
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:34,001
Oh, poor, poor, pitiful you.

192
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,979
How long have you been
feeling sorry for yourself?

193
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:39,412
Let me guess.

194
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:41,764
Your entire life.

195
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,834
- You tortured her?!
- I trained her.

196
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:55,801
- That's how she came back stronger.
- She's always been strong.

197
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,834
Now she's missing because of you.

198
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:01,767
All I did was help her get over the
one thing that was holding her back.

199
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,934
- What are you waiting for?
- Just not used to scorching myself.

200
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,820
Get used to it.

201
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,672
No fear, no pain.

202
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,513
I can't.

203
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,901
It's not fear
that's stopping you, is it?

204
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,871
You're holding on to something...

205
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:46,903
or someone.

206
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,434
Do you see anyone else here?

207
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,433
Oh, I can feel him.

208
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,634
So can you.

209
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,101
As long as you're trying
to be someone you're not,

210
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:59,229
you are gonna be vulnerable.

211
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:01,648
You are gonna feel the pain.

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,900
What's the name?

213
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,466
His name's Clark.

214
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,601
And if I had an ounce of his strength...

215
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:13,401
I'm not training you
to be like someone else.

216
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,168
I'm training you
to be Lana Lang,

217
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,734
to rise from the ashes
of your previous life,

218
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,059
stronger, more powerful...

219
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:26,685
fearless.

220
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,334
It's time to rise.

221
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,467
You don't look ready for class.

222
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,101
Carter, I have learned
so much from you,

223
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,518
but what I need,
I- I can't get it here.

224
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,833
What you need are skills, Lana...

225
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:29,967
maturity.

226
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,236
I need power.

227
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,827
And you'll have it.

228
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:42,736
But it just doesn't happen overnight.

229
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,534
I've had it before...

230
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:48,666
skills and abilities
beyond what you can imagine.

231
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:53,268
But I wasn't ready for them
physically, mentally, or emotionally.

232
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,449
And now, thanks to you, I am.

233
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:04,955
This thirst for power, Lana...
I've seen it before.

234
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:09,500
Most of the time,
it doesn't have a happy ending.

235
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:19,199
Well...

236
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,034
before you fly off
to change the world...

237
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,067
- I've got something for you.
- I don't deserve it.

238
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:38,582
Take this so you'll always remember.

239
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:43,596
As you rise higher and higher,
never look down.

240
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,714
After Edge City, where'd she go?

241
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,562
Metropolis.

242
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,619
She was so full of hope.

243
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:05,125
Wanted to imprint this stamp
of positivity on the world.

244
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,735
I couldn't let anything
happen to her.

245
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,068
After all the death and destruction
I've been responsible for,

246
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,504
Lana was my chance at redemption,
so I tracked her down.

247
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,068
When you found her,
what was she doing?

248
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:17,965
Investigating LuthorCorp.

249
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,034
I told her to put it in the past,
but she wouldn't listen to me.

250
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:22,300
So I joined her cause.

251
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:26,278
Keep an eye on her. And I
got this job on the inside,

252
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:29,131
feeding Lana information
while I advised Tess Mercer...

253
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,734
on defense-contract strategies.

254
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,925
Did Lana contact anyone else
when she was in Metropolis?

255
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:40,446
A blond woman.

256
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,825
They went to high school
together in Smallville.

257
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,500
- Chloe?
- Sullivan.

258
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,517
Sir, she's barely alive.

259
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:59,083
It's the only way to apply the nanites.

260
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,048
Begin the grafting.

261
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:12,094
Applying the Prometheus layer.

262
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:47,327
The cloak-and-dagger existence
suits you well, Regan.

263
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:53,615
So, how's your new career,
breaking and entering?

264
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:57,188
Did you find what you were looking
for in Lana Lang's apartment?

265
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,603
Still looking, just like you.

266
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,141
Only I'm trying to find the
technology to keep Lex alive,

267
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,027
not to destroy it.

268
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,948
The world already believes he's dead.

269
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,457
I'm just trying to make
a fantasy a reality.

270
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,755
You actually believe you can
declare Lex Luthor dead...

271
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:17,634
and not end up dead yourself?

272
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,284
You're a pretty pathetic
guard dog...

273
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:23,532
loyal to a master
that can't even feed himself.

274
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,861
Why don't you come
and work for me?

275
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:32,935
I'll give you more milk-bones
than Lex ever did.

276
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:36,635
I think I'd rather shovel cow dung.

277
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,470
Oh, you see, it's not really a choice.

278
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,815
Once you discover the Prometheus
technology, I want you to bring it to me.

279
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,961
I'm afraid that...

280
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,236
you're gonna be waiting
a long, long time.

281
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,847
Find me the Prometheus technology,

282
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:07,730
or I'll have to take it... by force.

283
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,133
Regeneration complete, Dr. Groll.

284
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,859
Pull her out and get her quarantined.

285
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:47,679
Clark, no more superscares, please.
I'm this close to a cardiac arrest.

286
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:48,954
Why didn't you tell me?

287
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:50,885
So now I'm keeping secrets
I didn't know I was keeping.

288
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,671
Lana.

289
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,360
How could you not tell me
you spoke to her?

290
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,830
Because she asked me
not to.

291
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:00,977
I have to respect that.

292
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:05,117
Now it looks like your respect
may have gotten her kidnapped.

293
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,277
What?

294
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:07,866
Chloe, if I'd have known
what she was doing,

295
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,526
I could have stopped her
before she got hurt.

296
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:12,576
I wasn't about to betray her trust, Clark,
just like I would never betray yours.

297
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,387
You of all people
should understand that.

298
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:16,386
This is different, Chloe.

299
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:19,915
I have abilities. I can take
care of myself. Lana can't.

300
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:27,153
Look, Chloe, all that matters
now is finding her.

301
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:31,358
Please, you have to tell me
everything she said to you.

302
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,793
Okay, first of all, just so you know,
she didn't come back to see me.

303
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:40,054
She was on a mission.

304
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:47,240
Am I hallucinating, or is that the
long-lost Lana Lang in front of me?

305
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,832
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi!

306
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,380
Oh, my god, I thought I'd never
see you again. Now you're back.

307
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:58,037
Actually, I'm only here
for a short stay.

308
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:03,147
I am so impressed with what
you've done with Isis, Chloe.

309
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:07,043
You've turned my dinky little operation
into a place that really helps people.

310
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:09,576
I'm just carrying on
the torch you lit.

311
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:13,467
In other late-breaking news,
I'm getting married next month.

312
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,851
That is a huge headline.

313
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:19,240
I am so happy for you.

314
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,255
You two make a perfect couple.

315
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,501
Speaking of which,
does your short stay...

316
00:24:24,557 --> 00:24:26,904
include a pit stop
at the Planet to see Clark?

317
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:29,727
Uh, not this time.

318
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:34,892
But I read about the red/blue blur
saving the citizens of Metropolis.

319
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:39,288
I've got to say that, when I saw that
article, it brought tears to my eyes.

320
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,489
I am so proud of him.

321
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,046
Lana...

322
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,685
I know
that you miss all of us,

323
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,154
but something tells me there's
more to your trip back home...

324
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,426
than simply checking in
with the old gang.

325
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,209
I actually came back here to
find out more about project Ares.

326
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:04,068
Project Ares... wasn't that Lex's scheme
to genetically enhance injured soldiers?

327
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,185
Using alien DNA.

328
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,726
Lana, this is all in the past.
Lex is out of your life now.

329
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,641
Why don't you just put this
behind you and move on?

330
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,935
I am moving on.

331
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,198
Really?

332
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:22,655
Because it seems to me like
you're not just playing with fire,

333
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,562
you're stepping
into a raging inferno.

334
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:29,415
- Clark should know about this.
- I plan on telling Clark...

335
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,401
when the time is right.

336
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:36,939
Chloe, I want you to promise me
that you won't say a word.

337
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,748
I can take care of myself now.

338
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:46,207
All I did was honor
my friend's secret.

339
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:48,360
And now I feel like
this is all my fault.

340
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,261
That must have been
the way she wanted it...

341
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:53,894
so she could do what she had to do
without anyone getting in her way...

342
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:55,348
especially me.

343
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,324
Did you check on project Ares
after she left?

344
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,786
Yeah, it turns out the project
was mothballed over a year ago,

345
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,249
even before Lex
went missing.

346
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:04,978
Tess Mercer told me Lana's been looking
into technology that could keep Lex alive.

347
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,450
She thinks that Lex abducted her.

348
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:09,239
Since when are you trusting what the
first lady of LuthorCorp has to say?

349
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:10,946
Since she came clean with me.

350
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,485
She told me when Lana made that
disk, she was being held at gunpoint...

351
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,448
by a team of Lex's men led by Tess.

352
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,394
Wait, Clark.

353
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,275
If Lana didn't make that disk on her own,
then why didn't she come home to you?

354
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,896
She was too busy
planning her revenge on Lex.

355
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:31,412
Chloe, I need to find Lana before
she does something she'll regret.

356
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:47,064
That's a ballsy move,
sitting in the boss's chair.

357
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:52,206
Either you have good news for me, or you
like to live dangerously close to the edge.

358
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:05,434
I guess it's the latter.

359
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,235
He did have good news
for you...

360
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,454
the address of the Prometheus lab.

361
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,477
Unfortunately, he told me first.

362
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,400
So working for Lex gives you
carte blanche to kill innocent people?

363
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,511
Innocent?

364
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,372
He worked for you, Tess.

365
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:31,499
Give a mid-level bureaucrat a little bit
of power, and it goes straight to his head.

366
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,451
You're the expert.

367
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:37,828
You know, I actually
used to be envious of you.

368
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:40,714
Of course, that was before
I found out Lex was using you...

369
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,367
as his eyes and ears.

370
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:48,255
I happen to have
my own eyes and ears,

371
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,179
hidden in the security cameras
in this office.

372
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:54,013
Not only did they record
your illuminating conversation...

373
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:58,156
with my security guard,
but also his tragic murder.

374
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:00,501
Yeah.

375
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:04,841
But that footage is nothing compared
to the memorable moments I saw.

376
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:09,015
Lex was nice enough to let me
catch some of your, uh...

377
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,248
highlights.

378
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:16,465
I'll make sure a few of them
make it into your obituary.

379
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,733
There's a classified LuthorCorp
project called Prometheus,

380
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:30,663
but now that I'm Brainiac-free, I
couldn't even begin to hack the firewall.

381
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:37,477
You said the first time
is radiator.

382
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,922
Yeah, I think so, but I don't know
what the building's heating system...

383
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:43,142
has to do with any of this.

384
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:01,776
Whoa.

385
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:05,309
Looks like Lana's got
her very own secret stash.

386
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:23,565
She obviously didn't want to leave
any of the good stuff on my gigabytes.

387
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:29,271
Why do I feel like
I'm cracking open her diary?

388
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:32,420
It might be the only way
we can save her, Clark.

389
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,874
- Who's this guy?
- Edward Groll.

390
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:44,024
He's been with LuthorCorp
since the first meteor shower.

391
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,180
If they gave out PHDs
in all things alien,

392
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,288
this guy
would definitely have one.

393
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,936
I know you were involved
with project Ares.

394
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:58,226
But more importantly, I found
out you designed Prometheus.

395
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:02,223
I want to commend you. That
is an amazing achievement.

396
00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:05,190
You must be mistaken,
Mrs. Luthor.

397
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:07,176
It's Ms. Lang.

398
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:09,279
That will never change.

399
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:15,557
I promise, doctor, I don't intend
on destroying your technology.

400
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:18,345
I want to put it to good use.

401
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,581
I'm an academic. I hold the chair in
biophysics at Metropolis university.

402
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,280
Where you designed and built
a meta-dermal skin graft

403
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,871
that will not only sustain
Lex's health...

404
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:30,677
but will give him
superhuman abilities.

405
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,846
Superhuman abilities?

406
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,662
Have you taken up
reading comic books?

407
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:41,109
For someone intelligent enough...

408
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:45,228
to harness alien DNA
into the ultimate power suit,

409
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:48,145
you are dangerously naive.

410
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,481
What good will your technology
do in the hands of a madman?

411
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:56,129
You and I both know that Lex
is too dangerous to wear it.

412
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,580
But I can.

413
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:03,050
I'm sorry, Miss Lang. I don't
have time to discuss fictitious...

414
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:07,073
If Lex ever puts on that suit,
he will corrupt its power.

415
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:11,667
He will become a god among men,
and the world will never recover.

416
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,703
Do you want your legacy to be allowing
Lex Luthor to become the ultimate weapon?

417
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:24,778
Or do you want to be remembered
for saving people's lives?

418
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,800
For improving the human
condition all over the world.

419
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:33,889
I have a space in east metropolis...

420
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:37,433
in a warehouse on 95th and
Bristol. You can set up your lab.

421
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:39,857
It's not just me.

422
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,260
I work with a lab full of researchers.
They'd never allow it.

423
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,131
Tell them it was on Lex's orders...

424
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,018
that he wanted me to be the guinea pig.

425
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:54,572
It's not so far-fetched, is it?

426
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:03,226
I don't think
she was kidnapped, Clark.

427
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:09,509
Lana doesn't want to destroy
the technology.

428
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,404
She wants to use it
on herself.

429
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:34,872
Thank god.
Her blood pressure's rising.

430
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:37,329
For now.

431
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:41,180
The machines
are what's keeping her alive.

432
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:43,302
She's going to be fine.

433
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,104
She has to be.

434
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,025
Where's the Prometheus suit?

435
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:55,075
Stop!

436
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,649
Don't enter that chamber.

437
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:58,695
Any contaminant could kill her.

438
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,160
Her?

439
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,102
Lana.

440
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:13,533
It was Lex's orders.

441
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:19,219
Prometheus must be destroyed.

442
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:24,897
It's too late. You can't destroy
the suit without murdering her.

443
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:31,411
Lana Lang was born
to be a martyr.

444
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:33,276
No!

445
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:43,165
You will never be able
to help Lex Luthor again.

446
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:28,087
You find her before she finds me.

447
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,646
This woman is lethal.

448
00:35:56,967 --> 00:36:00,587
Lana, you got to believe me,
I didn't know you were in there.

449
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:05,395
Yes, you did.

450
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm not here to hurt you, Tess.

451
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,737
I'm here as your friend.

452
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,274
My BFF who tears open
my safe with her bare hands...

453
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,903
and burns
all of my research?

454
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:24,179
I think that you're stretching the
definition of friendship just a little bit.

455
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:30,518
I don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

456
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:35,834
I know how much you want to get
revenge on Lex, and who can blame you?

457
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,955
I have felt that exact same rage.

458
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:43,900
He didn't implant a microchip
into your brain.

459
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:47,980
All that anger will lead you
down a long tunnel...

460
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:50,764
that you will never
find your way out of.

461
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,673
Yeah, that's a really
easy position to take...

462
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,713
when you're clad
in an invincible suit.

463
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,413
I didn't put the suit on
for protection.

464
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:10,417
I did it so that I could actually
do some good in the world.

465
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:19,319
You are an amazing woman, Tess.

466
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,698
But it's hard to see when
you're stuck in the dark shadow...

467
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,834
of an even darker man.

468
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:28,828
Why do you think I want Lex gone?

469
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,752
You may have gotten rid
of the microchip...

470
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:38,402
but every second
that you're consumed by hate...

471
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:42,088
is another second
Lex is still in control of you.

472
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,673
Don't be a victim anymore.

473
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:19,484
Kent.

474
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,637
What are you doing
rising before the roosters?

475
00:38:21,872 --> 00:38:23,806
Couldn't sleep.

476
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,929
Clark.

477
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,786
Meet me up on the rooftop.

478
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,626
Lana!

479
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:43,571
I've been looking all over
for you. Are you okay?

480
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:46,330
I've never felt better,
Clark.

481
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,174
It's because you're wearing
that suit, Lana.

482
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,361
You have powers,

483
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,704
and the last time that happened,
it didn't end well.

484
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:56,063
I'm different now.

485
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,766
This time
I've prepared myself.

486
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:03,817
Those months that you were gone, why
didn't you tell me what you were doing?

487
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:06,718
You would have never
let me go through with it.

488
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:08,719
Because it's dangerous, Lana.

489
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:11,108
It's never been tested
on humans.

490
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,420
Give Lex credit
where credit is due.

491
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:15,750
When it comes
to all things scientific,

492
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:19,871
he's pulled off the impossible
on more than one occasion.

493
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:24,066
Clark, you don't
have to protect me anymore.

494
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,708
You don't have to
worry about me.

495
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:28,486
How can you say that, Lana?

496
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:30,179
We have no idea
what's gonna happen.

497
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:31,743
Exactly.

498
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:34,646
And that's why it's so important
to live in the present.

499
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,822
Whatever happened in the past

500
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:41,118
and whatever happens
in the future,

501
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:42,605
it doesn't matter.

502
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,389
It does matter, Lana.

503
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,228
It matters if you get hurt.

504
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:53,152
I know how much
you care about me.

505
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,063
You always have.

506
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,938
That's why when I came back
for Chloe's wedding, I...

507
00:40:02,173 --> 00:40:05,086
I didn't think
we could be together.

508
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,993
Clark...

509
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:11,048
the last thing I wanted was to be
some distraction in your life.

510
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,531
You're not a distraction.

511
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:17,894
You never were.

512
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:22,674
I'm not anymore.

513
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:28,306
Clark, nothing can hurt me anymore.

00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:31,722
You and I are equals now, and together,

515
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,282
we can help make
the world a better place.

516
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:43,948
Unless that's not
what you want.

517
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,429
No, Lana,
that's exactly what I want.

518
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:52,047
But it's a dream, Lana.

519
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:55,761
We both know dreams
normally don't come true.

520
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:04,340
There's never been
anything normal about us.
