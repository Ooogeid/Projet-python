1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,047
Previously on"smallville"...

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:05,700
I have to run faster interference on
these mysterious good-Samaritan reports.

3
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:07,239
Well, that just means i'm doing my job.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,897
And it's just a matter of time
before someone discovers that.

5
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:14,164
This crystal is the only clue that
we have, so find me lex luthor.

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:16,032
Clark, do you know what this is?

7
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,631
Tess mercer has it.

8
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:19,640
That's the computer she
wants me to hack into.

9
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:22,357
Maybe i could take a look
at that supercomputer.

10
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,359
It was stolen.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,992
Only a handful of people
knew about that device.

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,715
When i find out who has
it, i'm taking it back.

13
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,922
You're reading all this, aren't
you? This is all because of brainiac.

14
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:36,520
After he attacked me, my hacking
skills went from analog to digital.

15
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:38,384
- We don't know what can happen.
- Exactly!

16
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,670
So let's not worry about
it until we have to.

17
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,234
What's the status on
the black creek facility?

18
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:46,394
Completely dismantled, and the
guests have been re-Assimilated.

19
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,686
Lionel luthor killed my parents.

20
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:51,602
Did you know about this?

21
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:57,185
Oh, i'm just trying to corroborate my new
theory. Metropolis' very own mystery hero.

22
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,809
I'm gonna prove that
this guy exists, c.K.

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,387
He's out there.

24
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,229
I write news stories,
not fairy tales...

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,156
Especially ones about mythical
saviors that no one's ever seen.

26
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:21,861
Look, i may not have a name
or a face to connect him with,

27
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:25,261
But i am telling you, this stealth
crime fighter is as real as it gets.

28
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:29,534
The only stealth crime fighter i know about
wears green leather and plays with arrows.

29
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,790
And i think he's hung up his bow.

30
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,527
Lois, this guy is light-Years
beyond bows and arrows.

31
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:40,353
Trust me... this is the kind of
story that careers are made of.

32
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:43,077
Well, without a photo, that
story is about as relevant

33
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:45,358
As a five-Part exposé
on the tooth fairy.

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,796
I bet you clark won't feel that way

35
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:48,930
After i pitch him the
story over dinner tonight.

36
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,487
Oh, clark is coming to dinner with us?

37
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:58,740
Yeah, i had a feeling you were too much
of a cynic for such an uplifting piece.

38
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,047
But, hey, c.K. Will be all over this.

39
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,660
I wouldn't be so sure.

40
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:05,374
As shocking as it might
seem, smallville is no hack.

41
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:11,217
Wait a minute. Did i just hear
you give clark kent a compliment?

42
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,371
Give me the purse!

43
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,051
You're robbing the wrong chick.

44
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:25,779
Jimmy! Get a picture of his face!

45
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,741
I knew i got a good lick in.

46
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,380
Oh, my god.

47
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:13,692
It's him.

48
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,868
Smallville 807

49
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:22,811
Synchro : flolo

50
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,325
For seriessub.Com

51
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:17,544
Hey, jimmy.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,862
C.K., have i been dying to talk to you.

53
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,337
You said it was urgent.
Is everything okay?

54
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:23,864
Everything is beyond okay, clark.

55
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:26,483
Once you see this picture that i took last
night, your life will never be the same.

56
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:27,532
You might want to sit down.

57
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,091
I think i'll stand.

58
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,152
What am i looking at?

59
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,088
Well, it's a... it's a person.

60
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,356
What, this blur?

61
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,425
Well, he's just moving so
fast that he's out of focus.

62
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:00,199
Jimmy, it looks like a, um...

63
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:02,332
It looks like a reflection
in the lens to me.

64
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,618
Maybe there was a police car
driving by with red-And-Blue lights.

65
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,276
In the middle of a mugging? Don't you
think that they would have stopped?

66
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:11,158
Well, it's not a person. They can't
move that fast. It's not possible.

67
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,228
A few years ago, i would
have agreed with you.

68
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,153
But you have to admit, we both have seen our
fair share of the bizarre and unexplained.

69
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:20,716
And what about lois? She's
the one who's supposedly saved.

70
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,434
Don't you think it's weird she didn't
say anything about it last night?

71
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,281
Not...really.

72
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,940
I mean, she's a naysayer, a nonbeliever.

73
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,945
She swears that it's her lightning-Fast
reflexes that came to her rescue.

74
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,833
So you're saying this blur saved lois from
becoming roadkill and she didn't feel a thing?

75
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:37,303
See, that's how good he is.

76
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,047
I mean, does this have "front
page" written all over it or what?

77
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,575
Jimmy, there's no way

78
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,045
That tess is gonna publish
an out-Of-Focus photograph.

79
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,369
I wouldn't even bother showing her.

80
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,247
Too late... caught her in the elevator,
and she seemed mighty interested.

81
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,642
She even agreed to
let you write the copy.

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,480
Jimmy, don't you think you should have
asked me if i was interested first?

83
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:57,715
Clark, i was doing you a favor.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,791
I mean, this is a huge story.

85
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,091
Look, i've been stuck in lois' shadow
ever since i landed at the planet,

86
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:05,865
And i'm pretty sure the
same is true for you.

87
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,593
It's time that we made
names for ourselves.

88
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:11,146
Jimmy, i'd rather be stuck
in lois lane's shadow than...

89
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:14,035
Than be in the spotlight
for some make-Believe story.

90
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:16,585
Just...think about it, okay?

91
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,544
And whatever you do, just
keep it on the down-Low.

92
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,656
If lois does get wind of this, she's gonna
be all over it like a pit bull on a poodle.

93
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,459
Don't worry.

94
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,161
I won't tell a soul.

95
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:30,612
Thanks.

96
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:39,266
How does a violent criminal walk free?

97
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:43,164
Yes, i've heard of bail...
for jaywalkers or shoplifters,

98
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:45,217
Not muggers who almost killed me.

99
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:48,371
I hope you realize that i will
personally take this up with the mayor.

100
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:49,639
Hello?

101
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,888
There she is.

102
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:56,012
The legendary lois lane.

103
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,952
I know you from somewhere, don't i?

104
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,024
I think i'd remember a face like yours.

105
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:04,655
You knew my name.

106
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,625
Sebastian kane... new city reporter.

107
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:16,291
Are you on crack, detective?

108
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,254
How does a violent criminal walk free?

109
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:24,572
Well, if you like covering robbery and
homicide, you've come to the right place.

110
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:28,247
The crime rate's so high, there's actually
a "no vacancy" sign in front of county jail.

111
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,459
Really?

112
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,084
Metropolis seems like a safe haven
compared to some of the places i've covered.

113
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,379
Really? Like where
... the gates of hell?

114
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:37,920
Iraq.

115
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,834
Northern mosul.

116
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:42,567
I was an embedded journalist
when the first troops went in.

117
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,710
You must have seen some
pretty graphic imagery.

118
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,626
A little more than i bargained for.

119
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,730
Well, i've been pretty
much embedded since birth.

120
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:56,318
I'm an army brat. No actual combat.

121
00:07:57,146 --> 00:08:00,564
But if you'd met my dad, you'd
be surprised i made it out alive.

122
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,531
In that case, you know what it
feels like to be the new kid.

123
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:06,635
This is my first time in metropolis.
I still haven't quite got my bearings.

124
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:08,595
You know what you need?

125
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,684
Lois lane's guide to
surviving the big city.

126
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,496
I know all the tips and tricks.

127
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,158
Well, i got an idea. Why don't i
take you out for dinner tonight?

128
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,005
You can share some of those secrets.

129
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:26,380
Well, my calendar's
pretty chock-Full, but...

130
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,996
I may just happen to be free tonight.

131
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,789
Perfect.

132
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:55,264
Why so sad?

133
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,321
Don't ever touch me again.

134
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,691
So, did lane steal that crystal?

135
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,899
It takes a little more than a handshake.

136
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,879
Well, then i guess you're gonna
have to get a little more intimate.

137
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:18,609
It's already in the works,
but not under your employment.

138
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,391
I'm done being your
personal peeping tom.

139
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:27,977
For a memory thief, your own
recall is surprisingly spotty.

140
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:32,487
Do i need to remind you that i'm the
one that released you from black creek?

141
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,754
That without me, you'd still
be staring at four gray walls,

142
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,000
Waiting in vain for your freedom.

143
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,546
That favor's been repaid
three different times.

144
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:44,690
This woman lois... she's a good person.

145
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm not gonna steal her memories.

146
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,474
That's unfortunate.

147
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:52,054
Because i'm one of the
few people that know

148
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,768
What a sick, voyeuristic
predator you really are...

149
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:58,710
About the women that you stalked and
killed before you ended up in black creek.

150
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:00,912
Those things i did...

151
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,539
That was before i could
control my abilities.

152
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,020
I want a fresh start.

153
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:12,772
You'll get it.

154
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:14,945
You will.

155
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,612
When you find me that crystal.

156
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:28,123
Or i'll have to place a call to
my friends in law enforcement...

157
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,054
Tell them about the trail
of bodies in your wake.

158
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:42,346
- So, i'll talk to you next weekend, okay?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,544
I need to talk to you.

160
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,001
About jimmy's latest
and greatest snapshot?

161
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,377
You deleted it, right?

162
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:52,499
Not yet. I wanted to talk to you first.

163
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,302
What's there to talk about?

164
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:57,225
I'm not gonna let my picture land
on every doorstep in metropolis.

165
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,722
It's not like anyone's gonna
be able to tell it's you, clark.

166
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,478
You're practically just
a smudge on the lens.

167
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,149
But it is me. People
will know i'm out there.

168
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:08,892
And why is that such a bad thing?

169
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:13,076
I know that this is gonna sound
totally insane, but think about it.

170
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,610
We live in dangerous times,

171
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,079
And for people to know that
there is someone out there,

172
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,940
Someone dedicated to saving lives?

173
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,663
I mean... that could really mean a lot.

174
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,781
That sounds great, chloe,
but it's not that simple.

175
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:25,913
This is my secret we're talking about.

176
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,909
If people find out, it's
dangerous not only for me,

177
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,453
But it's a threat to
everyone who knows me.

178
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,001
Well, i wouldn't say anything
if i wasn't absolutely sure.

179
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,789
You need to talk to
jimmy, get him off this.

180
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,479
You're the only one
he's gonna listen to.

181
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,827
Jimmy is giving you a perfect alter ego.

182
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,145
It's called an alias, clark.

183
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,845
Writers have been
writing under pen names

184
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,979
Since the invention of the alphabet.

185
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,837
Oliver queen has the green arrow.

186
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,037
I think it's time for you
to have one of your own.

187
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:53,928
This isn't a debate, chloe.
We need to protect my identity.

188
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:59,071
Look, when it comes to your secret,
i've never gone against your wishes.

189
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:02,349
And i understand what a
huge leap this is for you.

190
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:06,515
But that picture doesn't reveal
anything about clark kent.

191
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,685
It simply gives the world something
that they desperately need right now.

192
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:14,844
A hero.

193
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,097
Kent.

194
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:31,601
You know, for a cub reporter, you tend
to step into the lion's den quite often.

195
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:33,209
I hope it's urgent.

196
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:35,970
Look, i'm not sure where
jimmy olsen got the idea

197
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,712
That i wanted to write his good-Samaritan
story, but i'm not interested.

198
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:40,607
"Not interested."

199
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,875
In a potential front-Page story.

200
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,801
Makes me wonder what you
would be interested in.

201
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,725
Well, it just doesn't feel right to
put my name on some manufactured story

202
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,688
That's based on an
out-Of-Focus photograph.

203
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,423
From what i remember, the only
thing out of focus on that photo

204
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,193
Was our red-And-Blue
white knight.

205
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,192
But you can't even tell who it is.

206
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,263
- You can't even tell what it is.
- Exactly.

207
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,435
That's what makes it so brilliant.

208
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,923
It's mysterious, tantalizing,

209
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,156
Full of hope and just a hint of danger.

210
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,696
And i'm sure it'll sell
a lot of newspapers,

211
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,978
But to do it by running
a tabloid picture?

212
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,389
I doubt that's even
something lex luthor would do.

213
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,935
I'm not gonna listen to some
lecture on journalistic excellence

214
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:24,635
From a reporter whose biggest by-Line
concerned a kitten-Adoption fair.

215
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:27,376
Okay, you asked to be
taken off the story.

216
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:30,171
- I have no problem with that.
- It's not a story.

217
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:34,437
No, you're right. It's a tease.

218
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:37,987
But jimmy olsen tells me he's
up to his elbows in research,

219
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,335
And with a few more leads,
we'll have a face and a name.

220
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:45,899
When that happens, then
we'll have the real story.

221
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,075
Smallville?

222
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,787
What are you doing here?

223
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,749
Lois. I didn't realize you were here.

224
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,481
- I was just...
- Rifling through jimmy's things?

225
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:12,623
No.

226
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,149
He left his bag here.

227
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:19,145
I was in the neighborhood, so i thought
i'd do him a favor and pick it up for him.

228
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,791
What, so now you're jimmy's errand boy?

229
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,685
I'm his friend.
Anything wrong with that?

230
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,701
Nothing. But, ooh!
Could you do me a favor?

231
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,845
Zip.

232
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,719
Where are you going all dressed up?

233
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,987
Little thing called a date.

234
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,100
I know you're fresh off the farm,

235
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:01,537
But sometimes, when a guy
likes a girl, he asks her out.

236
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,565
I know what a date is.

237
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,402
So, who's the unlucky guy?

238
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,887
New reporter... started
work at the planet today.

239
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:13,648
Unlike a lot of new hires, he's
actually a serious journalist.

240
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,299
You just met him... today.

241
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:17,838
I know.

242
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,578
The sparks were flying everywhere.

243
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:22,157
I'm surprised the bullpen
didn't burn right down.

244
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:25,021
Do you always wear so
little on a first date?

245
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,113
Got a problem with the way i look?

246
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:31,602
No.

247
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,664
Just looking out for you. That's all.

248
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:39,667
Thanks, clark, but i'm a big
girl. I can take care of myself.

249
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,175
Behave yourself.

250
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:52,651
These are for being nice to the new guy.

251
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:55,660
How sweet. You shouldn't have.

252
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,745
Oh, you're probably wondering who the
strange man in my apartment is. This is clark.

253
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:06,921
He's one of the daily
planet's sharpest errand boys.

254
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,635
Well, it's nice to meet you, clark.

255
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,993
Clark's actually, um, on his way out.

256
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:17,309
So, don't forget to drop off those
papers after you pick up my dry-Cleaning.

257
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:19,033
Go.

258
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:24,883
Sorry about him. He's still
a little wet behind the ears.

259
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:55,273
C.K., be prepared for your career
to be launched into the stratosphere.

260
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:57,426
You are definitely gonna want
the by-Line after you hear this.

261
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:00,726
Jimmy, i thought i told you i'm not interested
in the by-Line on some make-Believe story.

262
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,376
You're gonna change your
tune once you see my research.

263
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,646
I think the good samaritan started
saving lives right here in smallville.

264
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:08,939
Jimmy, that's a pretty random leap.

265
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,451
Not...really.

266
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,489
"Teen mysteriously saved in lake."

267
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,874
"Girl rescued in robbery."

268
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,550
"Freak accident saves woman."

269
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:22,546
Now, all those happened right around the time
that you and chloe were in the ninth grade.

270
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,874
What, did chloe give you all this?

271
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,352
Just because i take
pictures for a living

272
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:29,693
Doesn't mean i don't know my
way around a search engine.

273
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:31,946
Whatever.

274
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,102
I think that there's a real possibility
that you went to school with this guy.

275
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,906
And what makes you say that?

276
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,562
Look at all the people involved
who went to smallville high.

277
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:43,496
Then right around the time
that you guys graduated,

278
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,961
These mysterious
incidents, they started...

279
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,773
Well, they started popping
up more often in metropolis.

280
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:54,867
What's your point?

281
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,585
Um, yeah, i'm just wondering

282
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,182
If anyone at smallville high stood out.

283
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,448
You know... had...hero potential.

284
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,074
No, not that i can think of.

285
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,378
But even if this guy did exist, don't
you think it's his decision to go public?

286
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:20,643
I don't know. I mean, maybe a little...

287
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,737
Gentle prodding might do him some good.

288
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:27,678
I mean, it's not really
your choice to make.

289
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,865
Be careful with that,
jimmy it's fragile.

290
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:42,346
Since when do you take such an
interest in my family's photographs?

291
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:53,833
What is it?

292
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,247
Look, jimmy, i got a lot of work to do.

293
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:05,817
And, uh, i got to fix the tractor, so...

294
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,239
It's all so clear.

295
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:11,817
That's what's been going
on between you and chloe.

296
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,981
She's known this whole time. And...

297
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,412
And now this picture.

298
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,675
Jimmy, you're not making any sense.

299
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,662
No, it makes perfect sense.

300
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:29,158
It's you, isn't it?

301
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:48,506
System overload.

302
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:50,252
Fatal error.

303
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:56,204
- Chloe, jimmy knows my secret.
- What?

304
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,668
Between the research
and these family photos,

305
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,781
- He put it together.
- Oh, my god. What did you do?

306
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,093
I denied it. I didn't
know what else to do.

307
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:06,087
I told him i had chores, and then i came
over herere. Chloe, this is not good.

308
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,545
I'm so sorry, clark. I
should have listened to you.

309
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:10,907
I had no idea he could
pick you out of a lineup...

310
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,638
Not from that blurry mug shot.

311
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,949
The important thing is that we find a way to
throw him off the trail for his own good.

312
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:20,654
You beat me here.

313
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,725
Jimmy.

314
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,744
When i left you, you were doing chores.

315
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:27,146
You blurred over here, didn't you?

316
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:28,750
Jimmy, that's ridiculous.

317
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,902
I used all the shortcuts.

318
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:32,714
What shortcut?

319
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,519
I was speeding the whole way.

320
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,463
Oh, you know what, clark? Why
don't you show me on a map?

321
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:40,415
Jimmy, this isn't a witch hunt.

322
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,204
You've known this whole time.

323
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:45,812
That's the big secret that
you've been keeping from me.

324
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,523
And i get it.

325
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:50,750
I get it. And of course you
want to keep it a secret. But,

326
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,109
You can trust me, c.K. I got your back.

327
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,949
And i appreciate that, jimmy.

328
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,925
But this deep, dark secret that you
believe in so strongly just doesn't exist.

329
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,584
I'm sorry to let you down.

330
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:03,680
Chloe, you... you'll
tell me the truth, right?

331
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:06,058
Yeah, i mean, the truth
is, as much as i wish

332
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,106
That clark could shatter
land-Speed records, it's just...

333
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,347
He's just a regular guy.

334
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,658
You don't trust me, do you?

335
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,864
She's right, jimmy.

336
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,926
There's nothing special
about me whatsoever.

337
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:25,389
Then i guess i'll have to prove it.

338
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,606
Jimmy...

339
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,198
Clark.

340
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:59,550
Hey, man, uh, listen, if you're
looking for a little jaunt to aruba,

341
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,452
You're gonna have to find another
plane, because this one's packed.

342
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,945
It's all full, and we're about
ready for takeoff. Isn't that right?

343
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:08,843
When your assistant said you were having
your preflight drink, she wasn't kidding.

344
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,276
No, she was not.

345
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:11,929
I hope the pilot's at least sober.

346
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,182
Well, i sure hope the pilot's sober,
too, clark. He's got to get us there.

347
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,229
You know what it is, though,
honestly... you just got to get

348
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,944
In the right frame of mind if
you're gonna fly the friendly skies.

349
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:21,000
- Isn't that right, ladies?
- Yeah.

350
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,014
Oliver, i need to talk to you.

351
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,619
You know what, clark?
Actually, right now...

352
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,282
Not the greatest time for me.
But i tell you what i can do.

353
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,371
I'll drop you a postcard, okay?

354
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:33,587
It's urgent.

355
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:39,788
Just give us one second.

356
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:41,352
Thank you. Please.

357
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,216
Look what you did.

358
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,635
So, what's the latest
crisis in your life, clark?

359
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:57,867
Or did you just come here to
lecture me about drinking and flying?

360
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:00,517
Jimmy's onto my secret.
He's got this picture...

361
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:02,245
And you're afraid that
he's gonna plaster it

362
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:04,160
All over the front page of
the planet... is that it?

363
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:07,025
Yeah. You know what? That
might not be such a bad idea.

364
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,288
It sure would force you
to step up a little bit.

365
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:12,012
What happened to you?

366
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:15,399
You've all but given
up on the green arrow.

367
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:19,149
Did you know that lois was mugged
a block away from your apartment?

368
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,797
It seems that every time someone sees
you, you have a drink in your hand.

369
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:25,239
Maybe i'm not the one
who needs to step up.

370
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:31,889
Whatever. Listen, you
just need to relax.

371
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,800
Okay?

372
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:35,439
Sometimes even superheroes
need to take a vacation.

373
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,886
Oliver, i understand that
you're still upset with me.

374
00:23:37,887 --> 00:23:40,023
I knew that lionel killed your
parents, and i didn't tell you.

375
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,183
I made a decision, and
maybe it was the wrong one.

376
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,303
But you're the only one
who can help me right now.

377
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,584
Well, i tell you what, clark.

378
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,945
- I'll call you when i get back.
-There's no time, oliver!

379
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,567
People have died because
they know my secret!

380
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,807
Lives have been turned upside down.

381
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,724
I can't mind-Wipe the people
who already know my secret.

382
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:04,450
I can only do my best to
protect the people like jimmy.

383
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:13,219
Don't do it for me. Do it for him.

384
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,118
He's an innocent bystander whose
life will never be the same.

385
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:28,478
So, there's bombs going off everywhere.
The soldier next to me gets shot,

386
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:32,187
So the lieutenant turns to me, grabs my
notebook, frisbees it out the humvee window,

387
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:33,993
And sticks an m16 in my hand.

388
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,291
Wait a minute... i thought you said

389
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,547
Your notebook made it all
the way to baghdad and back.

390
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:42,275
It did... once the smoke cleared, i walked
about a mile and a half to go find it.

391
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,754
So, what about the last few years?

392
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:49,150
What kind of misadventures have you had?

393
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,971
Come on. You can be
honest about your past.

394
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,373
Where do i start?

395
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:57,080
Any big investigations?

396
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:00,628
You know, where you went deep
undercover with a drug lord

397
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:03,943
Or crime family or
maximum-Security prison?

398
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:07,249
Okay, bullets flying
over my head is one thing,

399
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,793
But stick me in a tiny,
little cell, no, thank you.

400
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:11,709
Claustrophobia's a bitch.

401
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:16,465
So, you've never, you know, seen the
inside of a big government facility?

402
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:20,294
'Cause that would be a great
exposé waiting to happen.

403
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:25,456
You want to hear about the last time
i was in a big government facility?

404
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,507
I think i was in high school.

405
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:32,220
That's about as close
to prison as it gets.

406
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,569
Really?

407
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,798
Have you ever had your palms read?

408
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:44,615
I don't do too well
with fortune-Tellers.

409
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:48,652
The last one i went to see told me
that i was destined to fall for a guy

410
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:51,545
Who flies a lot and
likes to wear tights.

411
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:55,082
So i'm just waiting for my
cross-Dressing pilot to make his landing.

412
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:59,063
Well, i'll only tell
you the good stuff, then.

413
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:06,736
Give me your hand.

414
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:13,675
Okay.

415
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:18,469
...made it all the way
to baghdad and back.

416
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:26,390
"Wilson turner."

417
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,467
Abilities classified. Homicide.

418
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:29,995
I knew it.

419
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:33,112
You were in black creek.

420
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,777
So...

421
00:26:41,318 --> 00:26:43,110
Am i going to live?

422
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,308
Excuse me.

423
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:50,898
I should take this.
I'll be back in a moment.

424
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:51,941
Okay.

425
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:12,221
So, are you and lois
getting to know each other?

426
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:15,721
I scanned her. She doesn't have
your artifact. I know that much.

427
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,694
Anything besides air
in that brain of hers?

428
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,347
She's figured out who i am.

429
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:25,056
She has this flash
drive from black creek.

430
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:30,659
The one she stole from the library.

431
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,895
Oh, well. The facility's
been dismantled.

432
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,839
There's nothing on that that
could implicate luthorcorp.

433
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,438
It implicates me.

434
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,094
She knows the truth about what i can do.

435
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,812
Well, it sounds like you're
in a bit of a quagmire.

436
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,135
Especially in light of the fact

437
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,574
That she's an overzealous
newspaper reporter.

438
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,690
You might want to find
yourself a new reporter.

439
00:27:58,165 --> 00:28:01,452
Something tells me lois lane
won't be coming into work tomorrow.

440
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:10,024
Move on to our next
person of interest...

441
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,222
Jimmy olsen.

442
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:31,021
Well, then, thanks for dinner.

443
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:34,338
Now you'll be able to make it across
town without a tour book in your hand.

444
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:36,770
Hey, you said you had
that extra transit map.

445
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:39,024
Why don't i come up and get
it? We can have a nightcap.

446
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:44,484
I like nightcaps, but, unfortunately,
i'm on a lethal deadline.

447
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:47,349
I have to proofread a
5,000-Worder due at dawn.

448
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:51,353
I'm a hell of a speller. Why don't
i come up and give you a hand?

449
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:54,974
Thanks, but, uh, spell-Check
is actually my best friend.

450
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,321
See you mañana.

451
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,935
No one can know who i am.

452
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,232
I need that flash drive.

453
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:30,583
Are you ready?

454
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:31,931
Ready as i'll ever be.

455
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:35,621
I don't enjoy driving a speeding
car at anyone... even you.

456
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:37,021
It's okay, chloe.

457
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,307
Someone's gonna save me.

458
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,117
That's him now.

459
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:44,672
Chloe, remember... 10:00 on the dot.

460
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:48,098
Tell me you're sober.

461
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:51,044
Let me tell you something
... i wish i wasn't sober.

462
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:53,028
I could be in a cabana
in aruba right now.

463
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:56,250
Instead, i'm hanging out in the middle
of downtown on a rooftop with you guys.

464
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:57,627
You didn't hear me complain

465
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,065
When i had to put on green
leather to protect your identity.

466
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,798
Clark, you made out with my girlfriend,
man. What did you have to complain about?

467
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,210
Look, jimmy's gonna be here any second.

468
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:13,332
We cross at 10:00. And,
oliver... don't screw this up.

469
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,035
Just keep your fingers crossed.

470
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,157
Jimmy. Thanks for meeting me.

471
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:23,594
Clark, i want you to know
that no matter what you tell me,

472
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:27,440
I'm not gonna look at you any differently.
You'll always be the same old c.K. To me.

473
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:33,506
I swear. Ask anyone.

474
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,102
I know how to keep a secret.

475
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,403
You recognized me at the daily planet.

476
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:44,073
And i can just as easily forget.

477
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,046
I have a terrible memory.

478
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:49,200
You can trust me.

479
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:55,194
There's one thing you learn...

480
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:59,509
When you get locked up
in a cage for four years.

481
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:04,169
That is, you don't...trust...

482
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:05,758
Anybody.

483
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:15,172
Jimmy, let's go get some coffee,

484
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,166
Set the record straight
once and for all.

485
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,030
Whatever you're comfortable
with, man. I'm here for you.

486
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:25,714
I'm sorry, lois, but i'm
never gonna be locked up again.

487
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:53,755
On the move, oliver.

488
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,136
Yeah. Let's just get
this over with, huh?

489
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:04,811
Hello?

490
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:06,426
Clark!

491
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:08,465
Help!

492
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,382
Help, clark!

493
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:35,812
Listen, um, i need to make a
phone call. Just wait right here.

494
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:37,605
- Now?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

495
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,361
- You're coming with me.
- What?

496
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,633
No, hey, man. Just take my wallet.

497
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,097
I don't want your money.

498
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,301
This isn't part of the plan.

499
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,800
Jimmy! What happened?

500
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:58,907
Do you actually expect
me to fall for that?

501
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:02,858
I know exactly what happened.
You... you just saved me.

502
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:06,121
Jimmy, i wish i could take
the credit, but it wasn't me.

503
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,617
It was him.

504
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:15,460
No way.

505
00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:02,444
- I'm so sorry, c.K.
- Congratulations, jimmy.

506
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,789
To think that i just about pulled you
out of a closet you weren't even in.

507
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,342
- I feel terrible.
- Don't feel too bad.

508
00:35:08,343 --> 00:35:11,584
Actually, i'm honored you thought
i could move with lightning speed.

509
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:14,096
Well, you might not
be superhuman, clark,

510
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:16,529
But there's a reason that i
thought you were the good samaritan.

511
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,021
Why is that... 'cause i buy
girl scout cookies twice a year?

512
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:22,368
Seriously, c.K. You're the kind
of guy that people can count on.

513
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,048
Whether it's your friends or
strangers, you're always there for them.

514
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,901
That's rare.

515
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,082
What's rare? A pen that
works in this place?

516
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,036
I heard about your date last night.

517
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,786
Ended with a thud.

518
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,032
I'm sorry i didn't get your
phone call till it was all over.

519
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:49,162
I wasn't on a date, smallville. I was deep
undercover on a dinner with a psychopath.

520
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:51,882
Sounds like your type.

521
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:54,771
Lois, why didn't you tell me
you were working on a story?

522
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:57,466
If i told you my secret, it
would have put you in harm's way.

523
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,472
It was for your own safety.

524
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,018
Thanks for looking out for me.

525
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:03,490
You're welcome.

526
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:05,444
Hey. Lois.

527
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:08,795
By any chance, did you take
a peek at today's front page?

528
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:11,181
I certainly did, jimmy olsen.

529
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:13,794
I have to say that
i've underestimated you.

530
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:16,097
As hard as it is to believe,

531
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:19,846
I was saved now twice in two days.

532
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:25,080
Without a doubt, i'm officially a true
believer in this red-And-Blue superdude.

533
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:28,989
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hey, man, congrats. Time to celebrate.

534
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:33,063
Word from above...

535
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:36,097
The mayor's gonna announce the
new fire chief at 10:00 a.M.

536
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:39,961
My days of covering yawner press
conferences are all but over.

537
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,605
'Cause i have a new mission in life.

538
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:44,763
I didn't realize you had an old one.

539
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:50,865
I'm gonna use my expert tracking skills
and find this camera-Shy superhero.

540
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:53,743
Really? Good luck with that.

541
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,436
Mark my words, clark kent.

542
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:58,835
I won't st until i land

543
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,223
The first worldwide exclusive interview.

544
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:06,428
Watch me.

545
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,438
Nice press.

546
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:21,206
I got to tell you, i never
realizedow photogenic you were...

547
00:37:21,207 --> 00:37:23,277
As long as no one sees your face.

548
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:25,637
It could have been a lot worse.

549
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:28,005
Yeah, it could have.

550
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,761
I'm surprised you let the thing
print, though. I was expecting

551
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,643
To hear about some last-Minute
computer meltdown at the planet.

552
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:37,257
To be honest, it did cross my mind.

553
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:40,084
But then i got to thinking.

554
00:37:41,402 --> 00:37:44,696
Maybe my destiny is more than
just secretly saving people.

555
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:50,091
Maybe it was also to give people hope,

556
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:52,160
Someone to believe in.

557
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:55,969
I knew you'd catch on someday.

558
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,600
Well, i just wanted to say thank
you before you went on vacation.

559
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:04,255
Vacation's over, clark.

560
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:05,909
I'm headed to europe.

561
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,896
- On business?
- Uh, yeah. Kinda. Kinda.

562
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:12,465
You know my friends... the ones
who like to dress up and kick ass?

563
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,523
- We're having a summit.
- What happened to the party plane?

564
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:18,424
Want to know the truth?

565
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:21,147
I don't know.

566
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:24,173
It's like, when i was zipping across
the street, taking that punk down...

567
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:28,662
Well, i finally felt like
myself again, you know?

568
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,852
Because that's who i am.

569
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,611
I'm not the party boy who runs off
on these lost rum-Soaked weekends.

570
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:38,468
I'm not the multinational
corporate titan. That's not me.

571
00:38:40,714 --> 00:38:44,719
Underneath it all, the person
i really am is green arrow.

572
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:49,489
I'm glad you've finally come around.

573
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:56,382
Clark, i understand, uh...

574
00:38:56,536 --> 00:38:59,165
Why you didn't tell me
about my parents' murder.

575
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,324
You were afraid of how i'd take it.

576
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:06,692
And it's... it's fine. You were right.

577
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:10,597
And once i found out, i'm pretty sure

578
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,886
My parents wouldn't have
been proud of how i reacted.

579
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:18,190
Oliver, i have no doubt that
your parents would be proud

580
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,994
Of the person you've become.

581
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:25,686
Except for one thing, and it's
just a piece of friendly advice.

582
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:31,107
Don't ever wear that cape
again. It looked ridiculous.

583
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,509
Really? I kind of liked it.

584
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:37,505
Sure helped with the aerodynamics.

585
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,146
You should give it a try.

586
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:43,155
Not in this life time.

587
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:06,160
Who are you?

588
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:10,589
I thought you might
like a visitor...wilson.

589
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:13,502
How do you know me?

590
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:15,608
I was in that facility with you.

591
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:19,640
I know all about your ability
to read people like braille.

592
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,577
Now, tell me.

593
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:24,629
That man who stopped
you the other night...

594
00:40:24,952 --> 00:40:27,740
How much of his story
did you get through?

595
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,998
Let's just say he
shouldn't have touched me.

596
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:35,358
Guys like him belong in
places like black creek.

597
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:40,954
Why were you in there?

598
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,436
You don't seem so special.

599
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:51,662
You know, the human mind is simply
a highly sophisticated computer.

600
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:55,965
Download too much
information, and it crashes.

601
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,609
And all the data's lost.

602
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:02,901
What's that supposed to mean?

603
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,416
Here.

604
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,548
Let me show you.

605
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:12,198
