>> INTERCEPTING FILE TRANSFER...

2
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:20,502
FILE INTERCEPTED!

3
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:21,945
Got it.

4
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,347
I just intercepted the file.

5
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:27,881
Yeah of course I deleted any trace of it.

6
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,076
This isn't the first time
I've de something like this.

7
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,516
I'll see you in a few.

8
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,837
Help!

9
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:44,003
Somebody's after me!

10
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:02,885
The roof!

11
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:06,261
Come on! Isn't this when you're
supposed to swoop in and save me?!

12
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:15,086
No pepper spray?

13
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,056
This city's a dangerous place.

14
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:22,767
You should be prepared.

15
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,697
You can have my wallet.

16
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,568
You know that's not what I'm after.

17
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:36,604
Next time maybe you'll think twice before
you steal what doesn't belong to you.

18
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:39,945
Finder’s keepers.
I like the look.

19
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,168
Italian?

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,652
Why? You're thinking
of trading in your tights?

21
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,340
We were barely introduced.

22
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:57,890
"Somebody save me"

23
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:02,330
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

24
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:07,307
"Somebody save me"

25
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:12,953
"I don't care how you do it"

26
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:17,836
"Just save me, save me"

27
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,662
"Come on"

28
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,325
"I've been waiting for you"

29
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:33,694
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

30
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:37,739
"Just save me, save me"

31
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,925
"Come on"

SMALLVILLE 7x11 "SIREN"
Subtitles subXpacio

33
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,911
Good morning.

34
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,749
Hi.

35
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,899
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

36
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,117
Well, I'm off.

37
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:28,429
Okay.

38
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,964
Wait! Hold the doors!

39
00:04:56,634 --> 00:05:00,550
Dinah Lance - the word of justice,
thee right-wing hawk of the airwaves...

40
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:02,905
you're all dressed up.
Heading to an execution?

41
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:06,775
If you ever did any fact-checking, Lois,

42
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:09,019
you'd know that the state
outlawed those years ago.

43
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:11,558
I'm sure you'll get over it someday.

44
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:15,124
Well, if you're so in the know,
then I suppose you know...

45
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:18,359
that your limousine-liberal
Casanova has resurfaced.

46
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,503
Minus a certain shrill arm trophy.

BILLIONAIRE BOY BACK IN TOWN

48
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,262
BLONDE WOMAN

49
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,803
Looking for a new hairdo?

50
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,576
Let me guess. Ham and Swiss?

51
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:51,708
- Your favorite.
- No, actually, not at all,

52
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,520
which I think I've mentioned three times
this week, but thanks anyway.

53
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,693
I just can't hang around
that house amore, Chloe.

54
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,614
Knowing that phantom was living
my life with Lana for over a month...

55
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,128
while I was trapped in the fortress.

56
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,136
I know we looked alike, but she really
couldn't tell the difference?

57
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,452
And then she tells him
that they belong together.

58
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,613
Does that mean she doesn't
feel that way about me?

59
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,771
Well, she isn't exactly the same girl...

60
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,528
you used to trip all over
in high school, either.

61
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,664
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

62
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,181
Right.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

63
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:27,457
Any luck locating
the brain interactive construct?

64
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,572
Not since you asked me yesterday.

65
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,629
What happened
to your face?

66
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:35,992
First of all, did you seriously
not notice this until just now?

67
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:40,892
Don't worry, Clark. I'm fine.

68
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:42,637
Chloe.

69
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,893
All right, I've sort of been doing
this sidekick side job for Oliver.

70
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:52,868
What?

71
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:55,485
Look, Clark, a girl
has got to pay her bills.

72
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,491
and, I mean, let's face it,

73
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:59,617
you kind of fill my pro-bono qua.

74
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,682
His missions are dangerous.
And the fact he's taking you with him -

75
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:05,382
No, no, no, it was just
internet interception...

76
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:11,223
that ended up having a vicious
ninja lady attached to it...

77
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:14,589
who chased me onto the roof
and then almost beheaded me...

78
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,010
and went rappelling over the side
of the building, which I've got to admit...

79
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:20,328
was really smokin' cool.

80
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,732
Who was she?

81
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:35,971
You put Chloe in danger!

82
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,080
So, I take it we're skipping
over the whole...

83
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,954
"hello good to see you again,"
part of the conversation?

84
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:44,619
If you and your crew want to go out there
and put your own lives on the line,

85
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:48,018
that's fine.
Go ahead! But not Chloe!

86
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:51,209
Smart doesn't help when someone's
trying to attack you on a rooftop!

87
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:55,084
First of all, I don't think our leather-fetish
mystery woman was trying to kill Chloe.

88
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:56,750
She shouldn't have been in danger at all.

89
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,337
Secondly, Chloe's in danger like every
other week with you by her side, Clark.

90
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:03,282
You're the one who goes into things
without giving it a second thought.

91
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,503
Why don't you try to think about
someone other than yourself for once?

92
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,491
I'm selfish?

93
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,975
You know, some of us sacrifice being with
the people that we really care about...

94
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,058
so that we can go make a difference.

95
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,284
What do you do?

96
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:18,003
you sit around in domestic bliss,
curled up on a couch...

97
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:20,957
while a world of trouble
spins outside your door!

98
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,209
This blond woman -

99
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,866
Chloe said she shattered your arrows.

100
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:42,090
Not my proudest moment, but, yeah.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,742
She must have so kind
of sound-frequency control.

102
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:48,665
All the noise went muffled
right before it happened.

103
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,798
And the files she stole - Chloe said
she didn't know what it was.

104
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:56,481
I didn't tell her what it was.

105
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,221
We've intercepted Lex's latest project.

106
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:00,790
It's a photo file.

107
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:04,340
And this masked woman
just happened to show up?

108
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:07,342
Maybe Lex has a blond sidekick of his own.

109
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:21,030
I usually mind when someone sits
in the chair, but...

110
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:24,494
I'm a little distracted
to care at the moment.

111
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,908
I don't take to the morally murky.

112
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,540
Unless they pay you.

113
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,640
You know my standards.

114
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,492
No matter how rich you are,
you don't deserve to be robbed.

115
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:39,323
And you, richie, are a lucky man.

116
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:44,902
If you stopped whoever's been
hacking into my trade secrets,

117
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,594
I consider myself very lucky.

118
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,010
Your file almost fell
into the wrong hands.

119
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:52,526
I had little run-in
with an emerald archer.

120
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,373
Green Arrow?

121
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:58,153
I wasn't expecting company.

122
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,023
You think you can find him again?

123
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,642
If I had a good reason.

124
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:07,503
They've been breaking in and
setting off bombs at my work sites.

125
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:09,773
They belong in prison.

126
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:13,450
You bring me Green Arrow, and
I will make it worth your while.

127
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,145
I'd like this back as soon as possible.
Thanks.

128
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:34,415
I, um - I've been calling the farm,
but no one answers.

129
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,383
It's as if the place had been abandoned.

130
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:39,430
Or we have caller I. D.

131
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:46,353
The, um, editor of the Daily Planet,

132
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,661
Grant Gabriel -

133
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,997
he's been shot and killed.

134
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:56,677
Let me guess.
You think Lex is behind it.

135
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,999
I do, yes. I think it's why
he bought the paper.

136
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,085
It's the beauty of a divorce, Lionel.

137
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:10,122
Covering up Lex's baggage
is no longer my problem.

138
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,339
I don't want to cover it up, Lana.

139
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:13,834
I want proof.

140
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,533
I know you can get it for me.

141
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:20,650
Lex d I have kind of
suspended tea time together.

142
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:24,594
I know you have hours of footage -
spy footage on him -

143
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,547
and I'm sure I can find something
that will incriminate him.

144
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,022
What leads you to believe
that I would help you?

145
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:36,367
Several weeks ago, you held
a very sick woman hostage.

146
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,471
I was trying to help her.

147
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:42,245
And how did that work out
for you, bypassing the hospital?

148
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,423
Oh, oh, yes. that's right.
She died in your care.

149
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:51,200
You were very quick to share all this
with Clark's doppelganger, but...

150
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:54,268
why didn't you tell Clark?

151
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,043
Call me when you're ready for movie night.

152
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,578
OLIVER QUEEN

153
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,521
I was hoping you could help me.

154
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,692
This vigilante woman attacked Chloe.

155
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,436
I thought maybe you'd know if
she was connected to Lex.

156
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:30,236
It's kind of interesting that everyone was
so quick to turn me into Lady Macbeth...

157
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:32,112
when they found out I was watching Lex.

158
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,952
And yet you're the second person
to ask for my help today.

159
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:39,566
The second person?

160
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,534
She's not in any of the old footage.
I would have remembered the mask.

161
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,302
Thanks. I appreciate it.

162
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,776
Clark...

163
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:04,247
when you were gone,
I was treating this woman.

164
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,313
She was catatonic
after Brainiac infected her.

165
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,085
What do you mean, "treating"?

166
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:13,239
Monitoring her. She -

167
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,642
Until she passed away.

168
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,672
She passed away?

169
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,795
There wasn't anything else we could do.
Her mind was already gone.

170
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,180
We were just looking for clues.

171
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,739
Who's "we"?

172
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,582
You told the phantom this?

173
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,710
Lana, why do you bother
telling me now?

174
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,435
Lionel's holding it over my head.

175
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,361
I can't do this, Lana.

176
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:50,343
You're only honest with me
when you're threatened.

177
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,943
- In a few weeks with him -
- I don't know what else to say to you.

178
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,174
I thought that he was you.

179
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,152
You're supposed to know me
better than anyone.

180
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:01,362
And that's why you're here
with me right now.

181
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:03,583
But it was easier with him, wasn't it?

182
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:08,596
Yes. It was easier, Clark.

183
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,146
He was more affectionate.

184
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,277
He was more understanding.

185
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,967
Is that really what you want to hear?

186
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:22,303
I can't even look at you
without you taking it the wrong way.

187
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,244
Because you're looking at me like
you wished I was someone else.

188
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:31,773
Every transgression that I have made,

189
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,713
you have answered
with a hypocritical judgment.

190
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:39,376
No one can live up to
your self-righteous standards.

191
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:46,415
Do you have any idea how it feels
to wake up every morning,

192
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:51,791
knowing that you're going fail in the eyes
of the only person you've ever really loved?

193
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,981
And you're the one
who fell in love with Lex...

194
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,743
And then fell for that killer.

195
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,707
I don't think it's me you can't face.

196
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:33,947
I told him to give me call.

197
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,110
Lois.

198
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,426
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

199
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:03,413
- That's for breaking my heart.
- Really?

200
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:06,105
'cause it felt like it was for not calling
when I got back into town.

201
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,350
Oh, that one will come
when you least expect it.

202
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:11,500
Would you put a shirt on or something?

203
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:21,571
Well, at least I know why
I got canned from your speed dial.

204
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:28,045
The whole, uh, jumping-to-conclusions
thing before getting the full story -

205
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,044
how's that working out for you?

206
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,876
Huge time-saver.

207
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,818
The dinner's for you.

208
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,967
I knew you'd be on my doorstep.

209
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:46,892
and if you weren't, I'd have been on yours.

210
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,108
I missed you.

211
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,450
more than you could possibly know.

212
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:04,448
If you think the glistening-muscle-
answering-the-door-

213
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:07,568
in-your-bare-chest
routine was gonna work...

214
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,303
you were dead-on.

215
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:21,251
You're all I could think about.

216
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,223
Nice try.

217
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:41,497
Does that work on all the
fishnet-leather-clad blondes...

218
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,363
you have stashed on the balcony?

219
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,996
Get down!

220
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,681
Ollie?

221
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
Ollie?

222
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,138
Oh, my god.

223
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:43,321
Lois?

224
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,617
Oh, don't even think
of looking at me right now.

225
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:50,921
So, in all those nights together,

226
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,927
somewhere between brushing teeth
and spooning in the sheets,

227
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,074
you didn't think that it might be a good time
to mention that you prowled the streets...

228
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:59,431
with green leather and a compound bow?

229
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,728
Well, I don't usually
bring the compound bow.

230
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:05,304
Oh, so, now he's a funny hero.

231
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,784
I can't believe you didn't tell me
you were Green Arrow!

232
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:11,590
Hard to imagine why
when you're taking it so well.

233
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:14,471
You think the lacerating ropes
and platinum fembot...

234
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,816
might have something to do
with my lack of empathy?

235
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:20,537
So, what? Little Ollie got bored
with dodge ball in p. e...

236
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,517
and decided to play William Tell?

237
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,214
Whoa. Wait a second.

238
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:30,891
I kissed Green Arrow last year when you
were standing there with me in the alley.

239
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,662
Yeah, I remember that
with precise detail.

240
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:35,097
I can't believe you!

241
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,579
You, who were supposedly
my boyfriend, arranged for me...

242
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:40,094
to be lip-locked with some wannabe hero!

243
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:43,859
- Lois?!
- Ugh. How do you put up with that?

244
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,513
I don't know what it is you want from me,

245
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,318
but I'm hoping we just got off
on the wrong foot.

246
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:53,120
You can save your charm for
your squawking parrot over there.

247
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,848
Whatever someone's paying you,
I can beat it.

248
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,387
You know, this is more than
just about money, pretty boy.

249
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:01,894
This is about something that you and your
merry band of thieves might not understand -

250
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:04,155
justice.

251
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:07,644
Lady Justice must be blinder than I thought
she was, if she's got you on her side.

252
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,353
Just tell me this- what goes
through the mind of a terrorist...

253
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,686
when he's about to set off
a bomb in a factory?

254
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,800
A Terrorist?

255
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,294
You really have it backwards.

256
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:19,904
no one's ever been hurt,

257
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,264
and Lex's factories aren't exactly producing
Christmas toys for little girls and boys.

258
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,994
I'm the good guy!

259
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,606
Isn't everybody?

260
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:39,315
When I say I'm gonna do
something, I always deliver.

261
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,986
Now it's your turn.

262
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:45,445
You want your boy over here?
Start the wire transfer.

263
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:05,520
In case you can't see it,
the white flag is flying,

264
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,534
so don't even think
about going off on me again.

265
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:10,462
I'm sorry for being so hard on you...

266
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:13,511
about the Oliver thing.
I just don't want to see you getting hurt.

267
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,961
Well, we could all breathe easier
if we could find a lead on blonde ambition,

268
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:18,905
but right now, I've got zero.

269
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,427
Lana might.

270
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:22,958
Twist.

271
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,219
Okay.

272
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,535
She doesn't have any footage
linking Lex to the attacker,

273
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,179
but she was able to keep track
of his projects...

274
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,553
by piggybacking on the server
from Luthor mansion.

275
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,527
Of course. Right in front of my face.

276
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:37,997
Our silent siren...

277
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:41,981
knew I was making the interception
because she was on the Daily Planet server.

278
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,578
Can you access who logged on last night?

279
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:47,135
Yeah. I can't believe I didn't see that.

280
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,264
The negligent go-to girl strikes again.

281
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:52,336
chalk another one up
for the new-and-improved model.

282
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:53,911
Lana did come through,

283
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:57,683
but I'm not about to let Oliver
poach the best sidekick in town.

284
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,486
Dinah Lance was the only woman
logged on last night.

285
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,350
That doesn't help us much.

286
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,643
Why, because she's not blonde?

287
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,861
Please, Clark. The new bad girl
could be as blond as I really am.

288
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:18,042
There you go.
Raven black.

289
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,343
Canary yellow.

290
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:25,401
maybe we should call her
the yellow raven.

291
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,475
Black Canary
has a better ring to it.

292
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,310
This makes so much sense.

293
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:33,595
I mean, Dinah's slogan is
"the word of justice.”

294
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,792
Family of cops, hard-line view
of crime and corruption...

295
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,201
What are you doing?

296
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,302
Earning back my stripes.

297
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:44,574
I just hacked in to Dinah's
computer and it looks like...

298
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,697
there is a transfer in occurrence,

299
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:49,158
to her bank account right now.

300
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:56,473
Oliver said the file you intercepted
the other night was from Lex.

301
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,051
Can you block this transfer?

302
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:02,575
Cut off the air supply
so she'll have to surface.

303
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,718
Got it.

304
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,656
Missing your payoff?

305
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:27,727
Guess there's no honor among thieves.

306
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,069
Let me guess. yore one of the
Green Bean's little accomplices,

307
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:34,128
and now that your boss is all
tied up, you're out of work.

308
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,973
what'd you do with him?

309
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,338
Green Arrow isn't the villain here. Lex is.

310
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:42,305
Even tycoons who buy out
the press deserve justice.

311
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:45,100
is that the line you use to convince
yourself you're on the right side?

312
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,134
you know, you may not have
experienced this, stud boy,

313
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:50,435
but when you are on the right side,
you don't have to do any convincing.

314
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,203
Did it ever occur to you
there might be a reason...

315
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:54,258
why the Green Arrow
was stealing from Lex?

316
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,122
Actually, it didn't occur to me that
anything about Queen was reasonable.

317
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,675
Sorry. Green Arrow.

318
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,032
Next time you're a gun for hire,
do your research.

319
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:07,771
Why would a rich guy like Oliver waste his
time intercepting files for the fun of it?

320
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,812
What line did Lex feed you?

321
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,160
that you and your little gang
were breaking into his plants...

322
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,398
all over the world,
stealing trade secrets.

323
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:21,840
I'm guessing he didn't tell you
what those secrets were.

324
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:25,611
Where's Oliver?

325
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:23,219
Well, aren't you clever?
you managed to sneak in.

326
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:25,830
did you, uh, find anything?

327
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:29,548
I didn't find anything linking
Grant Gabriel's murder to Lex...

328
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,278
because I'm not looking.

329
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,650
Think, Lana. I -

330
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:41,644
you know what you've done,
lying to Clark, deceiving him.

331
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,654
Clark knows everything,

332
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:48,734
and he will know everything
from now on.

333
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:52,577
So, I guess your cards
are off the table.

334
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,773
Well, it's obvious that you adopted
more than just e Luthor name.

335
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:05,638
What about the part of you that
wanted to bring Lex to justice...

336
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:09,814
for all the evil that he's done?
Is that also off table?

337
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,682
Sometimes justice comes
at too high a price -

338
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,008
like sacrificing
my relationship with Clark...

339
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:19,077
because I wanted to see
Lex pay for his sins.

340
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,494
Why did you come here?

341
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,063
I went to the edge,
and Clark pulled me back.

342
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,363
I'm trying to the same thing for you.

343
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:35,409
So, this is because you have
my best interests at heart?

344
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,416
it's not about you.

345
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,368
I'm trying to change.

346
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:42,866
To be honest, to be the kind of person
that Clark could love again.

347
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,814
What game are you playing?

348
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:49,787
Lex is living proof
of what obsession can do.

349
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:53,098
- I know my son better than you.
- No, you don't.

350
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:57,989
Be careful.

351
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:25,737
Lois, what happened?

352
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,722
This crazy woman attacked us.

353
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:32,438
Why did some woman
attack you and Oliver?

354
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,986
Hey!

355
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:37,975
Isn't the view spectacular? I never
really noticed it before without the -

356
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,154
all the glass in the way.

357
00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:41,792
The view?

358
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,943
I know. Can you believe this guy?
A hydraulic walk-in closet.

359
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:49,490
You're not gonna find that
in the Sharper Image catalog.

360
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,435
It must be laundry day.

361
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,479
I mean, who picks archery as a hobby?

362
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,979
That's embarrassing. I'd keep
my quiver in the closet, too.

363
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,192
Lois, where is Oliver?

364
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:01,181
I don't know.

365
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:04,175
She knocked me out, and when
I came to, they were both gone.

366
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,855
I think you forgot a little
green something at home.

367
00:29:19,622 --> 00:29:23,549
I'm not handing green arrow over to
you until you can prove how bad he is.

368
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:28,481
The fact that he's been breaking
into my plants seems sufficient.

369
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,677
About those plants -
I' been doing a little digging.

370
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:33,381
It seems your auto-parts factory
doesn't sell any auto parts.

371
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,461
and your tech warehouse
doesn't distribute computers.

372
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,339
looks like you've been
buying into his propaganda.

373
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:45,716
I don't like being caught on the wrong
side, which is what I'm on, isn't?

374
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:48,262
You were never gonna hand Green Arrow
over to the police, were you?

375
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,209
I'm not much for philosophical debates.
I just want what I paid for.

376
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:58,175
Well, then, I guess that answers my question.
I'm not handing him over.

377
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:03,771
- Where is he?
- I'm looking over your shoulder.

378
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:07,133
Better luck next time, Lex.

379
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:41,083
Oliver?

380
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,667
Slash Green Arrow.

381
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:45,150
Any other hyphenates
I need to know about?

382
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:49,123
No, that was pretty much the biggie.

383
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:57,543
I'm sorry.

384
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,435
I never meant to hide
who I was from you. I just -

385
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:06,385
No it's okay. I get it.
You were just trying to protect me.

386
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,334
Yeah.

387
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,203
And I got to say,
it clears up a lot.

388
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:16,480
It never did make sense how you
could blow off a hottie like me.

389
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,810
Right, that's true.

390
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:27,059
Well, now that you know...

391
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm really hoping that...

392
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:38,595
I know my job takes me out
of town a lot, but...

393
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:43,045
on the weekends, there - there's a -

394
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,281
I'm asking you.

395
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:50,442
Please give us another chance.

396
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:55,137
I can make this work.

397
00:32:58,172 --> 00:33:00,129
I can't.

398
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,046
You know me and my big mouth.
I can never keep a secret.

399
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,754
I don't believe that.

400
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,801
I've never been good
at long-distance relationships.

401
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,814
Come on, Lois.

402
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,217
Okay.

403
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:19,017
Maybe I'm selfish here...

404
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:23,752
but I don't want to wonder
where you are every night.

405
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,299
I don't think I'd be good at
the whole dual-identity thing.

406
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,598
I...

407
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:41,216
I can't.

408
00:33:43,328 --> 00:33:46,389
I can't share you
with the rest of the world.

409
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,465
Enter at your own caloric risk.

410
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,638
How you doing?

411
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:34,412
Aside from the metaphor,

412
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,349
I was hoping Rocky Road
would help, but nothing, nada.

413
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,533
not even a dent.

414
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:48,721
You know, I thought Grant
would help me get over Ollie,

415
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,969
and if that didn't end badly enough...

416
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,142
the moment I saw Ollie again,

417
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:58,100
all those feelings just
came rushing right back up.

418
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:02,119
maybe it can still work
between you two.

419
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:07,606
You don't know Ollie like I do.
There are parts of him you've never seen.

420
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,533
That's a given.

421
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,150
I mean, sides of him.

422
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:18,557
He's got this one side that
I'm not sure I can live with.

423
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,993
How would you know
if you don't give it a chance?

424
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:23,715
We're not you and Lana.
We're not the perfect couple.

425
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:26,077
We are not destined for each other.

426
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,033
Lois, this isn't like you.

427
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,965
Normally, when things get challenging,
that's when you get interested.

428
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:33,653
This is different.

429
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,183
My dad was a general.

430
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:38,749
And he cared about me.

431
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,744
But I learned really early
that his role in the world...

432
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,039
was a lot more important
than being a father.

433
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:46,107
And you know what?
For good reasons.

434
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:50,364
And Ollie's life is demanding, too.

435
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:54,781
Lois, just because someone's
life has great responsibility...

436
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,465
doesn't mean your life
has to take second place.

437
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,718
Of course it does, Clark.

438
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:04,823
Can you imagine what it would be like...

439
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:09,656
to look into somebody's eyes and know that
their destiny is so much greater than yours,

440
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:14,807
that you will never compete?
You will always be left behind.

441
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:19,282
That would be hard for anyone, but...

442
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:22,845
No, I can't be left behind one more time.

443
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:31,392
You know, where Ollie's life is going,

444
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:34,859
there's not room for me in it,

445
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:39,392
and I know he'd never admit that, so...

446
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:43,939
I had to.

447
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,038
I just, um...

448
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:52,660
I can't face another heartbreak
down the road.

449
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:18,053
Besides, you know, why settle for hot, rich
and famous when I can hang out with you?

450
00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:41,130
I guess you got blondie's message, too.

451
00:37:43,777 --> 00:37:45,960
I spoke to Lois.
I'm sorry about what happened.

452
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:50,508
Maybe she'll get used to the
whole dual-identity thing someday.

453
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:52,772
Yeah, like when?

454
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:56,928
When the Earth cracks open and time
ticks backwards? I don't think so.

455
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:02,686
Hey. Thanks for coming.

456
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:05,854
I guess I need to eat a little crow, huh?

457
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:09,636
Is it too late to ask for an apology?

458
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,349
Apology accepted,

459
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:13,452
assuming you stop moonlighting for Lex.

460
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:16,700
That won't be a problem.
I've decided to hang up my fishnets.

461
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,992
I think I was a little out of my league.

462
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,791
I'll just stick
to being the word of justice.

463
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,832
At least I can't hurt anyone
over the airwaves.

464
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,279
Well, as long as they're not subsonic.

465
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,613
Still, I got to say...

466
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:30,660
it kind of seems like a waste.

467
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,446
Besides, Oliver and his boys
could always use a den mother.

468
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,863
It's true.

469
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:37,498
I'm not really much of a team player.

470
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:40,195
Really? That's perfect.
You're gonna fit right in.

471
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:45,781
What about you?

472
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:48,089
I'd say ricocheting bullets
off your back...

473
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,494
earns you the secret handshake.

474
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,340
Maybe someday.

475
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,293
Come on. There's a couple people
I want you to meet.

476
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,327
Has anyone ever told you
you've lousy taste in women?

477
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,429
Hi.

478
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:35,130
Hi.

479
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:40,826
I talked to Chloe. I thought I should
go stay with her for a few days.

480
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:54,492
I stole a Lamborghini.

481
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:59,429
I broke into a bank of ATM machines,
and I stole all the money.

482
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:05,366
I ripped off more vault doors
than I could count in a lifetime.

483
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,422
Lana I'm anything but perfect,

484
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:12,265
and I know that it's hard to live
with me, especially when...

485
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:19,094
not everyone can handle
the double-sided life I live.

486
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:26,259
Clark, I've been a two-headed
hydra lately myself.

487
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:34,524
It's funny. you can have all the right
motives and still do all the wrong things.

488
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,812
I just wish I knew how
we ended up here.

489
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:41,955
But...

490
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:46,668
for what it's worth,
I am still committed to us.

491
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,240
You don't think I am?

492
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:55,999
Clark, I think that you doubt
whether I'm the one...

493
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,145
you're really going to end up with.

494
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:05,854
I can't tell you the future, Lana.

495
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,000
Honestly, I don't know
what's gonna happen to us.

496
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:16,298
But I promise I'm gonna do
everything I can to make sure...

497
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,113
that we can trust each other again.

498
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:28,444
I don't want this to be over.

499
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:40,805
