1
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:34,492
Hey, i must have tripped every speed
trap in smallville to get here.

2
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,901
What happened?

3
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,264
I got another s.O.S. From kara.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And?

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,349
"Krypton will be destroyed
any minute.

6
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,074
"Brainiac is getting closer.
Please, hurry.

7
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:49,608
Your life depends on it."

8
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,499
So brainiac used kara to time-Jump

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Back to the day
that the planet exploded.

10
00:00:57,717 --> 00:00:59,400
Which means that all he has to do

11
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,899
Is stop that ship
that carried you as a baby

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,399
From leaving krypton, and...

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,500
You would be standing alone
in an empty barn.

14
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:12,523
Clark, if they made the quantum leap,
there must be a way you can, too.

15
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:14,300
Yeah.

16
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:17,600
Kara mentioned the fortress has
the ability to send me back.

17
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:21,100
If i take the octagonal disk there,
jor-El can make it happen.

18
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,451
Then, why are you still here?

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,730
I mean, you should be halfway
to krypton by now.

20
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:30,979
I'm not going.

21
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:37,399
But you have to stop brainiac,
or you'll fade away.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,799
- I mean, this could happen at any moment.
- I understand that.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,599
Okay, i know what
you're thinking, clark.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,642
The last time you meddled with the past,
it cost your father his life.

25
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:47,650
But, clark, look at what's at stake.
You don't have a choice.

26
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:50,093
I do have a choice, chloe,
and i'm making it right now.

27
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:53,047
Ever since i arrived, all i brought
is death and suffering,

28
00:01:53,148 --> 00:01:55,000
Meteor freaks, phantoms...

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,754
... or brainiac.

30
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,930
Clark, you've done so much good.

31
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:04,045
You can't blame yourself
for all the bad in the world.

32
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,537
It's not blame, chloe.

33
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm taking responsibility
for all the lives that i've ruined,

34
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:11,200
Including lana's.

35
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:15,864
Clark, this is not the time
to be stubborn, okay? Don't do this.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,199
We need you.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
I need you.

38
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,167
Chloe, you'll be fine.

39
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,600
Once i'm gone, you'll have
no idea i was ever here.

40
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,900
No, i'm not letting you off that easy.

41
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,900
You're going back to krypton now

42
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,399
Before it's too late.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
This planet will be better off
if i never existed.

44
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, my god, clark.

45
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey. What the hell
are you doing on our property?

46
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:20,338
What?

47
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,300
Who are you?

48
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:23,900
I live here.

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,408
I'm clark kent.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,400

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,300
Transcript : www.1000fr.Com/swsub.Com

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,500
Synchro : flolo

53
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,099
What are you doing?

54
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,580
I'm not in this picture.

55
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,254
You're their son.

56
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:48,688
Yeah.

57
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,000
And lucky for you, my dad
didn't find you in the barn

58
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,311
'Cause he'd be pulling out
his 12-Gauge right about now.

59
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:55,500
He's alive?

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,500
Dad? Dad?

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,702
"Dad?" What's your problem?

62
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,286
Look, body's home, all right?

63
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:06,639
If you don't get out of my
house, i'm calling the sheriff.

64
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,680
I never made it to earth.
I don't exist here.

65
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, unfortunately, you do,

66
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,421
And you still haven't told me
why you're in my house.

67
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:15,499
I'm not sure.
If i didn't get on that ship,

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,642
Then i shouldn't be here.
But somehow i am.

69
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,200
The ship?

70
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,600
All right, look, just relax, okay?

71
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,280
I'll get you some help.

72
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,333
I need to talk
to jonathan and martha.

73
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,400
Well, that's gonna be hard
'cause they're on a cruise,

74
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,404
Celebrating my dad's birthday.
Look, anyways...

75
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:34,767
Is lana okay?

76
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:38,100
I don't know who that is,
but i'll call the sheriff,

77
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,416
- And i'm sure he'll know what to do.
- No, it's all right.

78
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,255
I just need to make sureall
my friends are ok.

79
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,611
I need to use your phone book.

80
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:05,900
I'll be right back, hon.

81
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,900
Okay, i'll be waiting for you.

82
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:23,659
Smallville high, class of '05?

83
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm sorry, my inner database
is coming up empty.

84
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:29,200
Do i know you?

85
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,261
We went to high school together.

86
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,302
You may not remember me.
I was a bit of an outsider.

87
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:43,500
Listen, i'm trying to find
a mutual friend of ours.

88
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,699
She's not in the phone book. Lana lang?

89
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,039
Uh, the cheerleader?

90
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,400
We didn't exactlswim
in the same social pond.

91
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,699
I mean, to be honest,

92
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,200
Her blip fell off my radar
the day after graduation.

93
00:06:57,758 --> 00:07:00,030
But you were a reporter
at the torch, right?

94
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:03,387
Maybe you can use some of your investigative
magic, help me track her down?

95
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,800
I would love to help, but we have
somewhere we have to be.

96
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,300
Oh, you and your boyfriend.

97
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,467
Fiancé? Actually.

98
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,700
The wedding's on sunday.

99
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
Congratulations.

100
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,979
That's great.

101
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,569
- So, you ready?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,499
Your dad just called.
He's waiting at the tuxedo shop.

103
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry i couldn't help.

104
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,100
It's okay.

105
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:34,316
Ready?

106
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:39,758
I hope you find lana.

107
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,051
I'm really happy for you.

108
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:47,792
Thanks.

109
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,500
Nice bow tie.

110
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh, thanks. Yeah, it's...

111
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,448
A present from an old girlfriend.

112
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,785
She might have taken my heart away,
but she left me with a sense of style.

113
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:23,100
You're jimmy olsen,
the photographer, right?

114
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,600
The one and only.

115
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:27,400
Every time i see a picture
in the newspaper i like,

116
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,700
Your name's on it.

117
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
- You like my work?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:36,400
I wish that you were my editor. I mean,
she says that i have focus issues.

120
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,314
She should check her eyesight.

121
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,600
So, do you work here?

122
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
No, um...

123
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,300
I actually lost track
of an ex-Girlfriend.

124
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,200
I was hoping
the daily planet archives

125
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,662
Might help me find out
where she ended up.

126
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,024
Do you have any idea
who might be able to help me?

127
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,500
You're looking at him.

128
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm always there for a loyal fan.

129
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:57,519
Come on.

130
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:07,592
So, does this long-Lost love
have a name?

131
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:20,700
What is it? Is she ok?

132
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,848
Well, brace yourself.

133
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:26,099
"After high school, "lana lang
studied art history at the sorbonne

134
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,974
Where she met french
philanthropist pierre rousseau."

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,061
They're married, they have two kids,
and they live in the city of lights.

136
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:34,651
Sorry, buddy.

137
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,708
That's the best news i ever heard.

138
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:37,800
Really?

139
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:42,200
I guess things turned out pretty
good for her without you around.

140
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,500
I just want her to be happy.

141
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:49,100
Thanks.

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,100
Clumsy but cute.

143
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,120
Hey, miss lane,

144
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,658
Looking for an ace photographer
to shoot tomorrow's column one?

145
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,299
Put your camera back
in your pants, olsen.

146
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,367
I need you to make
another delivery asap.

147
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,400
Name's lois, lois lane.

148
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:16,000
So, kent,

149
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,717
Do you always bowl women over
the first time you meet them?

150
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:23,016
Why, don't be so hard on him.
He just found out th his old flame

151
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:25,400
Is doing the last tangon paris
with a french philanthropist.

152
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:28,099
- It's not as bad as you think.
- No need to put on an act.

153
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,799
I know all about unrequited love.

154
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,392
I have had more heroes exit
stage left than a greek tragedy.

155
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,504
But you know what i find helps?

156
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,945
Talking about it.

157
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,499
I'm gonna be at o'malley's after work.

158
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,567
Find me, and i'll buy you a cold one.

159
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:46,700
That's what it says on my pulitzer.

160
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:55,000
You're in possession of property
belonging to the u.S. Government.

161
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,538
Come with us.

162
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,600
What are you doing?

163
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,500
This is official government business
and doesn't concern you.

164
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,300
Back off.

165
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,500
Whoa, take it easy, she-Man.

166
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,499
What just happed?

167
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Not sure, t if the head ofthe dds ma
it's got to be serious.

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,911
Dds?

169
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:30,393
C-Span much? The department
of domestic security.

170
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,399
That was linda danvers.
She was appointed last month.

171
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,751
- Who would appoint her?
- The only person who can...

172
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:36,552
The president of the united states.

173
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,900
I still can't believe that lex
luthor was elected president.

174
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:55,761
Hey, he played the fear card,
got the most votes. End of civic class.

175
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,800
Ever since he rounded up the meteor
freaks, he's been a national hero.

176
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,852
Meteor freaks?
There was still a meteor shower?

177
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,300
Uh, yeah,
made headlines coast-To-Coast.

178
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:04,799
Luthor saved the day.

179
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,499
Does lois' arrest
have anything to do with lex?

180
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,499
Oh, so now you're on a first-Name
basis with the president?

181
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,787
I just know he can be dangerous.
Lois is a friend of mine.

182
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,898
- I don't want to see her get hurt.
- Aren't you sipping the poison

183
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,163
A little quick, romeo?
You two just met.

184
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:17,130
There must be some way
we can help her.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,900
Look, i'm just trying to keep my own
butt out of an orange jumpsuit.

186
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,036
Tell me where they took her.

187
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:24,899
All i know is she dropped
this mess in my lap,

188
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,327
And i got to clean house before
big brother comes knocking.

189
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,300
Hey, give me that back

190
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,923
What do you think that you're doing?

191
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,142
What does this mean?

192
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,104
I'm just a messenger.

193
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:38,927
Lois doesn't like courier services,
so i make her deliveries.

194
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,267
Where were you taking it?

195
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,017
Oh, i guess you didn't get the memo
that said, "why should i tell you?"

196
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,698
Oh, that's a good answer.

197
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,370
It's the ace of clubs.

198
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,830
Look for the suit at the end of
the bar. That's all i know.

199
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,623
Your messenger days are over.

200
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:29,788
Sheriff adams?

201
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,765
Long time since anyone's
called me by that handle.

202
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,714
- Do i know you?
- I grew up in smallville.

203
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:42,500
I kicked that town's dust
off my boots a long time ago.

204
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,699
What's your business here?

205
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,420
I'm making a delivery.

206
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,698
Why the hell is this open?

207
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,699
I want to know what's going on,

208
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,571
Or lois lane won't be the only one
in trouble with the government.

209
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,730
You're out of your league here, slim.

210
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:01,700
I am the government.

211
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,500
Now, get back to smallville

212
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:07,600
Before i lose my ladylike charm
and arrest your hide.

213
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,055
You mean like you did to lois lane?

214
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,500
Lane was arrested?

215
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,321
Don't act so surprised.
The dds picked her up this morning.

216
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:22,900
Look, the dds said that lois was in posssion
of something that belonged to the government.

217
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,196
Whatever it was came from you, didn't it?

218
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,126
You're her informant.

219
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,658
If anyone hears about this,

220
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,138
I will hunt you down

221
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:38,804
Like a henhouse fox.
Do you hear me?

222
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,330
I only want to help.
Tell me where she is.

223
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:45,509
If the department picked her up,
no one can help her now,

224
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,900
Not even me.

225
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,720
Just let me try.

226
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,299
Don't bother.

227
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,083
Just give it up.

228
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:55,800
I don't give up.

229
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,500
Tell me where i can find lois lane.

230
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,000
Bring her inside and lock her up.

231
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,740
Don't let anyone talk to her
until i have a turn.

232
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:16,200
Don't touch me.

233
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,300
What is this place?

234
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
You okay?

235
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,245
Yeah

236
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:43,900
Talk about sweeping a girl
off her feet.

237
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:03,000
Pretty handy having
a meteor freak on my side.

238
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,373
- I'm not a meteor freak.
- Right.

239
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,899
It may be a mess, but i thought
olsen's loft is the last place

240
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,799
Luthor's storm troopers
would come looking for us.

241
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,024
You mind telling me why
you're public enemy number one?

242
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:16,099
I'm not. I happen to have
a highly classified document

243
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,300
That proves luthor is putting
the country in jeopardy. Look at this.

244
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:23,778
Satellite images have revealed that our
enemy has deployed nuclear missiles

245
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:26,116
Within striking distance
of our country.

246
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:27,900
My fellow americans,

247
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,600
A threat in our own backyard
will not be tolerated.

248
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,800
This hostile action leaves us no option

249
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,752
But to answer with force.

250
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,200
One little problem...

251
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,800
The threat is as phony
as my uncle's hair piece.

252
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,600
The missiles don't exist.

253
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,802
It's no surprise that lex would lie.

254
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,300
But why would he create
a national crisis that wasn't there?

255
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,800
While the dds was chauffeuring
me to my inquisition,

256
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:58,286
I overheard an agent saying they were
taking the eagle to the mountain top.

257
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:00,339
It sounds like some kind of code.

258
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,433
It means they're moving luthor
to the norad bunker.

259
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,600
They would only do that
for one reason...

260
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,100
Nuclear war.

261
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:10,300
And since the threat is fake,

262
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,900
It means he wants to give
the enemy a sucker punch

263
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,000
With a preemptive nuclear strike.

264
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:17,600
I need to post the truth
on the planet's front page

265
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,530
Before luthor presses the button.

266
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,200
But if lex goes through
with this strike,

267
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:23,700
He's got to know that each side
will destroy the other.

268
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:26,754
Well, that's what i don't understand.
Luthor's not suicidal.

269
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,411
Why would he want to hit
earth's delete key?

270
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,173
Because of him.

271
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,300
Milton fine, the chief of staff?

272
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:42,800
He's powerful, but we're not
talking nuclear-Bomb powerful.

273
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,930
Somehow, he managed to get here.

274
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,658
What are you talking about?

275
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:48,700
He's behind it all, lois.

276
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,200
Milton fine doesn't care
what happens to this planet

277
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,120
Because he's not human.

278
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,898
He's a machine.

279
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,999
You might come across
a little stiff on "larry king,"

280
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,599
But you're saying he's an android?

281
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,299
If i was here to take him on,
none of this would have happened.

282
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
I thought everything would be
better off if i wasn't involved,

283
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,500
But it turns out it's worse
than i ever imagined.

284
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:14,587
I don't understand. How does any of
this have anything to do with you?

285
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,400
You're an android, aren't you?

286
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm the one person
who can defeat fine.

287
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:28,200
I need you to trust me.

288
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:36,674
Luthor's holding a press conference
in smallville in 20 minutes.

289
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,399
The only way to stop his plan

290
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,300
Is to get to the briefcase
with the nuclear-Attack codes.

291
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:43,800
If i destroy it, then he can't
initiate the launch.

292
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,937
They guard that nuclear football
better than the hope diamond.

293
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:48,579
I'll get past security.

294
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,939
Wait.

295
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,000
Even if you white-Tornado
your way in there,

296
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,515
You're still gonna stick out
like a red-And-Blue thumb.

297
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:57,642
You need to blend in.

298
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:04,399
Olsen's room mate's
about the right size.

299
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,339
Lois, we don't have time for this.

300
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,063
Then, stop standing around. Strip.

301
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,892
All right.

302
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,099
Kent, this is no time to be modest.

303
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,027
Armageddon's minutes away.

304
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,088
Well done.

305
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,036
Here. Put this on.

306
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:45,700
If anyone asks, it's a typo.
Your name's louis.

307
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,320
What's wrong now?

308
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:54,708
Something's missing.

309
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,199
Considering your
extraordinary abilities,

310
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,640
It's hard to believe
miss lane escaped from you,

311
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,952
Unless perhaps you wanted her to.

312
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:23,486
After all the years we've been together,
you turn on me now.

313
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,917
You're like my brother, lex.

314
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,699
You know i'll always be loyal to you.

315
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,200
Letting my enemies escape
is an odd way of showing it.

316
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,099
You don't know your true enemy.

317
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,839
His name is milton fine.

318
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:38,945
Really?

319
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,500
My closest adviser,

320
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:43,664
The man who got me elected?

321
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:45,386
He didn't do it alone.

322
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,900
I used every ability i have
to make sure you got what you wanted.

323
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:52,700
All i ever wanted was for mankind
to reach its highest potential.

324
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:55,276
We're so close.

325
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:58,500
And you betrayed me the very
moment i needed you most.

326
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,965
I've already seen
one planet destroyed.

327
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

328
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,000
I confiscated this
from lois lane's office.

329
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,600
It's a memo signed by fine
authorizing the false reports.

330
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:18,000
There are no missiles threatening us.

331
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,599
So, it's not betrayal
i should fear from you,

332
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,577
Just a simple lack of faith.

333
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,542
I'd never doubt you, lex.

334
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:29,189
It's milton fine.

335
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,173
Lex, what are you doing?

336
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,400
He was following my orders.

337
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:40,306
You disappoint me, kara.

338
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:43,621
With everything
my family's done for you,

339
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,914
To question my judgment.

340
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:49,767
It's only because
i care about you.

341
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:57,400
Since the day my father found your
ship submerged in the reeves dam,

342
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,836
He loved you like you
were his own daughter.

343
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,600
He died guarding your secret
from the world.

344
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,091
I know, and i owe my life to
both of you, but this country...

345
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,400
What do you know
about protecting this country?

346
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,851
You are an alien.

347
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:15,500
I am the president
of the united states of america.

348
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,200
By striking the enemy first,
i am ensuring our survival.

349
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,799
We will prevail.

350
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,600
And through it all,
i expect you to... look at me.

351
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:27,400
I expect you to stand by my side.

352
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:33,300
Of course, mr. President.

353
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,100
Sir, the press is gathering.
You have two minutes.

354
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:48,200
Great leaders are defined by the
difficult decisions they make.

355
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:59,300
Mr. President, history shall
forever remember your name.

356
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,230
This is a restricted area.
Leave at once.

357
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,145
- Reporters...
- Kara, listen to me.

358
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,886
How do you know that name?

359
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,627
Because i'm from krypton.
I'm your cousin.

360
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,300
I'm kal-El.

361
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,400
I was sent here to kill you.

362
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:51,626
I searched the globe
and couldn't find you.

363
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:54,699
Kal-El wasn't on the planet then,
so how can you be here now?

364
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,799
You're right.
I never existed in this world.

365
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,652
But somehow i'm here.

366
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:02,295
Time was altered. Something went wrong.
I can't explain what happened.

367
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:04,199
But right now, i need your help,

368
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,287
And we need to get the briefcase
with the nuclear codes away from lex.

369
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,000
I trust lex.

370
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,900
And i'm gonna stand by his side,

371
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:16,383
Just like he's done for me
all these years.

372
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,200
Kara, milton fine is brainiac.

373
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:23,442
He made it to earth?

374
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,758
It all makes sense.
I should have seen it.

375
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,339
He couldn't let you.

376
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:32,300
If you knew his true identity,

377
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:34,364
You would have kept him
from his mission.

378
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:40,400
Kara, together, we can stop
brainiac once and for all.

379
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:12,399
Who's this?

380
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,958
He's from krypton.

381
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,754
Please, just hear him out.

382
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:18,555
Lex, think about how you got
to this point in your life,

383
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,903
And you'll see that milton fine
was the one who led you here.

384
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:24,398
Lex, you know it's the truth.

385
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:26,439
He's manipulating you.

386
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:30,203
His goal is to gain access
to this country's nuclear arsenal.

387
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,399
Sometimes things go so horribly wrong

388
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,200
That the only way to fix them
is by starting over.

389
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,039
Is that what fine says?

390
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:43,800
Lex, his goal is to destroy mankind.

391
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:45,498
But not everyone.

392
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,196
America's best and brightest are safe.

393
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:51,015
They've already been shuttled to
bunkers throughout the country.

394
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,876
That doesn't make any sense.

395
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,108
There will be nothing for them
to come back to.

396
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:57,518
When the dust settles, we'll rebuild,

397
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
And i'll lead the survivors
into a new world.

398
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,689
Lex, what have you done?

399
00:26:33,297 --> 00:26:36,700
I thought one day i might have to
protect myselfm you, kara.

400
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm just sorry
that day's finally here.

401
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,300
You were supposed to be
by my side forever.

402
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:59,500
Take miss danvers to the chopper
and get her some medical attention.

403
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:01,739
Keep her handcuffed at all times.

404
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:11,088
Are you all right, mr. President?

405
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,811
Let's do it.

406
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:17,726
Lex, don't do this.

407
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:19,620
It's not too late.

408
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,500
The future is yours, mr. President.

409
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:33,948
Don't do it, lex

410
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:38,300
On my mark.

411
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:39,403
No.

412
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,100
Alpha, foxtrot, alpha,
six, four, zero, four.

413
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:46,216
- Code confirmed.
- Stop!

414
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:47,900
This is insane!

415
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,589
Initiate launch.

416
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:56,177
The team will assemble
at the norad bunker, sir.

417
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:58,014
I'll deal with the intruder.

418
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:00,700
Security will meet you outside
and take you to air force one.

419
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:14,290
You will not keep me from
the task i was programmed for.

420
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:17,200
Zod is still alive.

421
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,800
And trapped...

422
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:22,000
In the phantom zone.

423
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:26,300
With the humans gone, i would use kara
to release him through her fortress.

424
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,183
She'll never go along with it.

425
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:32,300
It didn't look like
she had much fight left in her.

426
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:37,300
But she'll heal. She's healthy.

427
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,600
So is lex luthor...

428
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,700
The vessel.

429
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,800
Together,
they will repopulate the planet,

430
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,600
And krypton will rise again.

431
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,700
You cannot change
the course of history, kal-El.

432
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,000
You disappoint me, my son

433
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,700
You cannot question your destiny
on this planet.

434
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:19,500
It was you!

435
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:24,500
You wanted to show me what the world
would be like if i wasn't here.

436
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:28,600
The disc in your hand revealed
your misguided intentions.

437
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,400
I was forced to show you
the error of your ways.

438
00:29:33,197 --> 00:29:36,600
I sent you to earth
for a purpose, kal-El,

439
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:39,833
One that cannot be taken lightly.

440
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:41,501
Send me back!

441
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:45,200
You must stop
the brain interactive construct

442
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:50,600
From altering history
and taking your life.

443
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,600
You cannot fail.

444
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:57,400
This time, there will be no second chances.

445
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,531
Clark, what happened?

446
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:06,400
I thought you were gone forever,

447
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,108
And then a millisecond later,
you're perfectly fine.

448
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:12,087
There's still time.
I have to make it right.

449
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,961
I have to go to krypton.

450
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:33,644
Hush, kal-El.

451
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:39,992
It's time to sleep.

452
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:48,300
Not every boy grows up to be a hero.

453
00:31:05,703 --> 00:31:10,000
Kal-El will die on krypton,

454
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:13,300
And now you will share his fate.

455
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:16,773
I won't let that happen.

456
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,600
You're gonna release lana.

457
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,100
You can't stop me, kal-El.

458
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:34,392
Clark, the baby.

459
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:45,500
There's no yellow sun
to charge you here.

460
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,014
You're not in kansas anymore.

461
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,500
Clark, get the baby on the ship
now before it's too late.

462
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:07,300
I'll handle brainiac. Go!

463
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,808
Hurry, clark. We have to leave.

464
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:10,400
Where's brainiac?

465
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:12,198
He's gone. He's destroyed.

466
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,800
Let's go.

467
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,600
Come on, clark.

468
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:29,702
To the portal. We've got to go.

469
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:59,500
Please, let me know
the minute anything changes.

470
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,783
The nurse said lana
seems worse than ever.

471
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:08,911
I know i destroyed brainiac.

472
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,429
I thought if he died,

473
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,193
It would break his grip
over lana, but i was wrong.

474
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,500
I don't know what else to do.

475
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,700
Clark, i am so sorry.

476
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:28,799
You know, maybe if we reopen
the portal to krypton...

477
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
We can't.

478
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,112
As much as i want lana well
again, there's no going back.

479
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:37,327
But if we go back, there's
so much more we could do.

480
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,700
We could save our home.

481
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,600
You don't know how many times
i wish i could've done that.

482
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:46,501
But you know it's possible.

483
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,000
If we just find
the right point in time,

484
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,745
We can fix everything.

485
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:53,667
But how do we know
we won't make it worse?

486
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,000
We can't change the past, kara.
We can only affect the future.

487
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,800
Whatever that future is,

488
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:12,900
I want you to know
that i'll always be there.

489
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,467
I'm here for you.

490
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:46,500
This place hasn't changed a bit
since i last saw it.

491
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:49,248
What are you doing here?

492
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:55,174
You were the last person
to see lana while she was well.

493
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:59,400
I figured you're the one to talk to
if i have any chance of helping her.

494
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,027
No one's asking for your help.

495
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:07,214
I'm only trying to save her, clark.

496
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:11,100
I had the best medical minds
in the world examine her.

497
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:19,000
Is there anything
thctors can do to help her?

498
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:23,000
They tell me her condition
is unlike any they've ever seen.

499
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:30,400
Several specialists
described it as almost alien.

500
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:35,700
So you're telling me
the best doctors in the world

501
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,742
Can't do anything to help lana?

502
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:40,400
Unfortunately, they've all come
to the same conclusion.

503
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:45,000
Her state is irreversible.

504
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:49,100
That's why i came to you, clark.

505
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:52,000
If we could find out
what triggered lana's syndrome,

506
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,914
Maybe we could have hope.

507
00:36:58,627 --> 00:37:00,300
Think, clark.

508
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:03,200
She was living with you.

509
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,300
Is there anything you can remember

510
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,700
That might explain
how this could have happened?

511
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:17,170
I wish there was.

512
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:30,300
If there's something you left
out that you'd like to share,

513
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,100
You know where to find me.

514
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,400
This is a new side
to clark kent...

515
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:00,600
Mild-Mannered reporter for
a great metropolitan newspaper.

516
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:02,814
Don't worry, lois,
i'm not after your job.

517
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:04,964
I'm just borrowing the planet's database.

518
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:07,192
Jimmy sent me up here. I hope it's okay.

519
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:09,967
Hey, mi desktop es su desktop.

520
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,700
What are you looking up?

521
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:19,100
I'm no expert,

522
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,800
But i'm sure that someone
is out there who can help lana.

523
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,999
You know with all my years
of watching "dr. Phil,"

524
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,915
You'd think i could come up
with the perfect thing to say, but

525
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm drawing a blank.

526
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:36,300
I don't do well with sad.

527
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,492
Don't beat yourself up over it, lois.

528
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,600
It's okay.

529
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,951
No, it's not.

530
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,900
Smallville, you were there for me

531
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:52,282
When i needed a shoulder to cry on,
and i am blowing this big-Time.

532
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:57,800
Look, i just wish i could
make everything all right.

533
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:02,600
You're a good friend, lois.

534
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:10,900
Hey, you know what?

535
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,800
Why don't we go drown our sorrows?

536
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:18,000
Why don't i buy you a brew?
You look like you could use one.

537
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:22,033
Seriously, check out
your driver's license.

538
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:23,623
We're legal now.

539
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,500
I'm not really
into the whole night life scene.

540
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:28,300
Well, i will have to take that
as a challenge.

541
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,200
The first round is on me.

542
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
