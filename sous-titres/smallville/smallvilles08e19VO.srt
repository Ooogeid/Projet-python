00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:01,630
<i>Previously on Smallville:</i>

2
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:04,088
Say that Clark Kent,
the unassuming journalist--

3
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:05,944
Steps out of the shadow
into his red and blue,

4
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:07,814
<i>creating two completely
separate identities?</i> 

5
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,017
No more than three tablets
a day.

6
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>They can be
highly addictive.</i>

7
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:13,662
And you're sure
this is it.

8
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:15,423
This is where I belong.

9
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,855
Watchtower
is officially online.

10
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:21,702
There is something
about being around you

11
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:24,482
<i>that seems to calm
the murderer inside me.</i>

12
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,763
I want you
to stay with me.

13
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:31,686
<i>Without a doubt,
I'm officially a true believer</i>

14
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:33,398
<i>in this red-and-blue
superdude.</i>

15
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:35,247
I won't stop until I land

16
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:37,592
the first worldwide
interview.

17
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:38,397
Good luck with that.

18
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,985
If you're not a member
of the press society,

19
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:53,122
you won't be on my list.

20
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,474
Check again.
"Lois Lane."

21
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,081
I've written a hundred stories
for <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

22
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:00,143
I'm sure
you've heard of it.

23
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:02,860
<i>It</i> I've heard of.
You -- not so much.

24
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:03,875
Again, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,561
Thank you.

26
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,677
Okay, obviously there's been
some sort of mistake.

27
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:13,236
It's not like I squeezed
into five-inch booted heels

28
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:13,789
for my health.

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,875
Miss Lane,
there's simply nothing I can do.

30
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:17,974
Actually, there is.

31
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,180
You can tell
Edward R. Murrow

32
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,331
that he can kiss this cub reporter's
sweet little ass.

33
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,885
<i>Lois!</i>

34
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:25,762
Chloe, thanks for coming.

35
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,380
The gargoyle at the gate was
letting in everyone but me.

36
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:30,409
Come on. My car's parked
around the corner.

37
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,915
That was <i>the</i> event
for journalistic achievement,

38
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,899
and Lois Lane
isn't even a "plus one."

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,587
Lois,
you're an amazing reporter.

40
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:39,810
Uh, correction --
<i>was</i> an amazing reporter.

41
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,571
You're only as good
as your last story,

42
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:42,951
and I wrote mine
so long ago...

43
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:44,976
It was practically
with a Feather pen.

44
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,347
I need
that news splash--

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,956
The pregnant man
or an impeached president...

46
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,962
Or, better yet,
a rendezvous with a superhero.

47
00:01:53,737 --> 00:01:55,544
I thought you gave up
on the costumed crusaders

48
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:58,016
after the Red-Blue Blur
ignored your open letter,

49
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:59,633
begging for an interview.

50
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,087
Can you blame the guy?
What was I thinking?

51
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,405
If you want your first interview
with a rock star,

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,976
you don't start
with Springsteen.

53
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,858
I had no idea

54
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:10,910
you were such a groupie
of the red, bold, and blue.

55
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:12,168
Well, who <i>isn't?</i>

56
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,666
The man has reinvented
the American hero.

57
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,199
Think about it.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,069
He saves people.

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,829
He's mysterious,
completely unavailable.

60
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:23,250
What part of that
doesn't scream "Lois Lane"?!

61
00:02:24,513 --> 00:02:27,004
God, you seriously have a crush
on him, don't you?

62
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,185
I respect his heroism,
professionally.

63
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,582
But even when I did
lower the bar

64
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,304
and tried to slum
a Green Arrow interview,

65
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,919
it turns out
Mr. Emerald Chaps

66
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,624
is another closet case
when it comes to publicity.

67
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,934
Lois, they wear costumes because
they don't <i>want</i> publicity.

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,509
Now, hurry up.
I'm parked illegally.

69
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,246
Ugh. Hold on.
These heels are silent killers.

70
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:47,680
<i>No!</i>

71
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:48,894
Chloe.

72
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:49,779
<i>Lois!</i>

73
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,346
<i>Just give me the keys.</i>

74
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:06,630
Ohh!

75
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,800
This one's
for your friend.

76
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,861
Oh, G--

77
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,985
Who the hell are you,
some sort of superhero?

78
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,114
You bet I am.

79
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,064
Call me Stiletto.

80
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:44,434
S08E17:
Stiletto

81
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,280
I know, Davis.
I was sidetracked.

82
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:38,634
I'll be home in like
20 minutes.

83
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,297
You're still
in the basement, right?

84
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,542
- Good.
- Miss Sullivan?

85
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,944
You took a pretty hard
hit to the head.

86
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,376
You should stick around
for observation.

87
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,218
I'm fine, thanks.

88
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,435
It's my
professional advice--

89
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,316
I appreciate that,
but I do have to go.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,243
Chloe,
is this what it takes

91
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,577
to get a call back from you
these days?

92
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:55,530
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks for coming.

93
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,775
Sorry about being
the invisible best friend lately.

94
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:59,017
Where <i>have</i> you been?

95
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:01,714
Um, Watchtower.

96
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,140
Just when I thought
I'd hit my fill

97
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,895
of, uh, high-maintenance men,
I take a job from Oliver.

98
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,172
I thought
he was off the grid.

99
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,127
He's in Syria...

100
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,947
Sort of incommunicado
with the rest of the world.

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,469
Which is why I'm glad
you're here.

102
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,290
My laptop
was in my backseat

103
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,762
when the carjacker
peeled away.

104
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,811
I've been using it

105
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:21,677
to update my Watchtower
databases from home.

106
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,083
Chloe,
those files contain details

107
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,972
of nearly every operation.

108
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:25,137
Hence,
the panicky flare

109
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,197
with everything
I've been saying.

110
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,278
And before you bite my head off,
I admit--

111
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,207
I know-- I never
should have taken it home.

112
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:31,606
Just tell me
it was encrypted.

113
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,605
But not un-hackable.

114
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,703
Okay,
I'll find your computer.

115
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:41,779
Did you get a good look
at the mugger?

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,976
I got a good look at the asphalt
after he hit me.

117
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:46,856
But there <i>was</i>
another witness.

118
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:48,402
When I came to
in the ambulance,

119
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:51,239
Lois was raving about
some mysterious heroine

120
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,695
who swept in and saved the day--
Stiletto?

121
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,310
Must be some kind
of knife expert.

122
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,116
Where is Lois, anyway?

123
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:03,391
There may be a new superhero
in town.

124
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:04,498
Where do you <i>think</i>
she is?

125
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:10,596
<i>Page 10!</i>

126
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:12,754
Why don't you just bury
my stiletto sighting

127
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:14,305
with the classifieds
while you're at it?

128
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,156
The next time you pull me
from a press-society banquet,

129
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,807
at least get me a story
with a picture.

130
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,974
Something tells me Stiletto's
got a bad case of camera shy.

131
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:23,803
She's not posing
for a head shot.

132
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:25,733
Get her in action
on the street.

133
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,805
Sure,
no problem.

134
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,351
I'll just ask to see
her schedule of upcoming saves.

135
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,920
What?
Did I misjudge you, Lane?

136
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,849
I thought your game was all
about the power of persuasion.

137
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,521
Get the picture!

138
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:51,372
<i>Lois.</i>

139
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,289
Chloe told me
about the attack.

140
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,217
She said you mentioned someone
named Stiletto?

141
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,946
Patience, Smallville.

142
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,188
Tomorrow you can drool over her
with the rest of the world.

143
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,482
<i>I'm</i> fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking.

144
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,005
Stiletto gave you
all these quotes?

145
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,488
She was talkative.

146
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:20,187
Look,
I need you to put me

147
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,157
in contact with her.

148
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,839
Get your own hero.

149
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:26,718
I have to respect
her request to keep a low profile.

150
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:27,719
It is not everyday...

151
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,412
that a superhero entrusts me
with her phone number.

152
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:32,640
She gave you
her number?

153
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,595
Sorry.
My eyes only, Smallville.

154
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,343
Lois, this carjacker took
Chloe's computer.

155
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:43,352
It has all her
Isis client information on it.

156
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,832
If this Stiletto was the last
person to see this guy,

157
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,091
I <i>need</i>
to talk to her.

158
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,834
Look,
if you want to help Chloe,

159
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:53,298
why don't you
go downtown

160
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,053
and talk to the thug
they <i>did</i> catch?

161
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,558
Maybe Stiletto left enough teeth
in his mouth

162
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:58,858
for him to rat out
his buddy.

163
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:31,727
Rye whiskey, double.

164
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,554
Right away,
Mr. Manheim.

165
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,021
Hey, ugly.

166
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,738
The boss wants to see you,
and he doesn't look very happy.

167
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,280
I bet he's not;
Mr. Businessman.

168
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,185
Hey, uh, real quick--

169
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:56,618
Sorry.

170
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,830
Look, uh,
I-I know I just started,

171
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,245
but I was wondering
if I could, uh...

172
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:06,007
Get an advance
on today's pay?

173
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:08,108
Yeah.

174
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:09,984
Just had some...

175
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,083
stuff... come up.

176
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,695
I'll talk to Ricky.

177
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:17,555
But this is
the last time.

178
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:54,356
I was hoping,
at the very least,

179
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,268
A.J. was arrested
for a Dolce & Gabbana.

180
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,486
Somebody clocked us.

181
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,020
We had to get out of there,
Mr. Milano.

182
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:04,382
Bruno, I'm trying to pull us out
of the streets.

183
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,544
We finally cracked
the metallic tint

184
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,368
<i>with those green rocks
from Smallville.</i>

185
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,825
We can make all the money
in the world,

186
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,613
and you're out there
snatching purses.

187
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,108
It's not
about the door prize.

188
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,441
It's about
reminding people

189
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,863
we're the ones
who own this town,

190
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:23,707
not some cape-wearing
circus freaks.

191
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:24,769
Yeah.

192
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:30,699
Between the gash on your mug
and A.J.'s shiner,

193
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:33,724
you two clowns are
<i>real</i> intimidating.

194
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,675
How can you
just sit back

195
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:37,808
and let these vigilantes
take over the streets?

196
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:38,512
<i>Our</i> streets?!

197
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,315
Enough!

198
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:42,047
We are done
with petty street crime!

199
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,279
We are a business now!

200
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:48,303
Yeah, you're--

201
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:50,710
You're right, boss.

202
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:58,773
Maybe it's time
for Bruno Manheim

203
00:10:58,798 --> 00:11:00,090
to climb
that corporate ladder.

204
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,488
Next we say good night
to the wannabe heroes.

205
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,495
Starting with Stiletto.

206
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:26,628
That one's personal.

207
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:59,157
Lois?

208
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:02,448
Lois, come on!
I can't be late for work!

209
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:08,607
What are you doing?

210
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:12,632
Picking up your rebound.

211
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,484
Lois.

212
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:25,942
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

213
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:26,899
I'm really flattered,

214
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,566
but I <i>just</i> broke up
with Chloe.

215
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:31,213
Ew. No.

216
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,958
I mean
rebound your career.

217
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,581
Nothing numbs the pain
of a breakup

218
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:38,789
like good,
old-fashioned work.

219
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,827
Look,
I'm not here to be saved.

220
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:42,664
You mentioned
a 100 bucks.

221
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:43,723
Now, what do you
want me to shoot?

222
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:57,040
Metropolis'
newest superhero.

223
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:00,667
Incoming.

224
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,016
Meet...

225
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,202
Stiletto.

226
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,280
I was gonna sew an "S"
into the chest.

227
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,158
Is that tacky?

228
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:10,048
Lois...

229
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:13,226
You're not serious.

230
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:14,893
Well,
not about the whole

231
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:16,726
"Cleaning up the streets" part,
obviously.

232
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:18,924
But...

233
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,792
I sort of quoted Stiletto
in one of my articles,

234
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:28,362
and my editor said that I need
a photo to get a page one.

235
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:34,058
Well, I guess I didn't see
the giant asterisk

236
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,810
above
"Lois Lane's Rules to Reporting"

237
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:37,055
that said
"or just make it up."

238
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,373
Hey!
Unlike you,

239
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:41,715
some of us haven't gotten
our up-close-and-personal

240
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,002
with
the Red-Blue Blur yet.

241
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:44,739
Now.

242
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:46,829
You know, look,

243
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,473
I know that you're dying
for a story with the guy,

244
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:49,620
but he doesn't talk to
<i>anybody.</i>

245
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:51,641
No offense, but...

246
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,241
Why's he gonna talk
to <i>you?</i>

247
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:55,895
Exactly.

248
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,821
The Red-Blue Blur might not talk
to me at first,

249
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,103
but a fellow superhero
like Stiletto

250
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,800
might just get his attention
long enough

251
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,897
to pitch the writing prowess
of the great Lois Lane.

252
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:09,927
<i>Ready?</i>

253
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:15,485
[ camera shutter clicking ]

254
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,446
Hey, well,
good luck with that.

255
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:21,701
Last I checked,
he's kind of invisible.

256
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:25,875
But crime
in this city <i>isn't.</i>

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,231
And when that police scanner
goes off,

258
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,487
the Red-Blue Blur
is never far behind.

259
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,263
<i>E-mail those photos
to my editor.</i>

260
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,154
I'm off to talk
to a <i>real</i> hero.

261
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,175
Chloe, it turns out
Lois' superfriend

262
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,331
may be our <i>only</i> hope
in getting your laptop back.

263
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:51,341
According to Met P.D.,
Stiletto's takedown posted bail

264
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,737
before they ever got him
behind bars.

265
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,368
Well, I haven't been able
to find any more leads

266
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:55,660
on Stiletto's
whereabouts,

267
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,091
but you might want to take
a look at <i>this.</i>

268
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:03,788
"Blur-etto"?

269
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:07,828
You know you've made it
when you have your own fansite.

270
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,412
And it looks like
your fans

271
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,085
are doing
a little matchmaking.

272
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,927
"No one understands a hero's
life of solitude better

273
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:15,947
<i>than a fellow cape"?</i>

274
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,300
"These two lonely hearts
belong together."

275
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,250
Who thinks
this stuff up?

276
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,583
Are they that far
off the mark?

277
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,071
Look, Chloe,

278
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,187
romance is the last thing
on my mind right now.

279
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,373
I know,
but let's face it.

280
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,133
You thought you found your
superpowered soul mate in Lana,

281
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:36,118
and I haven't heard you say
a word about her since she left.

282
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,728
That's because
I have <i>you.</i>

283
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:40,836
Come on, Clark.

284
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:44,048
I know I haven't been the most
reliable sidekick lately,

285
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,052
and Oliver and his gang
are M.I.A.

286
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:47,990
Having someone on speed dial

287
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:49,744
who knows what it's like
to lead a double life

288
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:51,414
might not be
such a bad thing.

289
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:53,998
My double life and I
are just fine.

290
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,587
I'd rather focus
on finding Stiletto

291
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,738
and getting
your computer back.

292
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,130
Okay.

293
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:01,587
But bold as she may be,

294
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,683
I seriously doubt we're gonna be
able to call her out

295
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,849
by putting a spike heel
over a klieg light.

296
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,365
Isn't it almost your bedtime,
Smallville?

297
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,773
Just finishing up some work
while I'm still motivated.

298
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:50,716
Slow night.

299
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,410
I'm good
if you want to go.

300
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:55,906
If the Red-Blue Blur
calls,

301
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,070
I'll be sure
to patch him through.

302
00:16:58,228 --> 00:16:58,948
Oh, that's right,

303
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:00,261
because your idea
of being a hero

304
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:02,505
is making sure there's still
paper in the fax machine.

305
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:05,009
Just doing my job.

306
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,145
Well, you're wasting
your midnight oil

307
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:08,227
because,
between the two of us,

308
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:10,454
the editor is only counting
the empty coffee cups

309
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:11,216
on my desk.

310
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,598
And that's because
you're in the big leagues

311
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:13,786
and I'm still just
a copy boy?

312
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,400
No, because you're doing way
better than anyone expected!

313
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:21,953
<i>Attention,

314
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:23,880

<i>on Fifth and Water,

316
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,105
Well,
I better go feed Shelby.

317
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:31,810
I should hit the gym.

318
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:51,981
I know I'm late.

319
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:53,987
I, uh, I got caught up
in a little project.

320
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:57,981
Are you taking pictures
of the sunset, bar boy?

321
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,648
This is a nice
tele-macro zoom.

322
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:04,484
Used to be a...
journalist, didn't you?

323
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,366
What are you doing here?

324
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,995
Now,
this is interesting.

325
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:13,488
<i>Blondie looks a lot</i>

326
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,103
different
when she's smiling.

327
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:16,903
Adorable.

328
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,705
Give me my camera back.

329
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:18,904
Unh-unh-unh.

330
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,547
What's going on here?

331
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:40,350
Do you know her?

332
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:42,743
- Her?
- Yeah.

333
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:45,652
No.
That's just a fluke.

334
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:49,872
Where is she?

335
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,767
You having a hard time
hearing me?

336
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,769
I said,
"Where is she?"

337
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:16,432
Where's Stiletto?

338
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,640
I have no idea.

339
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,755
Look, I don't know
where she is.

340
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:31,050
What is <i>wrong</i>
with you?

341
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,283
It's like you <i>want</i> me
to kill you.

342
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,245
Who's the hero now?

343
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:53,247
Way to go.
Now he's out.

344
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,222
Ah, he's worthless.

345
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:56,858
But it seems <i>everyone</i>
is in on Stiletto.

346
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:59,957
Get Ricky to hack
into that stolen laptop.

347
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:01,507
In the meantime,

348
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:03,837
I want you to go
right to the source.

349
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:05,978
Let's see what else we can
squeeze out of Blondie.

350
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,990
Wonderful.
Very stealth, Lois.

351
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:41,184
Ugh.

352
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,783
Next time,
I call myself "Nike."

353
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,312
He beat me here.

354
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:01,952
Hello?

355
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:05,098
<i>Are you here?</i>

356
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,987
Are you the Stiletto?

357
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,367
Can I just say
it's an honor?

358
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:22,595
Lois?

359
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:31,555
Lois?

360
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,009
<i>Who's Lois?</i>

361
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,426
I'm Stiletto.

362
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:38,713
I should get back
to my cave.

363
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,309
Lois, you could have a bag
over your head,

364
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,487
and I'd <i>still</i>
know it's you.

365
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,846
Go figure.
I want the Red-Blue Blur.

366
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:51,981
I get the exact opposite.

367
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,044
What do you think
you're doing?

368
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:54,785
What are <i>you</i> doing?

369
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,403
You're supposed to be
feeding Shelby.

370
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:58,523
Seriously, is there any woman
in your life

371
00:21:58,562 --> 00:21:59,500
you haven't stood up?

372
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,094
I saw the way you looked
at that scanner,

373
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,888
and I know how much you want
this superhero story.

374
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,539
So I came here
to make sure you were okay.

375
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:07,807
You're obviously not if you're
impersonating the Stiletto.

376
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:08,942
Okay, first off,

377
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:10,313
it's just "Stiletto."

378
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,378
There's no "the."

379
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,982
And second,
I'm not impersonating anyone.

380
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,732
I <i>am</i> Stiletto.

381
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:22,258
You made up a fake hero
so you could write her story?

382
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:24,906
Yeah.

383
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:31,826
Stiletto's only the beginning,
Clark.

384
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,492
These heels could kick open
some major doors for me.

385
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,117
What if Stiletto could help me
land a one-on-one

386
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,127
with the Red-Blue Blur?

387
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,021
Oh, this blur, he...

388
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:41,541
He avoids reporters
for a reason.

389
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,288
What would you say to him
no one else already has?

390
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:45,863
I wouldn't say anything, Clark.
I'd <i>listen.</i>

391
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,249
What if he's not looking
for a best friend?

392
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,267
Superpowered or not,
every Fred needs a Barney.

393
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,516
Unless it's based
on a lie.

394
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,751
Besides,
it could be dangerous.

395
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,680
Eventually, you'll find yourself
in a situation

396
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,283
you can't Stiletto yourself
out of.

397
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,327
Stiletto kicked ass
last night.

398
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:07,890
You should have seen the guy
I sent downtown.

399
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,476
I couldn't --
by the time I got there,

400
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,507
some attorney named Moynihan
already got him off

401
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,972
before I could talk to him
about Chloe's car.

402
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:14,546
Chris Moynihan?

403
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,283
He represents Ron Milano.

404
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,248
The biggest crime boss
in Metropolis.

405
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,126
Then let's go save
the world.

406
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,119
I'm in the market
for a sidekick anyway.

407
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,189
Just don't slow me down.

408
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,423
I'll find Milano
on my own.

409
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,693
You're gonna do everything
you can

410
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,201
to make sure your Stiletto story
doesn't get published.

411
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:46,909
Did you know your
transmission slips a bit in third?

412
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:48,025
What are you doing here?

413
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,231
What do you know
about Stiletto?

414
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,945
Stiletto? I don't know
who you're talking about.

415
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:54,356
Let me go!

416
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:57,665
No!

417
00:23:57,738 --> 00:24:00,137
Ugh!

418
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,460
You do <i>not</i> want
to lie to me.

419
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,128
I swear to God I don't know
who Stiletto is.

420
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,175
I never saw her.

421
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:09,326
Okay, sweetheart,
but if you do,

422
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:10,996
I'd like to leave
a message.

423
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,832
Hello to you, too.
Expecting Freddy Krueger?

424
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,223
What are you doing here?

425
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,927
I thought you were
tracking down Stiletto.

426
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:50,348
Well, the story broke
a proverbial heel.

427
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:51,943
It's not happening.

428
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,857
Oh. Bummer.

429
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,783
Oh, well.
I mean, it is Friday night.

430
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
There's bound to be
a tequila shooter

431
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,011
out on this town
with your name on it.

432
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,227
Why don't you go out,
you know, have fun?

433
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,403
I'm not actually here
to hang,

434
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,691
but 10-4 on the
loud-and-clear un-vitation.

435
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,441
Jimmy's not answering
his phone,

436
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:17,570
and I was just wondering
if perhaps you knew--

437
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,590
Where my ex was?

438
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,713
I thought that's what
Facebook updates were for.

439
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,098
Why are you even
looking for him?

440
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:29,601
I needed his help
photographing something,

441
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:31,444
and now I need his help
burning the evidence.

442
00:25:35,264 --> 00:25:36,315
Fine.
You know what?

443
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,147
Surprise!

444
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:41,864
I'm Stiletto.

445
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:43,668
Lois.

446
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:46,384
Oh, my God,
you did this for a story.

447
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:47,847
Didn't you?

448
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:52,183
Okay.

449
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:55,979
Clark's diatribe is still
ringing in my ears.

450
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,778
I don't need it
in surround sound.

451
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:01,742
I get it.
I messed up.

452
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,317
Like you've never gotten in
over your head?

453
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,226
Actually,
Lois, um...

454
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:18,304
Can I tell you
something?

455
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:22,729
Sure.

456
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:30,506
Jimmy should be
at the Ace of Clubs.

457
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,299
I really need to remove him
from my Facebook friends,

458
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:39,874
don't I?

459
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,383
Yeah.

460
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:46,011
Thanks, Chlo.

461
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:52,979
And...

462
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:55,323
Thank you
for understanding.

463
00:26:58,246 --> 00:26:59,548
Anytime, Lois.

464
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:19,880
<i>Hey, Bruno,
check this out.</i>

465
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:20,827
<i>Yeah?</i>

466
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,671
<i>I just unlocked a
whole mess of files.</i>

467
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:28,624
Who the hell
are <i>these</i> guys?

468
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,887
Ugh!

469
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:07,812
Jimmy?

470
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:33,507
Jimmy.

471
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:37,990
Ugh!

472
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:43,966
How the hell did
you get back here?

473
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:56,454
<i>Do you know
who you're talking to?</i>

474
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,545
Do you know
who <i>I</i> am?

475
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:03,284
You want to mess with <i>me?</i>
You want to mess with me?

476
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,320
<i>You want to
push me?</i>

477
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:08,794
- Oh, my God!
- <i>You want to push me, punk?</i>

478
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,420
<i>Hey, come on, Bruno!
Back up, man!</i>

479
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:14,396
<i>- You're gonna kill him!
- Come on.</i>

480
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:17,006
Seriously?
Ohh.

481
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:27,687
Clark Kent of
<i>The Daily Planet.</i>

482
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:33,878
Looks like you reporters think
you got a little story here.

483
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:35,316
Oh, that's it.

484
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,688
Wow, that's far.

485
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,032
If you want,
I can tell you how it ends.

486
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:56,438
Come on, Lois.

487
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:08,100
Ugh!

488
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,794
That worked.

489
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:17,457
Jimmy.

490
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:25,970
Stiletto has no idea
what she just stepped in.

491
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,187
Lois!

492
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:39,679
Clark!

493
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,738
Clark!

494
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,010
Hang in there.
You're gonna be just fine.

495
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:08,551
Oh, my God.

496
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,999
Dial 911.

497
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:15,213
Why did you do that,
Clark?

498
00:31:15,947 --> 00:31:17,729
You didn't need to be
some kind of hero.

499
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:19,327
<i>Lois...</i>

500
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:22,357
You have to get me
out of here.

501
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,463
Okay. Okay.

502
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:27,758
- Come on.
- The medics are on their way.

503
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:32,400
Come on, superhero.

504
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:34,279
You're gonna be fine.

505
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,206
Nothing like
a double-frosted bear claw

506
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,815
to ease the pain
of a flesh wound, right?

507
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:00,477
Oh, and I, uh, didn't know
whether you wanted your copies

508
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:01,364
single-sided
or double,

509
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:02,520
so I did both,
and then I thought,

510
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,594
"Hmm, three-holed
or no-holed?"

511
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:04,871
And I didn't know,
so I did both,

512
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:06,003
which is why there's...
so many.

513
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:08,559
Lois, you didn't have
to do all this.

514
00:33:11,677 --> 00:33:12,579
But thank you.

515
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:21,856
Looks like you got
your cover story after all.

516
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:24,914
I guess.

517
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:26,465
You <i>guess?</i>

518
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:29,043
The last time your name
was above the fold,

519
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:32,047
you held
a champagne toast.

520
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:35,961
Is there something
about this article

521
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:36,963
that's still
bothering you?

522
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:40,127
Fine, I admit it.

523
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:42,867
Sometimes,
the Lois "Fast" Lane ambition

524
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:44,665
ramps into cruise control
and gets away from me.

525
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,066
Those mob guys
would still be on the street

526
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:49,387
if you hadn't come
to my rescue.

527
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:52,161
<i>Your</i> rescue.

528
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:55,037
Yeah, right.

529
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:57,506
You're the one
with the...

530
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,580
Smallville,
if you hadn't been there to...

531
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,492
You're welcome, Lois.

532
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:19,560
<i>I hope this means</i>

533
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:21,439
that Stiletto's hanging up
her heels for good.

534
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:22,253
Gladly.

535
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,830
Those heels were giving
my blisters blisters.

536
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:28,140
Besides,
if Manheim had better aim,

537
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:29,713
you'd be dead.

538
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,939
And it was really sweet
of you to, you know...

539
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:34,477
Throw yourself in there,
but, uh...

540
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:35,885
I never should have put you
in danger.

541
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:38,091
It's not like you save lives
for a living.

542
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:41,400
No, there's only one
Red-Blue Blur.

543
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:45,096
Honestly,
I don't envy the guy.

544
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,235
After walking a mile
in Stiletto's shoes,

545
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,058
I was reminded
that I am not cut out

546
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:51,455
for that life
of solitude.

547
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,588
I didn't know there was
room for introspection

548
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,874
underneath that costume.

549
00:34:59,105 --> 00:34:59,960
Wow.

550
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:02,652
Look who got grazed
by a funny bullet.

551
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,030
You weren't gonna eat this,
were you?

552
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:25,729
Hey, man.

553
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,654
Didn't think I'd be hearing
from <i>you</i> again.

554
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,332
Yeah, well, let's just get this
over with, okay?

555
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,303
You're the one that said
he was strapped for cash.

556
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:37,572
Well,
I guess things change.

557
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:08,467
Hey, Clark!
Thank you.

558
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,912
I never thought
it would feel so good

559
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:12,902
to be reunited with a bunch
of silicone microchips.

560
00:36:13,076 --> 00:36:14,363
I grabbed it
before the police arrived.

561
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,736
So hopefully Manheim wasn't able
to pull any files off it.

562
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:18,856
Well, rest assured,

563
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:21,165
Tony Soprano Jr.
is my last close call.

564
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:23,518
I am done traveling
with all of my techno treasures

565
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:24,387
in one basket.

566
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,813
Are you
expecting company?

567
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:30,035
Uh, no.

568
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:34,519
Turns out that my
body's natural reaction to stress

569
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,659
is to bake undigestible amounts
of food.

570
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:38,495
Really?

571
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,839
After all the near-apocalypses
<i>we've</i> been through,

572
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,482
I've never seen more
than a chocolate-chip cookie

573
00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:44,415
come out of that oven.

574
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:48,302
Are you okay?

575
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:51,747
It's...

576
00:36:52,616 --> 00:36:54,228
I mean,
you almost died yesterday...

577
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:56,721
For my computer.

578
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,091
Chloe,
you made an honest mistake.

579
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,361
I'm fine.

580
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,330
I know you better
than that.

581
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,548
This is not
about a computer.

582
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:10,837
What's wrong?

583
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:14,013
Nothing.

584
00:37:15,545 --> 00:37:16,766
Really, I'm fine.

585
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,800
Look, I apologize if I've been
a little off my game lately.

586
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:25,095
<i>It's just
that after my divorce</i>

587
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:26,554
and Brainiac
and now...

588
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:29,130
playing Watchtower
to a bunch of needy superheroes,

589
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:31,306
I forget that I need to be
all smiles all the time.

590
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,893
Chloe, no one expects you
to bounce back

591
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,257
from everything
you've been through.

592
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,712
I just want you to know I'm here
for you if you need me.

593
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:41,902
I know.

594
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,642
But right now I really just need
a little bit of space...

595
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:51,045
Not a supersave, okay?

596
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:30,977
When am I gonna learn
that a wild-goose chase

597
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:33,033
for a story usually ends
with a rotten egg?

598
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:55,786
Hello?

599
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:58,130
<i>Is this Lois Lane,
the reporter?</i>

600
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,650
Who wants to know?

601
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,941
<i>This is
the Red-Blue Blur.</i>

602
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:09,568
Yeah, right.

603
00:39:10,424 --> 00:39:12,424
How do I know you're not
some deep throat wannabe

604
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,382
with a lot of time
on his creepy hands?

605
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:18,418
<i>Look down.</i>

606
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:29,332
I received your letter,
Miss Lane.

607
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,128
Call me Lois...
if you want.

608
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:33,781
And while we're at it,

609
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,587
do you want to weigh in

610
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:35,966
on the whole
"Red-Blue Blur" thing?

611
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:38,110
Because it's kind of a mouthful
on this end.

612
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:41,530
I think there's probably
a better name out there.

613
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,717
And if there's anyone
who can find it,

614
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:46,442
it's you, Miss Lane.

615
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:50,601
I'll put my best men
on it.

616
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:52,515
And by "men,"
I mean me

617
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,399
because I work
in the basement

618
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,516
and employ
pretty much no one,

619
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:55,661
unless you count
my intern.

620
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,592
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm rambling.</i>

621
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,818
You're nervous.

622
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,363
Can you read my mind?

623
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:05,531
Who am I kidding?

624
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,276
It's Saturday night,

625
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:07,206
<i>and I hightailed it
down here</i>

626
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:09,606
<i>because I have one obsession
right now, and it's you.</i>

627
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:11,396
<i>And when you didn't respond
to my skywriting,</i>

628
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:12,016
I just...

629
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:13,813
<i>It was a nice one,
by the way.</i>

630
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:16,895
Between you and me,

631
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:19,276
I could use a little work
on that subtle thing.

632
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:20,935
You know
there's nothing wrong

633
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,460
with taking your job
seriously.

634
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:27,080
There is when you don't know
who you'd be without it.

635
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,502
<i>Something tells me
you know yourself</i>

636
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:30,599
<i>better than you think.</i>

637
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:35,564
Lois,
you're a great reporter...

638
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:37,260
All on your own.

639
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:40,554
You don't need a hero
or some gimmick

640
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,524
to make a headline.

641
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:42,995
<i>Thanks.</i>

642
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:45,975
My editor would kill me,
but...

643
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,199
I don't want this story.

644
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:51,452
What I've really been
wondering is...

645
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,418
What is it that you need?

646
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:56,659
<i>I mean,
you've dedicated your life</i>

647
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:57,816
<i>to a city
full of strangers.</i>

648
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:59,320
<i>And I'm not saying
that I know what it's like</i>

649
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:00,502
<i>to be a hero,
but...</i>

650
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:03,763
<i>Even the fastest blur
in the world</i>

651
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:05,438
<i>can't outrun loneliness.</i>

652
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,231
<i>I guess
what I'm saying is...</i>

653
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:13,150
If you ever
want to talk...

654
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,502
Totally off the record...

655
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:18,332
I'm only
a phone call away.

656
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:21,442
I'll keep that in mind.

657
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:24,291
And, Lois...

658
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:27,710
When I'm ready to tell
the world my secret,

659
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,883
you'll be the first
to know.
