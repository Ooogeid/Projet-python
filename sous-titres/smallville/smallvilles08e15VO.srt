1
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,934
You want to rise above sea level,

2
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:21,167
you better sharpen those teeth!

3
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:26,767
You will eradicate the other kryptonian

4
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,734
and then the rest of the planet.

5
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,400
I am not going to hurt anyone.

6
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:32,734
You have no free will.

7
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:36,601
And you're destined to
become what you really are.

8
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:37,767
Doomsday.

9
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,300
No way! I can't believe it!

10
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,467
I thought, just for a
minute, someone needed me.

11
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,868
Well, i'm sure he needs you.

12
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,300
How do you know?

13
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:50,901
'cause i know clark.

14
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,267
Great! Thank you!

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,567
Nice to be back!

16
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,067
Lois!

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,734
Are you kidding me?!

18
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,234
<i>Now you show up?</i>

19
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:23,167
The one time i actually depend on you,

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,501
and you flake on picking
me up from the airport.

21
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,501
I'm really sorry.

22
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:28,868
Sorry?!

23
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:32,100
Sorry doesn't buy back the
last three hours i spent ...

24
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:36,634
standing in a downpour...

25
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,734
...watching cheesy curbside reunions.

26
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,868
I can explain.

27
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,767
You e-mailed last night
to say you'd be there.

28
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,501
What, do i need to tie a string
around your finger myself?

29
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:47,000
But i got held up a-at work.

30
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,501
I finished one thing, lois,

31
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,200
and something else would come up.

32
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:53,000
You're a reporter, smallville.
You're not saving the world.

33
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:55,701
I know. I should've called.

34
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,601
Look, i get it.

35
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,968
You have other things on your mind.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,133
I don't expect

37
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,567
to be the person at the
top of your priority list.

38
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,501
Clark kent.

39
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:21,667
He can save an entire city
in the blink of an eye,

40
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:23,634
but when it comes to ladies,

41
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,801
the red-blue blur still
drives with the brakes on.

42
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,801
Linda lake.

43
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,667
What are you doing here?

44
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,100
Watching you.

45
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,133
Impressive as always.

46
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:37,133
You're a murderer. You
should be in prison.

47
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,200
The police cleared my name.

48
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:41,734
Besides, there's no prison sentence

49
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,934
worse than where i've been ...

50
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,167
circling the drain of obscurity.

51
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,901
I'm a nobody, kent.

52
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:53,767
Two years living underground
dried up my prophetic pen.

53
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:58,267
But i'm ready to make another splash.

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,701
Haven't your stories
ruined enough lives?

55
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,701
Oh, no.

56
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,367
It's different this time.

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,701
I want to be the voice
of the red-blue blur.

58
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:12,501
Every rescue, every takedown,

59
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:16,767
every kitten that you
rescue from a tree,

60
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:20,234
you leak the story to me first.

61
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,701
My name will be known alongside yours

62
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,634
on papers around the globe.

63
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,701
<i>Chloe was right ... you are crazy.</i>

64
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,501
I prefer ambitious.

65
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:36,667
In fact, i spent a few
hours of my morning...

66
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,634
writing your life story.

67
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:44,167
Partner with me, i'll shred it.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,267
You turn your back on me,

69
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,567
and the whole world reads
about little orphan alien.

70
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:53,834
We've gone through this
before. I'll stop you.

71
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,300
Not this time.

72
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,701
You'll make a great headline, kent.

73
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:21,100
Smallville 815

00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,901
Presynchro : Flolo Transcript : yyets.net

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
For seriessub.com

76
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,301
Hey, can i raid your dvd collection?

77
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,900
Jimmy's being transferred to met gen,

78
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,734
and i don't think he's
into a chick flick.

79
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,701
You okay?

80
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,701
Linda lake is back.

81
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,267
What?

82
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,668
I thought that water snake
slithered back into her swamp.

83
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,100
If i don't give her an
exclusive scoop on all my saves,

84
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:32,534
she's gonna expose me ...
my name, my face, everything.

85
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, my god. Okay...

86
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,800
well, the h20 has
obviously gone to her head,

87
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,867
and we need to figure out a way

88
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,200
to kill that story once and for all.

89
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,933
She's got a backup plan, chloe.

90
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,467
Whether we stop her or not,

91
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,534
she's still gonna release my identity.

92
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,067
So i'm going public...

93
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
<i>on my terms.</i>

94
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,401
Whoa. Clark.

95
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,768
Okay, i realize that after lana left,

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,401
you really buried
yourself in patrol duty,

97
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:01,401
and there's nothing wrong with that,

98
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,434
but to come out waving the flag...

99
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,301
i mean, that's huge.

100
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:09,634
Chloe, i always thought that
i would live in secret forever.

101
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:10,833
But you convinced me

102
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,234
that jimmy's picture
of the red-blue blur

103
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:16,768
was a symbol of hope.

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,334
Didn't have an address
or a family or a face.

105
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,634
I mean, are you sure

106
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:25,367
that you're ready to have
all of your intimate details

107
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,067
made into the banner headline?

108
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,434
Well, i don't have a choice.

109
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,734
At least this way,

110
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:31,800
i can control the way my
story comes out in the press.

111
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,100
Right, because the paparazzi

112
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:33,334
e paparazzi

113
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,167
are famous for respecting
people's privacy.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,867
Clark...

115
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,301
<i>we can stop her. There's always a way.</i>

116
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,134
No, chloe, this time is different.

117
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,668
I mean, even if i agree
to be linda lake's puppet,

118
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,367
eventually she will stab me
in the back and expose me.

119
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,134
I need to stay one step ahead of her,

120
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,967
not only for me but for
everyone else's sake.

121
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,367
Even in a world this advanced,

122
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,000
people are still pretty backwards

123
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:57,668
when it comes to accepting change.

124
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,000
I know, chloe, but when
the red and blue blur

125
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:03,200
hit the front page, people accepted it.

126
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:05,734
And maybe they're ready to accept me.

127
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,501
There could be an upside
to all this, you know.

128
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:12,334
For the first time in my life,

129
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:16,100
i may actually be able to be myself.

130
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,100
Can i ask you what you're doing?

131
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,933
Davis bloome ... i'm
one of the, uh, emts.

132
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,768
I've never seen you before.

133
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,267
Well, i've been out for a few weeks.

134
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:42,301
Do you want to explain this?

135
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,034
I'm just restocking my rig.

136
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:52,200
Antipsychotics used for
multiple personalties.

137
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:55,434
Yeah, not exactly your
latest designer drug, is it?

138
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,334
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,000
I hope whoever it's for,
they get the help they need.

140
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,301
Trust me, so do i.

141
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,234
Can i talk to you?

142
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,401
Wow. What is that noise?

143
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,000
Is someone talking?

144
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,367
Lois, you can't ignore me forever.

145
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,467
Could be worse ...

146
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,734
you could be ignored in
a three-hour downpour.

147
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,701
I want you to write my story.

148
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,334
No offense, but i've
long since graduated

149
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,601
from the "lonely seeking
lonely" or classifieds.

150
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:46,134
It's a pretty interesting one.

151
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,768
Clark, i'm busy here.

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,534
You may have forgotten about
me, but the news world didn't.

153
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,100
After the story you're about
to write, it never will.

154
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,534
What story?

155
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,534
I didn't forget to pick
you up at the airport, lois.

156
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,167
The reason i wasn't there

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,534
is because i was protecting people.

158
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,267
I'm the red-blue blur.

159
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:15,967
That's the best you can do?

160
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:20,933
That thing that saved
you from the speeding car,

161
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,000
that was me.

162
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:23,800
That time the barn door
flew off its hinges,

163
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,301
you thought it was a weather anomaly.

164
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,334
I did that.

165
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah, right. What'd you do ...  sneeze?

166
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,467
Actually...

167
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,668
clark, next time you liquid-lunch,

168
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,601
take the rest of the day off.

169
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,200
Let me help you with that.

170
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,668
Guess i should stop
calling you "smallville."

171
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:26,834
You're speechless.
That's never a good thing.

172
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:32,301
The disappearing acts,
the half-baked excuses...

173
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:35,334
all this time, i just coughed it up

174
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,734
to a classic case of
peter pan syndrome, but...

175
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,901
...you're the opposite.

176
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,600
You're like...

177
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,967
...a hero?

178
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:55,001
Look, lois, this is a lot to take in...

179
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,700
all at once, but i wanted
you to hear it from me

180
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,901
before you heard it from anyone else.

181
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,268
So, why am i the first one you told?

182
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:05,967
Actually, lois, you're not.

183
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,433
Lana and chloe already know.

184
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:15,600
Someone's had a busy morning.

185
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,134
They've known for years.

186
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,634
Right. Of course.

187
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,167
Start at the beginning.

188
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,467
What guns you got in your arsenal?

189
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:42,533
Guess i might as well just
throw it all out there.

190
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,834
I can blast fire out of my eyes.

191
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,600
Okay.

192
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,034
I can hear a dog barking
from 10 miles away.

193
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,800
I can see through solid objects,

194
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,134
and i can run faster
than the speed of sound.

195
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,400
Wait.

196
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,767
Rewind.

197
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,067
Expand on your whole...

198
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,067
"see through things" thing.

199
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:12,368
No, lo...  i...

200
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,867
look, i have to focus.

201
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,368
How did i not put these pieces together?

202
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,268
I mean, i lived with you,

203
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:26,301
and now we practically
work on top of each other.

204
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,034
I mean, have i been
high this entire time?

205
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:35,700
The important thing
is that you know now.

206
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:39,134
And there's no better reporter
to tell my story than you.

207
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,667
Would you do me the honor?

208
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,500
Consider it done.

209
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,167
Tomorrow's front page will tell the tale

210
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:55,001
of the red-and-blue,
meteor-infected hero.

211
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,734
About the meteors...

212
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:04,400
we should talk about where i'm from.

213
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,800
Your money's no good here.

214
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:25,934
For 50 years,

215
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,533
i've watched this city
get eaten alive by crime.

216
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,433
But you picked us up, kent.

217
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:35,834
You reminded everybody what
it means to be good again.

218
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:38,567
Excuse me, mr. Kent.

219
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,533
Can i get your autograph?

220
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,567
Sure.

221
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:47,901
There you go.

222
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,734
I like your outfit.

223
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,400
Thanks!

224
00:13:58,201 --> 00:13:59,600
He's so dreamy!

225
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,767
Oh, my god!

226
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
Wow, red-blue blur.

227
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,533
Oh, i want his autograph!

228
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,034
All right!

229
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,967
He is sexy! That guy?

230
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:19,134
Hey, clark! Catch!

231
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:24,567
I'll fall for you any day, clark.

232
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,467
You can't just do that.

233
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,800
It's not...

234
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:28,834
that's clark!

235
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:31,167
No way! You guys see that?!

236
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:38,667
You may have scooped me, but
i will have the last word.

237
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,201
You don't understand.

238
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:57,934
There has to be a room available.

239
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,934
My husband's being transferred here now.

240
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,201
I confirmed yesterday.

241
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,101
Yesterday, our parking lots
weren't full of paparazzis,

242
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:06,500
and our hallways weren't
full of rubbernecking fans.

243
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,234
It's not fair to our other patients.

244
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,201
It's not fair to jimmy.

245
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,567
I'm sorry, but we can't run a hospital

246
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,034
when everybody's clamoring for pictures.

247
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,533
Of a guy in a neck brace?

248
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:20,634
A guy in a neck brace married
to the alien's best friend.

249
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,433
Davis.

250
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,101
When did you get back?

251
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:38,567
Chloe. Hey.

252
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,234
Uh, just a few days ago.

253
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,167
I think we should talk
about what happened.

254
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:48,767
You remember?

255
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,134
Well, it's kind of hard to forget.

256
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,067
I mean...

257
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,567
you kissed me.

258
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,234
Right, yeah.

259
00:15:58,268 --> 00:15:59,234
Uh...

260
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:00,368
yeah, i'm assuming

261
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,700
that that's what all the
phone calls were about.

262
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,234
I sort of deleted the
messages without listening.

263
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,268
Yeah, well, you didn't miss much.

264
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,433
I-it was basically a long,
rambling, awkward apology.

265
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,301
Look, i-i wasn't blowing you off.

266
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,301
It's just that with jimmy's recovery

267
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,268
and then losing a chunk of my memory

268
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:19,001
after the wedding from
hell, i was ... yeah, okay.

269
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:21,201
See, this is exactly
why i went out of town.

270
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:22,834
I need to give you some space.

271
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,334
No space is necessary.

272
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:27,901
Davis, look, let's just
forget that this ever happened.

273
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,201
The problem is i can't seem to do that.

274
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:34,967
You have been nothing
but a good friend to me.

275
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,700
I just ...  i don't think
that will ever be enough.

276
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,234
So i take it friendship's off the table?

277
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:47,867
Chloe, a friendship like ours...

278
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,433
it can be dangerous.

279
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,134
I guess this is goodbye then.

280
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:07,634
<i>You actually know her?</i>

281
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,268
Yeah, so?

282
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:11,400
So? She's famous!

283
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,433
She's the kryptonian's best friend!

284
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,034
Kryptonian.

285
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,234
Ready to earn your
stripes as city editor?

286
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,334
Linda lake.

287
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,834
Well, there's a name i
haven't seen in a while.

288
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:39,201
Here to reclaim the stiletto
out of your assistant's back?

289
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:41,500
We both know

290
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,467
this news rag's nothing more
than poor man's wallpaper.

291
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,567
Just here to make it readable again.

292
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,368
Clear your page one. Run this.

293
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,034
We stopped throwing your
gossip grenades years ago.

294
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,767
Don't forget that while
you were chasing ambulances

295
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,867
with the other cubs,

296
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,867
i was breaking real news.

297
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,433
My blog had more hits
than the chicago mob.

298
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:02,268
My name was feared and
revered around the world.

299
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:03,600
<i>I'm doing you a favor.</i>

300
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:07,334
Do yourself a favor,
lake. Get a new career.

301
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,533
It's about the alien.

302
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,567
We're live from the smallville farmhouse

303
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,867
where up until this morning
clark kent lived in anonymity.

304
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,167
Now the crowds are gathering

305
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,001
to try and get a peek at
the superhero next door.

306
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,001
There she is.

307
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,301
Chloe sullivan,

308
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,600
what's it like having an
alien as a best friend?

309
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:30,767
I'm, uh, just trying to get inside.

310
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,034
Mom, what do you mean, "forced leave"?

311
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,134
Can they even do that to a senator?

312
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,268
Okay, look. This will all blow over.

313
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,234
People just need time to adjust.

314
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,301
All right. I'll talk to you later.

315
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,767
Clark, it's chloe!

316
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,167
The beatles have landed in smallville.

317
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:52,201
You okay?

318
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,334
<i>Yeah, i'm fine.</i>

319
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,433
<i>How are you dealing with
the instant star status?</i>

320
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,834
Unfortunately, my 15 minutes
of fame have no end in sight.

321
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,368
Well, i don't mean
to add to the fanfare,

322
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,167
but lois was just given
an editor's promotion.

323
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,600
And congratulations ...

324
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,967
you now have a penthouse office
right next to tess mercer.

325
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:15,301
<i>Man on tv: clark kent's
not everyone's hero.</i>

326
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:22,634
<i>Last week, a crane collapsed
at my husband's work site</i>

327
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,800
<i>and killed him.</i>

328
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:27,301
<i>Where was clark kent then?</i>

329
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>Who says he gets to choose</i>

330
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,901
<i>who lives and who dies?</i>

331
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,567
Clark, right now we need to
focus on finding linda lake.

332
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,934
Now, i think i know why she went m.i.a.

333
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,800
It turns out that linda
shared a cellblock with me

334
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,834
in black creek.

335
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,533
She can turn herself into water, chloe.

336
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:49,800
Why didn't she just escape?

337
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,467
Because electricity is her kryptonite.

338
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,634
Linda lake's specialized restraints

339
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,967
discharged a chemical
electrical bonding current,

340
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,934
meaning it basically kept her solid.

341
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>Great, then all we have to do is find
her. Man on tv: we now take you live</i>

342
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,067
<i>to a press conference with linda lake.</i>

343
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,234
<i>Shouldn't be too hard.
Lake: clark kent...</i>

344
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,767
<i>is not a hero.</i>

345
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,934
<i>He's not a savior.</i>

346
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,400
<i>He's not even a friend.</i>

347
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:21,567
<i>He is the first wave of
an all-out alien invasion.</i>

348
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,134
<i>My detailed investigation has revealed</i>

349
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:31,567
that clark kent is to
blame for meteor showers,

350
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,700
deadly power outages,

351
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,901
and an unspeakable
trail of human carnage.

352
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:42,667
When it rains, it pours.

353
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,134
<i>A hero that tried to stop this alien</i>

354
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,667
<i>before it ravaged our homeland again.</i>

355
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,500
<i>And that hero...</i>

356
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:55,034
<i>that hero was lex luthor.</i>

357
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,400
<i>And clark kent killed him.</i>

358
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,201
She just turned me into a public enemy.

359
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,500
E just turned me into a public enemy.

360
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,500
<i>Clark, you need to leave. Now.</i>

361
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,101
I can straighten this out, chloe.

362
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,834
I'll talk to the authorities myself.

363
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,834
It looks like they want
to talk to you, too.

364
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,767
Look, clark, this is
only gonna get worse.

365
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,533
You need to leave while you still can.

366
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm not running, chloe.
People need to know the truth.

367
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,600
Now, why don't you
go out the back, okay?

368
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,368
I'll catch up with you later.

369
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:28,734
Be careful.

370
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,768
Linda lake is lying through her teeth.

371
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:52,067
Her points line up, clark.

372
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,434
So why don't you just tell
me who you're working with?

373
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,334
Like i said, i'm not
working with anyone.

374
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:57,334
I was sent here alone.

375
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,868
To do what ... work on a farm?

376
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,100
It's pretty clear there's
a bigger agenda here.

377
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:03,033
Look, my father sent me
here with a dying wish

378
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,868
that i use my abilities
to protect mankind.

379
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,134
It's what i've always done.

380
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,667
It's what i'm gonna continue to do.

381
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,134
And i'm sure if i ask your
friends, they'll attest to that?

382
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,467
Hmm? Friends like lois lane?

383
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:16,200
You gave her the front
page of a lifetime.

384
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,267
Now, if she's been keeping your secret,

385
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,033
she could be aiding and
abetting an enemy of the state.

386
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,367
No, lois is innocent.

387
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:24,667
Everything she knows is in her story.

388
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,033
And chloe sullivan?

389
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,501
Impressive how long
she kept your secret.

390
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:31,134
How many other secrets
is she keeping, clark?

391
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:34,667
Look, i have been open about
everything you've asked me.

392
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,033
And i appreciate it. I really do.

393
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,501
I'm sure you won't have any problem

394
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,501
with us running some tests.

395
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,634
No one agreed to any tests ...

396
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,667
only to answer the
questions... you asked of me.

397
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:51,000
Just calm down, and everything
will be fine, all right?

398
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:52,434
No one's running any tests.

399
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:57,701
Fire!

400
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:17,768
Keep your car running.
The feds are after you.

401
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,000
What did they do to you?
It doesn't matter, chloe.

402
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,501
You have to leave smallville now.

403
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,167
<i>Man on radio: we
interrupt this broadcast</i>

404
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,601
<i>to bring you a special bulletin.</i>

405
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:27,067
<i>Authorities are on a statewide
manhunt for clark kent.</i>

406
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,234
<i>He's considered dangerous,</i>

407
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,933
<i>unpredictable, and without remorse.</i>

408
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,434
<i>Granville county has issued a
mandatory curfew of 9:00 p.m.</i>

409
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:33,967
<i>And urges families with children</i>

410
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,801
<i>to stay indoors at all times.</i>

411
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,567
Do they know about the
meteor rocks? Not yet.

412
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,701
That's why they're after you ...
to find a way to stop me, chloe.

413
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:47,801
We have to leave town separately. What?

414
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,634
Am i losing you, clark?

415
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,967
If this is goodbye, i'm not saying it.

416
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,033
No, chloe, when this all
dies down, i'll find you.

417
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,033
I promise.

418
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,534
This isn't gonna die down, clark.

419
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,900
There has to be a way that
we could just undo everything.

420
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,401
I mean, can't you just ask jor-el

421
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:02,067
to orchestrate another second chance?

422
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,200
He's gone, chloe.

423
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,933
He disappeared when
the fortress went dark.

424
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,134
Then unless you're hiding
some sort of latent power

425
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,933
to turn back time, i have no more ideas.

426
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:11,734
The legion.

427
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:14,300
They gave me a ring that
makes time travel possible.

428
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:16,100
I hid it in a toolbox in the barn.

429
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:18,234
I never thought i'd
have to use it, but...

430
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:20,967
you think you can go back
to before your story broke?

431
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,300
The legion went back
1,000 years using it.

432
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,467
Okay, now, i know i
don't need to remind you

433
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:27,900
what happened last time
you turned back the clock.

434
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,067
There's always a consequence.

435
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,933
The world fears me, chloe,

436
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,967
and as long as they know who i am...

437
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
i can't help them.

438
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,334
I don't have a choice.

439
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:53,801
Clark, call me.

440
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:56,067
Whatever trash these people
are spreading about you,

441
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,000
you can count on me to
fire back, guns blazing.

442
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,367
You sit across from the guy, lane.

443
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,734
How slow are you?

444
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,100
Oh, hell no.

445
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,300
Hold that elevator!

446
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,367
Last i checked,

447
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:27,200
stories required these
little things called "facts."

448
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,367
Maybe the city editor is
willing to print your fiction,

449
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:33,000
but tess mercer will
gladly run my rebuttal.

450
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,300
I'm sorry, katie, i'm ... i'm
gonna have to call you back.

451
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,367
My connection just took on
a terrible whining sound.

452
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:40,701
Okay, thanks.

453
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,167
Katie couric.

454
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,634
You see a parade, and you just
have to rain on it, don't you?

455
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,067
You can't stand the fact

456
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,000
that there are actually
good people in this world.

457
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,534
If your boyfriend really
cared about saving people...

458
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,768
...he would've done things my way.

459
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,467
People looked up to him.

460
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,601
He could've been the
hero they always needed.

461
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:08,701
Funny thing about people ...

462
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,300
the only thing they love
more than building up heroes

463
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:13,834
is tearing them down.

464
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:20,734
Tess, what were you thinking?

465
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:22,000
Man: she's up here.

466
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,933
Miss lane, we need to speak with you

467
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,967
regarding matters of national security.

468
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,067
Without my lawyer,

469
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,334
you're not gonna hear
me so much as hiccup.

470
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Nice interception, but
you shouldn't be here.

471
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,367
All the bloodhounds in the state
will be sniffing you out. It's okay.

472
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,567
I know this sounds crazy,

473
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,367
but in a few moments,
this will all be over.

474
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,467
Okay, well, try me.

475
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,401
My shock threshold is
pretty high right now.

476
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:52,501
Lois, i have a ring

477
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:55,834
that allows me to go
to any moment in time.

478
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:57,167
I'm gonna go back

479
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,334
to before linda lake
ever wrote that article.

480
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:03,300
The world isn't ready to
accept someone like me.

481
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,100
Then stay and fight back.

482
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:09,801
Look, give people a chance
to see who you really are.

483
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:10,933
It's too late, lois.

484
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,067
My whole life, i've seemed different.

485
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,933
Some people spend their entire lives

486
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:20,933
looking for a way to stand out...

487
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:25,167
to be a person that
anybody would call special.

488
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,367
When you first told me who you were...

489
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:32,834
my thought was, "anyone but clark."

490
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,834
And not because of the alien thing.

491
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,267
I... i've known enough guys

492
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,367
to know that you can
be born on terra firma

493
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,834
and be light-years from normal.

494
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,967
Lois, you don't have
to explain. I get it.

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,334
No, you don't.

496
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,334
How can someone with
x-ray vision be so blind?

497
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I've been down the hero road before.

498
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:03,868
And every time, i made a giant u-turn.

499
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,667
But this...

500
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:11,667
this was different.

501
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,567
<i>And this time, it will
be different, lois.</i>

502
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:18,300
When i do this, no one's
gonna remember who i am.

503
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,367
And when you hit your reset button...

504
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:29,234
...you're not gonna tell
me your secret, are you?

505
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:33,933
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,933
That's okay.

507
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:42,933
Why should i think i'm special?

508
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,734
Clark...

509
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:51,567
i understand.

510
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,134
Lois, you don't understand.

511
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:00,900
<i>It's because you are special.</i>

512
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,834
I have to go.

513
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,134
Looking for this?

514
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,834
Oh, my god. What happened?

515
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:01,968
Chloe, i am so sorry. It's all a lie.

516
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,734
I thought that i could stop it.

517
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,067
Davis, look at me.
Tell me what's going on.

518
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,901
I'm gonna go get you some
help. No! No, you can't!

519
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,000
Nothing helps.

520
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,167
What are these?

521
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,801
I built up a tolerance.

522
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,000
I can't control it anymore.

523
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,467
<i>Control what?</i>

524
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:18,033
The beast.

525
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,667
You must have blacked it out.

526
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,567
You were in the arctic with me.

527
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:26,801
You told me it was my destiny
to kill the other kryptonian.

528
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,501
What are you saying, davis?

529
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:31,501
<i>"The other kryptonian" ...
there's only one kryptonian.</i>

530
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:32,667
There's only clark.

531
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:36,334
I'm...kryptonian.

532
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,868
You're doomsday.

533
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:46,968
I was sent to this planet to kill clark.

534
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,601
You stay away from him.

535
00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:52,000
You have to warn him, chloe.

536
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:53,767
Something's been drawing me back here.

537
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,367
I thought that it was you, but no.

538
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,067
It was clark.

539
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,734
Davis, your eyes...

540
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:06,767
chloe, run.

541
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:08,234
Get out of here!

542
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:14,801
Lois, i need you to
give a message to clark.

543
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,334
He's not picking up his phone.

544
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,767
That creature that was at
my wedding is davis bloome,

545
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,601
and he's coming for clark!

546
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,734
I used to think a lot about rings.

547
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:49,834
I thought getting one meant
i'd found true happiness.

548
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,267
But there is no such thing as
true happiness in this world,

549
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,400
is there?

550
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:57,234
Not when you only see the bad in people.

551
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,934
Look how fast they turned on you.

552
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:04,634
One second, you're on top of the world.

553
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,968
And the next,

554
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,534
it's as if your life story's
written in someone else's blood.

555
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,834
Not that i care.

556
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:13,300
This trumps your blur any day.

557
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,767
That ring ... it's dangerous.

558
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:15,801
No.

559
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,968
This ring is every journalist's dream.

560
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,801
I'll know stories before they break.

561
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:25,701
<i>The entire world will know me.</i>

562
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:49,968
The rock.

563
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,334
Are you okay? I'll be all right.

564
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,467
Chloe just called.

565
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:07,000
You're not gonna believe
this, but davis...

566
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,767
i know what you're planning.

567
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,767
Mr. Kent.

568
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,701
I was just thinking about you.

569
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,334
Two years is too long
to go without a visit.

570
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:36,501
You're not gonna run my story.

571
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,734
Your story?

572
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:44,067
Oh, so now you're not
just super, you're psychic.

573
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,667
I'm a journalist now.

574
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:48,000
I brought you my latest work.

575
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,267
It's about all the
murders you committed.

576
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,067
People are gonna know
who you really are,

577
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
and your word will mean nothing.

578
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,767
You're going to jail.

579
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:06,234
I don't think so.

580
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,434
No one can ever know my name.

581
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,134
Some things never change.

582
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,601
I've been gone a month,

583
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:51,334
and you still drive in the granny lane.

584
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:55,401
You're welcome for the ride, lois.

585
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,800
Did i mention i missed
your ongoing commentary?

586
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,967
No, actually,

587
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,534
and aside from asking me
what the speed limit was,

588
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,967
you barely said a
word on the way home...

589
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,800
or since i've been
gone, for that matter,

590
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,900
unless you count the
three 10-second voicemails.

591
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,867
Lois, you know, after the wedding,

592
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,467
things got a little crazy.

593
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:15,567
Things got a little crazy
before all hell broke loose.

594
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,200
Let's face it.

595
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,734
<i>Or ... or we could not face it</i>

596
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:24,100
and just forget that
it ever almost happened.

597
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,334
I think it's a pretty
complicated conversation, lois.

598
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,534
We don't have to
overanalyze anything now.

599
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,100
I'm gonna work off my jet lag
later on tonight at the cafe.

600
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,000
You want to come by for a coffee, cool.

601
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:42,800
If not, let's just say i get it.

602
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:45,467
Okay.

603
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,501
Okay. See you then.

604
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:51,200
Or not. Or whatever.

605
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,734
I'm going to work.

606
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:01,434
I have to admit,

607
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,900
i would've loved to have seen clark kent

608
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,134
as an international-celebrity icon.

609
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,434
It wasn't a pretty sight.

610
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,301
Yeah, but being a
part of your entourage,

611
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,867
<i>i must've had some perks, right?</i>

612
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,100
If you consider complete
invasion of privacy a perk.

613
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:16,301
Though there was this one moment

614
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:19,067
right after i told
lois the truth about me.

615
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,501
I thought everything would be okay.

616
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:24,100
Thought i could have
it all, but i was wrong.

617
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,467
You know, clark,

618
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:30,000
<i>maybe you can have your
cape and wear it, too.</i>

619
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,833
Say that clark kent, the
unassuming journalist,

620
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:35,334
buttoned up in a starched shirt and tie,

621
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,668
but then, when he's playing the hero,

622
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:39,768
he ... steps out of the
shadow into his red and blue,

623
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,501
creating two completely
separate identities?

624
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:42,501
Yeah.

625
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,601
And for the cherry on top,

626
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:48,601
you get to tell lois the truth
and still know her reaction.

627
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:51,701
All of this made one
thing very clear, chloe ...

628
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:54,267
lois can never know who i really am.

629
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:57,034
Clark, is it safe to say
that maybe another benefit

630
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:58,534
from protecting your secret

631
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:01,234
is getting to protect
yourself from getting hurt?

632
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,833
I destroyed the legion ring.

633
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,800
Speaking of that...

634
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:14,668
controlling time ...
it's too dangerous, chloe.

635
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:17,200
It always comes at a price.

636
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:22,833
Trust me, i'm thrilled that
you got a page-one rewrite.

637
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,567
But it kind of makes me wonder

638
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:28,134
what might've changed this time.

639
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,167
Can i ask you what you're doing?

640
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,401
Davis bloome ... i'm
one of the, uh, emts.

641
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:53,467
Oh, well, there's actually a
patient who's looking for you.

642
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,134
Uh, there must be some mistake.

643
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,501
I don't know you.

644
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:12,634
While i've been puddling around
metropolis for the last week,

645
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:15,367
i've seen lots of interesting stories.

646
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:19,534
What a nice surprise to stumble
upon your dirty little secret.

647
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:23,967
Painful breathing, pale complexion...

648
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,933
unsightly bone protrusions.

649
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,034
You don't know what
you're talking about.

650
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,034
Right.

651
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,067
You just have a terrible skin condition.

652
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,634
What do you want from me?

653
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:50,933
I want you to release the beast

654
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:54,267
and break me out of these restraints.

655
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It doesn't exactly work like that.

656
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:03,234
Don't waste your time with the pills.

657
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:05,067
I've seen what you can do.

658
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,200
You don't understand.

659
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:08,067
You don't know what you're dealing with!

660
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,000
<i>No. You don't understand.</i>

661
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:13,067
I can't spend another
second trapped in a cell.

662
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,467
Do you want me to tell
chloe who you really are?

663
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,034
That's a good boy.

664
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:26,167
Become the thing you're meant to be.

665
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,501
Stop.

666
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,833
Let it go.

667
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,134
Shut up!

668
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,434
Set me free!

669
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,668
Oh, my god.
