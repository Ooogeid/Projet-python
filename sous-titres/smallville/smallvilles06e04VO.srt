00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,590
Hello.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,930
Here you are,my lady.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,440
Thank you.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,690
It's beautiful,
but I feel self-conscious even borrowing it.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,520
It shouldn't stay hidden in the luthorcorp safe.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,080
It needs to be worn for the very first time
on the neck of a beautiful woman.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,320
It's perfect,martha.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,650
But now it's time to meet
the moneybags of metropolis.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,020
You'll need them to fund your bid
for the united states senate.

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,950
Okay,now,remember,this a party.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,420
I know.I know.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,200
Stay away from religion,politics,and bad dye jobs.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,240
Ollie!

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,550
We haven't seen you in such a long time.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,950
Hello.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,110
Hi,oliver.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,500
Uh,mr.Westcott and his wife,candice.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,220
I'd like to introduce you to lois lane.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,340
Hey.

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,010
Simon westcott.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,670
It's my pleasure.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,300
Likewise.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,090
So,I wanted to tell you that I thought you were

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,710
so eloquent at the congressional
indictment hearings.

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,060
Sorry about your oil tanker.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
I'd hate to be a pelican in that harbor,huh?

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,670
Well,we're gonna go.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,370
That's our cue,so...

29
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,830
I guess I forgot to add public humiliation
to the list of cocktail-party don'ts.

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,510
I'm gonna go get us a drink,okay?

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,000
You just wait here,and don't talk to anybody,okay?

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,500
I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,880
I hope you're having a splendid time

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,960
and that you've had a chance to
reconnect with some old friends.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,240
Right now,though,I'd like to introduce
you to someone who I hope will be a new friend,

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,770
a valuable new friend,someone I'm sure
you'll be glad to have on your side.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,810
Ladies and gentlemen,may I introduce to you
our kansas state senator and future U.S.Senator

38
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,750
martha kent?

39
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,370
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,540
Hey!

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,170
Give me the necklace.

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,110
You forgot to say "please.

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,350

46
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,800
I couldn't I.D.The guy,
but he didn't exactly stick around to chat.

47
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,070
You told mr.Luthor that you almost caught the guy.

48
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,020
Yet you expect me to believe you
didn't see anything?

49
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,100
Look,lionel luthor pays safetex,what,
a gazillion dollars for personal security?

50
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,130
So don't blame me if you let a boy scout
with an archery badge crash his party.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,130
Okay.

52
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,450
I think miss lane's made her point.

53
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,670
Wouldn't you say?

54
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,640
She'll call you if she remembers anything.

55
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,260
Evening.

56
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,090
So what aren't you telling him?

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,280
I just nabbed the story of my life.

58
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,090
William tell's not the only one
who walked away with a serious party favor.

59
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,460
Mr.Queen.

60
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
My mom told me you were here.

61
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,610
Smallville,it's almost midnight.

62
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,150
Smallville you're clark kent?

63
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,510
You must be oliver queen.

64
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,670
Yeah.

65
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,850
This is funny.

66
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,960
You know,the way lois talked about you,

67
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,700
I thought you

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,570
were gonna be a little bit more of a  - I could use some water.

69
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,990
Little more what?

70
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,830
Well...

71
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,890
of a geek?

72
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,610
Well,you're not exactly jumping
the velvet ropes at nightclubs,so...

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,530
it's really nice to see that lois has found
someone who can overlook her personality.

74
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,230
Oh,don't worry about it,clark.

75
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,600
If I lived under the same roof
with such a beautiful woman,

76
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,480
I probably would amass my feelings in sarcasm,too.

77
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,340
Feelings?

78
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,550
Feelings?

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,740
A little advice,freud jr.,There
-- stick with your day job.

80
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,550
The only reason I'm here is to
get that necklace back.

81
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,380
Last thing I want is for my mom
to be indebted to lionel luthor.

82
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,560
Yeah,well,I mean,she should have thought of that
before she accept his help with her fundraising.

83
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,910
Oh,and if you're really championing
the cause of pickpocketed billionaires,

84
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,700
you might want to add a few more to the list.

85
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,720
Lionel luthor's not the only victim?

86
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,810
Over a dozen of metropolis' who's
whos have been hit recently.

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,800
Good.Then there's some leads.

88
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,150
Not if all the victims were
as uncooperative as lionel luthor.

89
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,920
You find it interesting
that he never called the police?

90
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay,if you boys are done marking your territory,

91
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,100
which,for clarification,is not me,

92
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,310
I have a front-page article that's missing
a few key details.

93
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,640
Good night,boys.

94
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,050
What was with that sprint up the last hill?

95
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,370
I always suspected you couldn't handle me.

96
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,650
Dr.Groll.

97
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,250
Did we have a meeting?

98
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,570
No,I just need a few words with you...

99
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,250
in private.

100
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,460
You can say anything in front of miss lang.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
It's about the device.

102
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,210
Please.

103
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,120
Where'd you get that?

104
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,300
I found it.

105
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,590
And I asked dr.Groll to figure out what it was.

106
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,160
Some kind of power source
beyond anything developed on earth.

107
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,970
If we could understand the technology,it could
potentially solve the planet's energy crisis.

108
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,000
For someone on the verge of saving the world,
your enthusiasm seems tempered.

109
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,340
There is one risk.

110
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,930
If it fell into the wrong hands...

111
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
it could be used as a weapon.

112
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,040
So,if it's so dangerous,
shouldn't you hand it in to the government?

113
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,300
Then he'd lose any chance at a nobel prize.

114
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,860
Isn't that right,dr.Groll?

115
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,190
What do you want me to do?

116
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,510
Every breakthrough has its challenges.

117
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,020
Keep working.

118
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,750
Very well.

119
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,370
Hey.

120
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Let me guess.

121
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,410
You need help researching your next article.

122
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,790
Yeah,the inquisitor's search engine consists
of a highlighter and the yellow pages.

123
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,760
Does mrs.Kent know that
you're still moonlighting on her?

124
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,420
Are you kidding me?

125
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,200
I've got this double-identity thing down.

126
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,800
And besides,I told her all about it this morning.

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
All right.

128
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,070
So what's the story worth
bringing out the alter lois?

129
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,380
Actually,you know,now that we're both in the same
biz,I probably shouldn't be leaking my story.

130
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,400
I can't believe you don't trust me.

131
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,530
It's not all of you I don't trust.

132
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,000
It's just one little side of you.

133
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,950
Lois,I'm not gonna scoop your story.

134
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,290
But watching you bumble through our database is
like watching clark try and dance.

135
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,720
Come on.

136
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,860
Lois,tell me what you got.

137
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,070
Okay.

138
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,800
I scooped this off the scumbag before he ran away.

139
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,400
There's some writing on the inside,
but it's too faded to make out.

140
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,060
Yeah,this could take a little while.

141
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,830
Well,I haven't seen you since the world
was falling down around us.

142
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,800
And I hear you have got yourself a new landlord.

143
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,520
I assume that lex told you we were together.

144
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,910
Mr.Luthor,if you called me
here to discuss my relationship with lex

145
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,860
oh,that would be wildly inappropriate,wouldn't it?

146
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,620
Unless,of course,you consider
that the last time you and I spoke,

147
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,830
we were discussing
which one of us was going to kill lex.

148
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,790
He wasn't himself.

149
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,700
But you were -- completely yourself.

150
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,310
And unless I'm mistaken,
the discussion was due to the fact that lex --

151
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,630
please,sit down

152
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,600
was obsessed with
a piece of alien technology infinitely

153
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,730
too dangerous for any of us to comprehend.

154
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,260
Does this sound familiar to you at all?

155
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,610
Mr.Luthor,this is all behind us now.

156
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,380
Ah,well,it's obvious that any trust
you have for me only works in times of crisis.

157
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,640
But we both know,miss lang,
that the crisis is far from over.

158
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,680
Lex salvaged that piece of technology.

159
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,250
Why do you think I moved into the mansion?

160
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,650
Please tell me.

161
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,020
Mr.Luthor,I care about lex.

162
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,660
But part of being with
him is protecting lex from himself.

163
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,070
I'm not naive.
I know that comes with the territory.

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,950
Well,apparently lex has finally found his equal.

165
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,120
But watching over him?

166
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,450
That is not enough.

167
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,800
Miss lang...

168
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,100
lex is using every resource available to
him to unlock the mystery

169
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,900
of that pandora's box
that he somehow managed to get ahold of.

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,160
Once he opens it and
unleashes whatever is in it to the world...

171
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,840
Well,we may not be lucky enough
to close it this time.

172
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,040
What do you think we should do?

173
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,380
Destroy it.

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,730
"The green arrow bandit.

175
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,870
" It doesn't really roll off the tongue.

176
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,510
This guys steals your boss's necklace,
gases you and your cousin,all in 24 hours?

177
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,480
I think he has a thing for you.

178
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,120
Well,when you're my editor,
I'll remember to care what you think.

179
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,640
You know that whole sugar-and-spice thing?

180
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,700
It never really took with you,did it?

181
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,070
Look.

182
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,520
Green arrow,green eggs and ham
it doesn't really matter what I call this guy.

183
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,010
I'm gonna have his face plastered
all over the front page soon enough.

184
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,860
Well,unless I'm missing something,

185
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,320
without that ring,you're not nearly as close
to I.D.Ing this guy as you claim to be.

186
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,740
Yeah,that.Well,
I might have stretched the truth just a little.

187
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,400
Okay,well,it's a good thing that the
inquisitor doesn't pride itself on integrity.

188
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,690
Listen,

189
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,390
I don't like the idea of you dangling yourself
out as bait in front of this guy,you know?

190
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,450
Anyone after the green arrow's
gonna come after you.

191
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,870
Anyone after the green arrow

192
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,660
is a friend of mine,
and I will be sitting front and center with them

193
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,280
when they lock this guy up.

194
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,460
Wouldn't want you on my jury.

195
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,800
Meaning...

196
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,740
well,you know,I thought we did away with the

197
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,290
"shoot first,ask questions later"
mentality with covered wagons.

198
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,820
Oh,come on.Don't tell me
you're some kind of bleeding-heart pacifist.

199
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,820
And that's worse than a knee-jerk fascist?

200
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,200
All right.

201
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,760
Forget about this guy for the weekend.

202
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,680
I can have you in cancun in time for
the sunset tonight,sipping margaritas.

203
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,490
What do you say?

204
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,150
Well,as much as I would love
to be your beach bimbo,

205
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,360
the only person I'm gonna be spending
the weekend with is into leather

206
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,530
and has a perverted fetish for archery.

207
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,760
Why is that?

208
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,110
Oh,I understand.Thank you.

209
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,300
Clark.

210
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,880
What a good surprise.

211
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,550
What brings you up here?

212
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,220
My mom was pretty shaken up after the party.

213
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,480
Oh,yeah,I know.

214
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,540
But in spite of the impromptu entertainment,

215
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,560
your mother made a terrific impression on
some very influential people.

216
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,680
She wasn't the only one.

217
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,490
Walk me to my car,will you?

218
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,630
Don't worry,clark.My security team is
making a very thorough investigation.

219
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,620
Unlike the police.

220
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,160
Why wouldn't you report something  that valuable if it was stolen?

221
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,490
Well,I'd rather not let the entire city

222
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,340
know that I'm a sitting duck
for some acrobatic archer.

223
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,770
It's not wise to advertise our vulnerabilities,
is it,clark?

224
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,430
You're talking about some
very expensive vulnerabilities.

225
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
Ooh,faberg?egg.

226
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,810
Bishop's miter,14th century.This is big stuff.

227
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,790
Not the kind of stuff
you find in your local pawn-shop window.

228
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,640
Here's something that might interest you,
unless you've noticed this already.

229
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,520
There's only one name on the safetex client list
that hasn't been hit already.

230
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,140
I don't want to be late.You find it,huh?

231
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,730
Who are you?

232
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,110
Haven't you read?

233
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,310
I'm the green arrow.

234
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,140
Well...

235
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,510
I hope you enjoyed your cult status
while it lasted.

236
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,620
I think you're taking the whole
neighborhood-watch thing a bit too seriously.

237
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,130
That's fun.

238
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,290
Looks like I'm not the only one with a secret.

239
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,960
I hate to break it to you,
tough guy,buyou're on the wrong side.

240
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm not sure the police would agree.

241
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,040
Look around you,beav.

242
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,640
The days of the good guy
running the show are over.

243
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,400
Evening.

244
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,630
Miss lang,what are you doing?

245
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
Lionel luthor knows about the black box,

246
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,930
and he is willing to do anything
to get his hands on it.

247
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,030
And you think I'm working with him?

248
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,100
Not yet.

249
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,770
But trust me.

250
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,280
When he approaches you,and he will,

251
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,610
lionel is going to make you
an offer that is hard to resist.

252
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:43,600
No matter what the bribe,you will come to us
before you breathe a word to lionel luthor.

253
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,580
With all due respect,
I work for lex and not his girlfriend.

254
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,180
I'm not interested in your respect,dr.Groll.

255
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,310
I'm much more interested
in your 14 years of employment here,

256
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,250
your two girls that are now
in prestigious prep schools,

257
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,930
that new home that you
just built on sparling lane.

258
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,470
You have a pretty wonderful life.

259
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,650
Are you threatening me?

260
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,850
Well,it just came to my attention that
if the government or your colleagues

261
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,440
were to find out that you were
secretly testing alien weapons,

262
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,630
this life that you have worked
so hard for may take an unfortunate turn.

263
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,700
So,how'd you let this guy
slip through your fingers?

264
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,630
This green arrow bandit's got a lot of gadgets.

265
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,970
Gadgets?

266
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,640
Against the man of steel?

267
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,200
He's good,all right?

268
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,240
Fine -- backing off.

269
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,840
The green arrow bandit?

270
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,740
Is that really the name lois came up with?

271
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,500
If you ask me,I'd lose the "bandit,"
but not my story.

272
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,500
You know,with your competitive streak,
I'm surprised you forfeited this one to lois.

273
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,640
Competition?Lois?

274
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm chalking this one up to pro bono.

275
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,610
Yeah,right.

276
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,790
Okay,so idle hands aren't really my thing.

277
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,120
I got the safetex report on the arrows.

278
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,200
They're made from an advanced
titanium alloy that is untraceable.

279
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,470
What about the ring?

280
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,630
None of the shots I scanned on my computer
came out to have a clean image.

281
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,100
However,I may have forgotten to
mention to lois that

282
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,950
my computer is compiling them to render a new one.

283
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,310
Look,you can tell the mail room
to stop forwarding these bogus claims.

284
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,040
Well,I highly doubt the green arrow
is going to out himself on a hello kitty notepad.

285
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,480
Yeah,thanks.

286
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,710
Lois,hey.

287
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,160
Chloe,help!

288
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,680
Clark,she's in trouble.

289
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,080
[ Knock on door ] Lois?

290
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,400
Looks like someone took her.

291
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,050
What are you talking about?Who would do that?

292
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,080
Isn't it obvious?

293
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,610
The green arrow.

294
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,740
What makes you think
he'd have anything to do with this?

295
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,360
He's wanted all over town for armed robbery.

296
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,890
Lois is the one who publicly
threatened to unmask the guy.

297
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,580
I guess he doesn't live by a code of honor.

298
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,220
Because it's not the same as yours?

299
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,740
Maybe if you were as interested
in finding out about this guy

300
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,210
as you were in catching him,you wouldn't
have realized that everything he's stolen

301
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,300
so far has been bought off the black market.

302
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,120
You're saying lionel's necklace is -- yeah.

303
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,260
That's exactly what I'm saying.

304
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,470
You've been on this hunt to return
it to its original thief.

305
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,290
You think lionel took her?

306
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,730
I think there are a lot of people out there

307
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,900
that would go to any length
to catch the green arrow.

308
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,540
I got to go.

309
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,240
Chloe,it's too late.There's no sign of her.

310
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,350
Well,I might have something that will help --

311
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,550
the image from the ring finally rendered,
and I'm sending it to you right now.

312
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,370
It's a family crest.

313
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,830
The only problem is ye old crest
makers weren't very creative.

314
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,650
There's thousands,
and they're all practically identical.

315
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,900
It's gonna take me a little
while to track this one down.

316
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,390
Chloe,I know what it is.

317
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,730
Clark?

318
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,930
Hello?

319
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,910
Hello?

320
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,300
How much do you know about the green arrow?

321
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,050
I should have known he wouldn't have
the stones to face me in person.

322
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,220
No!

323
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,110
You know who he is!

324
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,500
Give me a me.

325
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,170
What did you see?

326
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
Who's the green arrow?

327
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,640
Bandit -- green arrow bandit.

328
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,080
And like you don't know.

329
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,780
That errol flynn wannabe put you guys up to this.

330
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,490
That's enough.

331
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,200
This bandit...

332
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,650
has made a joke of the firm
I've worked my life to build.

333
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,410
He's walked off with more
than $30 million from my clients.

334
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,610
Then why am I the one with bruises
on my knees right now?

335
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,300
Because you splashed my humiliation across
the front page of the paper,

336
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,660
and now you're going to help me rectify that.

337
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,570
I don't know who he is.

338
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,660
She doesn't know anything.

339
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,000
Kill her.

340
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,570
Lex: I didn't know blackmail
was one of your talents.

341
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:34,450
Lex,um,I know I went behind your back,
but I wanted to do this my way.

342
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,880
And if you're mad -- actually,I'm impressed.

343
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,870
I never had anyone try to protect me like that.

344
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,180
Lex,we have a serious problem -- your father.

345
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,890
He isn't gonna stop until he gets
that black box away from you.

346
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,950
Because he's afraid of what I'll do.

347
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,200
What about you?

348
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,690
Is there a part of you
that wonders the same thing?

349
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,330
No.

350
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,810
I believe in you.

351
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,210
But,lex,there is something that
I haven't been completely honest with you about.

352
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,850
I knew the box was a weapon.

353
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:50,470
If the box is that dangerous,
you want me to shut the project down,don't you?

354
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,430
No.

355
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,750
Lex,it might be the only thing
that will save us from them next time.

356
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,450
[ Groans ] Are you okay?

357
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,220
No thanks to you.

358
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,350
I saved you.

359
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,390
Yeah -- from goons who were trying to find you.

360
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,640
They're not the only one with a "v"
for vendetta on your little leather ass.

361
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,800
Little?

362
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,980
I've been really working the glutes lately,too.

363
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,800
Did the humor come with the costume?

364
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,860
Did the "tomb raider" routine
come from wanting daddy's attention?

365
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,500
Guess my aim's a little rusty.

366
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,870
Now...

367
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,230
let's take off those glasses and unveil
our prince of thieves,shall we?

368
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,870
[ Engine revving ] Oliver queen,you owe me one.

369
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,240
That was you on the roof?

370
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,810
Why'd you let me get away?

371
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,640
I'm not sure lois would understand
why her new boyfriend leads a double life.

372
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,510
Or why one of her best friends
does the same thing?

373
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,310
I think we're even.

374
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,400
We'll be even when you return
what you stole from lionel.

375
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,740
Chloe,what's all the buzz?

376
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,570
Seven stolen artifacts were anonymously
returned to the met,the tate,and the louvre.

377
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,000
Looks like you've got some friendly
competition in the knight-in-shining-armor arena.

378
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,700
The guy does a couple good things,
and he goes from villain to hero overnight?

379
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,390
Every time he strikes some corrupt tycoon,

380
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,660
an anonymous donation to some charity
mysteriously appears the next day.

381
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,700
You don't care how many laws
are broken to get it there.

382
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,460
That's just the price of justice.

383
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,460
I mean,if you ask me,he's a modern-day robin hood.

384
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,710
That doesn't mean
I'm not dying to find out who he is,though.

385
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,240
Oh,hey,I never heard back from you after
I sent you the picture of that crest.

386
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,160
I kind of ran into a dead end.

387
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,520
That's funny.So did I.

388
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,690
All my files on the ring are gone...

389
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,610
including the backup files -- clark?

390
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,690
Just don't look into them,chloe.

391
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,190
You know who he is,don't you?

392
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,930
As a favor to me,please don'T.

393
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,850
And he knows who you are.

394
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,950
Well,I guess there's some sort of secret
code of honor among superheroes.

395
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,540
What do we have here?

396
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,960
Yeah,not bad for a rookie,huh?

397
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,440
That's really incredible.

398
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,960
You have every newspaper in the country
calling this guy the green arrow.

399
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,370
He's got a real following.

400
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,270
Yeah,well,so did charles manson.

401
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,090
I know this is a rare moment for you,
but maybe you're overreacting.

402
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,220
It's not like this guy's a killer.

403
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,100
Ollie,he's a threat to metropolis,and I'm not
gonna stop until I find out who he is.

404
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,460
Trust me.

405
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,360
You don't know the green arrow like I do.

406
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,610
Not that I'd ever question
your theatrical skills...

407
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,100
[ Laughs ] ...

408
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,650
But you really had lana convinced.

409
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,740
Thank you,dad.

410
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,420
Just following the script
the script that you gave me,son.

411
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,210
But,you know,

412
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,240
if you really want to have an honest relationship
with lana,you should stop testing her.

413
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,590
Oh.

414
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,560
Well,I had to be sure.

415
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,600
Another important lesson you taught me

416
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,320
the greater the trust,the greater the betrayal.

417
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,220
All right,lex.

418
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,980
What do I have to do to prove to you that
I want to be a part of your life?

419
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,090
Part of my life or part of the project?

420
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,590
I would never have told you about
the box if you hadn't already known.

421
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,210
But that's as close as
you're ever gonna get to it.

422
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,380
All right.All right.

423
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,660
So what makes you think
that I won't tell lana lang

424
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,340
about the obstacle course you set up
for her if I'm so untrustworthy?

425
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:27,090
Because you've put so much effort into
fooling the kents that you're a good man,

426
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,760
you're starting to believe it yourself.

427
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,570
I didn't realize I was such a fascinating subject.

428
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,420
You've been reading up on me.

429
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,300
You and lois ought to start a fan club.

430
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,430
You gonna tell her?

431
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,450
I don't know,clark.

432
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,530
You seem to be doing a pretty good job
skating by with this farm-boy charade.

433
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,350
You can't be with someone unless
they know who you really are.

434
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,980
Trust me.I've tried.

435
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,680
You lost her to lex.

436
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,160
Is that why you hate me,clark?

437
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,150
'Cause I'm just another silver-spoon-fed rich boy
is that it?

438
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,260
Or is it because I'm not
willing to play the martyr like you?

439
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,540
You can play this game as long as you want.

440
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,790
But sooner or later,you're gonna hurt her.

441
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,430
You know that.

442
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,820
Well,you seem to have all the answers.

443
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,760
So I guess it's a good thing
I've decided to put this into safer hands.

444
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,030
For the record,lionel bought that
off a notorious bosnian warlord,

445
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,390
used it to launder luthercorp money.

446
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,970
So why give it to me?

447
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,210
Well,you seem to have a crystal-clear
idea of what's right and what's wrong.

448
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,900
You decide who it belongs to.

449
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,560
It's not as clear as it used to be.

450
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,990
You really think it's right to steal,
as long as it goes to a good cause?

451
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,870
That the end justifies the means?

452
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,840
Absolutely,yes.

453
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,560
I'll never feel that way.

454
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,090
You said you didn't owe me one.

455
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,130
So why are you really here?

456
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:54,030
Clark,you have abilities I couldn't even dream of.

457
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,780
And I admire that you use them
to save the people you're close to.

458
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,290
But?

459
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,730
But there's a whole world of people out there,
clark.

460
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,820
They need us.

461
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,640
With your potential...

462
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,330
you can't wait for them to come to you.

463
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,850
When you're ready to do something about that...

464
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,750
you let me know.
