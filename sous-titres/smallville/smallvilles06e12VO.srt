1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,750
There we go.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,840
Well,shelby,what do you say
we call it a night,huh?

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,590
Your friend chloe's
gonna be here any minute.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,240
Any minute.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,740
Thanks for your help,buddy.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,140
Shelby?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,190
Shelby? what is

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,860
Shelby?

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,910
What,boy?
You see something I don't?

10
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,350
Clark.

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,140
Earth to superfreak.

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,240
Everyone,please,sit down.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,080
Are you still
with us,clark?

14
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,580
What's going on?

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,470
Well,you said that you
and your dog were in the barn

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,300
when you heard something.

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,280
And then you left us
for a bit.

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,000
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,800
How'd I get here?

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,630
So,what attacked you?

21
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,200
Was it a kryptofreak again?

22
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,560
No,no,no,I know.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,170
It was a spirit from the
phantom zone, right,kal-el?

24
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,190
How do you know
that name?

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,950
'Cause you never shut up
about it,

26
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,330
oh,great son of jor-el.

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,960
Settle down,gentlemen.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,510
Wait,back off!

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,370
Take it easy,clark.

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,820
Take those deep breaths
we talked about.

31
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,800
Who are you?

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,780
It's me...

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,700
dr. Hudson.

34
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Hold on. I don't want
to have to hurt anyone.

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,880
Why don't you just use
your superspeed and run away?

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,660
What?

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,420
Why are you
doing this to me?

38
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,980
What do you want?

39
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,490
What's happening?!

40
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,140
Let me go!

41
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,960
Please,someone!

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,750
Why am I here?!

46
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,940
here!

47
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,870
I don't belong in here!

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm not crazy.

49
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,250
I don't belong here.

50
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,020
Back away from the door.

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,260
Back away from the door!

52
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,390
How'd I get here?

53
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,330
Think back,clark.

54
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,450
You know
how that happened.

55
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,400
Someone or something
attacked me in my barn.

56
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,350
Is this 33.1?

57
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,000
It's lex.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,840
He's always wanted
to get me under his microscope.

59
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,170
I'm afraid
your obsession with lex luthor

60
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,100
is part of the fantasy world
that you created

61
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,720
after you experienced
your psychotic break.

62
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,240
I get it.

63
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,090
You want me
to think I'm crazy.

64
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,860
I would prefer
not to use pejoratives.

65
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,250
You suffer
from paranoid schizophrenia.

66
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,630
You have
for a number of years...

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,170
...after the death of your birth
parents in the smallville meteor shower.

68
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,740
See,it's not true.

69
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,600
My birth parents were out
of town for the meteor shower.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,950
You were placed in the wonderful
adoptive home of the kents.

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,580
But like many children,

72
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,140
you invented a make-believe
world to help you deal

73
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,190
with the trauma you endured.

74
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,540
You convinced yourself that
you came from another planet,

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,600
that you possessed
special powers

76
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,450
and you used them
to save humanity.

77
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,160
Whatever you're trying to do,
it's not gonna work.

78
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,730
An active imagination wasn't
a problem when you were a boy.

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,460
But when you entered your
freshman year at high school,

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,970
you slipped permanently
into your fantasy world.

81
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,780
If you're gonna play mind games,
you got to try harder.

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,020
This isn't a game,clark.

83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,730
You're sick.

84
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,300
And your condition
is getting worse.

85
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,620
But the good news is,

86
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,220
I have developed a new treatment

87
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,910
that will cure you.

88
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,040
Tell lex
that I don't buy it.

89
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,880
Lex isn't your nemesis.

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,480
And 33.1 doesn't exist.

91
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,230
For the last 51/2 years,

92
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,290
you've been a resident of the
fairview psychiatric hospital.

93
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,370
Everything else -

94
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,790
your superpowers,
your alien lineage,

95
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,990
your secret identity...

96
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,810
...it's all a delusion.

97
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,440
Hey,stop licking the ball -
it's cheating.

98
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,860
Time for medication.

99
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,760
All right,let's go.
Keep on moving. Keep on moving.

100
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,500
That means you,too.

101
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,390
Let's go.

102
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,430
Don't hide that pill under
your tongue. Swallow it.

103
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,040
You're not crazy,kal-el.

104
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,450
We don't have much time,
so listen to me closely.

105
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,940
I believe
you're from another planet.

106
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,230
What makes you say that?

107
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,880
Because like you,
I'm not from here.

108
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,050
I come from mars.

109
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,070
You can't trust anyone.

110
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,050
Hey!

111
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,810
Don't even think about it.

112
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,320
Mom? Mom!

113
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,830
Clark,you're home!

114
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,070
I can't believe it!

115
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,480
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,900
What are all your things doing
in the loft?

117
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,810
Clark,
this is my home now.

118
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,510
After your dad passed away,

119
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,550
nell and I bought the farm
from your mom.

120
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,340
Not everything has changed.

121
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,590
I kept this.

122
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,330
You once said that looking through
it brought me closer to you.

123
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,030
And having it here
makes me feel

124
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,650
like you're always
with me.

125
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
I don't understand.

126
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,650
I know.

127
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,010
This must be really hard
for you.

128
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,990
You've been gone a long time
and a lot has changed.

129
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,760
But none of that
matters anymore.

130
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,700
Freshman year, you promised me
that we would never be apart.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,570
You were right.

132
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,740
We weren't dating then.

133
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,140
You...

134
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,200
you were with whitney.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,250
The football jock?

136
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,280
Clark...

137
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,340
there's only one person
I've ever been in love with...

138
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,060
you.

139
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,640
It's okay.

140
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,120
The doctor said that you'd suffer
mild amnesia after the treatment.

141
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,940
What treatment?

142
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,510
I didn't have
any treatment.

143
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,270
But you were released
from the hospital.

144
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,950
I wasn't released.

145
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,860
I escaped.

146
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,490
Lex luthor put me
in that hellhole.

147
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,520
Lex didn't put you in there.

148
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,460
No!

149
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't care if you two are engaged
- stop protecting him!

150
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,320
I hardly know lex luthor.
I'm gonna call the hospital.

151
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,940
No,stop.

152
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,270
You're lying.

153
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,430
You're in on this, aren't
you? He sent you here!

154
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,160
That's why you're here
- to distract me until he shows up.

155
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,720
Please stop.

156
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,930
What did lex do with my
mother? Where is she?!

157
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,010
She's probably
at the mansion -

158
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,380
the luthor mansion.

159
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,660
Clark...

160
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,250
Thank god.
You're okay.

161
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,990
Oh,clark!

162
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,530
Oh,I've been a wreck
all day.

163
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,150
Everyone at the hospital
is so worried about you.

164
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,220
You knew
I was in that place?

165
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,420
Dr. Hudson called lionel
the moment you disappeared.

166
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,490
They've both been
looking for you.

167
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,420
Lionel?

168
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,420
He must be in on it.

169
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,530
He must have told lex
the truth about me.

170
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,980
Clark,please,
try to calm down.

171
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,120
Calm down?

172
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,630
Mom,you don't understand.

173
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,140
They put me in that asylum.

174
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,460
They took away my powers.

175
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,190
Oh,sweetheart...

176
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,540
it'll be all right.

177
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,070
Mom,we have to get you
out of here.

178
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,690
We have to get you
away from lionel.

179
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,920
No,clark.

180
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,570
Lionel and i
are married now.

181
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,230
I- I meant to tell you,

182
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,230
but I-I was afraid
of how you'd react.

183
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
How could you?

184
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,150
He's a good,decent man.

185
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,020
Lionel's made sure you've gotten
better care than I could ever afford.

186
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,050
He's been lying to you!

187
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,980
No,clark. Dr. Hudson's treatment
will make you well again.

188
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,030
Please,
I just want my son back.

189
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,460
No,you're coming
with me right now.

190
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,890
No,I -

191
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,530
ADALEFLINE

192
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,570
they're drugging you,too.

193
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,800
Clark,those are
my allergy pills.

194
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,170
What are you doing?

195
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,810
You need help,clark.

196
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,760
Mom,you don't understand
what's going on.

197
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,350
- You're coming with me.
- No.

198
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,700
- Right now!
- No!

199
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,000
Come on!
Mom!

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,150
You have to -

201
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,230
please,don't hurt him!

202
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,000
Stop!

203
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,230
There's nowhere to run,
mr. Kent.

204
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,040
Just relax and put your hands
behind you.

205
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
Chloe,how'd you find me?

206
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Are you kidding me? I've been in gps mode ever since
my contact I.M.'D me about the breakout this morning.

207
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,170
Look,I can't stay here. I
don't want to get you involved.

208
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,460
Clark,
I already am involved.

209
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,650
You think you're the only one whose
life's been turned upside down?

210
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,090
Why do you think
I've been under the radar?

211
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,040
Chloe,they're after me,
not you.

212
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,830
They're after both of us.

213
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,330
Now,don't ditch your sidekick
till you get your powers back.

214
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,660
You might need me
to cover you.

215
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,830
Glad to see you,chloe.

216
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,700
I was beginning to think
I was actually losing it.

217
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,120
Clark,once we get this thing
on the front page,

218
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,400
father and son luthor are gonna be
wearing matching orange jumpsuits.

219
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,510
Lex...

220
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,540
I got to go see him.

221
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,820
Wait a minute.
You just got out,clark.

222
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,210
You're gonna go back
into the devil's lair?

223
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,060
Lex is more dangerous
than ever right now.

224
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,180
Even more reason
to stop him.

225
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,140
No,clark,you don't
have your powers back.

226
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,830
You could get hurt
like everyone else.

227
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,570
Powers or no powers,
I won't let him do this to me.

228
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,630
All right,fine. Since your
superspeed's out of gas,take my yaris.

229
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,950
And be careful.

230
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,560
Surprised to see me?

231
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,990
My father said
you were out.

232
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,070
I just never thought you'd have
the nerve to show your face.

233
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,070
You may have taken my powers,lex,
but I'm not afraid of you.

234
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,010
And I won't let you
ruin my life.

235
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,990
Your...
life.

236
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,690
I think you have that
a little backwards.

237
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,070
Did you forget our little run-in
on the loeb bridge five years ago?

238
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,770
When you save someone's life,
you tend to remember.

239
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,930
You really think
you saved me.

240
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,440
Well,then,
let me refresh your memory.

241
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,180
I have to spend the rest of my
life in this chair because of you.

242
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,760
This isn't possible.
I was there -

243
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,110
and you caused
the accident!

244
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,310
Oh,you claimed you saw my car
swerving out of control,

245
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,900
so you jumped in front of it to
save me with your superpowers.

246
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,570
But when I jerked
the wheel,

247
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,200
my porsche flipped
end over end

248
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,520
and wrapped
around the guard rail.

249
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,590
That's not what happened.

250
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,170
If it was up to me,
you'd be rotting in jail.

251
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,270
But my father insisted you go
to that mental hospital instead.

252
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,570
Anything to impress martha kent
with his kindness.

253
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,890
This is a trick.
It's a trick!

254
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,270
Really?

255
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,430
Open your eyes,
you crazy son of a bitch!

256
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,970
Does this look like a trick
to you?!

257
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,660
If there's one thing
I regret in my life...

258
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,590
it's that I didn't
just run you over.

259
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,850
Clark.

260
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,850
I knew you'd come here
to see chloe.

261
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,080
What happened
to the coffeehouse?

262
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,310
Clark,this has been an abandoned movie
theater for as long as I can remember.

263
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,190
No,this doesn't make sense.

264
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,180
This can't be real.

265
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,000
Lana,lex said that I...

266
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,470
caused his accident.
Is that true?

267
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,730
It's all in the past now.

268
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,110
Clark,come back
to the farm with me.

269
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,010
We can get through this.

270
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,140
We can get
through anything.

271
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,140
None of this
makes sense,lana.

272
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,640
And you and I -
we're not together anymore.

273
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,500
Ever since kindergarten,
we've been together,clark.

274
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,790
Thought that this would
help you to remember.

275
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,400
It's from the gumball machine
at quinn's market.

276
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,560
You gave it to me
when we were 10 years old.

277
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,930
You said that it was
my wedding ring.

278
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,380
And when you put it on my finger
and kissed me for the first time,

279
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,660
that's when you stole
my heart.

280
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,680
I don't remember.

281
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,160
You suffered so much
in that hospital.

282
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,000
Every weekend when I'd come to
visit, I could see it in your eyes.

283
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,780
I never gave up hope
that you'd get better.

284
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,660
I don't know
what's going on.

285
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,270
But chloe does.

286
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,400
She knows who I am.

287
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,620
Clark,you shouldn't
see her right now.

288
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,260
Chloe!

289
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,230
Clark,thank god.

290
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,030
What's going on?

291
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,790
******Lex and his men
took everything.

292
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,290
They're trying to wipe me
off the face of the earth.

293
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,170
You know,
lex is in a wheelchair.

294
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,640
Clark,when it comes to the luthors,
you can't trust anything,okay?

295
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,440
We got to go subterranean
until you get your powers back.

296
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,210
But,chloe,
I'm not so sure.

297
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,590
Nothing's the way
it's supposed to be.

298
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,940
It all seems so crazy.

299
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,490
******

300
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,650
We're not crazy.

301
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,780
We're just the only two
that know the truth.

302
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,990
That's why they put us
in the mental institution.

303
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,600
I tried to tell you.

304
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,640
What's she doing here?

305
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,580
Chloe was in fairview
with you.

306
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,200
You were
in that place,too?

307
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,790
They put me in that snake pit
to shut me up.

308
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,070
You know that she has a family
history of mental illness.

309
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,430
Don't listen to her,clark.

310
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,740
She's just trying
to confuse you.

311
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,920
Clark,please,
just come with me.

312
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,540
And I'll get you the help
that you need.

313
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,930
I should have known you'd
never be able to resist her.

314
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,500
You never could.

315
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,450
If she's here,it means
they're not far behind.

316
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,350
Chloe,hold on!

317
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,100
Just stay here!
We'll figure this out!

318
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,840
There's nothing
to figure out,clark.

319
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,380
I know who you really are, and
they're gonna kill me for it.

320
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,710
I have to go!

321
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,380
Mr. Kent,
just take it easy.

322
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,700
Chloe?

323
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,190
Chloe.

324
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,680
Clark,I'm not crazy.

325
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,460
No.

326
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,050
No!

327
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,340
Chloe?

328
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
This can't be real.

329
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Chloe didn't die.
No.

330
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,260
She couldn't have.

331
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,590
I'm sorry,clark.

332
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,690
I know how much
you cared about your friend.

333
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,460
What the hell
do you want from me?

334
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,850
For you to have
a happy,healthy life.

335
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,410
And it will become
a reality...

336
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,110
after this treatment.

337
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,660
I'm not gonna
go through with it.

338
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,540
I know who I am!

339
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,780
I'm not sure you do.

340
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,860
Your name is clark kent,

341
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,620
not kal-el.

342
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,310
And jor-el

343
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,040
isn't your father.

344
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,290
JOREL ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP

345
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,350
Dr. Fine,dr. Milton fine,

346
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,900
please report
to level three,stat.

347
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,700
When the human mind has faced

348
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,080
tremendous emotional pain,

349
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,070
it has no choice
but to protect itself.

350
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,010
You've taken bits and pieces
of your surroundings

351
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,410
and created an alternate universe
where you feel safe and secure.

352
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,150
Clark...

353
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,520
in a world where you truly
have no power,

354
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,840
you chose to give yourself
superpowers.

355
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,100
FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  A PRISON MEMOIR

356
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,690
PHANTOM ZONE

357
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,000
Good morning,doctor.

358
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,050
Good morning,raya.

359
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,320
FIARBIEW MENTAL HEALTH  HOSPITAL

360
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,690
That'll be all,raya.

361
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,070
BUILDING CAPACITY 331

362
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,050
This is a piece
of meteor rock from smallville.

363
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,670
Oh,it's -
it's all right,clark.

364
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,390
It can't hurt you.

365
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,040
It's not what you call
kryptonite.

366
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,250
******

367
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,510
Chloe...

368
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,100
really is dead.

369
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,360
I'm sorry,clark.

370
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,940
I'll get
the treatment ready.

371
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,910
You can't give in,kal-el.

372
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,390
You must resist.

373
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,640
None of this is real.

374
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,890
Leave me alone.

375
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,640
Listen to me.

376
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,430
When you were attacked
in the barn,

377
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,540
you were infected by a being that
you released from the phantom zone.

378
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,690
The phantom zone
doesn't exist.

379
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,500
Yes,it does.

380
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,050
And if you were a human,

381
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,320
that spirit would have
taken you over with ease,

382
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,120
uthor.

383
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,550
But you're a lot stronger
than that.

384
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,850
You're kryptonian.

385
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,930
You're a patient in a mental
hospital. You're just as crazy as I am.

386
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,100
If you give in to hudson

387
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,030
and undergo this treatment,

388
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,800
the entity will gain control
of your body with all its powers

389
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,480
and unite the other fugitives
from the phantom zone.

390
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,780
Together,they'll enslave
all of mankind.

391
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,950
If this is all in my head,
then how are you here?

392
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,740
I'm in your mind as well,

393
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,440
trying to help.

394
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,740
But there's only one way
to purge this parasite

395
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,510
and regain
your consciousness.

396
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,910
You have to kill hudson.

397
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,080
Kill hudson?

398
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,390
I can't kill a man.

399
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,130
He's not a man.

400
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,540
Hudson's a phantom.

401
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,340
You told me not to trust
anyone. Why should I trust you?

402
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,150
You know
who you are,kal-el.

403
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,810
Trust yourself.

404
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,060
Well,if it isn't
our visitor from mars.

405
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,960
Look within.
Believe in yourself.

406
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,370
The future of mankind
depends on it.

407
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,850
Whoa,what's the matter,
there,freak,huh?

408
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,420
Scared of a little fire?

409
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,940
Isn't mars
the red-hot planet?

410
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,840
Welcome home.

411
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,730
Get him out of here.

412
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,780
It's time,mr. Kent.

413
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,550
I didn't want you
to go through this alone.

414
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,960
Dr. Hudson said
I could come.

415
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,410
So close,clark.

416
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,770
You're gonna get better, and
we can finally be together,

417
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,980
like we were always
meant to be.

418
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,140
I want you to be real.

419
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,590
I am real.

420
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,850
Okay.

421
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,690
Let's say that I am
a hallucination...

422
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,900
and that your world
really does exist.

423
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,770
I'm about to marry
your greatest enemy.

424
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,340
You're an alien
from another planet

425
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,590
who's responsible
for so much tragedy.

426
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,600
Do you really want
to live in that reality?

427
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,150
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

428
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,360
Don't you just want to take
this treatment and be with me?

429
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,720
Of course
I want to be with you...

430
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,860
more than you could
ever imagine.

431
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,350
Then stop fighting,please.

432
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,880
You've lived like this

433
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,250
carried this burden
of being a hero.

434
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,680
It's time to just let go

435
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,990
and live a normal life.

436
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,390
I've never been normal.

437
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,090
Your destiny isn't
to save the world,clark.

438
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,330
It's to be with me

439
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,610
for the rest of our lives.

440
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,220
There's no need
to be afraid,clark.

441
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,370
The procedure
is quite painless.

442
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,850
It will be over
in the blink of an eye.

443
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,170
Shelby?

444
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,680
I'm still in the barn.

445
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,420
Settle down,son.

446
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,770
I know who I am!

447
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,270
****

448
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,050
*******

449
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,310
Stop it!

450
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,930
You're having
another episode.

451
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,430
Think about lana.

452
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,910
You could be together at last.

453
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,250
Get out of my mind!

454
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,580
It's you.

455
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,030
Welcome home,kal-el.

456
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,890
Clark?

457
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,060
Clark,are you all right?

458
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,720
Hey.

459
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,660
- Hi.
- shelby.

460
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,720
Thank you,buddy.
You saved my life.

461
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,470
You're sure I was only out
for a second.

462
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,050
I was walking from my car
when I heard you fall,

463
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,470
and by the time I got to
the barn,you were on your feet.

464
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,590
It felt like a lifetime.

465
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,490
I got to give
the phantom props.

466
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,760
Dangling the lana carrot
is a pretty tempting offer.

467
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,580
But he clearly has never come
across the steel will of clark kent.

468
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,330
Chloe,
you don't understand.

469
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,070
I almost gave up everything
and everyone

470
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,300
that I care about...

471
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,730
...for lana.

472
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,030
Wait a second.

473
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,030
Based on the pending nuptials,
I thought lana was past tense.

474
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,740
So did I.

475
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,070
The truth is,
I still love her.

476
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,830
I guess kryptonite's
not your only weakness.

477
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,250
So,who was i
in your alternate universe?

478
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,730
Editor in chief
of the dailyplanet?

479
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,180
Or a pulitzer prize winner,
maybe?

480
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,390
Something
like that,yeah.

481
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,240
The important part is...

482
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,050
...you were the one person
who believed in me.

483
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't know what I'd do without
you,chloe. Oh,is this when

484
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,150
I'm supposed to cue
the barry manilow music?

485
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,750
No,seriously.

486
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,360
You mean a lot more to me
than you know.

487
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,780
You look like you've got
something on your mind.

488
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,130
It's that obvious,huh?

489
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,590
You don't hide your feelings
as well as you think.

490
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,340
How you doing?

491
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,100
- I mean,with -
- fine.

492
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,890
Yeah.
Everything's fine.

493
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,520
Good.

494
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,320
So,are you gonna tell me?

495
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,880
What was that look
in your eye?

496
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,610
Oh,I...

497
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,050
I had a dream
about you last night.

498
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,390
I hope that it wasn't
a nightmare.

499
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,940
No.

500
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,210
We were 10 years old,
and I gave you a plastic ring

501
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,720
from a gumball machine
at quinn's market.

502
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,400
Sweet.

503
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,080
What was the occasion?

504
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,930
It was
an engagement ring.

505
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,920
What happened next?

506
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,520
I woke up.

507
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,800
Lana.

508
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,590
I should have guessed your delay
wasn't the herbal tea.

509
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,260
Clark.

510
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,380
It's good to see you
out and about,lex.

511
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,980
You know,you actually sounded
convincing when you said that.

512
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,270
I appreciate the civility.

513
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,190
You ready to go?

514
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,490
We don't want to keep
the wedding planner waiting.

515
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,370
Yeah,we were just
saying goodbye.
