1
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:13,983
So, it turns out global
warming's just another excuse

2
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,890
To take your clothes off.

3
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,881
I know what it looks like,
but oliver claims they raise

4
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:22,750
- A ton of money at this thing.
- Yeah, at 500 bucks a plate, i'll bet.

5
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,145
I'm just glad
you've got your press pass.

6
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:28,207
Although, as much as
i love the one-On-One time,

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,443
I got to say i'm actually surprised
lois unattached you from her hip.

8
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,558
What do you mean? Lois and i
aren't always together.

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,758
Clark, you see her more than
i see jimmy, and we're engaged.

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,810
What are you
trying to say?

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,237
Never mind.

12
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,527
I guess i just always thought that i
would be the one circling your typos.

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,566
Lois doesn't circle typos.

14
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,780
She underlines them
two or three times.

15
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:53,285
And she couldn't
skip out early.

16
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,378
In typical lois fashion,
she's already on tess' bad side.

17
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:00,387
Tess. That's assuming that the
luthor wannabe has a good side.

18
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:02,182
I know she's a die-Hard
lex supporter.

19
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:04,452
But up until this point,
she's been civil.

20
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,278
And i'm sure the flowing hair
and piercing green eyes

21
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,880
Didn't sway you at all.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,898
It doesn't change the fact
that lex knows my secret.

23
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,222
And if she truly is following
in lex's footsteps,

24
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:17,870
Then she may not be far behind.

25
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:20,484
You're right. And if lex chose her
to carry on his legacy,

26
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,631
She must be handled
with extreme caution.

27
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,438
Looks like ollie's party
started in the limo.

28
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:47,670
No.

29
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,484
He'd never show up drunk.

30
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,378
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

31
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,625
Oliver, come on. Stand up.

32
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:06,120
- I'm fine.
- I know you're not drunk.

33
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,946
- Come on, let's get you to a hospital.
- No, clark!

34
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,926
Oliver,
what's happened to you?

35
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:13,991
Poison.

36
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,191
I have 12 hours to live.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,424
Smallville 803

38
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:34,136
Synchro : flolo

39
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:10,436
For seriessub.Com

40
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,708
Chloe,
he's getting worse.

41
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,108
If it's poison, we need to
get him to a hospital.

42
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:22,898
- Davis is on his way.
- He needs a doctor, chloe.

43
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:26,406
Clark, if oliver said he wants to
avoid all mds and hospitals,

44
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,077
I'm sure he has
a really good reason.

45
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:29,918
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch my friend die!

46
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,717
Do you think
this is easy for me?

47
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:34,434
I know oliver, too. I've worked
side by side with him.

48
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,676
And when he says to do something,
it's always for a reason.

49
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,781
This time it's different! His life's at stake!

50
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,201
If you were lying on that couch,

51
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:42,429
I would do whatever you asked,
down to the letter.

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,169
I wouldn't hesitate.

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,850
Now trust him.

54
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:49,394
I'm gonna check his phone,
see if i can find the number

55
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,304
Of the girl he was with tonight.

56
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,049
Thank god. Davis.

57
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,429
He is a lot worse
than you said he was, chloe.

58
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,467
- We think he may have been poisoned.
- Can you help him?

59
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:09,339
His pulse is racing...
and he's burning up.

60
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,954
He's stable, so i can set him up
with a heart monitor,

61
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,201
Take his blood to the lab,
but if things don't look better

62
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:17,993
- In one hour, i got to bring him in.
- I know you're risking your job to do this,

63
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:20,121
But you can trust me.

64
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:27,492
Watch him. If anything changes, call.
I'll get the monitor.

65
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,186
His date's name is adrianna.
It showed up in the calendar.

66
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,569
And she didn't call after
he disappeared from the event?

67
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,481
No, and she won't pick up,
either.

68
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,202
I'm gonna go to the bar
and see if she's still there.

69
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:46,005
Let's hope for oliver's sake
that she knows something.

70
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:11,806
Latest dish with a side order
of spell check,

71
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,621
"Grisly murders down on hampton."

72
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,130
I haven't fired you yet?

73
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,536
Guess you're too busy
printing my stories.

74
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,753
What's with
the oliver queen collage?

75
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:32,449
I figured the news had trickled down
to the basement by now.

76
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,929
You know, for a renowned party boy,
queen sure can't hold his liquor.

77
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,718
Unbelievable.

78
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:41,432
Metropolis may have its very own
jack the ripper,

79
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,303
And you're preoccupied
with smearing a humanitarian.

80
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,284
Do you even know
oliver queen?

81
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:48,094
Not like you do.

82
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,191
Come on.

83
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,460
You can't tell me you don't get
a twinge of pleasure

84
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,296
Seeing your ex
take a public nosedive.

85
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,033
Look, he's a good person
who stands up against corruption

86
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,128
And social injustice.

87
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,271
I was gonna offer you the story. But
after that bleeding-Heart testimonial,

88
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:09,141
You're obviously not objective enough
to uncover the rest of it.

89
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,861
Well, it's not exactly a news flash.
You drink, you get drunk.

90
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,429
When someone leaves a club fall-Down
drunk, the story only gets better.

91
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,616
I need someone to get
to the bottom of this

92
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,372
Without suffering
from an emotional meltdown.

93
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:23,148
Please. You know, you need to
read your gossip column.

94
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,943
Oliver and i were through
a long time ago. I'll take the story.

95
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:11,995
What happened to her?

96
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,108
Someone found her passed out
in the bathroom,

97
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,415
- O.D.'D on something or other.
- Did she say anything?

98
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,946
She's barely breathing. Lucky if
she makes it to the hospital alive.

99
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,970
Come on, oliver.

100
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:31,157
Whatever's going on inside you,
you can beat it.

101
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,472
Hello!

102
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,841
Can anyone hear me?!

103
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:37,537
All right.
Here's the deal.

104
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:41,894
Normally, i don't eat anything
with more than 99 legs on it,

105
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,293
But i haven't eaten for days.

106
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,469
Kind of a bummer
for both of us, right?

107
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:56,337
Okay, you win. Go.

108
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:13,861
Hey, have you seen ollie? Apparently
he's boozed his way into a...

109
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:18,301
Who's he been partying
with, motley crue?

110
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:21,471
- It's not what you think.
- Find me a 24-Hour market.

111
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,292
I need a sports drink,
as much vitamin b

112
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,638
As you can get your hands on,
and one dill pickle.

113
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,362
Let's go! Ticktock!

114
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:29,332
He's no thung over, lois.

115
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,823
What's going on?

116
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:40,508
Clark's trying to figure it out,
but we do know that it's serious.

117
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,040
He's poisoned.

118
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,924
Oh, my god.

119
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:53,959
Ollie? It's lois.

120
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,739
What's he doing here?
He needs a real doctor.

121
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,646
He specifically said
no hospitals.

122
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,189
Well, i'm actually conscious,
and i'm saying he needs one.

123
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,857
Lois, i know
what it looks like, okay?

124
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,029
But right now, oliver needs
people he can trust,

125
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,874
And this is what he wanted.

126
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,504
You're right.

127
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:25,545
I know ollie better than anyone,
and if he said no hospitals...

128
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:32,974
... then i guess we have to
take his word for it.

129
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:41,598
- Mercy.
- Ollie?

130
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:44,230
What are you saying?

131
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:46,451
Mercy.

132
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,316
Can you hear me?

133
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,880
Can you hear me?

134
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,131
Get these things off me.

135
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,761
I hate leeches.

136
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,988
We can't take them off yet.

137
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,083
What the hell happened?
What is this?

138
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,969
You need your rest.

139
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,566
What's going on here?

140
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,141
What is this?

141
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,734
I promised them
that i could save you.

142
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,930
With leeches.

143
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:45,418
They produce
a curing enzyme.

144
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,677
You were poisoned
by a very highly toxic plant.

145
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,989
It's not that i don't appreciate
the sentiment.

146
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,390
I know it sounds crazy, but i'm a marine
biologist. We study this stuff.

147
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:01,560
Without this enzyme,
you'd be dead in 12 hours.

148
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:04,684
A hospital would have mis diagnosed you,
pumped you full of adrenaline,

149
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:07,035
And killed you instantly.

150
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:10,505
I guess... you're lucky.

151
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,548
And that shotgun
at the door...

152
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,203
Should i feel lucky
about that, too?

153
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:24,126
My friend and i...

154
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,718
We've been kidnapped.

155
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,597
Davis. I'm looking
for oliver's date.

156
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,494
She was just admitted.

157
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,888
I'm bringing oliver in.

158
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,459
Look, we just need a little more time.

159
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,204
We couldn't identify
what the poison was,

160
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:51,893
But we think it was something
that they drank in the limo

161
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,629
On the way to the fundraiser.

162
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,644
- Adrianna's a victim, too?
- Was a victim.

163
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:00,350
She's fine now.

164
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,127
We treated her with adrenaline,
and her stats evened out.

165
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:06,583
- But 10 minutes ago, she was dying.
- Modern medicine, clark.

166
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:09,918
That girl's living proof that oliver's too
sick to know what he's talking about.

167
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:13,020
Code blue!

168
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,165
Get a doctor.

169
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:18,583
Her pupils are completely dilated.
And her fever's through the roof.

170
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,259
We need 40 cc of nitro...
now! Now!

171
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,750
She's going into shock.
Stay with us.

172
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,788
It's not quite the scenario i pictured
if i ever ran into a woman

173
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,141
On this island.

174
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:52,351
Just be glad
that it worked.

175
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,462
What did they do to you?

176
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,868
We were in fiji
doing marine research.

177
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:06,413
And this speedboat
came out of nowhere.

178
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:08,377
And it attacked us.

179
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,998
And they killed everyone.

180
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,554
They killed our guide,
three of my classmates.

181
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,574
Well, how many are there?

182
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:23,751
There's the one at the door,
and there's a guy named marcos.

183
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,083
They were on their way
to thailand when the boat

184
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,844
Started taking water,
so they stopped here to fix it.

185
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,641
How's your friend?

186
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,203
She'll be okay.

187
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,888
We'll all be okay.
We just have to get out of here.

188
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:48,636
So, how's our golden goose?

189
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,755
You don't think
i know who you are?

190
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:54,660
Oliver queen?

191
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:57,244
No idea
what you're talking about.

192
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,085
You're famous!

193
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:03,186
Everyone knows you're that rich brat
who took off with his friends

194
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:06,704
On a yacht and partied his way
into a ship wreck.

195
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:11,042
And lucky for us,
not all of you were shark bait.

196
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,538
Just let them go, huh?

197
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:28,675
I have a different idea.

198
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,264
We'll ransom him
for millions.

199
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:42,118
No! No!
No! No!

200
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,207
If you kill her, you're gonna
have to kill me first.

201
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,743
You're not gonna die
for her.

202
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:50,570
I have been stuck on this god
for saken island for two years!

203
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,450
So i figure if i die...

204
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:56,934
At least i die
for something.

205
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:04,556
The boat's almost done.

206
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:08,043
Then we're out of here.

207
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,945
Look at us, the noble couple.

208
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:24,144
I let you go. In return, you were
supposed to save the world.

209
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,068
This, ollie...

210
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:30,670
This isn't saving the world, is it?

211
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,524
This is you backing out
on your end of the deal.

212
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,554
You know, maybe...

213
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,924
Maybe we had it wrong.

214
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,674
Maybe our...

215
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:53,936
... story ends
and neither of us are heroes.

216
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,243
Because you're not the only one
who couldn't hold up

217
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,181
His end of the deal.

218
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,940
The truth is...

219
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:12,428
... sometimes i wonder if
i should have ever let you go.

220
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,452
How's he doing?

221
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,605
Clark, can i talk to you
for a second?

222
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,863
The hospital couldn't
identify the poison.

223
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:52,258
That's because the profile
doesn't match any public database.

224
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,469
But how are we supposed to find an antidote
to a poison that doesn't have a name?

225
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,010
Name it ourselves.
The cyanobateria

226
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:00,522
In oliver's blood shares a similar
molecular makeup

227
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:03,478
To the chloroplast found
in a flower of the nerium genus.

228
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:06,134
Here. Now, there's only one species
of nerium oleander,

229
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,954
But that doesn't exactly narrow things down.

230
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:11,746
However, the high concentration
of cardio glycoside

231
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:16,096
Rules out several subspecies,
orienting us in the south pacific.

232
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,376
Why are you looking at me
like that?

233
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,412
You mean like
i'm at a met your lecture?

234
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:24,426
Chloe, you're the smartest
person i know by a long shot,

235
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:27,306
But since when can you trace
a few chemicals from an obscure flower?

236
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:30,135
It's no big deal. I'm just
expanding my knowledge base.

237
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:32,050
You're getting smarter.

238
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:35,503
I don't have time to discuss
this with you right now.

239
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:44,828
What is all this, chloe?

240
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,367
Thanks to lex's obsession
with toxins and viruses,

241
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,743
Luthorcorp has the most
comprehensive collection

242
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:52,145
Of organic material
on the planet.

243
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,983
You're reading all this,
aren't you?

244
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:20,574
There it is.

245
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,884
If luthorcorp has this flower,
then they have the antidote.

246
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:26,854
Listen, chloe,
as much as i appreciate

247
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:30,258
Whatever it is you just did here,
this is all because of brainiac, isn't it?

248
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:33,289
All right, i admit it. After he attacked me,
my hacking skills

249
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,735
Went from analog to digital.

250
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,840
And whether i like it or not,
i can read and process

251
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,851
Data at lightning-Fast speed.

252
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,902
Now, i knowthat right now
you are making a list

253
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:47,058
In your head of all the possible ways
this could be your fault, but please don't.

254
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,616
If this is because of brainiac,
then we don't know what can happen.

255
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:51,882
Exactly! No one knows.

256
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:55,727
So let's not worry about it
until we have to. Clark, this is my life.

257
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,467
And for once, something good
came from something horrible.

258
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,756
I'm choosing to look at this
as a gift,

259
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:03,609
One that could help us
save oliver's life.

260
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,525
Now trust me.

261
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,970
I think it's time to call in
a favor with your new boss.

262
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,791
It does bring out your eyes.

263
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,689
That tie.

264
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:33,615
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

265
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:35,399
A friend of mine has been poisoned.

266
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,426
The doctors can't help him,
but i think luthorcorp owns

267
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:39,723
The lab that makes the antidote.

268
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:42,713
Believe me, my heart
goes out to your friend. But...

269
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:46,538
I don't have some secret
stash of toxins or antidotes.

270
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,849
There must be something
you can do.

271
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,142
Lex never abandons
a project.

272
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,150
He doesn't, does he?

273
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:57,083
I'm still catching up on the ones
he's named after constellations.

274
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:00,931
But if this lab exists,
i don't know about it.

275
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,905
Look, miss mercer,
i realize that you're my boss

276
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,775
And that your job requires
a certain level of secrecy...

277
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:10,607
But the antidote to this plant
could save my friend's life.

278
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:22,125
Who exactly is your friend?

279
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:26,463
His name is oliver queen.
He doesn't have much time to live.

280
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:34,131
I'm not gonna stand here
and lie to you, clark.

281
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:36,858
But i can't help you, either.

282
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:40,775
The lab was relocated
to campo grande, brazil.

283
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:47,284
Even if i made a call, we'd never
get the antidote here in time.

284
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:11,042
You must be lois.

285
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:13,971
You must be the one who's
actually qualified to do this.

286
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,811
He's dying.

287
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,523
I'm sorry.

288
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,502
Here is what's gonna happen,
dimples.

289
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,472
You are going to reach
into that handy little

290
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,755
Tackle box of yours and
pull us out a miracle.

291
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:38,046
Oliver queen
does not die today.

292
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:42,876
The best i can do is keep him
alive a few minutes longer.

293
00:24:42,877 --> 00:24:44,294
Then do it.

294
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,380
I gave this bracelet to megan
for her birthday.

295
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,892
She was my best friend.

296
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,515
She was joking around when she said

297
00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:39,516
That she'd wear it
till the day that she died.

298
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:46,270
Okay, easy, easy.

299
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,189
There you go.

300
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,845
Come here.

301
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:04,037
I'm so sorry.

302
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:12,036
What are you doing?

303
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,027
They'll kill us.

304
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:21,141
I swore that if i ever made it
off this island, i'd change.

305
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,311
I wouldn't waste my life.

306
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:33,887
That starts now.

307
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,249
Boat's ready. Let's go.

308
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,673
Hurry up.

309
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,212
Careful.

310
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:04,165
That flower's poisonous.

311
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:30,365
You're not gonna
leave me here to die.

312
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,011
You want to live?

313
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,924
You crawl down
to the leech pond.

314
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,641
Make some new friends.

315
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,906
Are you ready to go home?

316
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,843
Just hit 106! He's on fire!

317
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,268
It's just like adrianna.
We need more ice and towels.

318
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,052
In the back.

319
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:06,808
Come on, ollie.

320
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,536
Hold on. Come on.

321
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:18,911
He can't take much more
of this!

322
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,105
Out of the way.

323
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,906
Lois, i need you
to breathe for me.

324
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,378
Breathe.

325
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:37,734
Come on, ollie,
stay with me.

326
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,170
Clark, he's dying.

327
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:42,952
Use it.

328
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:22,922
I don't get it.
This... antidote doesn't exist.

329
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:25,510
Queen industries.
They have a lab nearby.

330
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:28,999
Mercy.

331
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,704
- You have to go find mercy.
- What?

332
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,748
Tess mercer.
Clark, please.

333
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:37,061
Whoever did this to me,
they're gonna go after her next.

334
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:39,620
- You know tess?
- There's no time, clark!

335
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:42,490
She was working late.
She's at the daily planet.

336
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:00,689
Damn it.

337
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:15,441
Miss me?

338
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:19,980
You left me
on that island to die.

339
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:25,177
You're not an easy person
to track down, are you?

340
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:31,336
There's that scared little girl
i remember.

341
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:35,480
You haven't changed a bit.

342
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,163
I think you'd be surprised.

343
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:46,449
I meant to write you a postcard
to say "thank you."

344
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:49,395
You were one of the men
in my life that taught me

345
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:50,950
How to fight back.

346
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,077
Really?

347
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:53,490
Whatever happened to the party boy
hanging up his beer bong

348
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:55,389
So that he could do good
for the world?

349
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,019
Well, i'm not the guy
in that article anymore.

350
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,396
Of course you're not. You're oliver queen,
world-Famous samaritan.

351
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:04,048
And i was his first save.

352
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,196
Excuse me, you, um...

353
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:19,565
You know you were
much more than that.

354
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,235
I'm glad you're okay, oliver.

355
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,215
After all, i need the chief
of queen industries

356
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:33,755
Alive and well if luthorcorp is
gonna keep its competitive edge.

357
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:36,966
I'm happy to help.

358
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:39,317
This is great.

359
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,167
A few pay grades up from your days
studying jelly fish

360
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,477
And protesting
whaler ships, huh?

361
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,981
You're not the first person
to wonder how i arrived

362
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:51,310
At the helm
of the luthor dynasty.

363
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:53,213
Well, what's to wonder?

364
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:55,182
You play to win.

365
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:58,676
I found out how ruthless
you were a long time ago.

366
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,997
After what you did to me,
did you really expect me to just

367
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,960
- Sit around and eat ice cream?
- No.

368
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:07,030
You'd rather work
for my greatest enemy, and then,

369
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:09,625
Just when i think the knife
can't twist any farther,

370
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:12,070
You take over
his entire company.

371
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:14,731
Oh, so that's what you do
when you're not writing checks

372
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:16,428
And grinning for the cameras.

373
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:18,789
You sit around pondering ways
that i've dedicated my life

374
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,616
To your downfall.

375
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:25,485
I'm sorry to break it to you, oliver,
but everything i did, i did for me.

376
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:29,481
Well, then i guess our past
is behind us.

377
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,209
It has been since the day
that you said goodbye.

378
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,127
Oh, wait.

379
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,875
You never actually did, did you?

380
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:42,167
Is that why you
called me here?

381
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:44,662
Because it's on the tip
of my tongue.

382
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:49,439
No.

383
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:52,708
I called you
to give you this.

384
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:55,040
I realize that lionel luthor
is dead and buried,

385
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,669
But maybe this will help you
sleep at night.

386
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:24,343
- Hey, lois.
- Hey, thanks, smallville.

387
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:27,071
Starting to get the hang
of things around here.

388
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,841
I spoke to chloe. She said you
didn't come home last night.

389
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,777
So not what you're thinking.

390
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:37,811
I may have played nurse with oliver,
but it never progressed to doctor.

391
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:39,776
I've been working here
all night.

392
00:34:40,593 --> 00:34:43,695
"Kitten-Adoption fair
this sunday"?

393
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:47,214
You gave up your article
on oliver for this?

394
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:51,504
Doesn't sound like you, lois.

395
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:56,230
Is it possible you're more shaken up
about last night than you realize?

396
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,651
You think?

397
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,704
I was practically
a three-Shot martini.

398
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,670
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you have
to bury your emotions in your work.

399
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,838
This is the most heart breaking
kitten-Adoption story you've ever read.

400
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:14,955
What am i doing?
Ollie and i are through.

401
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:17,583
Maybe, but just because
your relationship's over

402
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:19,619
Doesn't mean
the feelings go away.

403
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,916
I'd be lying if i said
i didn't watch the goodbye tape

404
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:24,944
- That lana sent me more than once.
- Well, i'd rather avoid a ride

405
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:27,404
On the clark-And-Lana
roller coaster.

406
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:29,471
No offense.

407
00:35:30,073 --> 00:35:31,741
It's okay.

408
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:34,382
I've got a delicate enough ego
as it is.

409
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:37,511
I am not cut out to date a guy
with a hero complex.

410
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,960
I mean, you were there.
You saw him at the fundraiser.

411
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:43,958
He's practically an icon,
"the man of tomorrow,"

412
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,521
And i'm just lois lane,
the girl who writes about it.

413
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:51,196
Lois, there's nothing wrong with that.

414
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:55,173
Right. So, when the occasional feelings
flare up,

415
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:57,422
You just got to trust your gut,
as hard as it is,

416
00:35:57,423 --> 00:36:00,634
And realize that you broke up
for a reason.

417
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,058
Exactly.

418
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:06,255
That one's on the house,
smallville.

419
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:10,233
You should know,
i'm allergic to cats.

420
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,294
Get to work.

421
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:15,036
Chop-Chop.

422
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:35,166
I thought i closed those.

423
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:39,397
- I'm sorry. They were open.
- What are you doing here?

424
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:42,882
Uh, well, i was, uh,
checking in on oliver.

425
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:46,441
It was a hell of a close call last night.
He's got a pretty great crew of friends.

426
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:49,571
Renegade paramedic
included.

427
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:51,792
You must have done pretty well
on your s.A.T.S.

428
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,075
I thought you said
you studied journalism.

429
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:55,934
Well, yeah, journalism,
and then there were the core

430
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:58,833
Classes and some, you know,
electives and stuff.

431
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,206
Level with me, chloe.
Are you some kind of genius?

432
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,256
I'm embarrassing you.

433
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:06,437
There's a reason i like to try
and keep the doors closed.

434
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:08,938
You know, there's nothing wrong
with being smart.

435
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:12,804
When the seating chart at your wedding
looks more like a euclidean

436
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:16,621
Algorithm than a ding hall, you know
you've got something seriously wrong.

437
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,901
And the guy next to you
on that seating chart,

438
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:25,061
What does he think
about all this?

439
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,662
He doesn't know.

440
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:33,632
Well, it's all sort of
just happening,

441
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:37,138
Which is why i would really prefer it
if we could keep it between us.

442
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,412
Look, chloe, i think that,
in some weird way,

443
00:37:41,413 --> 00:37:45,076
We all have some part of us
that we hold underneath the surface.

444
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:48,850
Even i do.

445
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:05,842
So, i hear i'm not the only one
in town who owes you a drink.

446
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,129
Tess mercer's attacker
was arrested last night.

447
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:13,536
Why didn't you tell me
you knew tess mercer before?

448
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:17,434
It was in the past.

449
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:20,323
Not exactly proud of the way
things turned out.

450
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,086
Doesn't change the fact that she
knew the guy who tried to kill you.

451
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,450
Yeah, well,
it makes sense to me.

452
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:29,832
The guy came after me.
Then he's gonna go after her.

453
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,442
She's the other captain
of industry in town, so...

454
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,824
Oliver, with all that poison in your system,
are you sure adding more

455
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:37,567
Is the best idea right now?

456
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,217
Yeah, clark, why don't you
stick to your milkshakes, huh?

457
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,954
I'll know
when i've had enough.

458
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:52,285
Lionel luthor
killed my parents.

459
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,805
You figured that out
from flight records?

460
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:57,905
I mean,
it was a plane crash.

461
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,223
Yeah, it was a plane crash,
and according to that,

462
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:04,093
There were luthorcorp employees
on the maintenance lot.

463
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:07,032
And you think lionel paid them
to sabotage the plane?

464
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:15,033
Did you know about this?

465
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,683
You were the son lionel never had.
The guy knew everything about you, right?

466
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:25,432
So don't stand there and tell me
that you didn't know a couple

467
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:27,316
Of his dirty little secrets.

468
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:41,283
Look, oliver, i was afraid that
you'd do something you'd regret.

469
00:39:41,284 --> 00:39:44,261
"Something i regret." Like what, clark?
You thought i was gonna kill him?

470
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,887
Is that it?

471
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:48,179
I wouldn't have killed him!

472
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:53,888
I survived for two years
on an island by myself, clark!

473
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:56,227
When it wasn't pouring rain,
it was blistering sun!

474
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,991
There were mosquitos
that ate me alive!

475
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:04,125
It's okay, because you know
what? It made me strong.

476
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:09,177
You may be invincible,
but you are not fearless, are you?

477
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:13,465
You're afraid to trust your friends,
and you're afraid to face

478
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:15,279
Who you were really meant to be.

479
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:20,211
You're afraid of everything.

480
00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:23,592
Maybe you haven't been
put to the test yet.

481
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,422
Maybe your island's
still out there, clark.

482
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,094
- Take me to the airport.
- Right.

483
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,968
What the hell...

484
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,474
You.

485
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,977
Who do you think
paid your bail?

486
00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:59,385
Jail's too good for you.

487
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,880
I think he's having
a heart attack.

488
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,434
You might want to take him
to the hospital.

489
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,380
What am i, an ambulance?

490
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:15,575
They'll know what to do
with him.

491
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:28,968
