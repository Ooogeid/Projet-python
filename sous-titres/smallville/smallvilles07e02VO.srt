1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Lois, you've had
a near-Death experience.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,400
You should be resting.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,200
What are we doing
out here?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to find out
what lex is up to.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,400
Clark, you, on the other hand,
are not required to attend.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,600
After what happened to lana,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,400
Why don't you take up chloe's offer
and hang out with her at the talon?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
It's dangerous out here.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,600
And it seems that keeping you out of trouble
has become a bad habit of mine.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Besides, it gives me a good
opportunity to say goodbye.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
You can't break up
with me, clark.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,500
We're not even a couple.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,400
Lois,
i'm leaving smallville...

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,700
After lana's funeral.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,400
Wow,
didn't see that coming.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,700
Where are you
running away to?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
Up north.
There's something i need to do.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,300
Well, what about the farm?

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
You can't just let the corn
die on the vine.

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,200
My neighbor ben hubbard --

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,300
He's gonna run things
for a while.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,400
What's wrong, lois?

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
I thought you'd be happy
to get rid of me.

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,500
Are you kidding?
Who am i gonna pick on?

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,700
I'm sure
you'll find someone.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,700
Now, which direction did you
enter the dam from?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,400
Southeast. Follow me.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,000
What is that?

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,700
Holy crap,
this is amazing.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,200
Check this out, clark.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, my god.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
What do you think it is?

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Lois, it's probably
just some sort of experimental airplane.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,000
Then why aren't there
any windows?

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
And those symbols --

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,100
They aren't like any
airline logos i've ever seen.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
If you ask me,

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
We're looking
at a real live spaceship.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Come on, lois.

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
You and i both know
that they don't really exist.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
And based on this algae,

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,400
It looks like it's been
underwater for a while.

43
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,800
Lois?

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,200
That's what happens
when you touch my stuff.

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Go get your girlfriend...

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,900
And don't ever come back.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,700
Closed caption programs may be

<Font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@xxy
sync:frs@рвґє</font>

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm serious. You need
to go to the hospital.

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
What?
For this little bump?

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
My head has been bonked
a lot harder than that.

53
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Where's my laptop?

54
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,300
What happened
to you guys?

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,100
You are gonna want
to lock me in the loony bin

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,900
When i tell you this,

57
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
But clark and i just saw
a spaceship.

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Lois' imagination has finally
kicked into overdrive.

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,100
It was probably just some sort
of styrofoam prop for a school play.

60
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
Right. That makes sense,
actually.

61
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, but the world
i live in --

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,200
School props don't
knock people unconscious.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm thinking
maybe a force field.

64
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,800
Look, how many times
do i have to tell you, lois?

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
You slipped in the mud
and hit your head on a rock.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
I helped you to your feet.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,700
Why do you think i've got mud
all over me?

68
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,000
I know what i saw,
smallville,

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,800
And once i change, i'm going
straight to the <i>inquisitor.</I>

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,500
My editor is gonna flip.

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,900
Tell me
she's just seeing things.

72
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,500
It's what she didn't see,
chloe --

73
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,200
A kryptonian girl with blond
hair and a bad attitude.

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,100
She moved so fast that lois
didn't even know what hit her.

75
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,300
A kryptonian
attacked lois?

76
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
Yeah, right before
she came after me.

77
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,800
Chloe, not only is she
as strong as i am...

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,700
She can fly.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,300
Whoa.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Sounds like we got ourselves
a true-Blue supergirl.

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Well, define super.

82
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,300
Nearly every kryptonian
that i've come across

83
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
Has turned
into a cold-Blooded killer.

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,300
Yeah. What is it
with you people?

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,100
Are you the only half-Decent
member of your kryptonian race?

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Listen, i got to go
back to the dam.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,300
If you can --

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,400
Wow,
a lot of painkillers

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
For someone who's not
feeling any pain.

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,900
It's just
a little headache.

91
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,400
By the time i get back
to the <i>inquisitor,</i>

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,300
I'll be good as gold.

93
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
You've lost consciousness.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,300
You could very well
have a concussion.

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, i'll let you know
if i'm seeing double

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
When i'm typing
my story.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Lois, no. I'm sorry.

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,800
But after everything we've
just been through together,

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm not letting you
put yourself in danger.

100
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
Okay.

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,300
But 10 minutes,
and then i'm gone.

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,700
???

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,700
Well, i'm glad someone has
something to smile about.

105
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,900
Well, this smile means

106
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,600
That you've been cleared
of all charges.

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
You're a free man,
mr. Luthor.

108
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,300
On what grounds?

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,400
They caught the killer.

110
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,700
A disgruntled employee from
your tunnel-Construction crew

111
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
Claimed he got cancer
from the chemicals down there.

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,500
He blew up my wife
to get back at me?

113
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,600
That's what he said
in his confession.

114
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,000
Come on.
Let's get out of this cage.

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
I'll buy you
a big, juicy porterhouse.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,100
He didn't do it.

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,900
Lex, they found his fingerprints
at the scene.

118
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
He confessed to the crime.

119
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
I don't care what kind
of evidence there is.

120
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,300
The man did not murder
my wife.

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
-As your attorney --
-As my attorney,

122
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,800
I want you
to set up a meeting

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
With this
disgruntled employee.

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
I want to hear it from him.

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,100
What's the point?

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,300
I'm not sure lana's dead.

127
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,400
Move along, sir.
This is a crime scene.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Lex, i thought you'd be

129
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,900
Sharpening your shiv
behind bars by now.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Someone else confessed.

131
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,500
Once again, a luthor snake

132
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Manages to slither away
from the grip of justice.

133
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
How much did you have
to pay this poor guy?

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,700
I didn't pay him anything.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Apparently, my father did
before he disappeared.

136
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,200
The man who confessed
happens to be dying of cancer.

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,100
He wanted his family
taken care of.

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,900
It doesn't matter
what legal sleight of hand

139
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,100
You pulled this time, lex --
It's not bringing lana back.

140
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,800
What if she
isn't dead, chloe?

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,500
Lex, you're already free.

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,800
You don't need
to keep coming up

143
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,300
With more convoluted
conspiracy theories.

144
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,200
As you probably know,
before lana "died,"

145
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,300
She managed to steal highly
classified research from me.

146
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,800
Lana's remains have
all been positively i.D.'D

147
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Down to every last strand
of dna.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm well aware
of the dna evidence.

149
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,700
Look, chloe,
you're lana's best friend.

150
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,800
If she told anyone about
her plan, it would be you.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,100
Tell me, chloe.

152
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Tell me
everything you know.

153
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Here's everything
i know, lex.

154
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,100
You need some
rious psychiatry.

155
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,400
Hey, are you all right?

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,500
Uh, yeah, i'm fine.

157
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
But your little
kryptonian gal pal's

158
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,000
Been showing up
all over lowell county.

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Have you seen her since
she went all space-Shuttle?

160
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
No, but i found
her victims --

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,900
Two dead park rangers
right where her ship used to be.

162
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,100
I need to find her
before she hurts someone else.

163
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Well, i-I think
she's still grounded,

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,300
Considering these 911 calls
coming in.

165
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,500
Three different preschools
called and reported

166
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,000
Some blond woman storming in,
scaring the children.

167
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Where was she last seen?

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,100
Can't catch me!

169
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,100
What's your name?

170
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,100
It's okay.
I won't hurt you.

171
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,900
Cody.

172
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,400
What about you?
What's your name?

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Whatever you're doing,
it stops now.

174
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,000
You again.
You following me?

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
Humans can't move
that fast.

176
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,900
Who are you?

177
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,800
Doesn't matter.

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Not gonna let you kill
one more person.

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
I haven't killed anyone --

180
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,900
At least not yet.

181
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
But you're starting
to tempt me.

182
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,900
You want to tell me
what you're doing on earth?

183
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,000
You can trust me.

184
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Looking for a small boy.

185
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,000
I've searched everywhere
with no luck.

186
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
This boy have a name?

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Kal-El.

188
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
Lois, a story
about a spaceship

189
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,300
Is not gonna send your career
into the stratosphere.

190
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
It'll embarrass you.

191
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,300
It's the truth, chloe.
I saw it with my own eyes.

192
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,900
Lois, you don't know
what you saw.

193
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,300
Besides, i'm still trying
to resuscitate my credibility

194
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,400
After writing
about the smallville
believe-It-Or-Not set.

195
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,200
We are talking
about an alien invasion.

196
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Two men are dead.

197
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,600
If you were there,

198
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,700
You'd be clacking away
on the keyboard as we speak.

199
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Not now.

200
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,700
<I>the daily planet</i>
just hired

201
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,000
A new editor wonder boy
from the <i>star city post.</I>

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And spaceships are not the stuff
of good first impressions.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,800
Did i hear someone
say spaceship?

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,100
Didn't anyone teach you
that eavesdropping is rude?

205
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Eavesdropping
is my livelihood.

206
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,600
Grant gabriel --
Your new editor.

207
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,700
Actually, she doesn't
work here. I do.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,900
I'm chloe --

209
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,700
Anne sullivan,

210
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Former editor
of the smallville high <i>torch,</i>

211
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,500
Taking met u.
Journalism classes by night

212
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,000
While writing filler stories
sandwiched between sofa ads
by day.

213
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,800
Tell me
about your close encounter.

214
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,900
Can't share
a trade secret.

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,800
I work for your rival,
the <i>inquisitor.</I>

216
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,200
Our rival?

217
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,100
This is <i>the daily planet,</i>

218
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,500
Read in virtually ever country
across the globe.

219
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,600
We have no rival.

220
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
That's true.

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,400
Besides, <i>the planet</i>
wouldn't publish

222
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,600
A story like that anyway.

223
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,000
See, that's the kind
of old-Guard thinking

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
That's putting newspapers
in the crapper

225
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,700
All around this country.

226
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,200
Since when is
truth in journalism old guard?

227
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,200
Well, she says it's true.
I believe her.

228
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,600
I'll tell you what.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You deliver me
your spaceship story,

230
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
A story
that will sell papers,

231
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
And you've got yourself
a job here.

232
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Are you serious?

233
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,500
Do i sound like i'm joking?

234
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,600
You can't be kal-El.

235
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,400
He's a sweet, chubby baby

236
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,100
Who laughed
when you tickled his feet.

237
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,900
You knew me on krypton?

238
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeah.
I used to watch over you.

239
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
I don't understand.

240
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,800
I mean, i left the planet
right after you.

241
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,300
We were
on the same trajectory.

242
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Your ship --

243
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,300
It seemed to be underwater
for a long time.

244
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,400
You must have crash-Landed

245
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
During the meteor shower
into the reservoir.

246
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,200
When the dam broke, it finally
brought you to the surface.

247
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,200
How long was i
in suspended animation?

248
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,500
18 years.

249
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
My imbedded learning programs
covered a lot of scenarios,

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
But this clearly
wasn't one of them.

251
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,800
Kara, why are you
searching for me?

252
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,500
My father, zor-El,
told me to find you.

253
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,000
That was my mission.

254
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,400
Zor-El?

255
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,800
Zor-El and jor-El
are brothers.

256
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,400
Then that makes us...

257
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Cousins.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,900
Jor-El never mentioned
your dad.

259
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,200
He and his brother
never talked.

260
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,100
Why?

261
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,100
The house of el
has a lot of family secrets

262
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
That nobody
ever discussed.

263
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,700
As humans would say,
we were...

264
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,800
Dysfunctional.

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
But i'm sure you have
a lot of questions,

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,700
But right now
we need to find my ship.

267
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,100
I'd do it myself,

268
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
But those green rocks --
They keep weakening me.

269
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
And trust me -- You want to
stay away from them.

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,500
If you're around them too long,
they can kill you.

271
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Kill me?

272
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,800
Zor-El told me
that the yellow sun

273
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,300
Would give me abilities
beyond my wildest dreams,

274
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,000
But he definitely never
mentioned any fatal weaknesses.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
It's because
he didn't know.

276
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,500
The green rocks,
they're called kryptonite --

277
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
Radioactive pieces
of our home world.

278
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,600
How did pieces of krypton
travel 23 galaxies?

279
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,700
You don't know what happened
after you left.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,400
Well, i know we were
in the midst

281
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,700
Of a global civil war
led by general zod.

282
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Zor-El told me that krypton's
salvation was on earth

283
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,900
And that you and i
were the key.

284
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
I hope we're not too late.

285
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,200
Kara, krypton is gone.

286
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
What do you mean, "gone"?

287
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
It exploded.

288
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
You and i
are the only survivors.

289
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,500
No.

290
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Planets don't
just explode, kal-El.

291
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,200
Ours did.

292
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,300
No.

294
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
This yellow sun has fried
your brain cells.

295
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,100
Come on.
Help me find my ship.

296
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
We can hide it here
on your farm.

297
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,500
Your ship's missing.

298
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,700
If it's missing,
then humans took it.

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Kal-El, if anyone but me
tries to open that ship,

300
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,600
It will activate
the self-Destruct sequence.

301
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Define self-Destruct.

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
I think you call it
something like a...

303
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,600
Nuclear explosion.

304
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,300
There was no sign of alien life
near that site --

305
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,400
None whatsoever.

306
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,400
Open it.

307
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
Surface temperature
rising steadily.

308
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,000
Begin extraction protocol.
Prepare to evacuate now.

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
We don't have
a lot of time, people.

310
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,400
Lane, i had a feeling
you worked fast,

311
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,200
But i didn't know
you were a lightning bolt.

312
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,600
You got pages for me?

313
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Actually, i need to talk
to you about that.

314
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm not interested in talk.
I want to read.

315
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,300
Look, chloe sullivan
should write this story.

316
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,700
She's already on your staff.

317
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,300
And let's face it,
she can write circles around me.

318
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,900
I know she's family, lane,

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
But chloe sullivan's
lost her mojo.

320
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,200
Now she's just another
run-Of-The-Mill hack

321
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
Giving herself
carpal tunnel

322
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,000
Covering city hall
and fourth-Of-July parades.

323
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Look, my cousin's feelings
mean a lot more to me

324
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,900
Than some stupid article.

325
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,600
Your cousin's feelings?
How sweet.

326
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,500
Let me tell you
something, lane.

327
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
Newspapers
don't have feelings.

328
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They have stories,

329
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And stories are what
pay the bills around here.

330
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
You think i'm being honored
by the publishers guild tonight

331
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,100
Because i'm mahatma gandhi,

332
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,300
Because i give a damn
about feelings?

333
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,900
No. I break stories
any way, any how.

334
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Well, you're gonna have to break
this one with someone else.

335
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,200
This isn't
about your cousin.

336
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,600
This so-Called
flying-Saucer story --

337
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,900
It's all smoke and mirrors.

338
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,700
You're using
some high moral ground

339
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,400
To bail
out of a sinking ship.

340
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,500
This ship is far
from sunk, bow tie.

341
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,600
I happen to have a contact
in the air force

342
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,900
Who supplied me with these.

343
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,200
They're satellite photos
showing a caravan of trucks

344
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Driving from the dam
to a grain silo in granville.

345
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,600
Does that look like
smoke and mirrors to you?

346
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,000
No.

347
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It looks like passion,

348
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,300
And it's what separates you
from the rest of the pack.

349
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
This is the fork
in your road, lane.

350
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,800
In a dozen years, you'll either
be lois lane, star reporter

351
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,300
Whose name is synonymous
with <i>the daily planet,</i>

352
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,100
Or lois fill-In-The-Blank,

353
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,500
Married to an insurance adjuster
in the sticks

354
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,800
With four kids
and 40 extra pounds.

355
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
You won't be able to look
in a newspaper

356
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,500
Because it will always remind
you of what could have been.

357
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Which road
sounds better to you?

358
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,500
What do you have for me?

359
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
We applied
voice-Recognition software

360
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,300
And, using our satellites,
cast a net

361
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Over every landline
and cellphone on the globe.

362
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,900
I don't care
how wide your net is.

363
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,300
If you don't find lana,

364
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
It's not worth the string
it's made of.

365
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
We have a map, sir.
She's in asia.

366
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,300
Where?
China.

367
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,400
Our gps puts her just a few
miles from central shanghai.

368
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,100
Prepare the jet
for takeoff.

369
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,900
Yes, sir.

370
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Those doors would have opened
if you'd have just waited.

371
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,100
We don't have time to wait
for ancient technology.

372
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
Between the two of us,
we can cover more ground.

373
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,000
Of course, it would help
if you could defy gravity.

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
Explain to me again
why you can't fly.

375
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,100
I'm not sure.

376
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,300
I guess the humans
are right, kal-El.

377
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Girls do mature faster
than boys.

378
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,400
It's clark, remember?

379
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,600
Just start walking.
Don't look back.

380
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,700
I should have known
you were clark's cousin

381
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,600
From all the primary colors.

382
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,600
Do you know
where my ship is?

383
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,200
Kal-El's
getting me nowhere.

384
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,600
It's clark.

385
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
We've checked every luthorcorp
facility in the area.

386
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,600
Do you have any leads?

387
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,200
Unfortunately, not too many
extraterrestrial vehicles

388
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,300
Are actually registered
at the dmv.

389
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,300
I have nothing.

390
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
I told you coming here
was a waste of time.

391
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,300
She's just a human.

392
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,800
A human who's smarter
than both of us combined.

393
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
Look, i'm sorry, clark,

394
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
But this new editor is
breathing down my neck.

395
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,300
He wants
some big, splashy story,

396
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
And all i could come up with

397
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,000
Is the sudden loss
of am/fm radio in granville.

398
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,600
I'm out of here.

399
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll just do a flyover

400
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,400
And start x-Raying
every single building.

401
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,300
Kara, wait.

402
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Your ship -- Does it emit
any sort of frequency?

403
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,100
Well, yeah. If it's opened,
there's an alarm.

404
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,300
Could that alarm be disrupting
the am/fm radios?

405
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
Kal-El, if that alarm's
been triggered,

406
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm the only one
who can disarm it.

407
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,600
What are we doing up here?
Time's running out.

408
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,700
Look, you cover the grounds.
I'll get the bird's-Eye view.

409
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,800
What does your ship
sound like?

410
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,900
What?

411
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,200
If your ship is emitting
an alarm, then you can hear it,

412
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,100
Even if it's miles away.

413
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,400
It's one of our abilities
on earth.

414
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,200
You have to focus.
Block everything else out.

415
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,300
Just try.

416
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,300
All i hear is the wind.

417
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,100
Close your eyes.
It might help.

418
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,400
Try to focus.

419
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I know you can do it.

420
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Just try to listen
to all the sounds around you.

421
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,400
Make it stop.

422
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,600
Oh, make it stop.

423
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,700
Listen. Listen.

424
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,400
I know it's loud at first,
but you have to focus, okay?

425
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,600
Eliminate the sounds
one by one

426
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,300
Until all you can hear
is your ship.

427
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,100
Kal-El,
i -- I can hear it.

428
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,600
Then we can find it.

429
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
I knew those roadblocks
i slipped past

430
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
Weren't there
for just a chemical spill.

431
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,400
They evacuated the area

432
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Because of what's
down here underground.

433
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,900
And judging by that funky sound

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,700
And the megawatt light show,

435
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
Something is going on
behind that door,

436
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,900
And it's not laserium.

437
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,300
Oh, my god.

438
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,400
It's official.

439
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,000
I found the holy grail.

440
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,600
Uh-Oh.

441
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,300
Are you okay?

442
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,600
My ship -- It's gone.

443
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,300
What are we gonna do?

444
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,600
<I>that's the last time</i>
<i>you'll ever touch me.</I>

445
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,400
<I>do you really think</i>
<i>i could just let you walk away?</I>

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,600
<I>what are you</i>
<i>going to do, lex...</i>

447
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,600
<I>kill me?</I>

448
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,500
<I>that's the last time</i>
<i>you'll ever touch me.</I>

449
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,300
<I>do you really think</i>
<i>i could just let you walk away?</I>

450
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,500
<I>what are you</i>
<i>going to do, lex...</i>

451
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,500
<I>kill me?</I>

452
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,700
<I>that's the last time</i>
<i>you'll ever touch me.</I>

453
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,300
<I>do you really think</i>
<i>i could just let you walk away?</I>

454
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
<I>what are you</i>
<i>going to do, lex?</I>

455
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm impressed.

456
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,500
I did learn
from the master.

457
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,100
As soon as i heard
you'd freed yourself,

458
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
I laid out the breadcrumbs

459
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
And waited for the wolf
to come knocking.

460
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Tell me, lex.

461
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,700
How were you planning
on getting your revenge?

462
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,800
Lana, if i wanted revenge,

463
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,700
We wouldn't be having
this conversation.

464
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I've come here to beg
for your forgiveness.

465
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,700
With a gun
pointed at your head,

466
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,200
You'll say anything,
won't you?

467
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,300
The things i did to you
were beyond inexcusable.

468
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
I don't blame you
for wanting to ruin my life.

469
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
I probably would have done
the same thing...

470
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,200
Only not as elegant.

471
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
I always knew
you were smart, lana.

472
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,100
I didn't know
you were brilliant...

473
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,900
Using my own science
against me.

474
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,000
It wasn't science, lex.

475
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,100
It was your own psychosis.

476
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,800
You cloned me.

477
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Not exactly.

478
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Model 503 was never alive.

479
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
That's why you were able
to wheel it out of my lab

480
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,100
And place it
in your driver's seat.

481
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,900
By the time
the car exploded,

482
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,900
You were safe and sound

483
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,200
While model 503, with your dna,
was being blown to bits.

484
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,900
It was perfect.

485
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,300
As far
as the world's concerned,

486
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Lana luthor
is dead and buried.

487
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
And a dead woman
can't be convicted of murder.

488
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,800
You'll never hurt
another person again, lex.

489
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I don't want to.

490
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,800
Don't come any closer.

491
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,600
I want to give you
a better target.

492
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,900
After all the pain i've put you
through, i deserve to die.

493
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,500
Please, lana.
Pull the trigger.

494
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,300
I promise you the world
will be a better place.

495
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,100
Do it.

496
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Kill me.

497
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,900
If you want to come back
to smallville, you'll be safe.

498
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll take care
of everything.

499
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
You can live your life
however you want.

500
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,000
My father's gone,
presumed dead.

501
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,900
And as for me...

502
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,300
I would never, ever
hurt you again.

503
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,500
I'm sorry, lana.

504
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,900
There aren't any mattresses
to break your fall.

505
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,600
To think i could have landed
a job at <i>the daily planet.</I>

506
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
What a joke.

507
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
I am no chloe sullivan
and never will be.

508
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Lane,
i just read your story.

509
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
It's ridiculous.

510
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
It was just her first draft,
mr. Gabriel.

511
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
It's absurd
how good it is.

512
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,500
Your prose leaps off the page
like a bengal tiger.

513
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,800
I was riveted.

514
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
So, you're actually
gonna run it?

515
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,000
Absolutely not.
It's utterly unprintable.

516
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,600
I don't care if every word
of it is true.

517
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,600
I can't run a story
about a ship from outer space

518
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,500
Without a photo.

519
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,700
You got to learn, lane.
Always carry a backup camera.

520
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,800
If you would just give her
a second chance --

521
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
You like water, lane?

522
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,500
As much as the next girl.

523
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,200
I'm giving you
a waterfront view.

524
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,900
This is your new desk
right here,

525
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,200
Right across
from cousin chloe.

526
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Excuse me?

527
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,000
If you're lucky, sullivan,

528
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,300
Some of her passion
will rub off on you,

529
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,100
Maybe put a little fire
on that torch

530
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,400
You let burn out
after high school.

531
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
Am i hearing things,

532
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Or did you
just offer me a job?

533
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,300
Welcome to <i>the daily planet,</i>
lois lane.

534
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,600
You play your cards right,

535
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,500
You'll be out of this basement
quicker than your cousin.

536
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,700
Nothing like
a little family rivalry

537
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,100
To keep
the bullpen hopping.

538
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,400
Kara?

539
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,100
You okay?

540
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,900
How did it happen?

541
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,500
Krypton, i mean.

542
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,900
I don't know.

543
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,400
I'd always heard whispers
of a doomsday scenario,

544
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,100
But i never thought
anyone would actually do it.

545
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,700
We were supposed to be

546
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,200
The most advanced civilization
in the galaxy.

547
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,500
One thing i've learned

548
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,200
Is that evil exists
in all cultures,

549
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
No matter
how advanced they are.

550
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Maybe if i had had my abilities
on krypton,

551
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,100
I could have saved it.

552
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,100
You saved a lot of people
here today.

553
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
You should feel good
about that.

554
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,900
It's different
for you, kal-El.

555
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,100
You don't have
any memory of krypton.

556
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,500
This has always been
your home.

557
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Well, then, be my memory.

558
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,100
Tell me about my family.

559
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,400
It's hazy from all those years
of sleep in the ship.

560
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
I do remember some.

561
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,400
I used to, uh,
sneak away from kandor

562
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
And come and see lora.

563
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,400
She always
made me smile.

564
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
You knew my mom?

565
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,100
The day she found out
she was pregnant,

566
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,200
I'd never seen her
so happy.

567
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,100
You were so cute.

568
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,700
You were her miracle baby.

569
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
And now she's gone.

570
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,800
My parents are gone,

571
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,600
The entire house of el.

572
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,700
I'll never see any of my family
ever again.

573
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Well,
you're with family now.

574
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,700
Look, you can stay here with me

575
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,300
On the farm as long as you want.

576
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
You know, these humans
are not as bad as you think.

577
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,400
Thank you, kal-El.

578
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,200
I mean, clark.

579
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,200
I just wish i didn't feel
like such a failure.

580
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,500
I made my father a promise,
and i couldn't keep it.

581
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Kara,
that wasn't your fault.

582
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,600
We can't always be everything
our fathers expect us to be.

583
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,700
I know that firsthand.

584
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,600
The way he spoke
of the crystal --

585
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,400
He told me to guard it
with my life,

586
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,500
And now it's gone.

587
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,200
Wait, there's a crystal
in that ship?

588
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,700
With all of my directives

589
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,300
And the power to help me
along the way.

590
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,000
If that crystal fell
into the wrong hands,

591
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,400
It could be disastrous.

592
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Luckily, we don't have
to worry about that

593
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,300
Since it was destroyed
with the ship.

594
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,900
No. That explosion wouldn't
scratch the crystal.

595
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Only a kryptonian
can destroy it.

596
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
I've searched everywhere.

597
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,100
That crystal is gone.

598
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,200
Hmm.

599
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
The spacecraft was eviscerated,

600
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
But all is not lost.

601
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,100
Kal-El, my son,

602
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,500
You have finally chosen
to start your training.

603
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,000
A kryptonian girl
showed up at my doorstep.

604
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,600
Her name is kara.

605
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,500
Last time that happened,
you were behind it.

606
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I know nothing
of her arrival.

607
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,000
She says she was sent here
by her father, zor-El.

608
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,500
You might remember him,
since he's your brother.

609
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,100
Care to tell me why you ignored that branch
of the family tree?

610
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
Whatever zor-El
wanted with you,

611
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,400
It was not for the greater good
of krypton.

612
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,800
He could not be trusted,

613
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,200
And neither
can his daughter.

614
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,100
You can't blame kara
for the actions of her father.

615
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,600
She's not here
to cause any harm.

616
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,200
That is an emotional,
human reaction.

617
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Be careful
of your feelings, kal-El.

618
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,700
They can betray you.

619
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,400
My feelings
are part of who i am,

620
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Whether you like it or not.

621
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Now, what about
my training?

622
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
Your training
starts with kara.

623
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
Watch over her, kal-El.

624
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,400
She poses a greater threat
than you believe.

625
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,700
Mr. Luthor.

626
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,700
I take it you found
who you were looking for.

627
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,900
There's someone else
i need you to locate.

628
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,700
This drawing isn't much
to go on, sir.

629
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,300
It's all i have.

630
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,100
That woman saved my life.

631
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,800
Use whatever resources
are necessary to find her.

632
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,600
Is that clear?

633
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,500
Yes, sir.

634
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:30,600
