1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,070
If you don't honor the promise
that you've made to my son,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,270
I will kill clark kent.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,470
I want you to be there on our wedding
day to see what you lost.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,470
- Lana, we should be together.
- I've had a change of heart.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,470
May I present to you mr.
And mrs. Alexander luthor?

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,870
I found my mom, clark.
She's in a mental institution.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,570
I never felt rage like that before.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,270
You were angry before you
ever heard of titan.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,570
How could she marry lex?

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,870
I don't know, clark,but she made her choice.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,470
Mom?

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,970
What could be more urgent than lex luthor
developing an army of superfreaks?

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,070
I'm some kind of meteor freak, aren't I?

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,470
We don't know that.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,370
There were complications.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,270
- We lost the baby.
- No.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,470
March 29,1995

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,570
Mom!Mom!

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,870
Mom, mom, I want you to be
the first to read it.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,670
"Long live the loch ness monster."

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,870
Mr. Hedgis said it was my best story yet --

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,470
even better than the one about
the alien abduction.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,670
Something tells me those aren't happy tears.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,270
What's wrong?

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,970
I'm so proud of you...
my little cub reporter.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,470
Chloe, I'm so --I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,870
Wait. For what?

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,570
You didn't do anything.

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,770
It's time,mrs. Sullivan.

30
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,970
Mom, who are those people?
Where are you going?

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,570
Mommy's just going on a little vacation.

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,570
By yourself?

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,070
Don't you worry.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,170
Your daddy's gonna take good care of you.

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,370
But nobody goes on a vacation by themselves.

36
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,370
When are you coming back?

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,570
12 Years Later

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,770
I hope you're calling with good news, doctor.

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,170
well***

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,770
***

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,770
Yeah, well, she wouldn't be the first freak
who refused to show her true colors.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,570
Keep pressing.

43
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,670
i***

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,470
I want answers.

45
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,370
What do you want?

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,070
Thanks, lex.

Smallville
Season 06 Episode 18

50
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,070
Chloe?

51
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,570
Hey, we were supposed to meet
for coffee this morning.

52
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,570
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I guess I must have slept in.

53
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,170
After a run in the mud?

54
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,870
What -- did you forget to wipe your feet?

55
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,270
All I remember is I was doing my dishes
here at the apartment

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,070
and then I'm waking up in bed.

57
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,270
Maybe you're sleepwalking.

58
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,770
Last night, possibly,but this isn't the first
time this has happened.

59
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,470
Two days ago,I was typing on my
computer at the daily planet,

60
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,170
and then, boom, I'm waking up
at home the next morning.

61
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,170
Clark, do you think maybe something's
starting to happen to me,

62
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,670
like in a krypto-freak kind of way?

63
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,170
Hey, don't reporters usually deal in facts,
not jumping to conclusions?

64
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,170
Yeah, I know.

65
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,570
It's just that ever since I found out that
I'm a member of the meteor-infected masses,

66
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,570
I've been seriously and secretly freaking out.

67
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,570
I don't blame you.

68
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,070
You don't have to go through this alone,
all right?

69
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,770
Come on, I'll give you a ride to work.

70
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,770
Okay.

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,570
Lex, what happened?

72
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,870
I was in a little fender bender last night.

73
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,670
Why didn't you wake me?

74
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,570
Lana, you've been dealing with so much lately.

75
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,170
I wanted to let you sleep.

76
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,470
It seems like you're not sleeping much anyway.

77
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,170
I haven't told anyone yet.

78
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,870
Somehow, saying I lost the baby out
loud makes it more real.

79
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,370
I know.

80
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,470
I'm hurting as much as you are.

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,470
The last sonogram,
the baby was perfectly healthy.

82
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,570
Lana, I promise,give it time,
and we'll have a house full of beautiful children.

83
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,570
What if there's something wrong with me?

84
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,970
What if that's why I lost the baby?

85
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,270
You can't do that to yourself.

86
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,770
Dr. Albright told us,1/3 of all pregnancies
miscarry with no rhyme or reason.

87
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,970
I want a complete checkup.

88
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,470
I want every test possible
to find out what went wrong.

89
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,170
Absolutely.

90
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,970
I'll make an appointment immediately.

91
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,770
Now, you get some rest.

92
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,370
Chloe, when you blacked out at the planet,
do you remember what you were working on?

93
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,370
Just a story about tree planting in circle park.

94
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,670
I mean,nothing controversial.

95
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,070
Is that lex's car out there?

96
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,370
Let's go see what's going on.

97
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,770
Chloe, no offense, but I think
lex can get his own aaa.

98
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,770
Something doesn't seem right.
Let's turn around.

99
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,570
Come on.

100
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,470
Looks like the police got here
before lex's cleanup crew could mop up.

101
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,470
That luthorcorp security guard
just grabbed his cellphone.

102
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,570
It's time to perk up those ears.

103
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,570
Jackson, what do you got?

104
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,670
I searched the car and surrounding areas.

105
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,670
The flash drive is gone,mr. Luthor.

106
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,670
Whoever ran you off the road must have taken it.

107
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,070
Okay. Bye.

108
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,570
What is it?

109
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,670
Lex didn't crash by himself.
He had a little help.

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,770
And whoever it is stole his flash drive.

111
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,570
Do we know who racer "x" is?

112
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,670
No, but their vision's only 20/20.

113
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,370
What's that?

114
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,770
What's what?Did you find lex's flash drive?

115
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,170
Did you just --

116
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,870
I found something.

117
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,370
It's a button.

118
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,170
That's my button.

119
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,570
Chloe, either this is some bizarre coincidence,
or you --

120
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,370
I was here last night.

121
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,070
Do the math, clark.

122
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,470
The muddy boots,the missing button.It's me.

123
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,670
I'm the road warrior.

124
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,070
Chloe, before you throw the book at yourself,
there's probably another explanation.

125
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,870
Can you explain this?

126
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,870
Let's face it.

127
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,870
I'm guilty as charged.

128
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,570
Chloe, whatever you did,
you clearly weren't yourself.

129
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,070
CONFIDENTIAL

130
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,170
There's onlyne document on here,
and it's a krypto-freak's case file.

131
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,670
Is there a name?

132
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,870
It just lists an I.D. Number.

133
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,070
With a serious ability.

134
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,670
They're suspected of being able to control
meteor freaks.

135
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,370
Look, whoever this is,
I think they controlled me.

136
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,870
Chloe, of all the people in the world,

137
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,970
why would they choose you
to run lex off the road?

138
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,470
Date of birth --september 20, 1960.

139
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,470
Born in granville, kansas.

140
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,870
Oh, my god, clark.

141
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,870
That's my mom.

142
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,770
I want to see my daughter.

143
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,870
You'll get to see chloe.

144
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,170
We just need to take things slowly.

145
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,570
The drug you've been given is still
in its experimental stage.

146
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,670
We wouldn't want your ability to throw
you back into a catatonic state.

147
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,070
Whatever ability you think I have
is a figment of your imagination.

148
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,270
In your medical file,you claimed
you committed yourself

149
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,070
because you had the power
to control your daughter.

150
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,170
Whenever you touched one of her possessions,

151
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,770
you could make her do whatever you wanted.

152
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,670
I was sick, mentally ill.

153
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,070
Whatever I said was the product
of a delusional mind.

154
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,570
Delusions don't short-circuit your brain.

155
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,870
You can thank your incredible power for that.

156
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,870
And maybe -- maybe it's wishful thinking,

157
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,270
but I'm willing to bet you can use that power
to control others just like her.

158
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,370
Whatever connection I have to chloe
is because I'm her mother.

159
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,570
We have a bond.

160
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,070
You certainly do.

161
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,970
You both h

162
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,670
I have to see chloe.

163
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,770
Of course.

164
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,070
I'm not one to stand in the way
of a mother-daughter reunion.

165
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,270
I just need you to demonstrate
your powers for me.

166
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,570
There's nothing to demonstrate.

167
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,070
I've never been able
to control anyone but chloe.

168
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,570
Well, I suppose there's
a first time for everything.

169
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,170
Chloe, wasn't your mom
catatonic the last time you saw her?

170
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,170
Look, I don't often play late-night bumper cars.

171
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,770
She was obviously controlling me.
The question is why.

172
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,570
We don't know anything for sure yet.

173
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,270
My mom can manipulate krypto-freaks,

174
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,370
and whether we want to admit it or not,
I'm part of that demographic.

175
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,270
Hi.Chloe sullivan.
I'm here to see my mother,moira sullivan.

176
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,270
Did you not understand us the first time?

177
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,870
You were asked never to come back here.

178
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm sorry. There must be some sort of mistake.

179
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,270
She hasn't been here for months.

180
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,070
Your friend created a huge scene yesterday.

181
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,270
We don't want a repeat performance.

182
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,570
Well, there's no matinee scheduled.
I just want to see my mom.

183
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,670
Security's on its way.

184
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,270
I suggest you leave before
they have to escort you out.

185
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,070
My mother is here.

186
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,370
You can't prevent her from seeing her own mom.

187
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,870
Chloe, come here.

188
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,870
Clark, what are you doing?
I'm not gonna let them tell me --

189
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,370
just wait for me outside.Trust me.

190
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,570
Time for a little show-and-tell,mrs. Sullivan.

191
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,070
What do you want from me?

192
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,870
Give her all you got,lowell.

193
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,670
Stop.

194
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,470
Sit down.

195
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,270
I already told him.
I'm here to pick up my mother.

196
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,170
Apparently,per her doctor's orders,
moira sullivan's been transferred.

197
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,670
Without notifying me?

198
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,870
- You'll have to ask her psychiatrist.
- Fine.Where is he?

199
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,370
I'm afraid he's out of town at a conference.

200
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,670
- You're lying.
- You can't go in there.

201
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,170
Security!

202
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,770
I can't believe I did that.

203
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,870
Your mom must have sent you
to the sanitarium for help.

204
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,470
She didn't know she had
already been transferred.

205
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,070
So, she had me steal lex's flash drive
so I could find out where she really was.

206
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,570
Well, either way,
she's sending out an S.O.S.

207
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,770
We got it loud and clear.Let's go talk to lex.

208
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,870
I swear to you, I never knew
I could control anyone else.

209
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,870
Come on.

210
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,470
You're more talented than
you give yourself credit for.

211
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,470
And 

212
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,970
This man is a violent psychopath.

213
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,970
Good for him.
What does that have to do with me?

214
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,270
He escaped from this facility last night.

215
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,370
I need you to send him back here.

216
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,770
I am not going to be used.

217
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,870
Really?

218
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,270
See, I had this notion that seeing your daughter
was a high priority.

219
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,170
But considering you were able to abandon her
when she needed you the most,maybe not.

220
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,970
I know what it's like to lose
my mother, mrs. Sullivan.

221
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,070
You don't get over it.

222
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,670
Bring this man back to me...

223
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,170
and I'll make sure you see your daughter.

224
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,170
This belongs to him.

225
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,370
Find lex luthor.

226
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,470
Then kill him.

227
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,070
- Where's lex luthor?
- Who are you?

228
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,670
Tell me where he is.

229
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,270
You shouldn't have done that.

230
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,570
- Lana?
- Clark,she needs a doctor.

231
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,970
We got to get her to the hospital right away.

232
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,870
What about him?

233
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,370
I can handle him.

234
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,470
Clark, she's pregnant.Go.

235
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,770
Now.

236
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,670
What the hell are you doing?

237
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,770
Believe me,I can pull this trigger a lot faster
than you can flinch.

238
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,870
The last thing I remember,
I was running on the train tracks.

239
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,370
And when you woke up,
your memory was gone.

240
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,170
You know my mother.

241
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,570
Moira sullivan --where is she?

242
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,370
I don't know who you're talking about.

243
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,870
I was kept in this facility
with a bunch of other people with powers.

244
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,370
Where is the facility?

245
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,470
Well, the good news is,
there's no sign of a concussion.

246
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,770
But because of your recent miscarriage,
I would like to run a few tests just to be safe.

247
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,870
- Thank you.
- Okay.

248
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,670
Lana?

249
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,470
I heard what happened.Are you okay?

250
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,470
I guess that depends on your definition.

251
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,970
Is the baby all right?

252
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,270
I lost it a few days after the wedding.

253
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,670
You're the first person I've told.

254
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,070
I'm so sorry.

255
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,770
I feel like I've lost so much...

256
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,070
...that having this baby would change things,but...

257
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,670
now that it's gone...

258
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,970
...this isn't the life that I wanted.

259
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,970
Does this have anything to do
with what happened the day of your wedding?

260
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,070
You told me you weren't gonna marry lex,
and then, all of a sudden,somehow...

261
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,770
something changed your mind.What was it?

262
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,270
It was just wedding-day jitters,that's all.

263
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,470
Lana...

264
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,870
it was more than that.

265
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,070
You don't need to be afraid.Whatever you need --

266
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,570
clark, I need you to stop worrying about me.

267
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,670
It's okay, really.

268
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,270
I'm going to get through this
like I always do.

269
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,270
When my wife ends up in the hospital,
that means you've made a grave mistake.

270
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,670
I didn't mean for anyone else to get hurt.

271
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,470
I just wanted you to suffer.

272
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,870
Well, clearly chloe gets her brazenness
from her mother's side.

273
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,370
But as meddlesome as she can be,
I've actually come to admire her.

274
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,770
That's what makes this so difficult.

275
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,170
You stay away from my daughter.

276
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,470
Oh, it's too late for that.

277
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,370
Clark?

278
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,170
Clark?

279
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,370
Clark?

280
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,970
- Hey. How's lana?
- She's okay.

281
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,470
What'd you find out?

282
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,470
My mom was playing simon says with that guy
at the mansion,which means she's desperate.

283
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,870
He told mewhere I could find her.

284
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,970
Can we trust him?

285
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,670
Well, there is an old, abandoned hospital
on paper mill road,

286
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,670
just like he said,and it's owned by --

287
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,970
luthorcorp.

288
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,270
It's probably another 33.1 franchise.

289
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,470
I was gonna go check it out,

290
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,570
but I thought it would be more wise
for me to come get my army of one.

291
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,870
Chloe, get out of smallville, sweetheart,
as fast as you can.

292
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,970
- Where you going?
- I have to leave.

293
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,870
- Chloe --
- let me go, clark.

294
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,670
I have to leave town.

295
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,970
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

296
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,770
What's going on?

297
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,570
It's your mom trying to control you again.

298
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,570
Oh, my god.

299
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,970
Are you okay?

300
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,870
Yeah, I'm just dizzy.

301
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,270
- Can you get me a glass of water?
- Yeah.

302
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,670
Sorry, clark,but I have no choice.

303
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,770
Please...don't do this.

304
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,770
It's the only way I'll be able
to get out of smallville.

305
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,770
STOP

306
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,570
- I need to get through.
- Sorry, miss.

307
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,170
No.You don't understand.
I need to leave town right now.

308
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm afraid we're gonna have to reroute you.

309
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,870
What are you --

310
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,170
Mom?

311
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,070
Mom!

312
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,170
Chloe.

313
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,470
You're even more beautiful than I remember.

314
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,270
I can't believe you're awake
and you're talking.

315
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,870
I thought I'd never
get to speak to you again.

316
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,270
Honey,you shouldn't be here.

317
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,970
This is all my fault.

318
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,270
No, it's not.

319
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,970
You needed my help.

320
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,770
just like when you were little.

321
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,970
What?

322
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,870
Remember when you were 8
and you hurt your hands?

323
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,170
Yeah, how could I forget?

324
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,370
I had to wear those bandages for weeks.

325
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,570
You know, I've never
played kickball since then.

326
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,270
You didn't hurt your hand playing kickball.

327
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,470
You came home from school,

328
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,570
and your hands were all covered in ink.

329
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,070
So, I told you to go wash your hands,
and instead, you --

330
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,270
you went to play with your computer.

331
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,570
I was so frustrated.

332
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,570
I sent you to go wash your hands

333
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,970
and scrub them till all the ink was gone.

334
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,270
Mom, what are you saying?

335
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,370
I found you in the bathroom.

336
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,870
There was blood everywhere.

337
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,170
You had scrubbed your hands raw.

338
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,570
That's why I left --

339
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,770
to protect you from me.

340
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,670
And now I have to protect you from lex luthor.

341
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,170
This man that brought you here --

342
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,970
he knows you're infected.

343
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,170
You have to get out of here.

344
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,570
No. We have to get out of here.

345
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,170
Mom, you can control people with powers.

346
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,670
Is there anyone in here
whose ability could free us?

347
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,170
I'd love to.

348
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,970
Yes, lunch before the meeting is perfect.

349
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,470
Okay. Bye-bye.

350
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,170
Clark!

351
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,970
Sweetie, wake up!

352
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,270
Clark!

353
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,170
- Mom?
- Oh, baby.

354
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,870
No more experiments.

355
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,770
Keep walking.

356
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,170
Help! I need help in here, please! Help!

357
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,970
My mom -- she's sick.She needs a doctor.

358
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,580
What's wrong?

359
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,270
I don't know,but you have to help her.

360
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,670
Hey! Hey!What the hell?

361
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,470
Mom! Mom!

362
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,370
Protect me and my daughter.Set us free.

363
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,570
Stop!

364
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,570
Hold it right there.

365
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,170
Mom!

366
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,370
Chloe!

367
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,070
Go! Get out of here!

368
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,870
Take her back to the cell.

369
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,570
Chloe, whatever you have to do,get out now.

370
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,570
Lex, get out of my way.

371
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,170
I'm sorry.I can't do that.

372
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,070
Don't let your mother make you
do something you'll later --

373
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,870
Hey!I brought sandwiches.

374
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,170
I don't know which ones you like, mom,
so I bought one of each.

375
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,370
I don't think your mom's hungry.

376
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,270
Have you talked to oliver?

377
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,870
He said that he would set up a safe place
for her to stay in star city.

378
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,470
Mom?

379
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,970
Mom?

380
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,370
I-I wanted to see a blue sky...

381
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,970
one last time.

382
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,970
Well, there will be plenty of blue skies
where you're going, mom.

383
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,070
You're not gonna be locked inside anymore.

384
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,670
Sweetheart...

385
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,870
...I'm slipping back.

386
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,170
The drug that lex used on your mom --
it only lasts 24 hours,

387
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,470
or else she won't stay lucid.

388
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,870
Chloe, she doesn't have much time left.

389
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,370
Well, I'll go talk to lex.
I'll make a deal with him.

390
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,570
No.No deals with that man.

391
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,770
I can't allow it.

392
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,770
Mom, I already lost you once.
I'm not gonna do it again.

393
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,270
If this drug is out there,
I can get it, trust me.

394
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,870
I have some pretty amazing
resources at my disposal.

395
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,270
Being with you again.

396
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,770
...It's the greatest gift
I could have ever been given.

397
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,470
But I'm dangerous, chloe.

398
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,570
No, mom.That's not true.

399
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,270
My ability to control people with powers,

400
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,670
it's like I'm a human weapon.

401
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,170
And I-I can't --I can't allow it.

402
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,670
But, mom, it doesn't have to be like this.

403
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,770
My little cub reporter.

404
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,270
This...

405
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,770
this belongs...

406
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,570
...to you.

407
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,570
No, mom. Please.

408
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,270
Please don't go, mom --

409
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,170
not yet, not again.

410
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,270
I...

411
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,070
...love you...

412
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,770
...chlo-- chloe.

413
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,370
I love you, too, mom.

414
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,270
"Luthorcorp crimesagainst humanity."

415
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,070
That's catchy.

416
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,070
Too bad it'll never make it to print.

417
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,570
Lex, I'm tired of playing hardball
or softball or any ball,for that matter.

418
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,470
Game's over.

419
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,670
I'll tell you, your audacity's impressive, chloe,

420
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,370
especially given your recent late-night activities.

421
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,970
What?

422
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,770
You don't remember?

423
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,270
You ran my car off the road a few nights ago.

424
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,570
Investigators have boot prints,

425
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,870
hair fibers,samples of the mud found
in your apartment.

426
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,770
***

427
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,870
How many years do you get for
aggravated assault -- 10, 20?

428
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,570
For what you've done, they're
gonna throw away the key.

429
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,670
What I've done?

430
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,970
You don't have a shred of proof
about any of this,and you never will.

431
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,070
But rest assured,

432
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,370
the evidence I have against
you is locked away safe and secure.

433
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,170
Make that article disappear,

434
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,870
Deal?

435
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,670
My mother sacrificed everything
to protect the world from scum like you.

436
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,770
And if taking you down means spending some
quality time behind bars,sign me up.

437
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,570
You know, I thought you might say that.

438
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,270
That's why there's a plan "b"
firmly in place...

439
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,070
...a plan that makes prison
look like a picnic.

440
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,470
SMALLVILLE MEDICAL CENTER

441
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,070
Well, now, mrs. Luthor.

442
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,670
I did an extensive battery of tests,

443
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,270
and actually,I found something quite troubling.

444
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,470
What is it?What's wrong?

445
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,670
Did you give yourself injections,
or did you take pills?

446
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,370
I took prenatal vitamins.That's it.

447
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,670
Vitamins don't cause fatigue,nausea,

448
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,870
and the suspension of your menstrual cycle.

449
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,670
Synthetic hormones do.

450
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,470
Synthetic hormones?What do you mean?

451
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,570
That's what we found in your bloodstream.

452
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,070
That's what you took to fake a pregnancy

453
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,970
and to force a marriage to a billionaire.

454
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,770
When you stopped taking them,

455
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,470
it appeared as if you'd simply
miscarried, didn't it?

456
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,470
I don't understand.

457
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,670
I saw the sonograms.I saw my baby.

458
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,370
I don't know whose baby you saw,
but I can assure you,it wasn't yours.

459
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,870
I was never pregnant.

460
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

461
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,470
You okay?

462
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,370
How you doing?

463
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,670
it's just so unfair.

464
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,870
I mean, she's never gonna be able to read
any of the articles I've written,

465
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,770
you know, or meet jimmy.

466
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,870
She's never gonna get to know
the person that I've become.

467
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,670
It's a good thing I told her.

468
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,170
You did?

469
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,370
After I brought your mom to oliver's apartment,

470
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,170
I gave her the complete chloe sullivan bio.

471
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,770
She was so proud.

472
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,470
That's something
no one can ever take away.

473
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,370
Lex came to talk to me, clark.

474
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,470
Basically, he said
it's either kill or be killed.

475
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,270
The story or me.

476
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,070
He threatened you?

477
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,470
I'm in his cross hairs.

478
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,770
Yeah, well,now he's in mine.

479
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,570
Think about lana.

480
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,170
We can't do anything to him
until we know she's safe.

481
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,970
You're right.

482
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,270
He'd feed her to the lions
just to spite me.

483
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,570
But it's inevitable.

484
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,470
The war's about to begin.

488
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,070
then dana reeve would be his lois lane.

489
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,270
Dana symbolized hope to the millions
living with paralysis

490
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,770
through her tireless work on behalf
of the caregiver community.

491
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,070
The christopher and dana reeve foundation remains
committed to dana's work but needs your help.

492
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,970
Be a superhero to those with paralysis

engraved with the superman logo
and the foundation's slogan,"go forward."

495
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,070
