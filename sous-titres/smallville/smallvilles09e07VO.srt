1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,446
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:01,547 --> 00:00:03,724
I do remember seeing a
whole new side of Clark Kent.

3
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,902
I wasn't even wearing red or blue.

4
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:09,200
All you have to do is ask yourself
what do you want?

5
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:11,333
Who are you?!

6
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:14,139
I am Jor-El, your father.

7
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:19,296
These symbols appeared all over the
world the same night that Zod arrived.

8
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:20,929
You might recognize this one.

9
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:24,513
The last thing we remember is
our blood being taken in Kandor.

10
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:26,781
How did we get here?

11
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:28,781
She's Kandorian.

12
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:30,594
I thought Kandor exploded
with the rest of Krypton.

13
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,052
Jor-El said if she's here,
there may be others.

14
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:34,010
We better start looking.

15
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:35,250
Jor-El betrayed us.

16
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,449
- He survived.
- He didn't just survive.

17
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:39,730
He has power from the yellow sun.

18
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:41,739
And yet we have none?

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,744
Make her tell you where
this blur is. Or kill her.

20
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,996
You're Kandorian?

21
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:51,406
There's nothing more important
than finding the Kandorians.

22
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:12,826
KANDORIAN BORDER 20 YEARS
BEFORE THE DESTRUCTION OF KRYPTON

23
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:25,016
Relax, it's just a pinprick.

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,746
I never liked needles.

25
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,954
Small price to pay for immortality.

26
00:01:39,603 --> 00:01:40,996
Medic.

27
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:44,158
There's a civil war raging,
and you're wasting time.

28
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:47,314
The forces of Black Zero
are closing in on Kandor,

29
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,078
and I can assure you,
they'll wait for no one.

30
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:52,205
You're the last of your battalion
whose blood I need, Major Zod.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,026
Get on with it.

32
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,523
There's a war to be won, and we want
to get back to our families.

33
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:00,925
Right, soldiers?!

34
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,427
- For the realm of Kandor!
- For the realm of Kandor!

35
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:08,120
Jor-El.

36
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm guessing you're not here
to cheer on the troops.

37
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,702
Call it a mission of redemption.

38
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:15,705
I'll need all those blood samples.
I can't let this project go on.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,347
My orders come from the
Ruling Council itself.

40
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:19,678
You have no authority here.

41
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:24,724
Medic, when the most renowned scientist
in Krypton tells you to stop, then you stop.

42
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,229
Thank you.

43
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:32,827
If the Ruling Council wants my blood,
let them find it on the battlefield!

44
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,167
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

45
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:41,084
Let Black Zero feel the bite of your
weapons and the bravery in your hearts!

46
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,299
Soldiers, move out!

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,678
For the realm of Kandor!

48
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,671
Yeah! Stop!

49
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:50,278
For the realm of Kandor!

50
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:52,478
Thank you, Zod.

51
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:55,456
You realize the council won't like this.
Do you know what you're doing?

52
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,589
Well, The Council can do what it will,

53
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:01,539
but I'll not let my life's work
be used to commit an atrocity.

54
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:16,973
Kandor.

55
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,412
My wife...

56
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,147
my son.

57
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,954
Zod, there's nothing you can do!

58
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,646
Kandor is gone!

59
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,902
None of you recall that tragic day...

60
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:44,961
because the moment your blood was taken
was the last moment you remember of Kandor.

61
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:47,216
But I can assure you...

62
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:49,666
I have not forgotten.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,231
Each one of you,

64
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,721
the last sons and daughters of Krypton,

65
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,231
are all that is left
from our beloved homeland.

66
00:03:57,408 --> 00:04:02,721
And I will not allow for
your birthright to be denied.

67
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,486
And Jor-El...

68
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:11,588
he came with us in the orb, and
somehow, he stole our powers from us.

69
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,914
And yet he flaunts them...

70
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,182
all over this city...

71
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,013
leaving his mark for us to see.

72
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,308
When we find this traitor...

73
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,974
we will force him to give
us what's rightfully ours.

74
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:37,614
We will be Gods on this planet,
and Kandor will rise again!

75
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:43,905
"Somebody save me"

76
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:49,050
"Let your warm hands break right through me"

77
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:53,905
"Somebody save me"

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,422
"I don't care how you do it"

79
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:04,359
"Just save me, save me"

80
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,062
"Come on"

81
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:10,044
"I've been waiting for you"

82
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:20,341
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

83
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:24,362
"Just save me, save me"

84
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,546
"Come on"

85
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:30,819
SMALLVILLE 9x07 "KANDOR"
Subtitles subXpacio

86
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,627
Hey.

87
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:45,799
If you raced here to see me, it must mean the
"I love Lois" show was preempted this week.

88
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,559
Come on, you know I always
speed over when you call.

89
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:55,497
Although, I may be responsible for
your cousin vanishing from prime time.

90
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:59,268
I was wondering why she skipped town
without saying goodbye. What's up?

91
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,854
I, uh...

92
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,190
I kissed her.

93
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:06,065
Oh, yeah, that would
definitely send her packing.

94
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,989
I mean, no offense to you, Clark.

95
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:12,669
It's just Lois' typical response to
intimacy is usually to blow out of town.

96
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,070
I just don't know what happened.
I went over there to talk to her.

97
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,783
The next thing I know,
I couldn't stop myself.

98
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:21,927
Yeah, I'm not surprised Clark. You've had
feelings for Lois since like the 1930s.

99
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:24,067
I was wondering when you
were gonna make your move.

100
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:27,382
Look, just take my word for it,
and give her a little bit of space.

101
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,510
And in the meantime,

102
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:34,639
my LuthorCorp mole dug up some
more information on the Kandorians.

103
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,854
How bad is it?

104
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,892
We were right.

105
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:42,639
Tess Mercer has teams around the globe
trying to bring the ETs home.

106
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:46,377
Her operatives have had their noses deep in
the Turkish desert, sniffing around for weeks.

107
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:49,405
Now, I think that you should wing
out there and take a peek yourself.

108
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,510
Unfortunately, my wings are
still clipped. I'll fly coach.

109
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,135
Uh, no, you won't.

110
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,800
Oliver can get you there first class.

111
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:56,953
I'll do this by myself.

112
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,250
Why, Clark? Come on.

113
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,907
Chloe.

114
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:05,017
Hear you need lift.

115
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:16,995
Your tomb raiders have been
digging in that desert for weeks,

116
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,342
and I still don't have what I want.

117
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,934
The sandstorms haven't
let up since we arrived.

118
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:25,001
Whatever or whoever was here
is either dead or buried.

119
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:29,274
Well, unless you want to end up the same
way, I suggest you get the job done.

120
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,403
Well, hello.

121
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,494
I received your message.

122
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:48,081
And like my super powered Kryptonian
comrade, you have a flair for the dramatic.

123
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,912
I think your deep-cover agent
might have a different opinion.

124
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:56,031
But I'm glad to see that
his untimely death got your attention.

125
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,205
I won't be toyed with.

126
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,949
A man named Jor-El...

127
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,883
he came with us in the orb.

128
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:10,215
He took all of our powers for himself.

129
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,885
You know him as the Blur.

130
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,963
Now, you...
you help me find him...

131
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:20,827
I'll give you what you've always wanted.

132
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,897
Now, you opened that orb,

133
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,100
the bottled-up hopes
and dreams of Kandor,

134
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:31,103
to work with us, and now you can...

135
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,106
in my side...

136
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,808
as equals.

137
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,712
Together.

138
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,250
Intimately.

139
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:54,794
I've already got a team on it.

140
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:59,264
I'll let you know when we find Jor-El.

141
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:08,707
You know, Clark, if you wanted to bury me in
the desert for going on that date with Lois,

142
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,162
you could've at least
taken me to Nevada.

143
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:12,767
- Oliver, let's not...
- I mean,

144
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:15,380
don't get me wrong,
I'm still gonna put up a fight, but...

145
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,617
we could've hit the strip before
the main event, you know what I mean?

146
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,643
Maybe a little blue man group.

147
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:22,771
Maybe a little carrot top.

148
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,718
You know, what I'm getting you next
year for Christmas is a sense of humor.

149
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:37,069
All right, look, we're at the exact
coordinates Chloe gave us.

150
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,871
I don't see anything for miles but sand.

151
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,209
Maybe we need to look deeper.

152
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:02,707
The Kryptonian symbols
that we saw at Watchtower...

153
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:06,298
they're like high-temperature brands left
when a Kandorian first arrives on Earth.

154
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:09,720
Out here, the temperature
would melt the sand into glass.

155
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,486
Who put your shield out
in the middle of nowhere?

156
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,233
"Jor-El"?

157
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:02,729
My father.

158
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,660
He's here on Earth.

159
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:45,447
Shelby. I came to take my
favorite blonde for a walk.

160
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,556
Who are you?

161
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,715
My name is Jor-El.

162
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,860
Oh, my God.

163
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,053
I... I...

164
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,988
You made it to Smallville.

165
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:02,591
Clark found your markings in the desert.

166
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,794
You're Clark's father.

167
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:09,421
You are mistaken.
I have no child.

168
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,512
His Kryptonian name is Kal-El.

169
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,444
So, this is my son.

170
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,615
And what's he doing here on Earth?

171
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,550
Well, you sent him here as a baby.

172
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:31,686
It was the only way you could save him.

173
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,447
Save him?

174
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,362
Look, I hate to be the
bearer of bad news, but...

175
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:44,328
Krypton was destroyed.

176
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,522
My wife...

177
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:54,550
Lara.

178
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,978
Clark's mother, she's...

179
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:59,313
not here with you?

180
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:02,646
She wasn't part of the experiment.

181
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,809
I'm sorry. I... I didn't know.

182
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:14,095
Look, we've been searching for all
the others who have come here with you.

183
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,231
They will be difficult to find.

184
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:21,699
They're very well trained. A battalion
of soldiers led by a great commander...

185
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:25,006
and the best friend I ever had, Zod.

186
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,175
Jor-El.

187
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:31,646
You stand before the Ruling
Council charged with treason.

188
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:37,425
The technology I created was intended to
heal those afflicted by wars and disease,

189
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:41,087
not to resurrect the
dead through cloning.

190
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:44,725
The orb will ensure that
Krypton's strongest will endure...

191
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,528
if our planet is ever destroyed.

192
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:49,860
But if we send the orb
to Earth and it is opened,

193
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:55,240
the clones inside will develop extraordinary
abilities under their yellow sun.

194
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:58,353
The humans will be
powerless against them.

195
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:03,415
We cannot doom another planet's
future to preserve our past.

196
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:07,582
Perhaps you should've had
more faith in your own race.

197
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:09,945
You leave us no choice.

198
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:13,771
The punishment for treason is death.

199
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,956
Council.

200
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,496
Major Zod.

201
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:25,789
Your presence is an honor,
but this is a closed trial.

202
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:28,214
Well, I demand to be heard.

203
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:37,230
I may have driven Black Zero back
into the ice, decimating his ranks,

204
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:42,102
but my accomplishments pale
in comparison to this man's.

205
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,720
Jor-El...

206
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:48,909
is the truest hero I have ever known.

207
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:53,127
He has dedicated his
life's work not to death...

208
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,429
or war...

209
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:58,032
but to creation.

210
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,147
When Kandor fell,

211
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:05,869
many of our brightest and most
promising citizens perished...

212
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,102
in an instant.

213
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,979
Krypton lost mothers...

214
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,733
fathers...

215
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:15,784
daughters...

216
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,691
sons.

217
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,741
What good will come...

218
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:26,456
if you extinguish another
life unnecessarily?

219
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:29,770
I implore you all...

220
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,672
let Jor-El live.

221
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,513
Your passion is noted, Major.

222
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,590
It is agreed.

223
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:57,926
Jor-El...

224
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,103
The Council will spare your life.

225
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:05,062
But you are ordered to complete the orb.

226
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:09,006
You must include Major Zod's DNA...

227
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,840
and your own.

228
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:16,111
If that fateful day of judgment
ever comes to Krypton...

229
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,546
our survivors on Earth...

230
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,238
will be led by two of our
planet's greatest heroes.

231
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,629
I, Zod, am in your debt.

232
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:37,866
Never forget that, my friend.

233
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:45,988
If it wasn't for Zod, I wouldn't be
here, and neither would my son.

234
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,411
I'm afraid you've only
lived half the story.

235
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:52,940
There's a few more chapters on Zod
that you still need to hear.

236
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:55,270
And I'm gonna warn you...

237
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,585
it doesn't have a happy ending.

238
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:07,528
I can't believe my father's been on Earth
this whole time and Jor-El didn't tell me.

239
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:08,964
So... so when you say "Jor-El,"

240
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,466
are we talking about the dude
in your ice-crystal-palace thing?

241
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,036
He must have known what it would
mean to me to meet my real father...

242
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,978
to speak to an actual person
and not just some voice in the Arctic.

243
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:23,457
But, again, Jor-El kept me in the dark.

244
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,514
Well, I'm sure there's a reason
he didn't tell you the truth.

245
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:28,850
He's probably afraid...

246
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,970
that in person, he's worse
than I thought he was.

247
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:37,425
You really mean that, or
is that the anger talking?

248
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,927
There's...

249
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,762
there's a part of me that
doesn't want to meet him at all.

250
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,406
Look, man, I...

251
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,352
I can't imagine what it's
like to live your life.

252
00:17:56,711 --> 00:18:00,224
But there is one thing I can relate to,
and that's growing up without parents.

253
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:06,669
Clark, we don't get a second
chance to be with them.

254
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,975
And I'll tell you what...

255
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:17,031
I'd go to hell and back just to wrap my
arms around my old man one more time.

256
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:39,054
Clark must be flying through some turbulence
because I can't get a call in to him.

257
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:42,590
But I'm sure that he'll touch down soon,
and then you'll finally...

258
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:45,013
get to meet your son.

259
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:49,182
I'm saddened that he spent his
entire youth away from his people...

260
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,469
and grew up alone.

261
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:55,570
Well, maybe he wasn't around other
Kryptonians, but he certainly wasn't alone.

262
00:18:55,804 --> 00:19:00,208
Trust me, the Kents are the greatest
parents you could've ever hoped for...

263
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,875
on Earth.

264
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,312
I would've expected as much.

265
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:07,648
My father sent me
here when I was younger...

266
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:10,268
as a... a rite of passage.

267
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:12,854
Like a walkabout?

268
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:16,992
I met a man called Hiram Kent.

269
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:20,728
I felt so much love in his house.

270
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:24,365
And perhaps that's
why I sent Kal-El here.

271
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,801
But if you didn't know
that your son even existed,

272
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,238
why did you come to Smallville today?

273
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:34,074
I have many very fond memories here.

274
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:37,226
I wanted to see the place again.

275
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,770
Well, your instincts
about the Kents paid off.

276
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,620
Clark is the most amazing
person I've ever met.

277
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:49,290
And your guidance helped
make him into the man he is.

278
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:52,493
I worry that he isn't the
only one I've influenced.

279
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:57,620
Perhaps I played my part in
making Zod the man he became.

280
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:59,833
Look, whatever you did to him,

281
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:04,403
Zod is the only person responsible
for choosing to become a monster.

282
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,555
Sorry about the accommodations.

283
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,888
Not exactly five star, is it?

284
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:38,685
- Who are you?
- A friend.

285
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,403
We both know that's not true.

286
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:43,196
Look, I don't expect you to believe me.

287
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,800
But I had to take drastic measures
to protect you and Kal-El.

288
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:52,087
How can you protect anyone
when your only concern is yourself?

289
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:59,023
Well, your Kryptonian instincts must be on
the fritz because I'm not the enemy here.

290
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:04,650
Major Zod has been turning
this planet upside down...

291
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,085
looking for a man who
we call "The Blur."

292
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,903
Now, I let him believe that
you have all the powers.

293
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,797
Zod doesn't even know
that Kal-El exists.

294
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,830
So your son is safe...

295
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:19,852
for now.

296
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,896
Why are you involved in our affairs?

297
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:24,937
Because I see.

298
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:27,679
I see what mankind is
doing to this planet.

299
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:30,743
The earth is doomed.

300
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:33,512
And your race is the
only answer to saving it.

301
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,618
That's why I released
you all from that orb.

302
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:41,487
You shouldn't have done that!

303
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:45,818
We are abominations that
should never have been created.

304
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:49,399
If the Kandorians get their powers,

305
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:52,269
then what you've done
will not save this planet.

306
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,833
It may, in fact, destroy it.

307
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:57,336
Not if they turn out like your son.

308
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:01,369
You are mistaken to think that
we are so different from humans.

309
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:06,272
Our sacred book of Rau
teaches that where there is light...

310
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:07,987
there is darkness.

311
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:11,921
Which is why I want you
to help me protect Kal-El.

312
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:15,708
If not, Zod will find out about him.

313
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:19,733
And he may very well kill my son.

314
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:24,396
For Zod is a foe not to be taken lightly...

315
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,824
with or without his powers.

316
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:32,305
If you want to save your son...

317
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:35,575
you have to make a sacrifice.

318
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:40,863
You must convince the
Kandorians that you are The Blur.

319
00:22:53,893 --> 00:22:56,697
Chloe. Hey, are you okay? Wake up!

320
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,398
- Chloe, are you all right?!
- I'm fine.

321
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,090
I'm fine.

322
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,997
What happened?
Tell me who did this to you!

323
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,782
- Chloe?
- Jor-El.

324
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,768
M... my father's here?

325
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:16,715
Chloe, he... he came all the way to
the farm, but he didn't stay to see me?

326
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,587
Before he knocked me out, it seemed as
though he had some unfinished business...

327
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:23,616
with someone else.

328
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:25,639
I don't understand.

329
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,759
Who else does he know in Smallville?

330
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:29,813
Clark...

331
00:23:29,848 --> 00:23:33,294
Jor-El isn't the only one who came in
for the Kryptonian reunion.

332
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,235
So did Zod.

333
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:47,680
I see my crack security
team is on the job.

334
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:49,582
Oh.

335
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,250
Why won't they let me in?

336
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:54,486
We are partners now, after all.

337
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:58,724
I just came to get a progress
report on our search for Jor-El.

338
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:03,128
Let's just say that the, um...

339
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:05,464
the noose is getting tighter.

340
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,472
This calls for a celebration.

341
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,566
Looks like you've
already been celebrating.

342
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:25,250
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

343
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:29,522
This is my favorite discovery
on your little planet.

344
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:33,233
"The wine cup...

345
00:24:33,668 --> 00:24:36,665
is the little silver well where truth...

346
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,357
if truth there be, doth dwell."

347
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:43,423
See, now I'm impressed.

348
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,344
You've read your Shakespeare.

349
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:48,215
He's amusing, but...

350
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:52,205
I find the pleasure I get
from wine much more satisfying.

351
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,911
Every sip...

352
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,283
reveals a new riddle...

353
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,872
a new truth.

354
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:05,390
Just like you, Tess.

355
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:09,728
Every time we're together,
I discover something new.

356
00:25:12,732 --> 00:25:16,026
And I can't wait to see
what my next sip reveals.

357
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:20,556
The bitter truth that I'm not interested.

358
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:24,650
We're keeping this partnership
strictly professional.

359
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:29,021
The lady doth protest too much.

360
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:33,701
Whether she doth or not, I can guarantee
she won't be revealing any more...

361
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,155
tonight.

362
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:55,570
But not to worry.

363
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:58,076
Because while we were
enjoying our drink,

364
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,879
I had my people grab something
much more valuable from your cellar.

365
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:24,598
When you told me you could
help me find my father,

366
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,138
I didn't know it was
because you wired my house.

367
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,741
Clark, before you burst a
blood vessel, let me explain.

368
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:31,844
I set up those cameras when you left
after your last dance with Doomsday.

369
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:34,012
I wanted to keep an eye on
your place until you came home.

370
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,715
I've been home for weeks.
You didn't tell me anything about them.

371
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,283
Don't look at me, man.

372
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:41,498
Look, Clark, I'm sorry, okay?

373
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,956
But I think the cameras may
have actually recorded something...

374
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,091
that might lead us to your father.

375
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,565
Jor-El didn't give me the Kryptonian
sleeper hold to get away from me.

376
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:07,408
He sensed danger.
He was trying to save you.

377
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:19,024
There's only one person who would send
operatives to kidnap him, and it's not Zod.

378
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,461
Clark. I know how you feel, okay?

379
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:25,601
But going off to confront Tess all
eyes ablazing is not a good idea.

380
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:28,300
You're gonna do something
you'll regret, you understand?

381
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:30,368
Why don't you just let me talk to her?

382
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:32,838
Oliver's right, Clark.
You're not in any place where...

383
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:01,185
Hello, old friend.

384
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:09,595
I've seen what you've done
for the humans in Metropolis.

385
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:12,555
It's time you did something
for your own people.

386
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,539
You give us our powers.

387
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,444
Considering what happened
the last time we met...

388
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:22,821
I think it's the least you can do.

389
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:04,710
Kneel.

390
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,743
The council's demands have been met.

391
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:09,212
The orb is ready.

392
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,749
And so are these... the
stones of knowledge.

393
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:16,372
The teachings of the 28 galaxies
will be available to...

394
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:20,022
our people, if ever they are resurrected.

395
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:24,760
All that is left is for you
and I to include our DNA.

396
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:34,455
Which is why you will understand
why I need you to do this for me.

397
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,449
My wife gave me this before
I went off to battle...

398
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:51,020
so I could always keep my most
precious treasure close to my heart.

399
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:55,258
It's all I have left of my son.

400
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,149
Be careful, Zod.

401
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:59,155
They will see you.

402
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:11,541
My friend...

403
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,549
I beg of you...

404
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:25,341
use these fragile cells to
bring my little boy back...

405
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,135
so I can hold him in my arms again.

406
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:33,529
But it is not an exact science.

407
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:36,699
There can be complications, mutations.

408
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,936
No, no, no, no. D... don't
give me excuses. This is my son.

409
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:46,329
You could bring him back to me.

410
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:49,608
But we cannot change the past.

411
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:53,763
After everything I've done for you...

412
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,185
how dare you deny me this request?

413
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,487
We do not have the right.

414
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,823
Think of how you'd feel if you had a son!

415
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,864
Please.

416
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,868
I'm truly sorry.

417
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:40,568
You are as dead to me as my son.

418
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,137
Defend yourself!

419
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:52,714
I have no powers.

420
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,415
I used the blue Kryptonite
to take them away,

421
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,951
the same way I corrupted the orb so none
of you could rule this planet as Gods.

422
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,686
But you did have it.

423
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,142
You came with us in the orb,

424
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:05,956
yet you harnessed the powers
of the yellow sun for yourself.

425
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:06,912
How?!

426
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:09,153
I shall never tell you.

427
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,198
You owe this to us!

428
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,475
You owe this to me.

429
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:31,209
Krypton is gone because you destroyed it.

430
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:34,492
That's impossible.

431
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:35,709
You're lying.

432
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,812
Here on this planet,
when we emerged from the orb,

433
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:41,635
we were shadows of our former selves.

434
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,906
But those we were created
from stayed behind on Krypton...

435
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:49,550
and had full lives, spouses, children.

436
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:51,801
Many years later,

437
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:55,986
you decided to lead a military
coup to take over Krypton.

438
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:59,642
But on the eve of your defeat,
instead of surrendering,

439
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,901
you chose to raze our planet.

440
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:03,212
How would you know that?

441
00:33:03,646 --> 00:33:05,248
Because it is the truth.

442
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,527
Now we've been given a second chance...

443
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:11,439
to have lives here on Earth,
to live among the humans,

444
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,293
to be different...

445
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:15,140
To be better than we were before.

446
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,765
This is the same selfish morality that
kept me from ever seeing my son again.

447
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:23,882
Perhaps you are right.

448
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:29,422
Perhaps if I'd given you what you wanted,
you never would've betrayed Krypton.

449
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:38,553
Like you betrayed me?

450
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:42,119
I feel your pain now more than ever.

451
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:53,180
How could you?

452
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:57,311
How could you fathom my pain...

453
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,570
if you've never had a child?

454
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:08,914
You do understand.

455
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,428
That look in your eye...

456
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:16,285
I've seen that before in the mirror...

457
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,491
when I prayed that you would
bring my son back to me.

458
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:25,928
You said... you said after we were
put in the orb, our lives went on.

459
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,297
We had families, spouses...

460
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:31,092
Children.

461
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,399
You're hiding something
with selfless conviction.

462
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:36,026
The shields...

463
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,565
You didn't put them in Metropolis, did you?

464
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,537
You're protecting someone.

465
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:45,214
Somebody that did not come with us.

466
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:48,651
The same person that told you
of Krypton's destruction.

467
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:52,882
- Someone from the house of El.
- No.

468
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:59,400
Somebody you'd give your life for.

469
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:16,679
- Release Jor-El.
- Major, I don't understand.

470
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,348
He will lead us to the one
that will give us our powers...

471
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,716
His son.

472
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:31,126
Clark.

473
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,529
Just when I thought
you'd flown off my radar.

474
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:35,272
Where is he?

475
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:39,492
I've already checked every LuthorCorp
facility, the Daily Planet, and this house.

476
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:41,753
I found no one.
Where are you hiding him?

477
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:45,602
I'm gonna need a little bit
more information, like a name.

478
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:48,711
You know who I'm talking about.
His name's Jor-El!

479
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:51,510
I'm sorry. I can see how upset you are.

480
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:53,549
But I don't know who you're talking about.

481
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,581
You're lying.

482
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,921
You have operatives all over
the world tracking aliens.

483
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,429
You know everything.

484
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:02,410
The only alien I know is
standing right in front of me.

485
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:05,980
Where's my father?

486
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,937
I want to see him now!

487
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:09,500
Clark...

488
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,524
I have waited so long...

489
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:14,567
for you to admit your
true Kryptonian heritage.

490
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:18,574
I always hoped you'd tell
me because you trusted me.

491
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:21,953
But I'll take what I can get.

492
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,518
Where is he?

493
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:26,945
Tell me!

494
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,734
Zod has him.

495
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:31,227
Don't worry, Clark.

496
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:37,401
I had a tracking device put on Jor-El's
clothes so we could locate him.

497
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,723
You wanted Zod to find him...

498
00:36:40,558 --> 00:36:42,813
so you could find the others.

499
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,099
You used my father as bait!

500
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,901
Clark, I was just trying to protect you.

501
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,240
Find him!

502
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,698
He's at your farm.

503
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:18,701
Jor-El?

504
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,712
Who did this to you?

505
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,791
I don't know.

506
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:34,037
Okay, hold on.

507
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,938
I'll get you help.

508
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:39,813
Kal-El...

509
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:43,582
I'm so proud of you... so proud.

510
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:47,439
Please...

511
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:49,221
don't go.

512
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,104
I can save you.

513
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,659
Save...

514
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,860
Zod.

515
00:37:58,408 --> 00:37:59,508
No.

516
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:01,443
No!

517
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,587
When my dad died,
I remembered thinking at least...

518
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,876
I'd have the memories of being
with him here on the farm.

519
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:26,635
With Jor-El being gone,
all I'm left with is...

520
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,747
Empty feeling inside.

521
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,732
See, I had so many questions
I wanted to ask him.

522
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:45,164
Figure out who he really was.

523
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:48,349
It seems to me like you're
a chip off the old block.

524
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:52,304
After seeing how he saved our spunky
sidekick, I'd say you're both heroes.

525
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,511
I'll never be able to live up
to everything he accomplished.

526
00:38:58,645 --> 00:39:00,465
I don't know.

527
00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:05,321
I don't think anyone wears that
super shield quite like you.

528
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,703
Still, he sacrificed so much
sending me to this planet.

529
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,837
Then he sacrificed himself
again to protect my secret.

530
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:20,334
Of course he did, Clark.

531
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:22,767
You're his son.

532
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:25,060
He didn't have to die.

533
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:37,172
I asked Chloe to scan
all the footage she has from the farm.

534
00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:40,404
She's gonna use the Watchtower
to figure out what really happened.

535
00:39:43,156 --> 00:39:45,257
Look...

536
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:49,829
I know you and I haven't always
seen eye to eye lately, but...

537
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:56,304
I got your back... always.

538
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,473
Good.

539
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,394
'Cause I'm gonna need your help
to figure out who killed my father...

540
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:07,280
and bring him to justice.

541
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:19,687
Jor-El, you lied to me.

542
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,315
It looks like you had another
reason for coming to Smallville.

543
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,185
I'm sorry.

544
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,526
I can't give you what you want.

545
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,695
I can't save Zod.

546
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,836
You might remember him as a friend.

547
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,668
But I know what he becomes.

548
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:27,277
