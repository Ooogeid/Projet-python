1
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:02,209
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:02,244 --> 00:00:04,076
Everything is about meteor freaks lately.

3
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:06,914
Ok. I thought we agreed we weren't
gonna use that word anymore.

4
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:10,353
Clark, the crystal! You're the
only one that can stop the eclipse.

5
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:14,742
I just need to know that
you love me, no matter what.

6
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:20,245
What do you think is stronger, Clark-
her hatred for me or her affection for you?

7
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:25,155
I mean, of all the people in the world,
you had to end up with your editor.

8
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,113
Trust me. It's better the world
knows you as Grant Gabriel.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,511
My name is Julian Luthor.

10
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:31,926
Kara!

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,412
Kara!

12
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:35,756
There's no way to trace
where the alloy disappeared to.

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,940
I suggest we find it.

14
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:41,509
You have chosen to defy me
yet again, Kal-El.

15
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:45,205
This defiance cannot go
without consequence.

16
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,685
And now... an all-new "Smallville."

17
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:13,112
Anyway, what was saying?

18
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,529
So you did bring me in here to work?

19
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,522
Right - work.

20
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:22,661
You need to stop blabbering to the world
that I am writing the Lex Luthor exposé.

21
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,919
It's the biggest story
of the year.

22
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:29,133
I- I just thought we agreed that
our dating life would be off-the-record.

23
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,027
We're hiding in a storage closet.

24
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,039
What more do you want from me?

25
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:38,845
It didn't cross your mind that
inquiring minds might wonder why a...

26
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:42,530
rooky basement dweller
is writing this story?

27
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:45,852
It has nothing to do with us.

28
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:51,504
Well, if I'm gonna keep our -
this a secret,

29
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,697
I need to make sure that the only
part of my body earning me stories...

30
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,559
is my reporter's nose.

31
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,102
I didn't give you the story.

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,295
Lex requested you.

33
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:03,758
What?

34
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:07,418
Clark? Hi.
It's your daily freak-out call.

35
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:10,245
Seriously two weeks with no callback.
What's going on?

36
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:13,201
Lana said you guys smooth everything out
before you went to the fortress,

37
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,868
I'm getting tired of lying
about you being in Minnesota.

38
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,729
I can get really angry
or really scared.

39
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,455
Hey, was that Clark?

40
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:24,093
He said he would fix our
satellite dish two weeks ago.

41
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,629
It still looks like Jack Frost
puked all over the TV.

42
00:02:26,823 --> 00:02:29,015
He's still in Minnesota,
spending the holidays with Kara.

43
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:32,419
Well, when he returns
from those 10,000 frozen lakes,

44
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,831
I would rely like my "daily show" back.

45
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:39,275
In the meantime, happy holidays.

46
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:42,324
I had the printshop compile
all my research on LuthorCorp,

47
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,024
so there you go - 101 ways
to make Lex Luthor squirm.

48
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,434
Thanks, cuz. You're actually
my first legitimate source.

49
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:53,768
Thank me for convincing you
to break it off with Grant.

50
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,311
Now no one can say you didn't land
this one fair and square.

51
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,132
Did anyone lose their phone?

52
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:19,175
Hello?

53
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,215
You've been ignoring me.

54
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,994
Uh, you got the wrong person
here. It's not my phone.

55
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,260
I know. But it's not easy
getting your attention, Lane.

56
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,531
You erased my e-mails.
You tossed my letters.

57
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,249
I'm trying to help you
bring down Lex Luthor.

58
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:37,612
Hey, I appreciate that, but when
it comes to LuthorCorp conspiracies,

59
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,999
a lot gets tossed in the "crazy" bin.

60
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,379
See if this gets me
to the top of the pile, Lane -

61
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,569
There's a bomb on your cousin.

62
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,580
If you try to get help,

63
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:54,406
if you so much as whisper
a single word to anyone,

64
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:56,231
Chloe dies.

65
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,162
Do I have your attention now?

66
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:09,127
"Somebody save me"

67
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,552
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

68
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:18,511
"Somebody save me"

69
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:24,138
"I don't care how you do it"

70
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,005
"Just save me, save me"

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,824
"Come on"

72
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:34,475
"I've been waiting for you"

73
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:44,809
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

74
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:48,840
"Just save me, save me"

75
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,983
"Come on"

76

77
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:18,593
When I suggested a dinner meeting, I was
hoping to consume calories, not burn them.

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,805
Well, technically, I should be stringing
popcorn at a suicide slum's nursing home,

79
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,207
but then I wouldn't have the pleasure
of beating you two bouts to one.

80
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:29,995
In that case, I'm afraid you've traded
one business event for another.

81
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,970
I want you to ask someone else
to write your exposé.

82
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:39,278
Lois has a mysterious way of diving for
a penny and coming up with the Holy Grail.

83
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,927
Well, I appreciate your brotherly concern,
but I don't have anything to hide.

84
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:46,681
Well, that's certainly a cavalier approach
to a murder accusation...

85
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,145
and a public divorce.

86
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:53,295
Lois knows what she wants, Lex.
She'll get to you.

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,669
Or, more importantly, get to you.

88
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,656
You know, for someone who claims
to have broken it off with her,

89
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:01,550
you certainly sound concerned
by what she uncovers.

90
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,353
I'm not the one
Lois has a vendetta against.

91
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,889
I thought
you would have learned by now.

92
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:12,248
I always find a way to win in the end.

93
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,613
Slow down, Adrian.

94
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:22,872
I'm not exactly Mozart
on the keyboard.

95
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:27,184
I got everything up to you being
an escaped clone from LuthorCorp.

96
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,320
With a body aging on overdrive.

97
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,180
I'll be dead any day now.

98
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:35,618
Well, you'd think Lex Luthor
would have kinks like that work out.

99
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,391
I know. It sounds crazy,
but you need to believe me.

100
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:42,430
It doesn't matter what I believe.
I am printing this to protect my cousin,

101
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:44,405
and take it from a fellow Lex-hater...

102
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:46,671
The Planet won't print
anything without proof.

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,742
Just write the story.

104
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:52,103
In a couple of hours, every newspaper
in the country will be begging for it.

105
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,541
Come on.

106
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:01,391
DELIVERY FAILED!

107
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:02,711
What?

108
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:16,819
You don't think I covered bases?
Don't try anything cute.

109
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:56,778
Are you nuts?!
What are you doing?!

110
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,784
I saw you staring at me.

111
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,452
Yeah, so? You're a babe.

112
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:02,726
Great. You're a terrorist and a pervert.

113
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,649
Deactivate the bomb!

114
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:06,955
Bomb? W-what bomb?

115
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,163
Very funny.

116
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:16,569
"Office America.
How may I help you?"

117
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,597
Oh, crap.

118
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,755
What the hell's going on?

119
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,846
I am so sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

120
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:28,976
You need some serious help, lady.

121
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,717
I'm getting security.

122
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:33,510
Great.

123
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,586
Pull yourself together, Lois.

124
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,213
Hey, man. I told you I was sorry.

125
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:01,898
I told you to shut your mouth.

126
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:05,811
Now, you're gonna walk out of there and
finish this story like nothing happened.

127
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,734
I'll clean up your mess.

128
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,775
You killed him.

129
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:12,259
And next time, it'll be Chloe.

130
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,335
Lana.

131
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,365
Clark.

132
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,998
Oh, my god. You've had me so worried.

133
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:39,986
Were you in your fortress
this entire time?

134
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:43,253
Time is so different there, I didn't
realize how long I was gone for.

135
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,007
Did you find Kara?

136
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:48,065
There was nothing I could do.

137
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:52,166
I think it's time I accept the fact
that she's gone and move on.

138
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,621
Kind of a tall order these days.

139
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:01,521
Well, I'm back, and you're here.
That's what matters now.

140
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,538
Clark...

141
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,424
as much as I have missed you,

142
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:10,785
I think maybe being apart
was good for us.

143
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,187
I had some time to think,
to evaluate my priorities.

144
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:22,915
I'm dropping my fixation on Lex
and all of his projects.

145
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:27,118
I had some time
to do some thinking myself.

146
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,296
I may know a way for us
to get back on the same page.

147
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,738
I need you to show me
everything you have on Lex.

148
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,288
We'll get him together.

149
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,552
This isn't exactly
hot chocolate on the boardwalk.

150
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,199
What are we doing here?

151
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,167
Look what I drove you to do.

152
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,644
If this is some attempt
at a guilt trip,

153
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,439
I haven't been watching Lex
for weeks.

154
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:01,166
Lana, it's time I face what I did to you.

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,447
What you did?

156
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,713
What I didn't do.

157
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:08,753
Let you open up about
how much Lex hurt you.

158
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:13,966
I wanted to just move on, forget
it ever happened, but you couldn't.

159
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:18,669
You hid your feelings,
and you hid your research.

160
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,918
You must have known I felt
responsible for everything...

161
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,905
Lex did to you while you were with him.

162
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,061
Everything he did to you
while you were protecting me.

163
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,819
Lex is the villain here, not you.

164
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:31,313
I know.
That's what I'm saying.

165
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,156
Lex needs to be put behind bars, Lana.
You were right.

166
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,501
I think you hold the key.

167
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,698
Scion?

168
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,092
Or what's left of it.

169
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:10,911
That vial, I must have destroyed it
when I wrecked Lex's lab.

170
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:15,500
Before you showed up, he was
talking about some alien invasion.

171
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:19,275
Do you think that this
has something to do with it?

172
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,965
Lana, if this is alien technology,
you didn't destroy it.

173
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,425
Lana, what is it?

174
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:32,482
If you really want
to partner with me on this,

175
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:37,108
then I think it's time you see everything
that I found on project scion.

176
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,377
Any outgoing?

177
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,967
Yeah. Right here.

178
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:23,915
Come on, lady.

179
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:29,877
Oh. Thanks.

180
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,362
Hey! So, good news.
Clark is back from the twin city,

181
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:41,873
so I'm just gonna drop off my rewrite
and en head over and, uh, say hello.

182
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:47,050
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. KA-BOOM!

183
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:49,884
Great. Cool.

184
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:53,665
So, I'll, uh...

185
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:56,130
send him your warmest?

186
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,033
I'm sorry. I'm just busy
prepping the interview.

187
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,755
You sure everything's all right?

188
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:05,191
Yeah. Just peachy.
See you later.

189
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,083
If we're taking Lex head-on,
there's no point in sugarcoating it...

190
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,456
I think scion might be
more live than we thought.

191
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:22,145
I take it Lex doesn't know
you found it.

192
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,543
Not so much an "it" as a "her. "

193
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,046
While you were gone,

194
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,992
Casey Brock, a LuthorCorp lab tech
working on scion, was found...

195
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,073
half-conscious in an alley.

196
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:39,440
She was exhibiting random, incoherent
speech patterns and was suffering from...

197
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,905
toxic levels of metal poisoning.

198
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,418
So you had her quarantined.

199
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:44,954
What other choice did I have?

200
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,878
When I heard about
Casey's strange symptoms,

201
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:51,223
I had my contacts at the Isis foundation
have her transferred down here.

202
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:52,574
So, this...

203
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:54,363
this isn't exactly official.

204
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:57,907
It is extreme, but if she had
something to do with scion,

205
00:14:57,914 --> 00:15:01,809
then I couldn't have the other patients
exposed to whatever was in her bloodstream.

206
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,505
What do you mean "was"?

207
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:08,852
Overnight, the metal content in
her body dropped dramatically.

208
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:13,717
My team could find hardly any trace
of zinc, magnesium, or iron.

209
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:18,134
So whatever it was siphoned her body's
natural minerals and moved on.

210
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,574
She's been doing that
since she was admitted.

211
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:29,586
No one understands what she's saying.

212
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:37,035
I'm not surprised.

213
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,579
She's speaking Kryptonian.

214
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,490
Jimmy.

215
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:02,293
You know, I'll just, uh,
grab the next one.

216
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,832
Don't be ridiculous.
There's plenty of room.

217
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:09,731
Yeah, uh... you know, the thing is
is that I'm - I'm going the other way.

218
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:13,761
We're in the basement.
Travel options are kind of limited.

219
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:17,201
Right.

220
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,176
- You going to the Christmas party later?
- Nah.

221
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:43,381
I think I'm gonna pull my Scrooge
card on this one and stay home.

222
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:47,059
I heard Susan from H. R.
is bringing mistletoe tonight.

223
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,875
I know. I'm all about
the amusement factor.

224
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,873
If I remember correctly, there was mistletoe
last year. It... didn't seem to stop you.

225
00:16:57,314 --> 00:17:00,728
Yeah, well, that was different. I mean,
I already had my sights set on...

226
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,740
...you.

227
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,182
Oh, my god.

228
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,679
We're stuck.

229
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:35,554
With a bomb.

230
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:41,069
LUTHORCORP FIRST FUNCTIONING CLONE

231
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:02,126
I got to say - much cuter in person.

232
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,845
Adrian.

233
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,365
Your attention to yourself,

234
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:09,725
and I'll decorate that elevator
with your cousin.

235
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:14,187
Where's my story?

236
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,225
Now, I haven't exactly read
"C-4 for dummies,"...

237
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:27,847
but I'm guessing that if we' babysitting
a bomb, it'd be somewhere in this pile.

238
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,319
- This is, uh...
- Not supposed to be in there.

239
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,909
Jimmy, I seriously doubt
my secret Santa planted a b...

240
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:51,981
Oh, wow.

241
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,408
I have the worst secret Santa ever.

242
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:03,086
It's all in there.

243
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:06,529
"LuthorCorp's first functioning clone."

244
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,074
Something tells me you wouldn't go
this far if it weren't the truth.

245
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:21,309
My body won't hold out much longer.

246
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,950
I'll be dead by Christmas.

247
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,482
Celebrate Christmas, Lane?

248
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:31,447
Yeah.

249
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:36,221
We used to send out the
Christmas portrait every year.

250
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,899
Me in an ugly sweater,

251
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:43,781
mom with her fake smile,
and dad...

252
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,851
missing his football game.

253
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,667
Then you must know how it feels
when one of them is in danger.

254
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:01,422
You'd think.

255
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,258
After I escaped from LuthorCorp,
I went looking for them -

256
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,868
My parents, my Christmas memories...

257
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,896
it's all a fiction some scientist
downloaded into my brain.

258
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:19,715
Yet, I remember them
like they're real.

259
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:25,414
And come tomorrow morning's
early edition,

260
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:27,402
the world will now
what Lex did to you.

261
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:29,238
Now, please, let my cousin go.

262
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:32,894
The deal was - I write the story,
you give me Chloe.

263
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:34,636
Not quite.

264
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,853
You need to force Lex
to confess what he's done.

265
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:43,508
Don't make me remind you
what's at stake.

266
00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:00,185
If you can hear me, we're in the center
elevator at the Daily Planet with a bomb.

267
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,562
Hurry, please, Clark.

268
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,413
Clark!

269
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:07,113
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,225
You waste your one phone call on Clark?

271
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,455
I didn't realize we had so few flares.

272
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,734
Regardless, you called Clark
before you dialed 911.

273
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,746
I mean, what's he gonna do,
dismantle the bomb with his great hair?

274
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,570
Lois snuck me a note,

275
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,513
which mean at she's under surveillance
by whoever's orchestrating this.

276
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,325
Now, how would it look if a swat parade
trampled through the bull pen?

277
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,843
Smile at the nice people.

278
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,045
See? No one suspects a thing.

279
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:47,273
You have your bag?

280
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:52,185
My finger is on the detonator.

281
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:56,420
No confession, your cousin dies.
Try to warn them, your cousin dies.

282
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:00,293
Let's go see the boss.

283
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,355
Everything Caseys been rambling
turns out to be hex code.

284
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,600
Like a pattern of Kryptonian
zeroes and ones.

285
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:08,606
Right.

286
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,713
Chloe once used a computer
program to find a pattern...

287
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:12,939
in Kryptonian symbols
that Lionel was scribbling.

288
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:14,962
Maybe she can translate this one.

289
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:17,857
Not if she's not here.

290
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:28,332
Here she is, right on time.

291
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:32,614
Mr. Luthor, you know Lois Lane.

292
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:35,788
Well, it certainly
has been a while, hasn't it?

293
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:39,357
I haven't seen Ms. Lane since
I caught her breaking into my office.

294
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,769
Yeah, a long time.

295
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:45,628
Shall we?

296
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:47,081
Please.

297
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,436
Uh, big story. Exciting

298
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,115
Uh, Lois, maybe you should
just ask your questions.

299
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,353
Right - questions.

300
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:57,542
Ask him about project Gemini.

301
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,273
Mr. Luthor...

302
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:03,393
perhaps we could start
by discussing project Gemini.

303
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,721
Excuse me?

304
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:09,302
My sources tell me you run
some kind of an ant farm,

305
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:13,286
except instead of ants, it's humans
and instead of a farm, it's a lab.

306
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,439
- Lois!
- Not that you're renowned for your...

307
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,351
eloquence, Lois, but... I have
no idea of what you're talking about.

308
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,438
Human cloning -

309
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,774
The replication of a DNA sequence...

310
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,703
produced from a single
identical ancestor.

311
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:30,747
My mistake.

312
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:33,511
I didn't realize you'd be
pitching me a Hollywood movie.

313
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:36,441
Is this how you run your paper,
Mr. Gabriel?

314
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:39,620
Tell him who's talking to.

315
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,005
Adrian sends his best.

316
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,404
Should that name mean something?

317
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,746
Now reach in your briefcase.

318
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:55,414
Oh, my god!

319
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:03,162
Aim it at Grant
and get the truth.

320
00:24:03,272 --> 00:24:05,188
It's time for the truth, Lex.

321
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,355
Lie again...

322
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,815
Grant Gabriel dies.

323
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,579
Lois, put down the gun.

324
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:19,170
Just answer the question.

325
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,256
Lane, what the hell are you doing?!

326
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,178
Getting the truth.

327
00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:23,894
Lex, there's no time.

328
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,425
Why does Adrian have a memory
for a life that doesn't exist?

329
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:29,617
I don't know who Adrian is.

330
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:31,261
Well, I wrote his story.

331
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:33,124
He grew up outside Philly,

332
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:35,256
played point guard
for Homestead High,

333
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:38,290
got his first job on the obituary beat
at the Liberty times.

334
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,711
That is where he first got
noticed as the editor in Alaska...

335
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,786
first in sports, then in...

336
00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:48,030
What are you doing?!

337
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:51,135
Someone was pulling her strings.

338
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,361
I took her out the equation.

339
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,226
So she wouldn't hear the truth?

340
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:58,075
Those were my memories, Lex.

341
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:00,296
You're the editor of a major newspaper.

342
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,116
That information is everywhere.

343
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:06,195
What about the time my mom got me a red
and green dirt bike for my seventh birthday?

344
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,345
I rode that thing everywhere.

345
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:12,743
- I thought I could pedal until...
- Until the chain wore out.

346
00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:15,649
That's the one.

347
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,357
I saw your picture in the newspaper one
morning and realized we had a lot in common.

348
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,076
- Who the hell are you?
- Lex, let him talk.

349
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,171
Ho do you have my memories?

350
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,409
Because Lex made me.

351
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:33,269
And when I didn't work...

352
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,812
he'd make you.

353
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,199
What he talking about, Lex?

354
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:41,572
Congratulations, Grant.
You are the perfect clone.

355
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:44,082
He's insane.

356
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,528
You're me.

357
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,235
Same DNA.

358
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:52,969
Same backstory.

359
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:55,627
The only difference is
that you worked and I didn't.

360
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,153
Lionel giving me up for adoption...

361
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,645
- My Harvard degree.
- Harvard degree.

362
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,420
- The paper.
- The paper.

363
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,120
It's all lies.

364
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,275
Am I even your brother?

365
00:26:15,422 --> 00:26:16,501
Brother?

366
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,609
Who died when Lex was 12.

367
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:20,882
You created me in a test tube.

368
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:23,579
You kept me like some kind of freak
pet so you could have a brother?

369
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,702
- Is that why you couldn't get rid of me?!
- You're not my brother!

370
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,057
You're a mistake!

371
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:48,378
Oh, my god.

372
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:50,085
Help

373
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:51,835
Help!

374
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,788
Help us!

375
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:01,252
Help us!

376
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:02,542
Help!

377
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:06,332
It's no use. If someone could have
heard us, they would have by now.

378
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:10,459
Jimmy, I don't think
we're gonna make it.

379
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,260
You know, I'm not gonna cart
my baggage through the afterlife.

380
00:27:20,353 --> 00:27:22,407
Jimmy, there's something
I have to share with you.

381
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:25,944
I always imagined this playing out
to a sad Kelly Clarkson song,

382
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,602
not some "jingle bells" muzak.

383
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,395
- Chloe, time is sort of the essence, here.
- Right. Ok. Look,

384
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:34,092
I didn't pull away from our relationship
because there was anything wrong with us.

385
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:38,052
I mean, we were - well,
at least you were perfect.

386
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:40,958
It was just me. I'm different.

387
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,988
I'm a meteor freak.

388
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:53,317
Some feedback would be
awesome right now.

389
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,233
Okay.

390
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,216
If we're going out
with no regrets...

391
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,324
Straight to her voice mail.

392
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:20,563
"CHLOE DON'T REACT. BOMB ON YOU"
Oh, my god.

393
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,403
Clark, look at this.

394
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:52,453
Move it, holy field.

395
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,048
I need to find Chloe.

396
00:29:56,113 --> 00:29:58,463
Security just pulled her
from the elevator.

397
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:02,249
Unfortunately, your puppeteer,
Adrian, managed to escape.

398
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:04,297
What about Grant?

399
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:08,386
He went to find you a medic, but
I see you bounced back just fine.

400
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:12,039
Wish I could say the se thing
about your career.

401
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,093
After the little ditty Adrian inspired,

402
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:17,922
I'm exposing your morbid
science fair to the world.

403
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:20,529
Really?

404
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,808
With what evidence?

405
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,729
The word of some Belle Reeve runaway?

406
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:30,902
Look not that it matters, but you're
no longer writing my exposé.

407
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,527
You'll have to take that up
with my boss.

408
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:40,005
I am your boss.

409
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,027
Merry Christmas, Lois.

410
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:45,864
I just bought the Daily Planet.

411
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:59,526
If you wan to split early I think
today qualifies as on-the-job stress.

412
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:02,093
I was just finishing up.

413
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:04,698
Um, but I'm - 'm glad
you're here, actually.

414
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:08,001
About the kiss in the elevator...

415
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:11,720
I do this thing when I think
the world is ending,

416
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,465
and I- I grab the first guy I see and...

417
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:17,203
sort of end up in a lip-lock.

418
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,402
Yeah. Me too.

419
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:25,572
I mean, girl - not guy, obviously.

420
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:29,099
An obviously, there's Kara.

421
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,390
Yeah.

422
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:36,363
But this wasn't about her.

423
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,288
Chloe, more than goodbye
was said in that elevator.

424
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:49,067
I just - I wish it didn't take
a near-death experience...

425
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:51,471
for you to feel comfortable
telling me the truth.

426
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:53,729
I know.

427
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,906
Trust me, Jimmy,

428
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,692
I've been struggling to tell you
about my meteor infection for so long.

429
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,936
What did I do to make you think
that I wouldn't accept you?

430
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:06,198
Nothing. I mean, I guess
I always knew that you would.

431
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:11,429
The real battle was accepting myself.

432
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,985
Well, I hope this means that you have.

433
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:23,695
So,

434
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:27,386
can I assume that special ability
has something to do with that,

435
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:30,422
supersize brain inside your head?

436
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:31,668
No.

437
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:33,575
My nerd is all-natural.

438
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,263
Oh, my god.

439
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:44,482
Can you fly?

440
00:32:55,382 --> 00:32:57,025
Here, Jimmy.

441
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,046
Just watch.

442
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,135
I didn't...

443
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,911
really think..

444
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:43,755
Where we you in 9th-grade rugby?

445
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:48,278
Believe me, no golden trophy
is worth these side effects.

446
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:50,283
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

447
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,454
Can you just, uh,

448
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,869
promise me that we'll keep this
between me, you, and my Neosporin?

449
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:00,914
I promise.

450
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,964
You're still the same Chloe.

451
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,831
The last of the acquisition documents.
Come midnight, the paper's yours.

452
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:35,711
Give me the names and bios
of everyone on staff.

453
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,900
It's time get rid of our deadwood.

454
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:41,318
Congratulations on the Daily Planet.

455
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:43,611
Wonderful.

456
00:34:44,094 --> 00:34:47,880
One more piece of my life you can
control, starting with my creation.

457
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:51,667
I can't believe you let that lunatic
sneak his ideas into your head.

458
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,065
You're my brother.

459
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:58,292
No, Lex. I'm an experiment.

460
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:02,338
beneath all that arrogance, your
cracks are starting to show.

461
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:05,739
did you really think
you could keep this a secret?

462
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,648
Or you're so desperate to mean something
to someone, it was worth the risk?

463
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,859
You can't punish me
for wanting a family.

464
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,264
How am I supposed to feel,

465
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:21,431
being the product of a man who's
destroyed everything he's ever touched?

466
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,768
No.

467
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,245
You're different Julian.

468
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:28,743
if I didn't love you,
you wouldn't be here.

469
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:32,237
I'm living proof
you've forgotten how to love.

470
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,618
But if you want to play god, you might
want to remember his greatest gift -

471
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:40,244
free will.

472
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:43,739
Let me live my life.

473
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,935
Oh, great. I'm fired, aren't I?

474
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:22,802
Well, luckily, I just finished putting
the bells and whistles on my résumé.

475
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:24,689
I would hire me in a second.

476
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:26,450
Lois, you're not fired.

477
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,403
Lex actually asked that you
specifically remain on the team.

478
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,199
Me?

479
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:34,762
Great.

480
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:37,413
Can't wait to watch him dull
his shredder with my stories.

481
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:41,029
You want to bury the truth,
buy the media.

482
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,219
But the fact that
you showed up on my doorstep...

483
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:48,796
means somebody's ready
to spread good news.

484
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:52,091
Does this house call mean
we're coming out?

485
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,732
Actually, it means
we're breaking up.

486
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:05,885
Oh.

487
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:14,368
Today was just an example
of why it's not a good idea...

488
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:18,152
for us to be together and work
together. It's too complicated.

489
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:23,818
And I didn't even drag you to all
the places I usually ruin a relationship.

490
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:31,831
Well, when you do decide
to take that trip...

491
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:35,291
he's a lucky guy.

492
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,784
Whoever he is, we sure as hell
aren't gonna work together.

493
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:49,733
So, how are we going to liquidate.

494
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,570
you'll take the elevator
and I'll take the stairs?

495
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,925
Don't be ridiculous, Lane.

496
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:00,333
I'll take the stairs.

497
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:34,281
I had to rev my geek into fifth
in order to crack that hex code.

498
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:37,062
Just think of it as a
thank-you for channeling...

499
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,987
your inner Bruce Willis yesterday.

500
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:41,676
I'm sorry it took till the
last second for me to get there.

501
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:44,329
I don't know where I'd be
without you.

502
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:46,614
Thanks.

503
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:48,998
Did I mention that I missed you?

504
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:52,732
So, this pattern, it made sense?

505
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:56,853
Well, to me, not so much,
but to a computer, it's scripture.

506
00:38:56,978 --> 00:39:00,211
The numbers represent an error message
that high-tech systems encounter...

507
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:01,285
when they can't boot up.

508
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:06,101
And's repeating, because the
computer keeps trying to start.

509
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,369
Exactly.

510
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,977
I think the sequence is actually
learning from its mistakes...

511
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:13,625
and getting closer
to successfully loading.

512
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,155
that's not my favorite look.

513
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,200
Chloe, this started as
a metallic fluid inside a vial.

514
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:24,116
It's now evolved into technology
that's willing to kill.

515
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,623
It's the brain-interactive
construct.

516
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:32,689
Clark, you think that
this is Milton Fine?

517
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,736
But you turned off general Zod's PDA...

518
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,352
after he spread that computer
virus across the world.

519
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:41,309
If any part of him was
left behind to regenerate,

520
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,375
then Fine could be out there.

521
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:50,004
Chloe. Hey

522
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:54,106
- I didnt now that you were...
- Just leaving.

523
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,072
You want to stay?
I kind of overloaded on Danishes.

524
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:02,914
No, thanks. Lois is actually
taking me out for breakfast.

525
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:05,938
she's deemed it "national
Chloe Sullivan day" or something.

526
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:07,974
I'll... I'll call you.

527
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,344
What's the occasion?

528
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,360
Your safe return from the fortress.

529
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,488
Christmas ca early this year.

530
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,684
I've missed that smile.

531
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:19,109
Me too.

532
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:21,485
To be honest, Clark,

533
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:24,453
after everything
I shared yesterday, I was...

534
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,100
worried that I'd scare y away.

535
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,651
But I've never felt closer.

536
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:35,042
I realized something
when I was gone.

537
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,203
That feelings, good or bad,
they don't just disappear,

538
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,769
no matter who you are.

539
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,589
Are we still talking about Lex?

540
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:49,869
I'm talking about us.

541
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,287
Yesterday, when I saw you in the barn,

542
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:58,012
it was like I felt in love
with you all over again.

543
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:34,810
