5
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,477
Jimmy,
look at all of this.

6
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,538
O.J.?

7
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:41,662
Actually, i have to bail.
I'm late for a meeting.

8
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,268
Well, you can't start your morning
without the wholesome olsen.

9
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,100
Wholesome olsen?

10
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,499
Egg-White omelet,
multigrain pancakes,

11
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,300
And something that looks like
butter, but somehow isn't.

12
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:56,200
Come on,
you can't reheat this stuff.

13
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
It's never as good
the second time around.

14
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,829
It isn't, is it?

15
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,430
I'm... I'm sorry i was so late
coming home last night.

16
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,892
Look...

17
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm not trying to start
any wildfires here. It's just that...

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,932
You know, i've been trying really hard to put
the spark back in our relationship, and...

19
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,000
And you don't think
i've been trying.

20
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,800
Look, jimmy...

21
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,600
I think it's just gonna take
a little bit of time

22
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,800
To breathe the embers back to life.

23
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,100
Chloe, we could do cartwheel
through a fountain of gasoline

24
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,700
And come out perfectly fine.

25
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,000
Are you not
feeling this anymore?

26
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
It's just that,
after what happened to lana,

27
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,000
I've had to help out
with the isis foundation.

28
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,000
I've been sunk knee-Deep
in the meteor-Infected,

29
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,500
And between contacting
all of lana's clients

30
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:00,000
And moving my stuff
into the office, i just...

31
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:04,100
Look, i'll take you
to lunch today, okay?

32
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

33
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,848
Sure.

34
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,720
Bye.

35
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,757
Bye.

36
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:41,700
What's with all these boxes?

37
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:43,300
Now that i'm house-Sitting isis,

38
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,300
Oliver thought
it would make a perfect bunker

39
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,283
To store all
of his troops' equipment.

40
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:49,900
You know, having a gang of
superheroes is great in theory,

41
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,983
But no one ever considers
the shipping costs.

42
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,800
Were you able to get
the veritas keys away from lex?

43
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,000
I spent all night with lana.

44
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,900
Clark, i know
you want to be with her,

45
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,900
But whatever lex opens
with those keys

46
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,500
Will give him the power
to control you.

47
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,700
The only thing important
right now is lana.

48
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,791
Right, but if lex knows
that you're the traveler,

49
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,167
Game over.

50
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,100
There's no saving lana.
There's no saving the day.

51
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,788
- Hello, apocalypse.
- I don't care about lex!

52
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,000
Clark, lana's still alive.
We're not giving up on her.

53
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,200
Then why haven't
we found brainiac?

54
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,100
If you think that breaking national-Security
laws is my idea of a good time...

55
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry, chloe. I know you care
about lana just as much as i do.

56
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
We're just running
out of ground to cover.

57
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,100
Maybe we need
to look to the sky.

58
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,700
What about a satellite?

59
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,400
Like, nasa caliber.

60
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:51,300
Kara and brainiac...
When they left the daily planet,

61
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:53,600
There might be a satellite
that picked up their trail.

62
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,700
It is possible that the velocity
of their flight

63
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:00,100
Created some sort of ionic
displacement in the outer atmosphere.

64
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
But hacking
into government satellites

65
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:07,100
Is light-Years out of my league.

66
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:09,000
You can do it.

67
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,200
Maybe it's time for me
to step up to the majors.

68
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:16,400
Thanks, chloe.

69
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:19,800
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't our last hope.

70
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:23,500
Okay, while i'm trying to access outer
space with an intel processor,

71
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,300
I think maybe you could contend
with the cosmos

72
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,400
Using the old-Fashioned ways.

73
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,100
Dr. Swann intercepted all of jor-El's
transmissions from krypton.

74
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,700
Now, it's possible he sent
something about brainiac.

75
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:39,300
I think it's time to sweep the dust
off of dr. Swann's journal.

76
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Please... Ladies first.

77
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,900
I knew there were a few real
gentlemen left in this town.

78
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,500
Nice guy, nice hands.

79
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,300
- These?
- Sure,

80
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,200
Strong, agile...

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,700
Perfect for hacking
the nsa mainframe.

82
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,800
Excuse me?

83
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,900
Special agent
vanessa webber,

84
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,900
Department
of domestic security.

85
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,495
I've been watching you.

86
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,800
Do what exactly?

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
A few months ago,

88
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,000
You infiltrated a classified
government firewall.

89
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,255
Starhawk.
Ring any bells?

90
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,200
Took us some time, but we traced
the federal offense to your computer.

91
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Lady, that wasn't me.
It was...

92
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,823
Look, i'm not your james bond. 
I went to a halloween

93
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,782
party once as james bond.
Everyone thought i was the maitre d'.

94
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:51,500
Relax, 007.
You're not our target. She is.

95
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,300
We have reason to believe that

96
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:56,400
Your girlfriend is working
for a terrorist sleeper cell.

97
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:59,199
Look, i know the feds like to throw
the "t" word around willy-Nilly,

98
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
But trust me... Chloe...

99
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,400
She's not dangerous.

100
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:05,000
Never starts as dangerous.

101
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:07,500
Starts as long hours at work,

102
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,600
A few missed dates.

103
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,800
And there's
those mysterious phone calls.

104
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:15,400
She's compromised
government-Run power grids,

105
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:19,300
Cellular towers, dmv records. Why are you
talking to me? Why don't you just ask her?

106
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,514
If she knows that we're onto her,
We'll never know her end game.

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,800
You have the one thing
that we don't...

108
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,500
Her trust.

109
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:31,600
And unless you want to write love
letters from the federal pen,

110
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:35,200
It's up to you to figure out
what it is she's after

111
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,100
And tell us
before she pulls the trigger.

112
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,200
Trust me.

113
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:43,500
You're gonna need this.

114
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:50,200
Chloe sullivan is not
who she says she is.

115
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,050
Hey.
Lunch, right.

116
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,850
Ah, today is so not my day
for remembering to eat.

117
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,250
It's no biggie. You probably just
didn't get the reminder text,

118
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,450
Uh, that i sent.

119
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,950
Uh, my... My phone's been
on silent.

120
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:18,250
Look, jimmy, i'm sorry
i've been so blindsided

121
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:23,250
By this career shift
and unpacking my entire life.

122
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:25,950
Well, that would explain
all the late nights.

123
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,750
Why didn't you say something?
I'm a pro when it comes to...

124
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,079
No, no!

125
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,150
Sorry. Uh...

126
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,450
Just moving into lana's office
is kind of a private thing.

127
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,150
Yeah.

128
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,450
I'm starting to sense that.

129
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,550
Oh, sorry,
i got to take this.

130
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,750
I heard that text loud and clear. My ears
are practically ringing over here.

131
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,739
It's my building manager.

132
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,650
He wants to talk to me
about... the rent.

133
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,418
Right now... actually.

134
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,853
And this can't wait
till after lunch?

135
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:10,050
No, i'm sorry, jimmy.
I got to run.

136
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,160
Sir.

137
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:39,749
Take my suitcase
to the limo. I'll be down shortly.

138
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,450
Sir, i'm afraid there's been a problem
with your travel plans.

139
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,650
If it's weather,
we'll power through it.

140
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:48,850
Zeus' right hand couldn't muster a storm
that would keep me from zurich.

141
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,974
It's not the gods
i'm worried about, sir.

142
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,750
It's the government.

143
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,850
What are you talking about?

144
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,450
All the F.A.A. Will tell me
is that you've been red-Flagged.

145
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,850
I ran it up to the highest level.

146
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,450
Then aim higher.

147
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,750
Sweet.

148
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,550
See, miss domestic security?
There's nothing here.

149
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,350
What are you up to, chloe?

150
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,850
Hey. I came as soon
as i got your message.

151
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,550
- What's going on?
- You need to read this.

152
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:43,139
Clark, you know i can't read
kryptonian. What am i looking at?

153
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,247
That page wasn't there before.

154
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,350
Okay, this entry didn't just magically
rita skeeter itself into swann's journal.

155
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,050
I know it sounds crazy,

156
00:13:54,444 --> 00:13:57,750
But these are the only transmissions
jor-El sent to earth before i got here.

157
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,550
There's no way
i missed a single page.

158
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:03,914
Trust me,
it wasn't there till now.

159
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,150
You do realize
that your greatest superpower

160
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,150
Is your ability to win me over
with just one look,

161
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,402
No matter how ridiculous
you sound, right?

162
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:16,835
- Can you translate it?
- No, even swann said

163
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:19,650
These transmissions
were distorted and incomplete.

164
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,750
Uh, okay, clark.
Now, that look kills me.

165
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:30,350
This transmission says,
"save lana at fortress."

166
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,749
As in lang? That's impossible.

167
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,150
I mean, that passage was written
in 1989.

168
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:41,050
Lana would have been
barely 3.

169
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,650
Why would jor-El send
an s.O.S. Out for her?

170
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,555
I think it's time
i ask him myself.

171
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,950
Wait a minute, clark.
This could be a trick.

172
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:50,750
Your birth father tried
to turn you into a popsicle

173
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,650
So you would outlive everyone
here on earth.

174
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:55,249
He's not exactly
your best ally right now.

175
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,117
The next time
i hold lana's hand,

176
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:59,550
I want to tell her i did
everything i could to save her.

177
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:03,150
If that means going up
against jor-El, then so be it.

178
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,550
Hey, C.K.

179
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,450
Jimmy, listen,
i was just on my way out.

180
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:28,850
Yeah, i only had to stop twice for
directions to get here, Half a tank of gas,

181
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,429
but it's not important.
You know, it can wait.

182
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,479
No. What's going on?

183
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:37,550
You know i wouldn't come to you
if i didn't think that you could help.

184
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,450
I have this...

185
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,250
Friend who's keeping
this really, really big secret.

186
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,642
I mean,
it's kind of humongous.

187
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,850
How did you find out
about this secret?

188
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,491
Well, i can't say that
i wasn't a little suspicious.

189
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,245
It's hard to be around someone
with crazy skills like this

190
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:01,950
And not think
that something is up.

191
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,950
So, i did a little digging.

192
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,871
And what i found, C.K.,
to be honest with you...

193
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,150
It's freaking me out.

194
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,610
I don't know where you're getting your
information, but i can explain.

195
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,750
The person that i thought i knew
isn't who she says she is.

196
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,450
- "She"?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:25,850
I mean, name me one good reason to lie to
somebody that you supposedly care about.

198
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,650
To protect them.

199
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,650
If you look at the relationship
you have with this friend,

200
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,814
Do you really need to know
everything about her?

201
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,989
Or is knowing
what's truly in her heart

202
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:41,850
Enough to know
you can trust her?

203
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,200
Jor-El, you mentioned lana
in your last transmission!

204
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Why?!

205
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,489
Tell me how to save her!

206
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,427
Please, help me.

207
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,399
Jor-El, what have you done
to kara?!

208
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:25,261
Why are you doing this?!

209
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:29,964
Kara, i can't hear you!

210
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,333
I sent the transmission.

211
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:36,600
Help me.
Help me save you, kal-El.

212
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,100
Brainiac wants to kill you.

213
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,523
Where are you?

214
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:43,142
I went back.

215
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm on...

216
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,751
I'm on krypton.

217
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:53,500
Krypton.

218
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,701
Nope.

219
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,670
Nope.

220
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:15,000
Definitely not.

221
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:19,300
Let's see if we can find
another way into this building.

222
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,600
Huh. He is the clubs.

223
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,099
Hey, clark, i know that
being in the fortress means

224
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,595
You're technically
out of cellphone range, but...

225
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,875
I found a satellite that
has a possible read on brainiac.

226
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:49,489
Now, it's connected to the city
satellite center, so i can't hack in,

227
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,500
But i do, however,
think i found another way in.

228
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,200
Oh, my god.

229
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,773
Who's playing big brother on me?

230
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,000
Why are you spying on me?

231
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:34,500
Hey, chloe.

232
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:36,826
I think i really screwed up...

233
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:38,632
Big-Time.

234
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,000
- Can you call me back?
- You don't want to do that.

235
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,838
Breathe a word of this to chloe,

236
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,199
And you are both facing charges
of federal treason.

237
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,099
Look, i searched chloe's office
like you wanted me to.

238
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,642
- There's nothing suspicious going on.
- Drop it.

239
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,199
The spyware that you installed
in chloe's office

240
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,500
Traced her recent
computer activity.

241
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,400
She has a plan,
and it's going down tonight.

242
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:02,795
- This can't be happening.
- I need you to man up right now.

243
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Any minute, i'm guessing chloe's going to
invite you to a bar called the ace of clubs.

244
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:10,400
She'd be too conspicuous
to show up on her own.

245
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,274
Wear it...

246
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:15,283
There's a fiber-Optic camera inside
so i can keep an eye on you.

247
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,799
So we can both watch my girlfriend drink
cozumels till she finds her inner shakira?

248
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,400
It's a secure building.
The club is her only way in.

249
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,445
Watch her like a hawk.

250
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,200
Find out what her target is

251
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,000
And get it before she does.

252
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,600
Sure.
Piece of cake.

253
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:40,445
You look beautiful,
by the way.

254
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,962
Thanks, handsome.

255
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:45,199
Though, i have to admit
i'm surprised

256
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,020
You could pencil in an event like
this with being so busy and all.

257
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,345
I know.

258
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,499
And aren't we lucky you were
able to find a tux to rent

259
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,170
On such a short notice?

260
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,800
Um, would you mind
getting me a drink?

261
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,970
Sure, no problem.

262
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,755
Here you go.

263
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:30,248
Thank you.

264
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:48,000
- May i have this dance?
- Actually, i don't, um...

265
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,177
Maybe the olsen's not
quite so wholesome after all.

266
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,108
I'm just getting started.

267
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:34,200
Shoot, i forgot to give
the valet the keys.

268
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,900
I'll be right back.
Just wait here, okay?

269
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,370
Take as much time
as you need.

270
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:35,460
Found it

271
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,860
Up with a twist?

272
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:08,660
You're drinking alone tonight.

273
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:16,360
And what the hell is this?

274
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,460
Whatever chloe was after,
i got to it before she did.

275
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:22,460
This is a list
of employee health benefits.

276
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,560
What?

277
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:25,460
That's impossible.

278
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,760
Oh, let me guess. 20th floor,
retinal-Scan briefcase?

279
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,660
She's better than i thought.

280
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,972
That briefcase
is the daily mainframe backup.

281
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,760
She just happened to lure you
to the most useless file on the drive.

282
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,714
- Really?
- You blew it.

283
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:46,059
Now i'm taking over my way.

284
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,160
If chloe trusted you
as much you seem to trust her,

285
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:50,760
She wouldn't get hurt.

286
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:54,560
Prison might actually do
your relationship some good.

287
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:16,960
Oh, my god.

288
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,060
Chloe sullivan,
you're under arrest.

289
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:33,560
Chloe will never talk.
You know that?

290
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:35,245
I wouldn't worry.

291
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:37,543
Agent webber always leaves
a few teeth.

292
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:51,561
Who are you working for?

293
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:54,192
I'm not a terrorist, okay?

294
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:55,886
I'm one of the good guys.

295
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:59,060
Good guys put their country
before themselves.

296
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,760
Who's your network contact?

297
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,608
I don't have one.

298
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:23,459
Why did you access power grids

299
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,160
Exactly where there just happened
to be unexplained energy surges?

300
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,530
Must be a plan behind it all.

301
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:33,760
Did you really think
it would all go unnoticed?

302
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,460
Don't even think
about passing out.

303
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:39,260
Give me the taser.

304
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:43,490
You really thought you could
get away with it all?

305
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,568
Haven't you
figured it out yet?

306
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:47,660
Tell you anything.

307
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,760
You need to make a choice
right now.

308
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:52,239
What's more important?

309
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:55,394
The secret or your life?

310
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:07,083
Turn this off.

311
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:44,560
- Chloe, hey, it's me.
- Jimmy.

312
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:47,360
You're still here.

313
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,559
I wish you'd let me
take you to the hospital.

314
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm fine, really.

315
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,405
Chloe, you almost died.

316
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,798
Look, i think i deserve an explanation...
Preferably the truth this time.

317
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,066
The truth?

318
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,059
Why don't you just
look at your files,

319
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,460
Or should i say my files?

320
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,360
You stole from me, jimmy.

321
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,159
Yeah, after being coerced
by the feds.

322
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,459
I mean, did you really think
that i was a government agent?

323
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,260
Did you really think
i was a terrorist spy?

324
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:21,540
She didn't give me any choice.

325
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:24,860
Besides, what was i
supposed to think?

326
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:26,660
You were sitting
on enough classified information

327
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:28,171
To start a nuclear war.

328
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:29,960
Jimmy, yeah,
that was my plan...

329
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,060
Nuke the whole thing
and just start over again.

330
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:33,702
Are you kidding me?

331
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,760
Why didn't you just come to me
like a normal boyfriend?

332
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:41,260
'Cause a normal boyfriend
doesn't get lied to every five minutes

333
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:43,260
By the girl that he thinks
that he's in love with.

334
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:51,560
All right, fine, i lied.

335
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:53,914
Is that what you want
to hear, jimmy? I'm sorry.

336
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:57,260
Is this the point
where the sad song comes on

337
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:58,960
And we break up
all over again?

338
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:03,260
Because i'm not gonna make it
that easy this time.

339
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,960
You know what? The feds are
gonna find us any moment,

340
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:12,760
And then i'll just spend the rest
of my life making license plates.

341
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,760
So, you may as well
just fire away.

342
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:17,960
Ask me whatever you want.

343
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:35,060
You want that
more than you want clark.

344
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:47,260
And by the way,

345
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,960
There's no one coming after us.
I'm taking care of that.

346
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,260
How?

347
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,360
You have your secrets,
and i have mine.

348
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,167
Deal?

349
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:16,640
Mr. Luthor...

350
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:18,560
Your box.

351
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:44,218
You aren't one of them.

352
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,660
The guy wanted me dead.

353
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:07,960
Find out who he is and see if he's connected
to whatever i'm dealing with quebec.

354
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,351
Busy?

355
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:17,460
Mr. Olsen,
i was expecting you.

356
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:21,760
I take it chloe doesn't know
how desperate you are.

357
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,160
I mean, she would never
let a friend

358
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:26,560
Crawl across burning coals
for my help.

359
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,583
You're a luthor...

360
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,760
Build and burn political ladders
for sport.

361
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:35,160
What i mean is that, um...

362
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:37,760
Well, you have pull
with these people,

363
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,860
And i thought that maybe
a string here

364
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:41,860
- Or a handshake there...
- You can stop now.

365
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:46,498
I cleared chloe's name from 

366
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:49,560
that suspiciously high-Ranking
government arrest warrant.

367
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:53,660
Special agent webber has decided
to drop her investigation.

368
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,660
Thank you.

369
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,460
But...

370
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,260
There's not that many people
eating lunch on lex luthor's dime.

371
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,460
Why are you helping me?

372
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,160
No catch.

373
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:17,360
You see, jimmy,

374
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,260
In light of recent events,

375
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,260
I'd like to think of
my employees as my new family.

376
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:25,460
Families help each other.

377
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,960
And i know if i ever
needed something from you...

378
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:33,887
You'd be more than willing
to be there for me.

379
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:39,260
Yeah.

380
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:12,360
So, kara's trying to contact you

381
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:14,460
- Via the fortress from krypton?
- I know.

382
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,860
Wait, krypton is the planet
that exploded, right?

383
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:19,749
It sounds crazy. Jor-El must have
done something to her.

384
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,560
But kara left with braniac. What does
jor-El have to do with any of this?

385
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:23,748
I don't know.

386
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:27,560
But how se could her message
come through the fortress?

387
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:33,030
Clark, have you considered
the possibility that kara really

388
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,860
is on krypton,

389
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,827
And it's just
a different time zone?

390
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,960
Like, the past.

391
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:42,860
You mean like time travel.

392
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:45,370
Check this out.

393
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,560
I followed the trajectory
of two blurs

394
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:51,193
That started from the daily planet roof.
Now, it has to be kara and brainiac.

395
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:55,360
What if the vortex
that they're flying through

396
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:58,660
Is some kind
of intergalactic time portal?

397
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,114
I mean, look at this.

398
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,959
- Looks like a red star.
- Right, and next to it is a star,

399
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,260
Which could be a planet...
Krypton.

400
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:07,959
Now, this pie was taken
seconds later.

401
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,633
The vortex is closed,
and the red star is gone.

402
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,111
It's possible.

403
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,160
You're saying
kara's actually on krypton?

404
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:20,860
Well, krypton 1989...

405
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:23,560
Give or take
a few light-Years.

406
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:29,860
That explains how her message
mysteriously appeared

407
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,246
In swann's journal.
She sent it to him,

408
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:34,011
Hoping that i'd read it.

409
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,560
It sounds more
like a hail-Mary pass.

410
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,860
Clark, if she sent those messages
to swann and the fortress,

411
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:42,460
That means kara's desperate
to get your attention.

412
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,060
When i was in the fortress,

413
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:46,460
Kara warned  what brainiac
was trying to kill me.

414
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,960
She must have meant the version of
me on krypton 20 years ago.

415
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,760
When you were a baby.

416
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,108
Clark, if you really are
in trouble on krypton,

417
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:57,260
You better find a way
to get there soon or...

418
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,836
I'll have never existed.

419
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,260
Looks like it's finally time
for kal-El to go home.
