1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:03,814
Be yourselves and just
speak from the heart.

2
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:07,778
Jimmy, chloe, i can't tell you how happy
i am the two of you found each other

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:10,340
You're very lucky to be together.

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:14,350
Look, your wedding day's gonna b
perfect, i'm gonna make sure of it.

5
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:16,537
Stop hogging the spotlight, smallville.

6
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:19,154
Hey, cuz, you know that i love you,

7
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:23,394
And i wish you and jimmy
long and happy years together.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,675
And remember what the
general always says ...

9
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:30,018
Marriage is the only war where
you get to sleep with the enemy.

10
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:34,410
You can edit out that last part, right?

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,042
I told him.

12
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:23,197
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

13
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,172
You may kiss the bride.

14
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:43,094
Ladies and gentlemen, join me
in welcoming the newly weds.

15
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,714
What was that?

16
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,482
Hold on, jimmy.

17
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,781
Please don't leave me.

18
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:42,989
Smallville 810

19
00:02:43,106 --> 00:03:01,058
Synchro : flolo

20
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:25,235
For seriessub.Com

21
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:39,408
It's 11:00 hours, people. We only
got till sunset to change this little

22
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,725
Heifer-House into my cousin's chapel
of love, so let's pick up the pace.

23
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,728
Hold on, emeril. Dinner
ware stays outside

24
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,190
- Until the reception presto
change-O. - Of course, no problem.

25
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:53,701
Goldilocks, this is mother goose.
What's the status at bridal central?

26
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:56,051
Half an hour ahead of
schedule. Good job, chloe.

27
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,921
But don't get cocky, or you'll
fall behind. Over and out.

28
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:03,098
Jimmy told me you're going to
be filming this epic, spielberg.

29
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,996
I want testimonials, candids, everything.
But i don't want to know you're here.

30
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,749
- You're a fly on the wall, all right?
- Ring that bell.

31
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,553
No.

32
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:16,779
Mother goose to baby bear.

33
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,999
Mother goose to baby
bear. Come in, baby bear.

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,883
I'm getting married. Shouldn't
i get bumped up to papa bear?

35
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:28,674
We don't need to jinx our big day.

36
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:31,380
Seem a little twitchy there, jimmy.

37
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:33,837
The butterflies in your stomach
starting to do the rhumba yet?

38
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:37,032
Not at all. Well, the only thing i'm nervous
about is seeing chloe before the ceremony.

39
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,997
It's bad luck.

40
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:42,104
What about the whole "till
death do us part" part?

41
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,499
That's got to be nerve-Racking.

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,052
Well, when you pick the right person,

43
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,727
There's no need for
wedding-Day jitters.

44
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,116
- Good answer, jimbo.
- You know, speaking of the right person,

45
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:59,438
Since you don't have a plus-One tonight,
i'd like you to meet one of my friends.

46
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:03,119
Name's clark kent. You heard of him?

47
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,347
Better wear your bow and arrow, cupid.

48
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:08,652
That bumbling tadpole is
not my prince charming.

49
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,714
Well, maybe you just need to jump
his lily pad and plant one on him.

50
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:13,778
Come on.

51
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,660
I've seen the way you
two look at each other.

52
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,695
You need to get your
eyesight checked, olsen.

53
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,754
Clark doesn't like me. He
likes... driving me crazy.

54
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:29,415
Flirtation 101, lane. I mean, that's
what a guy does when he's into a girl.

55
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,567
Really?

56
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:35,338
Trust me.

57
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:38,095
Lois and clark would be great together.

58
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:40,630
I can feel it in my gut.

59
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:45,071
Well, take some
ex-Lax, and get over it.

60
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:48,310
Okay, well, i'm gonna
go practice my vows.

61
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,662
When you see mr. Right,
will you give him this?

62
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:52,571
- Okay.
- Thank you.

63
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,977
Hey, if you don't get
that camera out of my face,

64
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,119
I'm gonna ring your bell, buddy!

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,140
Well, i guess the groom is more frazzled
than he thought.I forgot my bow tie.

66
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,683
You look great.

67
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:20,586
Hey, cowboy.

68
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,565
Want to give a girl a hand?

69
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,879
Oh, my god.

70
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,989
Oh, i'm not supposed to
see you till the wedding.

71
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,898
Okay, you know what? Cut.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

72
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,492
Come on, jimmy. This is classic.

73
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,283
Go, go.

74
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,730
I, called your phone,
and you didn't answer.

75
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,417
I thought that you were getting your
hair coifed, or whatever you call it.

76
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:42,676
- I made the appointment earlier.
- I wish you would have told me.

77
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:45,116
I wouldn't have come over if
i knew you were still here.

78
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,651
It's fine. Calm down.

79
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:50,320
No, you don't get it. This is a...

80
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,897
It's a disaster.

81
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:55,393
Maybe it's not so bad. I mean, my garter
belt is a little bit temperamental.

82
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:57,112
So maybe it's good
luck that you came by.

83
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:59,363
The groom sees the bride
before the wedding? It's

84
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:01,119
Like the hindenburg of disasters.

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,297
It's worse than black cats and
broken mirrors and all that...

86
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,390
Jimmy, breathe! Look, our love
has weathered federal arrests

87
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:10,804
And heart-Attack-Inducing kisses
and a freakazoid bout of amnesia.

88
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,401
I think that we'll survive this.

89
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,098
That's better.

90
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,161
You know, i guess me showing
up is just a sign that...

91
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,878
When no one else is around to help...

92
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,872
We'll always be there for each other.

93
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,580
Forever.

94
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,748
Perfect.

95
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,723
- I'm gonna go get my bow tie.
- Okay.

96
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:16,573
Chloe, it's davis. Look, i know i'm the
last person you want to talk to today, but...

97
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,412
Please call me back.

98
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,973
To delete this message,

99
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:22,873
- Press 7.
- Who was that?

100
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:26,508
Brigadier general lois,
letting us know that,

101
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,296
We have t-Minus three
hours until d-Day.

102
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:34,436
So, what do you say we get ready
to storm the beach, handsome?

103
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,960
Listen, you better watch out for lois.

104
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:06,345
She'll pin an apron on you and name you
after some sort of fairy-Tale character.

105
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,033
What's wrong?

106
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,593
Lex is alive.

107
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:14,055
I was tracking a wireless
ghost router he was using

108
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,173
To bounce e-Mails to tess mercer.

109
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:18,535
If we can get our hands on that router,

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,057
It'll tell us where
the e-Mails originated.

111
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:24,751
- It's not like lex to leave a trail.
- He's not leaving a trail.

112
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,831
His routers pop up all over the globe.

113
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,250
But every time i show up,
all the hardware's missing.

114
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,571
You want me to race in there and grab

115
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,652
The router the next
time lex sends an e-Mail.

116
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,183
That's right.

117
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,648
Now, listen. Based on the previous
pattern, i'm expecting one today.

118
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,700
This means we could be hours away
from locking that monster up for good.

119
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,436
I can't do this today.

120
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:46,831
Clark, what are you talking about? You've
given lex, like, 100 second chances.

121
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:51,388
And if he's out there alive, he hasn't made
a move for months. This can wait 24 hours.

122
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,162
- Chloe can't.
- The wedding?

123
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,113
Is that the real reason you
don't want to go after lex,

124
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,347
Or is that just an excuse?
Chloe's gonna understand.

125
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,919
No, she won't.

126
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,887
When i had jor-El
bring back her memories,

127
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:06,593
I asked him to leave out the
ones about who i really am.

128
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:09,499
You know everything she
suffered through because of me.

129
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,891
And not to give her
away on her wedding day?

130
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,519
It's not an option.

131
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,285
Maybe lex hasn't made
his move yet, but he will.

132
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,567
He's more dangerous
now than he ever was.

133
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:25,926
Chloe may not know your secret anymore,

134
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,416
But lex still does.

135
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,342
Sorry i took so long.
The warehouse was guarded.

136
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:55,648
Well, it's a good thing the infamous red-Blue
blur is faster than a speeding bullet.

137
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,185
So, let's see it.

138
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:01,792
Is that what this is about?

139
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:07,096
Oliver, you told me you set
aside your need for vengeance.

140
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,599
I know how much you hate lionel luthor
for what he did to your parents...

141
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,155
"Did"? Clark, it's called "murder."

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,866
You can't punish the son
for the sins of the father.

143
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,656
That's not what i'm doing.

144
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:23,978
I remember when my dad died.

145
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:27,598
I was so angry, i almost crossed a
line that i could not come back from.

146
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm not gonna let you
make the same mistake.

147
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,035
Well, the truth is i'm
going after lex for you.

148
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,210
That's only half the truth, isn't it?

149
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,152
Clark, come on, you know
how dangerous this guy is.

150
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:42,215
He may even know how to kill you.

151
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:47,353
Why don't you just...
give me the router?

152
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:50,169
Okay, it's gonna take me a couple
hours to download it, anyway.

153
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,634
Well, you're gonna have
plenty of time to eat cake

154
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,007
And do the chicken dance
before we even take off.

155
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,877
No, i'm gonna keep this
until after the wedding.

156
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,792
If you're really doing
this for me, oliver...

157
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,138
You'll wait until i can go with you.

158
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,231
What's with the fireworks?

159
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:26,145
He took the router with him.

160
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,834
Without that thing,
i can't make my move.

161
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,391
Well, put out the fuse, dude.

162
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:33,069
Wifi.

163
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,674
I downloaded the info while you
two were having that lovers' spat.

164
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,075
My god.

165
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:06,686
I have too much to do to start
crying, but you look breath taking.

166
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,962
If it wasn't for you,
i would look more like

167
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:12,330
The bride of frankenstein
than cinderella.

168
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:16,177
What you did to this barn
is absolutely amazing, lois.

169
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,359
Gonna answer that?

170
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:32,777
What's wrong?

171
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,104
Nothing.

172
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,728
It's davis bloome. He...

173
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,583
He's been calling all day.

174
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,622
You know, deep down, i know
he's a really great guy.

175
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,574
I just think he's a little confused.

176
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:49,415
Last week, he kissed me,

177
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,584
And he told me he wasn't gonna
let me marry the wrong guy.

178
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:56,971
Are you starting to have feelings
for tall, dark, and scary?

179
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:02,703
All i want is to walk down that
aisle and marry the man i love.

180
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:08,309
When did you know he was the one?

181
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:14,383
Lois, don't worry.

182
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:17,199
When you meet your
super-Stud, you'll know.

183
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:21,502
Please. This isn't about me.

184
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,403
I need to get bitten by the love bug

185
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,979
About as much as i need
a bite from a black widow.

186
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:30,054
- Do you have everything you need?
- Almost.

187
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:33,116
I have something old,
something blue, something new,

188
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:36,572
And i just need something borrowed
to round out the tradition.

189
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:44,998
When in trouble, leave it to
clark kent to get you out of a jam.

190
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,524
Let's see what we have here.

191
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:57,979
What are you two girls doing?

192
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,603
The bride needs something
borrowed to take to the altar.

193
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:04,999
How about she carry your piece of
smallville's finest meteor rock down the aisle?

194
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,800
Hey, why don't you put that away? I...

195
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,810
I have a better idea.

196
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:27,955
You gave that to me freshman
year at the home coming dance.

197
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,146
And you kept it all this time?

198
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,635
I never throw away good memories.

199
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,739
Thanks, smallville.

200
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,479
Another pre-Wedding fire put out.

201
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,443
If you're all set, you
and i have to vamoose.

202
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:54,409
It's almost high noon, and we
have a showdown to get ready for.

203
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,249
Goodbye, lex.

204
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,544
Oliver queen?

205
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,633
Lana?!

206
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:39,003
So oliver queen
moonlights as green arrow.

207
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,131
Does clark know about you?

208
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:44,630
I think i can safely say he knows
more of my secrets than he does yours.

209
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,996
You're not gonna tell me
you're down here on vacation,

210
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:49,656
- Fishing for marlin, are you?
- We both know that two hours ago,

211
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:52,711
More than 430,000
megagigs of luthorcorp ram

212
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:55,759
And ethernet cables were
running through this place.

213
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,341
Well, sounds like weeach came
here with a score to settle.

214
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:04,506
I'd say you were aiming to
settle more than a score.

215
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:11,258
He leave this note for you or me?

216
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,180
I'm not convinced lex is alive.

217
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,775
Just because the king dies doesn't mean
the entire empire crumbles overnight.

218
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,809
I just followed the leads
here to protect clark.

219
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,594
Good.

220
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:28,804
Because no one else seems too
concerned that lex found out his secret.

221
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:33,769
If you're on a trail, i can help you.

222
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:36,509
Is this your version of help?

223
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,970
'Cause it seems a little personal to me.

224
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:41,704
You're green arrow.
You're better than this.

225
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,835
You sound like clark.

226
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,652
If we want to fight
for the greater good,

227
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,654
Maybe we all have to be
a little more like clark.

228
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,273
How is he?

229
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,504
You know, he's giving
chloe away at her wedding.

230
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,493
Why don't you come find out?

231
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:25,238
No, i can't.

232
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,555
It's too complicated.

233
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,402
She's your best friend...

234
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,588
And it's her wedding day.

235
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,171
I don't understand what's
so complicated about that.

236
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:42,063
You just said we need to
be more like clark, right?

237
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:46,729
Well, what would he do?

238
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,011
Smallville, chop-Chop! Let's go!

239
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:57,868
We can't have a wedding without
the escort to give the bride away.

240
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,741
Looks like you're ready.

241
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,017
I have it all under control,
except for these cuff links.

242
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,833
They were my dad's, and i've
never had to put them on before.

243
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,528
Well, i guess you don't
have much need for cuff links

244
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,945
When you have a whole closet full
of flannel shirts, farmer john?

245
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:32,258
Big-City boy, let me give you a lesson.

246
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,851
You just have to make sure
this part sticks up straight,

247
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,997
And then it slides right in.

248
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:45,870
The ring?

249
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,718
You can give that to jimmy
when the minister signals.

250
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:51,931
And here are his vows
in case he forgets.

251
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,208
"It's really hard for me...

252
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:03,159
"To put my feelings into words,

253
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,771
"But from the moment we met,

254
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:08,684
I knew i wanted to spend the
rest of my life with you."

255
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:15,014
Jimmy's vows...

256
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,886
They're really sweet.

257
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:25,769
Yeah, he's a regular cyrano.

258
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:32,921
Hey, guys. How about a
testimonial before the ceremony?

259
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,447
- Sure.
- Great!

260
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:39,063
All right. Now, be yourselves
and just speak from the heart.

261
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,488
Jimmy, chloe, i can't
tell you how happy i am

262
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:43,627
The two of you found each other.

263
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,951
You're very lucky to be together.

264
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:49,756
Chloe, i know you're not picking up
because of what happened between us.

265
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:52,638
But i need you to call me back.
I don't know who i can trust.

266
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:55,031
I've done something horrible.

267
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,595
Didn't mean to scare you, pal.

268
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:33,438
I saw your ambulance while
i was doing my rounds.

269
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:37,790
- Is everything okay back here?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. It's just a...

270
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,570
A false alarm.

271
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:41,757
Probably a prank. Happens all the time.

272
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:50,379
That's blood.

273
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,936
I really need to go.

274
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:56,508
Hold on.

275
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,408
Sweet mary and joseph.

276
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:10,677
What the hell did you put in there?

277
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,863
What did you do?

278
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:17,363
It's not my fault. I blacked
out. I couldn't control it.

279
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:21,852
Okay, listen to me.

280
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:24,231
You need to go right now.

281
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,020
I'm not going anywhere.

282
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,533
And you aren't either,
until the cops get here.

283
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:45,469
Run!

284
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:58,029
We'd now like to ask chloe's escort
to join her on the dance floor.

285
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,899
It's time to boogie.

286
00:24:08,852 --> 00:24:11,421
I know. It's weird, isn't it?

287
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:12,979
A little.

288
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,318
Thank you for letting
us have our wedding here.

289
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,368
Yeah, well...

290
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:20,899
It's the least i could do.

291
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,560
You were always the best
friend i ever could have had.

292
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,042
You say that like something's changed.

293
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:33,261
Clark, trust me, we've been
through too much together.

294
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,936
Nothing is gonna make me forget that.

295
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,425
You're right.

296
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:44,887
The important thing is that your
life is everything you want it to be.

297
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:49,605
It is.

298
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,331
It's like i've been
carrying around this weight,

299
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:56,837
And i don't know why,
but a few days ago...

300
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,063
I finally let go.

301
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:02,918
Like i can move on.

302
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:08,338
Okay, c.K.

303
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,735
My turn to dance with my wife.

304
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:30,609
Guess i can give these
well-Heeled puppies a rest.

305
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:41,712
No way, i can't believe it!

306
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,960
Oh, my god!

307
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:16,157
Great. Thank you.

308
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,266
Want a glass with that?

309
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:28,493
Oliver. Just the person
i want to see right now.

310
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:33,445
So, want to tell me what
started this lost weekend?

311
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:35,930
Go on and enjoy the party.

312
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:39,798
Trust me, it'll be a real buzz-Kill
to listen to me whine like patsy cline.

313
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:42,417
Yeah, you're probably right.

314
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,016
You know...

315
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:46,572
I may not be at the top
of your confidant list,

316
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:49,338
But if you ever want to talk, i'm here.

317
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,442
I'm just having all these feelings,
and i don't know what they mean.

318
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,768
Well, who's the lucky guy?

319
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:14,000
Having this conversation
with an ex is...

320
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:17,804
Bad enough without turning
up the awkward dial.

321
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:19,626
Right.

322
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:24,246
Well, you know, there's
moving on in theory,

323
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:28,142
And then there's the moment
that it actually happens.

324
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:31,174
If you like, we can start now,

325
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,539
And i'll just be a really good friend.

326
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,002
Okay.

327
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:47,715
It's like i was going along,
and it just snuck up on me.

328
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:55,483
And i tried to ignore it, but then
there are these moments that you can't.

329
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,610
Maybe i was reading it wrong.

330
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:04,185
And to add insult to injury,

331
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:07,312
It all went down at tonight's
tribute to romantic bliss.

332
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:18,591
I know it sounds sappy...

333
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:23,653
But i thought...

334
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,879
Just for a minute...

335
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:30,451
That someone needed me.

336
00:29:33,968 --> 00:29:36,866
Well, i'm sure he needs you, lois.

337
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,817
That's sweet of you to
say, but how do you know?

338
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,735
'Cause i know clark.

339
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:20,496
Chloe's glad you came.

340
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:28,423
I could have used some warning.

341
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:39,074
You weren't planning on
coming back, were you?

342
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:41,397
Yeah, not until a few hours ago.

343
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,119
So, what changed your mind?

344
00:30:58,095 --> 00:31:00,979
I'm not expecting you to say it was me.

345
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:09,754
I read about the mysterious
blur saving lives in metropolis.

346
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:14,306
I'm proud of you, clark. It's who
you should have been all along.

347
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:17,809
Does that mean you're happy you left?

348
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:24,051
It was the hardest decision
i have ever had to make.

349
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:29,180
But i'm glad that i finally
had the guts to do it.

350
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:42,184
I would have died
before i admitted this,

351
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:46,721
But i used to sit on my front
porch and look across the field

352
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:49,795
At this barn, imaging
a summer wedding here.

353
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:54,465
Of course, i always thought
i'd play a bigger part in it.

354
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:59,046
You probably would have if i had
given you chloe's wedding gift.

355
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:07,141
I had jor-El erase all the memories
that chloe had of the real me.

356
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,147
I wonder if that would have
made things different between us.

357
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:19,308
I understood the lies that you
told me to protect your identity.

358
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,442
But i could never forgive you
for taking that away from me.

359
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,206
You can't mean that.

360
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:29,468
Lana, it turned your life upside down.

361
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:32,201
Maybe it was exactly what it need.

362
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,785
I could have landed a lot
of places in my life, clark.

363
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:40,504
But without you, none of
them would have led me here.

364
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,791
So that's it.

365
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:51,307
It's all over.

366
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,733
It's that easy?

367
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,119
No.

368
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:06,147
But where i am now, for the
first time, it feels right.

369
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,522
Clark, i know neither
of us could say it...

370
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:19,962
But maybe clark kent and lana lang
just weren't meant to end up together.

371
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:05,724
What was that?

372
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,224
I'm okay. Go.

373
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:41,127
Jimmy, don't!

374
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,978
No!

375
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:54,777
Jimmy, please, hold on.

376
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:02,109
Please don't leave me.

377
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,599
It's too late.

378
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:45,786
That thing took chloe.

379
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,326
Any word on chloe?

380
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,195
No. But i'm meeting with oliver.

381
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,267
He's using every
satellite in his company

382
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:22,787
To try to track down where
that thing might have taken her.

383
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,336
Are you all right?

384
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,083
Clark, there's nothing
more you can do for me.

385
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,817
You don't need to stay.

386
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:39,619
I know.

387
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:45,230
I need to find chloe.

388
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:57,514
Lois.

389
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,272
How are you holding up?

390
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,705
Jimmy's in bad shape.

391
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:06,895
The nurse said they had him stabilized.

392
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:09,322
But he's not out of the woods.

393
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:12,329
He has severe internal bleeding.
They're medevacing him to star city

394
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,816
To one of the country's top surgeons.

395
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,808
I'm gonna go with him.

396
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:22,057
I'll stay there until i hear from...

397
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,989
Why did this have to happen to her?

398
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:34,603
Why do these terrible things
keep happening all around us?

399
00:38:37,558 --> 00:38:39,431
I promise.

400
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,660
We're gonna get chloe back.

401
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,347
What if we can't?

402
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,015
Rendez-Vous in 2009 for smallville 811.
