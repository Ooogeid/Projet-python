00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,385
Previously on smallville...

2
00:00:01,505 --> 00:00:04,800
Chloe, i can't tell you how happy
i am the two of you found each other.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,461
Your wedding day's gonna be
perfect. I'm gonna make sure of it.

4
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:11,581
I've always felt like there
was this darkness inside me.

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,990
Run!

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,359
- What's wrong?
- Lex is alive.

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,493
Jimmy!

8
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,941
I've forgotten almost everyone.

9
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,834
I'm being taken over by brainiac.

10
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,403
There is some sort of
connection between us,

11
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,283
And i know that you feel it, too.

12
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,593
Since you don't have
a plus-One tonight,

13
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:32,426
I'd like you to meet one of
my friends. Name's clark kent.

14
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,457
Trust me...  lois and clark
would be great together.

15
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,135
No way! I can't believe
it! Lana, you're back!

16
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:43,710
It was the hardest decision
i have ever had to make.

17
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:48,247
If we want to fight
for the greater good,

18
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,767
Maybe we all have to be
a little more like clark.

19
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:53,866
Chloe deserves a life free
from the burden of my secret.

20
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:57,506
When you restore her memory, i don't
want her to remember my abilities.

21
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:02,467
Doomsday is coming.

22
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,032
- It's too late. That thing took chloe.
- Jimmy's in bad shape.

23
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,446
I'm gonna go with him to star city.

24
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,933
Why do these terrible things
keep happening all around us?

25
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:04,797
Lana!

26
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,967
I don't know what more i can do.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,343
I checked three time zones. No sign
of chloe or the creature that took her.

28
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:13,483
That thing that did this...

29
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:15,334
What was it?

30
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:21,081
Jor-El warned me about
an ultimate destroyer...

31
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,261
From krypton.

32
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,324
It should have gone after me, not chloe.

33
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:34,026
This was supposed to be the
happiest day of her life.

34
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,904
You should get some rest.

35
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,730
No, i'm...  i'm gonna go
to the isis foundation.

36
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,220
Chloe has files on just about
everything strange and unexplained.

37
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,355
Let me do it, lana.

38
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:56,549
Clark, i can help.

39
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,701
I know i've only been gone seven months,

40
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,341
But i'm a different person now.

41
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:05,909
Chloe needs us.

42
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:09,277
She needs both of us.

43
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,260
I'll call you as soon
as i find anything.

44
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:55,162
Hey, who are you? What
are you doing here?

45
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,534
I'll take that.

46
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,896
Let's see if he's ticklish.

47
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:49,834
Have a nice trip home, you hack.

48
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:03,256
Who are you? What's going on?

49
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:09,029
Kal-El, it is an absolute
honor and a privilege.

50
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,780
How do you know that name?

51
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,701
We are the legion.

52
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:16,885
We've come from the 31st century.

53
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:20,200
Hey, kal, where's your cape?

54
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,033
Cape?

55
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:26,033

58
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,280
That ax could split an atom. You'll
heal but not as fast as you'd expect.

59
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,968
He's gonna be fine, imra.

60
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,773
- We need to go.
- We shouldn't be attracting attention.

61
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:29,681
It's a little too late for that, isn't
it? You said you're from the 31st century.

62
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,547
- Why should i believe you?
- 'Cause we know everything about you.

63
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,791
You may be known as clark kent now,
but one day you'll be known as sup...

64
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,234
Garth!

65
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,670
It doesn't matter if
you believe us or not.

66
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,861
The less you know, the better.

67
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,400
There's one thing we can tell you.

68
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,284
We're your friends.

69
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:48,960
We're also leaving... now.

70
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,341
Garth!

71
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,767
No way!

72
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,945
I saw this in the levitz
museum behind visoglass.

73
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:00,314
- Put that back.
-  Get the magnet out of your ass, rokk.

74
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,734
I mean, this is... this is unreal.

75
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:06,625
You know the code...
don't touch anything.

76
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:08,912
Why are you here?

77
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,582
We're here to save you.

78
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:13,803
And now that you're okay,
we're heading straight back.

79
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,367
Not before you tell me who
that ax-Wielding psycho was.

80
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,214
- It's against legion code.
- I don't care about your code!

81
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,467
And i don't care about your legion!

82
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,434
That's the second attack
i've had in this barn tonight.

83
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,695
My best friend is missing,
and i need to find her.

84
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,367
You know anything, tell me.

85
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,167
The guy with the ax...

86
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,234
He goes by the name "persuader."

87
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,514
He's part of the human
supremacist movement.

88
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:43,227
A group of xenophobes who'd rather
die than live in peace with aliens.

89
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:46,437
And they all... pretty much hate you.

90
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,901
They stole one of our legion rings,

91
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,868
And they broke into the time
institute to come after you.

92
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,901
What does a 31st-Century
terrorist want with me?

93
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:04,717
Kal-El, your... your influence
will reach far beyond earth.

94
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:11,416
It's because of you that the world learns
to welcome alien immigrants with open arms.

95
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:17,072
What do you know about aliens?

96
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,467
Kal, i may have the smoldering
good looks of a human,

97
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,501
But i'm actually from a
hunk of mud called winath.

98
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,767
Rokk and imra are from
different planets, too.

99
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,300
We've come together,

100
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:32,367
Across the universe,
to form the legion...

101
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,618
To help others, as you do.

102
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:37,534
Without you, none of
that would have happened.

103
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,682
And now it's time for us to say goodbye.

104
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:47,911
Wait... we're not going anywhere.

105
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,361
This was the phantom zone crystal.

106
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:55,796
I know my history. This
was supposed to be used

107
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,400
To extract brainiac from
whoever he possessed.

108
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:01,199
The persuader didn't
come to kill kal-El.

109
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,283
He came to make sure brainiac survives.

110
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:06,567
Brainiac's gone. He's been destroyed.

111
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:10,334
No, he hasn't, kal... not yet.

112
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,632
Chloe?

113
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:42,434
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

114
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,857
I'm just about perfect.

115
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:10,506
- You appear undamaged.
- Chloe, what happened to you?

116
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:16,006
Chloe sullivan ceased to exist the
minute she entered this fortress.

117
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,701
I'm a brain interactive construct.

118
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,467
Look at me.

119
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,017
It's me. It's davis.

120
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,290
You're not davis bloome.

121
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:34,403
You're not even human.

122
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,267
Don't tell me the thought
never crossed your mind.

123
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:43,234
You were hatched by
kryptonian geneticists.

124
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:47,955
Your dna was designed to
adapt to any world you inhabit.

125
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:53,334
Now you no longer need
your camouflage abilities.

126
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,868
Those painful transformations
you've been experiencing...

127
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:59,116
They're the beginning
of your metamorphosis.

128
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:01,100
This is insane.

129
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,512
No.

130
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:08,230
It's... sad, from a human perspective...

131
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,265
Your naive romantic attraction

132
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:15,018
To the human i chose to inhabit.

133
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,222
Chloe, if you're in there anywhere,

134
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:22,868
You know that the feelings
that i have for you are real.

135
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,186
Feelings?

136
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:33,634
That was just a program i
was running to get you to me.

137
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,516
Your journey's just beginning.

138
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,235
Now it's time for you to incubate

139
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:45,033
In your kryptonian chrysalis.

140
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:48,567
Once you emerge, there
will be no more pain,

141
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,900
No doubt.

142
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:56,567
Only absolute rage
and unparalleled power.

143
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,653
Stay the hell away.

144
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:06,332
But you play a vital
part in my directive.

145
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,582
Once i get everything i need,

146
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:13,797
You will eradicate the other kryptonian
and then the rest of the planet.

147
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,801
I am not going to hurt anyone.

148
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,536
You have no free will.

149
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:25,386
12 days in the chrysalis,

150
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:28,767
And you're destined to
become what you really are.

151
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,780
Doomsday.

152
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,762
I think your timeline's a little off.

153
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:46,850
Brainiac did infect someone, but
it's already over. He's been defeated.

154
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,631
I'll admit a lot of
history might be inaccurate,

155
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,667
But today's date... it's been
known for over 1,000 years.

156
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,483
Kal, i flunked history,

157
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:57,196
And even i know that today's
the day you destroyed brainiac.

158
00:12:57,316 --> 00:13:00,367
It's no coincidence the persuader
showed up right when he did.

159
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,100
This girl you're thinking about...

160
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,178
The one that was brutally taken away...

161
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,601
Why do you think she has
something to do with brainiac?

162
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,649
I don't know.

163
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,065
You think she's the host.

164
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,214
If brainiac is still out there, then
i'll find him, and i'll stop him.

165
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,848
The three of you can go home to
the future. Let me handle this.

166
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,750
If brainiac isn't stopped today,

167
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,667
We won't have a future to go home to.

168
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,107
Kal, the problem is,

169
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,667
You were supposed to defeat
brainiac using this shield.

170
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,374
Now that it's been smashed...

171
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,467
The crystal can't be
the only way to stop him.

172
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,033
It's the only way to destroy him

173
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,607
Without killing the
human host in the process.

174
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,300
Kal, i'm sorry, but if
you know who the host is,

175
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,275
You need to take their life.

176
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:59,493
There's no other choice.

177
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,381
Who's chloe sullivan?

178
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,078
Why did you leave?

179
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,167
I need to do this my own way... alone.

180
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,647
- No one's killing anybody.
- What's with the ground transpo?

181
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,867
We should be having this
conversation up in the sky.

182
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:51,608
I can't fly.

183
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,667
You can't fly?

184
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,968
Rokk, what's up with that?

185
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,400
He obviously hasn't learned yet, garth.

186
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,906
- Where were you running to, kal?
- North, to see jor-El.

187
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,534
Of course... the fortress.

188
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,567
I think he can help.

189
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,534
You're positive chloe
sullivan is brainiac's host?

190
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,034
No, but she was attacked
last year by brainiac.

191
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,834
Her i.Q. Skyrocketed. Her
memories were being erased.

192
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:20,367
But it stopped. She was cured.

193
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,001
Kal-El, i have to tell you...

194
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,034
We've heard of lois lane...

195
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:29,133
Lana lang... even jimmy olsen...

196
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:34,029
But we've never heard a thing
about any chloe sullivan.

197
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:38,601
Then you don't know me
as well as you think.

198
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:42,233
He name was probably just
lost in the annals of history.

199
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,167
What she's trying to say
is that chloe sullivan

200
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,034
Probably isn't in the
history books because...

201
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,987
She didn't survive.

202
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:54,934
Chloe sullivan doesn't die. You hear me?

203
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:00,385
Kal.

204
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:11,500
Lightning lad.

205
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,034
You might want to take your a.C. Foot

206
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:17,100
Out of your d.C. Mouth
before you short yourself out.

207
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,714
Grife, rokk. I thought kal-El was known

208
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,968
For doing whatever it
took to save the world.

209
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,792
- Are you sure we got the right guy?
- It's him.

210
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:27,414
I don't know... no glasses,
no tights, no flights?

211
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:30,400
So far, he's nothing
like the man of steel.

212
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm sorry, lana.

213
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:53,400
I didn't mean to scare you.

214
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,670
But i desperately need your help.

215
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,033
How do you know who i am?

216
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,467
I'm from the future.

217
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:06,744
Look...

218
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:09,667
I understand that this
feels real for you.

219
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:11,701
But we can get you some help.

220
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,968
You're looking for chloe sullivan.

221
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,650
You're worried about her.

222
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,660
What do you know about chloe?

223
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,882
That she's changed.

224
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,894
She's been taken over by brainiac.

225
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:32,080
We'll find chloe, and we'll
figure out a way to stop him.

226
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,220
The only way to stop brainiac
now is to kill his host.

227
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,150
I need you to convince clark to do that.

228
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,507
That's why i came to you.
He won't listen to us.

229
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:45,834
I'd never ask clark to kill anyone.

230
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,867
Do you understand?

231
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:54,600
Ever since i was little,
i've read stories about you...

232
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,901
About the hardships you've overcome

233
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,567
And the incredible
things you'll go on to do.

234
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:05,064
You're part of the reason kal-El
becomes the hero we look up to.

235
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,762
Lana...

236
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,440
If brainiac survives...

237
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,192
Billions will die.

238
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,353
I came to you because you understand
sacrifice more than anyone.

239
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:28,499
You've sacrificed so much for clark.

240
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,491
Sacrificing my friend's
life isn't an option.

241
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:40,205
You still haven't told him
the reasons why you disappeared

242
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:43,233
And what you plan on doing next.

243
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:49,110
You're reading my thoughts.

244
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:53,001
If i know you...

245
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:56,821
You'll eventually realize
that taking chloe's life

246
00:18:56,941 --> 00:19:00,064
Is the only way to stop brainiac.

247
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:13,267
Cos, we should be trying to
catch up to kal-El right now.

248
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,133
Right now, i want to find out
more about this chloe sullivan

249
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,391
So we can track her down.

250
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:28,845
She has a lot of information
about superhumans.

251
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:32,068
Something called the isis foundation.

252
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:36,477
- The isis foundation?
- Yeah.

253
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,100
Lana lang founded that organization

254
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,534
To help people embrace their powers.

255
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,599
If chloe sullivan was
involved with them,

256
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:49,667
Maybe she was helping kal-El
to embrace his abilities.

257
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:52,901
Or maybe kal-El wanted chloe
to go under a different name

258
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:56,434
When he started flying...
you know, to protect her.

259
00:19:56,882 --> 00:20:00,941
Maybe chloe's death is what inspired
him to take flight in the first place.

260
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,634
Jor-El!!

261
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,701
Your father is gone.

262
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:26,622
And all the knowledge this fortress
ever held finally belongs to me.

263
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,282
Leave chloe alone.
You have what you want.

264
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:40,540
My hunger's never satisfied.

265
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:44,039
Knowledge is what fuels me.

266
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:50,133
And as savage as human beings are,

267
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:54,626
Their collective knowledge
is exceptionally rich.

268
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:57,300
Nothing about you is human.

269
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:59,200
And never will be.

270
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:04,734
After i've drained this planet
of all the human information,

271
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,624
Doomsday will annihilate what's left.

272
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,400
Doomsday.

273
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:24,043
It's a simple plan, actually.

274
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:27,901
Absorb and destroy.

275
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:30,834
You brought that thing here.

276
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Go on.

277
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,233
Kill me.

278
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,971
I knew you'd never harm
me in this human's skin.

279
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:57,267
Why do you think i chose her?

280
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,794
Great. The air here's worse
than the sulfur pit on tharr.

281
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:45,180
And they won't be replacing
carbon fuels for another 20 years.

282
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,609
These people... we need to protect them.

283
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:50,932
Without the humans and
their incredible spirit,

284
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:53,434
Kal-El would have never
become the hero he was.

285
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,901
The world we know would never exist.

286
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:59,714
Rokk, think about it...
everything we know about kal-El...

287
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,233
It's all through data
files and holovids.

288
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,601
It's so far in the past.

289
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,467
Maybe the person we've
always been looking up to

290
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,400
Is more legend than legion.

291
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:14,034
Look, he might not be everything
we thought he would be,

292
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:15,367
But he is no fraud.

293
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:19,090
Rokk, we have to stop brainiac...

294
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,830
With or without kal-El.

295
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,940
We're gonna have to kill
chloe sullivan ourselves.

296
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,511
Lana. That creature's
the least of our worries.

297
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:48,901
Brainiac is behind everything.

298
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:51,015
I know. And now he's taken over chloe.

299
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:53,534
I had a visitor. She seemed
to know a lot about all of us.

300
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,534
Imra?

301
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,998
I'm searching the global power grid
for power surges anywhere in the world.

302
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:00,300
Hopefully, that will
lead us to brainiac.

303
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,567
Clark...

304
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:04,034
That girl said the only
way to stop brainiac

305
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,001
Is to kill his host.

306
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,910
What if she's right?

307
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,870
Lana, i have always put my
loved ones before everything.

308
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:19,001
But this time, i'm
putting chloe's well-Being

309
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:21,701
Before the lives of billions of people.

310
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,901
I may have been gone awhile,

311
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:29,167
But the clark i know
would never doubt himself.

312
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,080
Lana... he would never waver.

313
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,014
He would insist that he
could save chloe's life

314
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:37,246
And the rest of the world.

315
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:10,767
Hey, matt, what's
going on? Are you okay?

316
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,346
A power surge.

317
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:34,233
It's showing a voltage spike
somewhere in downtown metropolis.

318
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,308
Can you pinpoint the address?

319
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:40,622
Looks like it's coming
from the daily planet.

320
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:43,238
Makes sense... it is
the hub of information.

321
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,592
Lana.

322
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:53,068
Lana, can you hear me?

323
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:14,732
Nice try, telepath.

324
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:21,334
Your sadism's historic
where i come from.

325
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,234
But so is your defeat.

326
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:29,400
History's about to get a rewrite.

327
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:37,521
- Nice sync-Up.
- For once.

328
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:41,576
Electromagnetism. That
pulse can crash any computer.

329
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:43,991
Now we need to pull
the plug. You okay, im?

330
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:47,018
I'm fine, aside from
a splitting headache.

331
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:53,726
I'm picking up
low-Level brain activity.

332
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,930
We don't have much time.

333
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:01,173
- Neither does the rest of the world.
- What's brainiac doing?

334
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:05,015
Using human brain-Wave entrainment.

335
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:10,083
He's downloading every last byte of
their knowledge, one mind at a time.

336
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,284
- I'll do it.
- No.

337
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:38,263
When i joined the legion, i pledged
an oath to do whatever it took.

338
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:42,181
And i'm gonna honor that...

339
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,854
For once.

340
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,652
It's okay, garth.

341
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,716
Give me the knife.

342
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:12,004
What are you doing?

343
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,390
We powered him down with
an electromagnetic pulse,

344
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,344
But he will be back online within
minutes. So we need to don't touch her.

345
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:20,867
Kal, whoever your friend
was, she's not there anymore.

346
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:29,734
- Did you power them down, too?
- No, brainiac can take credit for that.

347
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:32,334
Kal-El, we need to shut brainiac down,

348
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:36,125
- And for that, the host has to die.
- Does your legion have any principles?

349
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:38,200
You speak of a code,

350
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,367
But if it had anything to do with me,

351
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,257
Rule number one would
be do not kill... ever!

352
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:46,192
- Kal-El...
- If you ever believed in me...

353
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:48,795
And even if you don't now... help me.

354
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:51,277
There's a human being inside there.

355
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:54,508
We need to help her.

356
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:57,540
And together, i think we can.

357
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:00,288
Rokk...

358
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,597
Kal's right.

359
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,367
Chloe's there.

360
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,380
I can hear her.

361
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:28,300
What are we doing here?
We're running out of time.

362
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,068
Listen, if brainiac reboots,

363
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,867
I don't want him near
any computer networks.

364
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:37,655
- What do you want us to do?
- Work together... all of us.

365
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:40,192
I want to try to connect with chloe.

366
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,416
Imra, can you do that?

367
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,197
I'll try.

368
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:48,840
Between the two of you, i think
we can neutralize brainiac.

369
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,701
An electromagnetic
blast only lasts so long.

370
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:53,233
But he's a computer.

371
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:56,377
Whatever microscopic parts he's made
out of, they're probably metal, right?

372
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,040
I've never focused my
powers like this before,

373
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,632
But i can try to magnetically
extract the nanites.

374
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:03,362
I could short-Circuit
him with a static attack.

375
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:06,534
Get ready for a techno-Exorcism.

376
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,718
I've got her. Kal?

377
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:11,300
She's asking for you.

378
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:13,748
Chloe?

379
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:15,394
Chloe, i'm here.

380
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:21,670
Chloe, we're gonna try to get rid
of brainiac, okay? Just hang on.

381
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:28,667
Brainiac's fighting.
He's coming back online.

382
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,458
Rokk, now!

383
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,100
Come on, chloe. Hang in there.

384
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:52,055
Chloe?

385
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:56,267
Imra, can you hear anything?

386
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,786
- Chloe.
- I'm getting something.

387
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,100
Chloe. Hey.

388
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:10,468
Are you okay?

389
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:13,971
I'm fine.

390
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:18,439
I definitely feel a whole lot dumber.

391
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,591
It's nice to see the
kinder, gentler chloe.

392
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,767
nothing like having a binary bad

392
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,067
guy cleansed from your system
to put a spring back in your step.

393
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:02,595
But i'll feel even better once
i get to star city to see my husband.

394
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,622
I'm gonna relieve lois
of her nurse's duties.

395
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:07,486
It was nice of lois
to take care of jimmy.

396
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,218
Though, i think he'd rather have
his temperature taken by you.

397
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:13,347
Yeah. I'm just glad he's
okay. From what i hear,

398
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,588
He was lucky to make it
past that creature alive.

399
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,462
Whoever that destroyer was,
i haven't seen a sign of him since.

400
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:21,167
He was definitely linked
to brainiac, though.

401
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:25,567
Well, hopefully, he was powered
down along with brainiac.

402
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:30,634
So, how's your memory?

403
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,467
It's fine.

404
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,376
Up until "here comes the bride."
Then it's all a bit of a blur.

405
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,164
You don't remember
anything unusual about me?

406
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,201
Are we talking about your secret?

407
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:49,028
Clark, what in the world
would make me forget that?

408
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:53,234
Chloe, you've been through a lot lately.

409
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:56,001
It would take a lot more than brainiac

410
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,234
To wipe that from my memory.

411
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:06,025
Thanks for not giving up on me.

412
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,953
I'd never give up on
you, chloe. You know that.

413
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:15,788
I just hope that if it turned out
that there was no other choice,

414
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:18,133
You would choose to do the right thing.

415
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,433
What choice would that be?

416
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:27,103
To do what's best for the world...

417
00:34:27,223 --> 00:34:29,041
And not for me.

418
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,311
Know that i'd understand.

419
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:38,006
Well, as long as i'm around,
that's never gonna happen.

420
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,234
Oh, hi.

421
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:08,034
I was looking for clark.

422
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:11,234
The boys are out fixing the barn.

423
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:12,651
Thanks.

424
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:18,634
Imra, i understand
that you were only doing

425
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,067
What you thought was best.

426
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:25,096
We were willing to
take the easy way out.

427
00:35:25,814 --> 00:35:29,503
But kal-El... he never gave up.

428
00:35:30,957 --> 00:35:32,700
You know, it's...

429
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:35,334
It's true what history says about him.

430
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:38,094
He really does bring
out the best in people.

431
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:40,734
You're very lucky.

432
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,533
I probably shouldn't
be asking this, but...

433
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:49,368
You're curious about you and clark.

434
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:53,146
I couldn't help but wonder about us,

435
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,973
About where we go from here.

436
00:35:56,093 --> 00:35:59,209
Well, that's for you two
to discover yourselves.

437
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,964
But i will tell you this, lana...

438
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:06,440
You're remembered for a lot more

439
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,334
Than just your
relationship with kal-El.

440
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:12,934
You have a destiny all your own.

441
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:16,816
But don't worry.

442
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,234
Your secret's safe with me.

443
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:37,533
Holy sprock!

444
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,301
I've read about this.

445
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,734
You don't read. I told you about that.

446
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,834
It's one of the artifacts
they could never find...

447
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,496
The first baseball you ever hit.

448
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,967
It went clear across smallville.

449
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,214
You're right. My dad spent
hours walking the fields.

450
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,402
He finally found it on
the other side of town.

451
00:36:56,522 --> 00:36:59,563
Hey, do you think i could
keep this? Like, as a souvenir?

452
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:01,433
- Sure.
- Could you sign it?

453
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:05,282
- Garth, you're acting like a sub.
- What? It's for my sister.

454
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:16,967
Thanks.

455
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,280
Hey, guys.

456
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,334
Looks brand-New.

457
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:25,614
I guess it's time to go home.

458
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,189
You sure you want to take that with you?

459
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:30,934
I'm sure we'll be able to reprogram

460
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,535
What's left of brainiac
into something useful.

461
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:37,626
Let's hope brainiac 5 is
a little more friendly.

462
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:41,145
I'm sorry i doubted you, kal.

463
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,687
You did stop brainiac,
and without taking a life.

464
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:49,614
There's always a way, rokk. If
it ever seems like there isn't,

465
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,368
Just remember what we
accomplished here today.

466
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,667
Preserve life at all costs.

467
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,368
That will be the number-One
rule in legion code from now on.

468
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,334
It truly was an honor.

469
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:08,934
And if you ever want to
meet the rest of the legion,

470
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,001
Just put this ring on.

471
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:15,734
I've reprogrammed it
for time travel only.

472
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:18,248
No flights. Not yet.

473
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,218
So, looks like you're gonna have to
learn to fly without training wheels.

474
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:26,867
Just focus on 3009. We'll
be there to greet you.

475
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,500
Thanks.

476
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:33,201
But i think i'll stick closer
to my time zone for a while.

477
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:41,585
We do hope we see you again.

478
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:52,814
Kal...

479
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,500
Be careful in the days ahead.

480
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,268
Long live the legion.

481
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:39,106
I didn't think you
were much for jewelry.

482
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:41,500
I'm not.

483
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,467
It's a going-Away gift.

484
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,647
It's strange to meet people who
know exactly where you're going,

485
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,278
Exactly when you're gonna get there.

486
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:56,534
Well, they don't know everything.

487
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:59,921
I mean, if they did, chloe
wouldn't be alive right now.

488
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,301
And, unfortunately, they
didn't have what i had...

489
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:08,005
Human parents who taught me more
than just how to use my abilities.

490
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,433
They have a different role model.

491
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,204
With everything i've learned,

492
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:21,398
Everything i've been through,

493
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:24,001
Apparently, i'm just getting started.

494
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,314
According to the legion,

495
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:30,101
I will accomplish things so legendary,

496
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:32,616
I'll be known throughout the galaxy.

497
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:38,782
And you're not sure that you'll
be able to live up to that.

498
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:44,425
Clark...

499
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:48,062
There is no doubt in
my mind that you will.

500
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:54,147
Just do it on your
schedule... not theirs.

501
00:40:56,784 --> 00:41:00,459
Well, did they happen to mention
anything about your place in history?

502
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:02,325
A little.

503
00:41:03,268 --> 00:41:06,546
But the way i see it,
it doesn't really matter.

504
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:11,940
Our destiny is not written
in some book in the future.

505
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,791
We write it ourselves... every day.

506
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:23,547
And the question is...
what do we write next?

507
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:28,790
