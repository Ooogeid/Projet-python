1
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,685
I'm sure there were moments

2
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:44,981
when king arthur regretted
pulling the sword from the stone.

3
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,301
But he never gave up
his quest.

4
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:50,769
So why did you?

5
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:53,648
Or have you already
found the traveler

6
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,925
that you and the less fortunate
members of veritas were looking for?

7
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,298
The traveler.

8
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,461
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you've fallen

9
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,819
for patricia swann's
vid imagings?

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,494
I didn't imagine the deaths of virgil
swann or oliver queen's parents.

11
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:11,379
You think I can control the fate
of individuals? Oh, god.

12
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,809
You give me too much credit.

13
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,798
You certainly controlled mine.

14
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,699
It wasn't an accident
we were in smallville

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,620
the day of the meteor shower, was it?

16
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:25,042
The factory was just a cover.

17
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:28,261
You were really there
to meet this traveler

18
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,248
that veritas
wanted to protect.

19
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,753
I remember everything, dad.

20
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:34,496
those are the memories
of a small boy in shock

21
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:37,059
trying to cope with the trauma
of a meteor shower.

22
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,570
A trauma brought on
by my own father!

23
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,966
My life changed forever that day.

24
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,351
You sacrificed me
for the traveler.

25
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,559
why?

26
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:07,487
Who is it, dad?

27
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:10,832
Who is it?

28
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,317
Who is it?!

29
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:21,593
What if I told you now
that you are you traveler?

30
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,986
You're right. Your life
truly changed that day.

31
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:38,357
I told you in the helicopter that
you were destined for a great future.

32
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,502
That's why I've been so hard on you,
trained you so relentlessly.

33
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,814
Think, lex. Think.

34
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,962
You have survived
mortal injuries so many times.

35
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:48,883
How else can you explain it?

36
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:54,773
Because I was trained
never to accept defeat.

37
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,389
When I get my hands
on that box in zurich,

38
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:03,606
I have a feeling all
my questions will be answered.

39
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,133
I know how strong it is...

40
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,490
The attraction
of the dark power.

41
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,028
But it will destroy you.

42
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,013
I can't let you go down
that terrible path.

43
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:35,683
You must not open that box.

44
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,832
I can't open it...

45
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,975
Because
I need a second key.

46
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,727
Give it to me.

47
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:59,259
I've swept every possible place
you could have hidden it.

48
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,365
And I finally realized

49
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,694
there's only person
you would trust it with.

50
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,327
Yourself.

51
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:15,372
Lex, if you open that box,

52
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,475
if you get hold of that secret,

53
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,346
there will be no redemption for you.

54
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,459
No redemption. Ever.

55
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,058
I was raised
in your shadow.

56
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,732
Now you're gonna die in mine.

57
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,791
No one will even remember
your name.

58
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:58,336

62
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:47,117
i'm sorry, clark.

63
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,327
I traveled halfway
around the world via satellite.

64
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:51,563
There's no trace
of kara and brainiac.

65
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,634
I can't let lana sit
in that asylum in pain.

66
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,326
The only way to help her
is to find brainiac.

67
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,726
I've tapped every radar screen
known to mankind.

68
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,989
I mean, there's no bogey or blip
unaccounted for.

69
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,637
It's like they just flew off the map.

70
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,271
What about
brainiac's power sources?

71
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,660
Check the electrical grid
for any power surges again.

72
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,487
Stay focused, chloe.

73
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,117
Busy night out there.

74
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:25,985
What's going on?

75
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,618
Someone at luthorcorp just
jumped out their office window.

76
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,538
Rumor has it
it was lionel luthor.

77
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:38,433
Let's go.

78
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,962
I just talked to him.

79
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:24,181
You said you were  working down
the hall from your father tonight?

80
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,289
I heard him yell.

81
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,058
Then he was gone.

82
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,746
I know how difficult this
must be for you, Mr. Luthor,

83
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,866
but I need
a positive identification.

84
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,282
Whenever you're ready.

85
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:06,758
Yeah.

86
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,240
Thank you.

87
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,787
you killed him?

88
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,970
You killed dad?

89
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,873
Not that I want to
speak ill of the dead,

90
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:22,876
but lionel luthor left a lot
of damage in his wake, clark.

91
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,783
Remember he locked you
in a kryptonite box?

92
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,320
Lionel did a lot of things, chloe,
but he'd never commit suicide.

93
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:31,961
I don't know about that,
clark. He was beyond disturbed

94
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:34,966
- when he came to the daily planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.

95
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:37,676
He was pretty rattled
the last time I saw him, too.

96
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,329
He was desperate to give me
something... a locket.

97
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,244
What does a locket
have to do with

98
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,103
lionel luthor falling 40 stories
from his office window?

99
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,787
Mr. Luthor...

100
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:20,623
I just wanted to tell you how sorry
I was to hear about your father.

101
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,662
When I was a boy...

102
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,355
We took a trip together
to washington, d.c., just...

103
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:36,316
It was just the two of us.

104
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:43,101
I thought I was just tagging along
on another business trip, but...

105
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:48,122
... he wanted to show me
the air and space museum.

106
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,524
He knew I loved things
that could fly.

107
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:59,494
We were looking up
at the apollo 11 command module.

108
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,897
I couldn't believe
it went to the moon.

109
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,731
My father held my hand.

110
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:16,845
And he told me, "the right man
can make anything possible."

111
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,116
You have his locket.

112
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:49,342
How did you get him to...

113
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:57,507
Lionel was a cruel, sadistic man.

114
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,971
What are you suggesting?

115
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:06,395
No one will ever know, lex.

116
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,283
I promise you.

117
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,134
Where's the key?

118
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:32,657
It was empty.

119
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,844
My father must have given it
to someone.

120
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,867
I asked you
to keep an eye on him, gina.

121
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:49,923
Lionel stopped by the daily planet
before going to luthorcorp.

122
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,792
He was spotted
in the basement.

123
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:57,890
Get the helicopter ready.

124
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:01,236
Of course.

125
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,976
You killed dad
for a necklace?

126
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,287
You're not real.

127
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,476
He was mean sometimes,
but he loved us, lex.

128
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:34,744
Get out of my head.

129
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,770
Get out of my head!

130
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:39,426
You shouldn't
have done it!

131
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I had no choice!

132
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:18,653
"for kal-el,
in the event of my death."

133
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:50,513
in my lifetime,

134
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,602
I've known many famous
and powerful men...

135
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,732
Presidents, sultans, kings....

136
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:57,671
And I believed that I was
superior to them all.

137
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:59,817
But I've come to know
the truth, kal-el.

138
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:03,082
My greatest accomplishment
is that I have dedicated myself

139
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,627
to protecting your life
and serving you.

140
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,706
For that, I am grateful.
But if you are reading this,

141
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:12,487
it means that I cannot protect you
any longer from a terrible truth.

142
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,062
Two lockets exist... two.

143
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,430
Each one has its own key.

144
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,327
These keys, used together,

145
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:23,305
unlock the secret
of controlling you.

146
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,824
You must find the keys, kal-el,

147
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:30,046
or your destiny will fall
into the hands of another man.

148
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:32,958
You must save yourself.

149
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,576
What is it with the luthors?

150
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,591
I swear death follows that family
around like a stray puppy.

151
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,040
- Lois, you are not gonna believe this.
- You know, I wanted to search

152
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:59,248
luthorcorp tonight for evidence
that lex had patricia swann killed.

153
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:02,682
But you, no, genius that you are,
you wanted to stay here

154
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,575
and search through meaningless
memos in lex's office.

155
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:07,807
So while we were
over here atthe daily planet

156
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,087
photographing everything
but the bottled water,

157
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,657
the story of a lifetime was
happening right across the street.

158
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:15,926
Just take a look at the view.

159
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,181
One of tonight's shots
from lex's office.

160
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,054
What?

161
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,465
The schoolboy crush is sweet, jimmy,
but you need to adjust your focus

162
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:29,881
in more ways than one here.This is serious.
Bodies are literally falling out of the sky.

163
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,690
And we have the picture to prove it.

164
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,778
Lex's office
looks out over luthorcorp.

165
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,017
and?

166
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:42,048
It's lionel luthor
right before he died.

167
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,692
What? No way.

168
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,471
Creepy.

169
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,966
I can't believe
you got this, jimmy.

170
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:52,094
Well,
it's gonna get creepier.

171
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,268
There's someone else
in the room.

172
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,010
Look, lionel luthor
might have been pushed.

173
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:04,282
You think this blurry
blob of pixels is the killer? Come on.

174
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,273
Trust me. This has pulitzer
written all over it.

175
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:10,062
Yeah?

176
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,881
What are you waiting for?
Sharpen the shot.

177
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:16,171
Well, it's not that easy. My computer's
not powerful enough.

178
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,183
Hey, what about
that heavy-duty hardware

179
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,826
that lana has stashed
at the isis foundation?

180
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,530
Nice.

181
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,815
I can upload this bad boy to the
foundation's server right now.

182
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,631
And, you know,
if we're on lana's system,

183
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:32,377
we could probably use
chloe's mad skills with a cpu.

184
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,651
That is, if we can pry her
away from clark.

185
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,467
Chloe and I
share the same dna.

186
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:41,858
Trust me, jimmy... she is
gonna want to be in on this.

187
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:41,904
I'm so sorry
about your father.

188
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:45,147
Thank you, chloe.

189
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,718
He visited you
here tonight.

190
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,179
Yeah,
he really wasn't himself.

191
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,710
I fear,
in his deluded state of mind,

192
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,365
my father disposed of
some valuable family heirlooms.

193
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,331
Did he give you anything?

194
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,798
Other than the feeling that
something was definitely off?

195
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:06,959
no.

196
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
I mean, he was only here
for a few minutes.

197
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,713
And then, to be honest,
I got scared, so I...

198
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:12,503
Have you checked
your desk?

199
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:19,327
He didn't give me anything, lex.
I swear he just came here to talk.

200
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:34,005
This was my father's.

201
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,653
I've never seen it before.

202
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,820
Why were you hiding it
from me?

203
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:44,576
Lex, if I knew it was yours,
I wouldn't keep it from you.

204
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,927
Why would he even
give it to you?

205
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,494
Do you know
what this key is for?

206
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:54,280
Lex, lionel wasn't in
his right mind when he was here.

207
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:56,849
I don't know
why he left that.

208
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,282
You're fired.

209
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,747
Escort Miss sullivan
from the building.

210
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,358
Aren't you gonna give me a second
to clear out my private things?

211
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:17,578
Your personal items will be
boxed up and sent to your home.

212
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:21,421
Lex, your name may be on the building,
but that's my personal stuff. I have rights!

213
00:21:21,422 --> 00:21:25,583
If anything is missing, lex, I swear to god,
you won't hear the end of this!

214
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,468
I'll pack up
miss sullivan's belongings.

215
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,142
You go
back to the mansion.

216
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:36,960
Get some sleep.

217
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,125
We did it, lex.

218
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:24,484
Okay, that's it.
I'm leaving.

219
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:26,569
Lois, I want to start working on
this picture as much as you do,

220
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,755
but we haven't heard from chloe yet.
I really think that we should wait.

221
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:32,048
News waits for no one...
Not even chloe.

222
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:35,341
You texted her, you left her, like,
three voicemail messages at the apartment.

223
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,994
She's not helen keller. She'll get
the message and meet us there.

224
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:40,256
Well, it wouldn't kill us
to wait a few...

225
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:42,348
More minutes.

226
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:45,011
I agree with Mr. Olsen.

227
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:53,500
Why are we outside
of the kitchen?

228
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:55,331
It's a little late
for a snack, isn't it?

229
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,641
I've seen you around here before
haven't i? You work for lex.

230
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:00,609
Mr. Luthor has nothing
to do with this.

231
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,713
I'm here about
that photograph you took.

232
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:06,087
Which photograph would that be?
Because I take a whole lot of pictures.

233
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:08,208
Lionel luthor in his office
before he killed himself.

234
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:11,388
I want that photo destroyed. His
death was tragic enough

235
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,470
without it being sensationalized
by the media.

236
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:16,523
Well, you could have said that before
you broke out the heavy artillery.

237
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:19,431
Yeah, as soon as we saw it, I immediately
jumped on the delete button.

238
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,421
This is all a big,
big misunderstanding.

239
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:23,895
You're lying.
Ideleted it.

240
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:27,095
After I saw
your text message,

241
00:23:27,096 --> 00:23:29,951
I went into the mainframe and
pulled it from your hard drive.

242
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,671
But the transfer log shows
you uploaded the file

243
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,734
to a second server
with a cloaked i.p. Address.

244
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:36,703
I want to know
where you sent it.

245
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,966
- You shot me?!
- You weren't cooperating.

246
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:52,004
- How about a warning?
- Tell me or she dies. Where's the server?

247
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,792
It's the isis foundation. It's 3rd and
broadway. It's a 10-minute drive.

248
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,434
I'll come back for you
when I'm done.

249
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,496
You're really bleeding, lois.

250
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:34,527
I guess trying to take on
one of lex luthor's fembots

251
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:37,159
doesn't make me the smartest
icle in the freezer.

252
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:44,829
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

253
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:56,185
hey!
Is anyone out there?!

254
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,647
hey!

255
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,209
Is anyone in there?!

256
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:08,936
Help!
Can anyone hear me?!

257
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:20,864
Hey. Jimmy and lois here?

258
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:23,269
Not yet, but jimmy's message
said he already sent the files,

259
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,841
so I was about to get started.

260
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:29,685
I got a message that lionel
left for me in his vault.

261
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:32,469
Chloe, I think I know
why he was killed.

262
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:35,430
He was trying to
protect me.

263
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,591
Lionel did say
something terrible was coming.

264
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,216
There's something on earth
that can be used to control me.

265
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:45,175
Control you? As in "do my
bidding," like some sort of puppet?

266
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,293
I mean, what could possibly
pull your strings?

267
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:50,358
 I don't know. But whatever it is,
it takes two keys to unlock.

268
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,234
Clark, when I went back
tothe daily planet tonight,

269
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:57,544
there was a key in my desk.
Lionel left it there for you.

270
00:25:57,545 --> 00:26:00,392
- Where is it?
- Lex took it.

271
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,991
I was trying to hide it
from him, but then...

272
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,815
He fired me. Which is fine
because I wanted to

273
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,906
get out of
that black hole anyway, but...

274
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:10,489
Besides, we don't have time to
talk about my nine-to-five right now.

275
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,572
So you think that that mystery
man was after the locket?

276
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,772
I don't think our mystery man
is much of a mystery at all,

277
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:19,403
considering that lex went
to the daily planet tonight...

278
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:21,447
The same night
that his father died...

279
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,291
And fired you
over that key.

280
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:26,604
How long till we get an i.d.
On this picture?

281
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,994
Jimmy wasn't kidding when he said there
isn't a lot of photo in this photograph.

282
00:26:29,995 --> 00:26:32,523
I mean, it's gonna take me
at least a couple of hours.

283
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,192
Keep working on it.

284
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,030
My father just died,

285
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,765
and you're already
breaking and entering?

286
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,068
Lionel would never take
his own life.

287
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:21,813
I thought you'd at least try
to offer some words of comfort.

288
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:24,154
Get out.

289
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,398
I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,070
You can still be good, lex.

291
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:32,490
Tell clark what you did.
He's our friend.

292
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,666
I'm not gonna debate my father's
mental state with you.

293
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm grieving, clark. I think you know
what it's like to lose a father.

294
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:43,810
Don't bring my father
into this.

295
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:45,873
Why not?

296
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,390
Our fathers
were a lot alike...

297
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:53,882
Smart, strong-willed,
and both died prematurely.

298
00:27:56,895 --> 00:27:58,815
You know,
you're right, lex.

299
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,420
Lionel did die too soon.

300
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,298
I want to know the truth
about how he died.

301
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,151
The truth is...

302
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:09,092
Our dads were alike
in another way.

303
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,966
See, they both felt that you
were the kind of son

304
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,059
a father could be proud of.

305
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,237
He would have felt the same way
about you, lex,

306
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:22,428
if you would have tried.

307
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:25,065
What happened to you?

308
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:27,939
I did try, clark.

309
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:31,483
In fact,
when we first met,

310
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:34,018
you inspired me.

311
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:37,292
All I wanted
was to be your friend,

312
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,688
but you turned your back on me.

313
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:44,305
So you're the person
you are today because of me.

314
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,385
I tried to be
your friend, lex.

315
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:51,241
But all you care about
is power and control.

316
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:53,023
This is smallville!

317
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:57,382
Meteor freaks, alien ships,
cryptic symbols!

318
00:28:57,782 --> 00:28:59,901
These threats are real.

319
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:01,509
Someone had to
take control.

320
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,885
- Someone has to protect the world.
- Listen to yourself, lex.

321
00:29:05,073 --> 00:29:08,840
You're so caught up in your own
delusions, you've lost track of reality.

322
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,014
Have i?

323
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:15,182
Then let's talk about something
you can't deny.

324
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:20,660
After years of pleading with my
father to show me some compassion,

325
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:25,158
he turned to you
with open arms.

326
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,581
Now, what would a worldly
billionaire have in common

327
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:32,156
with a simple farm boy?

328
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:36,231
Maybe he just knew
he could trust me.

329
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:41,112
Of course.

330
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:44,396
Everyone can trust
clark kent.

331
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,438
You're the perfect son.

332
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:53,965
So... so why did jonathan kent
always seem so stressed?

333
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:59,171
I mean, was raising the perfect
son really that much work?

334
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:04,114
I wonder how much of a strain
it put on his heart.

335
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:09,158
Are you blaming me
for my father's death?

336
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,354
Are you?!

337
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:15,692
You're the guilty one, lex,
not me.

338
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:18,300
And this time, you're gonna
own up to what you've done.

339
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,649
I know you killed lionel.

340
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,261
- Who's delusional now?
- I have proof.

341
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,698
You really did it, lex.

342
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:45,056
Chloe, you in here?

343
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,671
Chloe, what happened?
You okay?

344
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,365
Somebody hit me.

345
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,694
Here.

346
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:55,006
They destroyed
the picture.

347
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,262
But you were right,
clark.

348
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,305
I saw the picture.
It was lex.

349
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,854
When I went to see lex,
I found lionel's locket.

350
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,297
But without that photograph,
we can't prove anything.

351
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:07,992
What about the key?

352
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,902
I x-rayed the entire mansion.
It's nowhere to be found.

353
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:13,677
What happened to jimmy and lois?
Where are they?

354
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:16,071
I don't know.
And I'm worried.

355
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:18,061
The last I heard, they were
leavingthe daily planet.

356
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,906
If whoever attacked me followed
the photo from there to here.

357
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:23,036
He may have stopped jimmy and
lois from leaving the building.

358
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:24,799
I got to go.

359
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,752
Clark, if lex has
both of those keys,

360
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:30,013
not only will he discover
your secret,

361
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,638
but he'll have total
and complete power over you.

362
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,409
Now, that's not
justyourworst nightmare...

363
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,517
It's everyone else's, too.

364
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,831
Be careful.

365
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:02,197
I've got an exclusive
for you.

366
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,069
When we get out of here...

367
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:13,167
... lois lane and jimmy olsen
are gonna be world-famous.

368
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:27,082
You know what, lois?

369
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,479
We really do make a good team,
you know?

370
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,101
Our name in lights. I can see it now.

371
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,470
It's gonna be great.

372
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:27,787
Hi, lex.
It's gina.

373
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,683
Please call me back.

374
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,030
I found who you've
been searching for.

375
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:34,604
I know who the traveler is.

376
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:40,822
After the funeral,
I plan on taking some time off.

377
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:43,167
Get the jet ready.

378
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,807
Zurich.

379
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:58,062
You can't run away, lex.

380
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:02,344
No matter where you go,
i'll always be there.

381
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:06,715
You can't get rid of me.

382
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,867
You need my help.

383
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,932
There's still good inside you.
I know it.

384
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,369
I don't want your help.

385
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,815
Don't go to zurich.

386
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,206
I'm going.

387
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:27,351
I have to.

388
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,451
Dad was right.

389
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:34,978
If you open the box,
it will destroy you.

390
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,510
It's all I have left.

391
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:40,738
It's not true.

392
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:46,810
You still have me.

393
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,442
no.

394
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,048
I'm done
listening to you.

395
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,801
You make me weak.

396
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,474
Long night.

397
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:06,927
It's good to see
the sun again.

398
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:11,148
It's too bad
lionel's not here to see it.

399
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,416
Lex closed the funeral
to any and all guests.

400
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:20,634
In other words,
lex is the only one invited.

401
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:29,072
Lionel deserves better.

402
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:33,816
At least we know how lionel
truly felt about you.

403
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:36,935
I mean, he thought of you
as his second son.

404
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:41,650
Another person who treated me like
a son and died because of it.

405
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:45,422
Jor-el died
getting me on that ship.

406
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:48,077
My dad died
of a heart attack

407
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:50,646
from the powers he took on
protecting me.

408
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,033
And now lionel's been murdered
for protecting my secret.

409
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:00,569
They did die for you,
clark.

410
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,974
But ultimately,
they died for all of us.

411
00:39:04,077 --> 00:39:06,656
There was a reason
those men were in your life.

412
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:09,899
Each of them added something
to the man that you are today.

413
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,893
How could lex have done it?

414
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:16,572
How does a son...

415
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:19,279
Murder his own father?

416
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:23,727
Total absence of love.

417
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,985
Some say that's
the definition of evil.

418
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:35,549
You have to get those keys
away from lex, clark,

419
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,955
before he kills anyone else.

420
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:42,795
He's not gonna have
the chance.

421
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:47,638
I won't let him.

422
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:59,230
