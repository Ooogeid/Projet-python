1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,700
A kryptonian.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,000
If anyone's gonna stop
this phantom, it's gonna be me.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,400
I took a little piece
of your dna,

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,200
And now i'm gonna take
your life.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,200
Do we have what we need?

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,200
It looks like
your fleet of fighters

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,300
Are about to get
their jet fuel.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,700
I had a run-In
with the last phantom.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,700
I have to leave
earth's atmosphere to heal.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm leaving lex.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,300
Do you really think
i could just let you walk away?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Lana!

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,300
Lana -- She's dead, son.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
I don't believe you.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,300
Why did you kill her?

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,700
I'm some kind of meteor freak,
aren't i?

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not going anywhere

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,600
Until you tell me what's
really going on at this dam.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,600
You can't die.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,200
You're under arrest
for the murder of lana luthor.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Chloe?

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
What the hell are you?

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,600
I'm you,
only a little more bizarre.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,500
<I>and now the season premier</i>
<i>of "smallville."</I>

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,900
Dad, how long
are we staying here?

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,700
Dad,
there's no fish here.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Son, this is the bes??

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,300
Hang on, chlo.
I'll get us out of here.

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,000
Those people.
I have to get back to the dam.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,500
Hey, clark.

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,400
You ever wonder what would
happen to all these humans

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,100
If you weren't here
to play savior?

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I know you do.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
You just never admit it.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
You don't know
anything about me.

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
No, clark.
I know everything about you.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,100
I didn't just borrow
your dna.

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I have all your memories,
all your thoughts,

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,600
Every last twisted one
of them.

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
When i'm living your life,

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,700
I won't make
those same mistakes.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,300
Hey, bud. Dad?

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Run!

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,600
Dad! Dad! Wake up!

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Dad! Dad, wake up!
Run! Dad!

46
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you all right,
buddy?

47
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,100
No!

48
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,000
Help me, please.

49
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Hey.

50
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
It's okay.

51
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Lionel?!

52
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Help!

53
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,000
Can anybody hear us?!

54
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,400
Is she dead?

55
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,000
No, honey.
She's not dead.

56
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,600
She's just...
a litt hurt.

57
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,700
Help!

58
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,800
Help!

59
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
How did you do --

60
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,400
The ceiling's unstable.
We're lucky it caved in.

61
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
Oh, let's not wait
to get lucky again.

62
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,300
Chloe?

63
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Chloe?

64
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,900
£¿£¿

65
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,700
Start an arterial line.
Inflate gases.

66
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,900
Prep for a chest tube now,
stat.

67
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,200
Lois.

68
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
You want to tell me
what happened out there?

69
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
It's gonna sound insane.
I don't know, clark.

70
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
Maybe i was unconscious
and dreaming.

71
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,400
Maybe you weren't.

72
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,100
The last thing i remember,

73
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,400
I was pulling an
eight-Inch knife out of my gut,

74
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,200
And there was
blood everywhere.

75
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I dialed chloe,
and i had this chill,

76
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
And my hands
started to tingle,

77
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And then
i must have passed out.

78
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,800
So someone stabbed you?

79
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,700
A guard -- Right here.

80
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
I know.

81
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,700
But there was this warm light
all around me.

82
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,000
And when i woke up,
the wound was healed

83
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,700
And chloe was lying
a few feet away, unconscious.

84
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,100
You said that lex

85
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,000
May have been doing
some experiments down there.

86
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
When i was out,

87
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
Maybe one of his men
did something to me...

88
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,900
And chloe.

89
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
That's it. I can't just
stand around here waiting.

90
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,300
I'm going to see
what lex did to her.

91
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,400
Lex?
Lex is dangerous.

92
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,900
I am not stupid,
smallville, okay?

93
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
I know that
he's not just gonna cough up

94
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
All his deep,
dark secrets.

95
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
But you heard the doctors.

96
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
None of chloe's vitals
were normal.

97
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,700
If someone at the mansion
knows what happened,

98
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,000
I will take my chances
with dr. Evil.

99
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,500
Maybe lana can help me
do some digging.

100
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,400
Lois, um...

101
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,200
...there's something
you should know.

102
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
If this is another
heart-To-Heart about lana,

103
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
I don't mean
to be insensitive,

104
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,900
But chloe is fighting
for her life,

105
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,500
And i am barely
keeping it together,

106
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,300
So one more ounce of emotion --
I might just lose it.

107
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,600
So make yourself useful
for once.

108
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,200
Just stay here and make sure
nothing happens to my coz, okay?

109
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Wo mr. Luthor,
the helicopter's waiting.

110
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,900
We should have you out of
u.S. Jurisdiction in two hours.

111
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,900
I was dead.

112
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
And there
was this light.

113
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
And an angel.

114
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Why would she save me...

115
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,800
After all i've done?

116
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,700
Lock down the perimeter.
Secure the stairwell.

117
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
The only thing gettingn
or out of here is that chopper.

118
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,500
Sir, you're wanted
for your wife's murder.

119
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,100
We need you to hurry.

120
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,500
Her soft skin...

121
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,500
And her hair...

122
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,300
That half-Awake smile

123
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,400
Wh she saw me come in
like...

124
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,300
She didn't know
if she was still in a dream.

125
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,000
She was the only thing
i was living for.

126
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,400
I'm sorry for your loss,
sir.

127
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,500
But right now
we need to get you airborne.

128
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,100
Police will be here
any minute.

129
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm well aware of that.

130
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm turning myself in.

131
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,300
Okay.

132
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,800
Whoa!

133
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Smallville,
you scared me.

134
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
Where have you
been hiding?

135
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,500
Uh, maybe where
i told you i'd be.

136
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,400
Although i got zilch.

137
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
Lex's men must have
cleared everything out

138
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Before the cops came.

139
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Hey!

140
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,200
Hey.

141
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,100
Why aren't
you watching chloe?

142
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,300
Man, how can a guy miss

143
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,800
What's been right
in front of him l this time?

144
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,100
Slow down there, tiger.

145
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,000
A little
personal-Space breach.

146
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,800
Come on,
i know you're looking for a guy

147
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Who doesn't
play by the rules.

148
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,000
And on what planet
is that you, smallville?

149
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,100
Whatever planet
you want me to take you to.

150
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Whoa, hey!

151
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
Maybe next time.

152
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,600
Wo where's my 1 mil
of epinephrine?

153
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm on it.

154
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,800
It's in.

155
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,100
She's not responding.

156
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,600
Check that monitor.
Those readings aren't possible.

157
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
We've got
atrial fibrillation.

158
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Charge the defib. I need
200 joules. Come on, chloe.

159
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,100
Pump it up.

160
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,500
New charge.

161
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,400
Clear.

162
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Come on, chloe.
Stay with me.

163
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Clear.

164
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Time of death 13:48.

165
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,800
Help!

166
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Somebody help me!

167
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,100
No.

168
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,200
Where's miss lane?

169
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
She just left.

170
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,400
Chloe's gonna be okay,
isn't she?

171
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,500
I can't share
any information with you

172
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,200
Until we've notified

173
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,500
Miss sullivan's
immediate family.

174
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,400
No.
No

175
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,500
That's a restricted area.

176
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,000
Get him out.

177
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,300
You can't be in here.

178
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,300
Where's
chloe sullivan?

179
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,500
She didn't make it.

180
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm sorry.

181
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Clark!
Somebody help me!

182
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Help!

183
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,800
It's okay.
It's okay.

184
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Clark, what happened?

185
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,100
Am i in a morgue?

186
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,100
Come on,
let's get you out --

187
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,700
Why am i in a morgue?

188
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,200
You're alive.
That's what matters now.

189
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
But i wasn't alive,
was i?

190
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Lois.

191
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,000
Lois is fine.

192
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm guessing you know that
better than anyone.

193
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,100
Turn around.

194
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,600
She showed me
her stab wound,

195
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,200
The one that
didn't leave a scratch.

196
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,100
I thought i had the market
on resurrections today.

197
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,400
May have done something to you
when you were out.

198
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
You want to tell me
what really haened?

199
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,300
Clark, as much as
i would love to contribute

200
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
To lois'
divine-Intervention story,

201
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,800
I was a little busy
being unconscious.

202
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,100
Clark, i don't have time
for 20 questions right now.

203
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,300
You just died
and came back to life.

204
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,200
Don't you think you should
have your blood pressure taken?

205
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,500
And get turned
into some sort of lab rat?

206
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,300
From one guinea pig to another,
i think i'll pass.

207
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,200
<I>clark means more to me</i>
<i>than you ever will.</I>

208
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,900
<I>that's the last time</i>
<i>you'll ever touch me.</I>

209
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,500
<I>do you really think</i>
<i>i could just let you walk away?</I>

210
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,700
<I>what are you going to do,</i>
<i>lex?</I>

211
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,200
<I>kill me?</I>

212
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,500
With evidence like that,

213
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,600
I doubt we'd be able to
get you bail.

214
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,500
I'm not worried about me.

215
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,400
I want an update on
the recovery efforts of the dam,

216
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,000
And more specifically i need
to know the status of model 503.

217
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,000
Most of the compromised units
have been recovered,

218
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,100
But we're still looking
for 503.

219
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,700
My father?

220
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,300
Still unaccounted for.

221
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,100
Sir, we have to find you
an alibi.

222
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
I wasn't miraculously saved

223
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
To run away from my demons,
keating.

224
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
I was brought back
to face them.

225
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
Be careful
what you wish for.

226
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,300
That was easy.
I loed for you at the mansion.

227
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,400
¶àóàµä»°we need
a little privacy.

228
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,200
The phantom.

229
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,900
You took clark's body.

230
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,800
Just a few cells.

231
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
Clark's still alive.
He's out there.

232
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
And you will
help me kill him.

233
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
I need meteor rocks --A lot

234
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,800
I'd never
help you kill clark.

235
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Lex, redemption
doesn't suit you.

236
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Why protect a clark kent
who hates u

237
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,600
When you can help the one
who wants to be your ally?

238
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,600
It's what
you've always wanted.

239
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,900
Isn't it, lex?

240
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Hey.

241
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,200
Oh, it's really hard
to concentrate

242
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,100
When lana was here one minute
and now she's just...

243
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,700
Ò²ëãã»óðóãµägone.

244
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,900
I'm so sorry, clark.

245
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,100
There's a lot more people
that could get hurt right now.

246
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,200
Yeah.

247
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,100
Denial should be our friend
right now.

248
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,900
Okay, so, this phantom-Clark
thing was inhabiting humans.

249
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,500
But when he touched you,
it just replicated. Why?

250
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,300
The phantom
needed a kryptonian body

251
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,500
In order to replicate
to become whole again.

252
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
Chloe, i don't know
how to stop him.

253
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
It's not like
i can just fly after him.

254
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,600
This guy can fly?

255
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,400
God, clark.
You got to get on that one.

256
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,500
Well, where's
our bizarro clark now?

257
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
I don't know.

258
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,900
But, chloe, before i hit him,
his face distorted,

259
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,100
Almost like he was hurt.

260
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
Which is
why he pushed pause

261
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,400
On his one-Man mission
to kill you.

262
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
But why would your doppelganger
weaken if you didn't?

263
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
It's like everything
affects him the opposite.

264
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,700
When lionel held
the meteor rock to him,

265
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,200
It almost
made him stronger.

266
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,900
Soaybe he went to find
more meteor rocks

267
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,700
So he could recharge
and finish the job he started.

268
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,600
Oliver's been tracking
all of lex's meteor shipments

269
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,300
For his 33.1 experiments.

270
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,500
Yeah, and it says here
in these records

271
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,400
That there were
several containers

272
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Transferred to reeves dam
just a couple weeks ago.

273
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Clark, if he gets there
before you do,

274
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,900
There's no way you can
go up against him alone.

275
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,600
I mean, how are you
gonna take this guy down?

276
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
I don't know, chloe.

277
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,900
But there is
someone who might.

278
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,100
When you left here,
you were hurt pretty badly.

279
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,700
How did you heal so fast?

280
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
I just had to leave
the earth's atmosphere.

281
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,300
But in my absence,
it appeared you did

282
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,400
Exactly what you were always
trying to prevent.

283
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,800
I unleashed
a carbon copy of myself...

284
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,500
Only without my --

285
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,600
Humanity.

286
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,700
What was
i supposed to do,

287
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,300
Let him kill
every host he inhabited?

288
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,800
That is one of the hardest
trials you will face, kal-El.

289
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
While your humanity
is your greatest strength,

290
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,100
It is also
your greatest vulnerability.

291
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,800
Well, it's part of who i am.

292
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,800
And it's who i want to be.

293
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm prd that i was raised
to care about people,

294
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,400
And i am not gonna apologize
for it anymore.

295
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,700
I know.

296
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
But this creature

297
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Was discarded at birth
as a poor imitation.

298
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,800
He was shown no compassion,
no conscience.

299
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
Therefore, he has none.

300
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,400
He knows only one thing --
Survival.

301
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,600
How do i stop someone

302
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,700
Who has all my powers
and none of my weaknesses?

303
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,000
By opening your eyes

304
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
To what you take for granted
every day.

305
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,500
Your faith in humans

306
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,700
Is not the only thing
that gives you strength.

307
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,200
Yellow sun.

308
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,600
That's why his face distorted
when he got into the light.

309
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,900
That may be the only way
to defeat him.

310
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,000
I can help,
but it's your battle.

311
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,800
The section of the dam
where the meteor rock is stored

312
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Shouldn't have been compromised.

313
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
The meteor rocks are in there.

314
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,800
I may have tracked you
around the globe,

315
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
But clearly you're not a native.

316
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Where are you from,

317
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
And why did you
only replicate clark?

318
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Now you got
a decision to make, lex.

319
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,600
What's more important --

320
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,500
Destroying me

321
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,900
Or solving the mystery
of clark kent?

322
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,700
Wrong decision.

323
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,400
You had the existence
i could only dream of,

324
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,400
Every pleasure  at your disposal,
and you wasted it.

325
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,700
You don't deserve this life, clark.

326
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,100
But i do.

327
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,500
Come on.

If i could get more
than two words out of you.

344
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,900
Thanks, chloe.

345
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,200
I think i'll take a rain check.

346
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,200
Yeah, well, i guess you deserve

347
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,100
A little bit of peace and quiet

348
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,300
After sending
the evil bobbsey twin

349
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,700
To the sunny side of mars.

350
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,400
Who's to say
he's any more evil than i am?

351
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,100
Unless you have
a second secret identity

352
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,600
That i don't know about,

353
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,400
Chloe, when i heard about lana,

354
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:45,700
I went to find lex.And i wasn't gonna
let him leave there alive.

355
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,100
The irony is
i think it was the first time

356
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,400
I ever really understood lex.

357
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,000
Loving someone is hard.
It's difficult.

358
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,700
But hate --

359
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,800
Hate is so...

360
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,400
Clean.

361
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,800
Maybe you need to feel this
right now.

362
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,500
I mean, anger is
a natural human emotion.

363
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,500
Well, that's just it.

364
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
'Cause when that phantom
was trying to kill me

365
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,700
And i was staring
into my own eyes,

366
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,600
I saw the monster that
i could become if i wanted to.

367
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,900
It was a reminder
that i am not human.

368
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,500
Tell that to every person
you've ever saved.

369
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,600
Clark, whether you want to e it or not,

370
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,900
You're one of us now.

371
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,000
And the fact that you're
from a galaxy far, far away .Just...

372
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,200
Adds character.

373
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
And you know i'm here,

374
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,300
No matter what side
of nature or nurture

375
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,700
Happens to be winning out.

376
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,600
It goes both ways,
chloe.

377
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,200
Whatever happened in that dam,

378
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,800
You ended up in a morgue.

379
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Yeah, it was nothing.

380
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm just saying
that when you're ready --

381
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,900
Thanks.

382
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Clark, there you are.

383
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
I forgive you.

384
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
For what?

385
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,400
Oh,don't make me relive it.

386
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
It was traumatizing enough
the first time around.

387
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,600
And by the way, you've got
some explaining to do there.

388
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,500
Lois, i'm sorry.

389
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,500
I know you are.

390
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,600
And i know you didn't mean it.

391
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,100
You were just in shock.

392
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,200
I heard about lana on the news.

393
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
Clark, i'm so sorry.

394
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,600
Look, all i can say is...

395
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,700
At first you don't know how
you'll ever make it through,

396
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,000
But somehow you do.

397
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,100
Just trust me on this one.

398
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,800
But if you ever
grab my ass again,

399
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,900
I will be taking your head
with me when i go.

400
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,500
Okay?

401
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,100
Your father would be proud.

402
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,200
He did everything he could to
prepare you.

403
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,700
But bravery
is not something you can learn.

404
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
How much bravery does it take
when you're getting pummeled?

405
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,700
Kal-El...

406
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,800
You could have ignored
all the phantoms

407
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
That escaped the phantom zone,

408
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,300
But you chose to take
responsibility and stop them,

409
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,500
Even one more powerful than you.

410
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,100
In a weird way,
he may have been right.

411
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Maybe i have allowed myself
to become weak,

412
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,700
Caring too much about everything,
everyone here.

413
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,900
You've learned a lot
from your time in smallville.

414
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,900
These people  have made you who you are.

415
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,700
They won't always be here.

416
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,300
Losing lana has made me realize

417
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,200
No matter how close i get,
someday they'll all be gone.

418
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,599
And all the time
that i've spent

419
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,900
Ignoring my destiny,

420
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Trying to be something i'll never be...

421
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,100
Human.
