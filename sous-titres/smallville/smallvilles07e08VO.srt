1
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:34,033
clark, coast city could not
have been more awesome.

2
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,967
i mean, who would have thought
that jimmy olsen

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,868
could shred those waves
with the best of them?

4
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,967
where's lana?

5
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:46,634
lana's in metropolis.
she's visiting her aunt nell.

6
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,401
clark, are you okay?

7
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:55,601
kara, do you ever
think about your parents

8
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:57,267
and it feels like
they're...

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,701
practically
calling out to you?

10
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,467
yeah.

11
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:06,234
i'm always thinking
about my family.

12
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:10,033
my mom and dad
will always be with me.

13
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,868
and so will lara.

14
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,234
i feel like i know something
about jor-el,

15
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,200
but my mother, she's always
been a mystery to me.

16
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,667
i have an idea.

17
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:24,467
i will tell you everything
you ever wanted to know

18
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,868
about the incredible lara-el...
in the morning.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,033
get some sleep, okay?

20
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,601
you must come to the fortress.

21
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,734
i need you, my son.

22
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:21,801
save me.

23
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:29,300
the crystal you carry
was made by zor-el.

24
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:31,834
it has no place
in this fortress.

25
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,900
my mother needs my help!

26
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,667
 it is far too late
for that, my son.

27
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:40,234
like all of krypton,
your mother is gone forever.

28
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,900
it's not true.

29
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,401
we need to help her.

30
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,834
 every experiment
my brother conducted

31
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:50,434
was motivated by power
and greed.

32
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:52,534
 hurry, my son.
i have little time left.

33
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,134
hurry!

34
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,900
do not allow human
emotions to cloud your judgment.

35
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,300
i won't turn my back
on my mother.

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,267
jor-el?

37
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,567
is that you?

38
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,734
i'm kal-el.

39
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,267
kal-el?

40
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,801
my son.

41
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:44,167
my beautiful boy.

42
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,000
you're a man.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,934
are you sure
you're okay?

44
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,301
oh, i'm more than okay.

45
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,733
i thought i would
never see you again.

46
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,434
it's...
it's like a dream.

47
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:16,668
a dream that started out
like a nightmare.

48
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,067
when i heard your voice,
you were in trouble.

49
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,501
the last i remember,

50
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:23,100
the world was exploding
around me.

51
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:25,800
you must have heard
my cries.

52
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,034
i knew your father
was working on a plan.

53
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,301
i didn't think he would send me
through a portal

54
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,067
forward in time.

55
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,401
there's something you should
know about how you got here.

56
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:40,501
aunt lara?

57
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,733
aunt lara!

58
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:45,900
oh, my god.

59
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,067
sweetheart.

60
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,334
i'm so happy
you managed to escape.

61
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:50,833
my father put me in a ship

62
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,201
and sent me away
in the nick of time.

63
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,634
you must have come
from my crystal.

64
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,167
crystal?

65
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,634
you've had it
all this time?

66
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,833
kal-el?

67
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,334
what crystal?

68
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,000
you didn't come through
a portal.

69
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:18,467
zor-el.

70
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,634
his technology...

71
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,767
it worked.

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,401
does that mean
my father's here, too?

73
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,067
if i emerged
from this crystal,

74
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,034
i am certain his replicant
is right behind me.

75
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,967
and he is dangerous.

76
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,568
it doesn't matter.

77
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,034
there's three of us
and one of him.

78
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,267
where's the face?

79
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,301
lasik, anyone?

80
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,733
it's right there.

81
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,467
that's not a face.

82
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,301
that's a blur.

83
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,601
a compromising page-one pic
of our philandering mayor

84
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,267
needs two eyes, a nose,
and a mouth.

85
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,134
that's what makes it
compromising.

86
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,767
who took these?

87
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,100
you're looking at her.

88
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:28,100
well, you're a woman
of many talents, lane,

89
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:30,867
but clearly photography isn't
one of them.

90
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:34,401
next time, take olsen.

91
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:37,767
forget the pictures, then.
the story speaks for itself.

92
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,700
"golden-boy mayor throws it all
away for raven-haired nanny."

93
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:49,267
what the hell
was he smoking?

94
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,833
he doesn't smoke.

95
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,334
some women just happen
to have the power

96
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:59,134
to turn a man's better judgment
upside down.

97
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,700
when did you learn
that nugget of wisdom?

98
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,100
not until very recently.

99
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,401
i want you
to admit something.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,467
your decision to hire me
was based on hedonism,

101
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,134
not journalism.

102
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:28,100
i knew it.

103
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:30,501
my job is a total fraud.

104
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:34,234
but i made the decision
to hire you

105
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:37,833
before i ever saw
your pretty mug.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,201
it was an
edge-of-your-seat expos?

107
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,434
on underground
cage fighting.

108
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,800
it was just a coincidence

109
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,833
that you happened to be
incredibly irresistible.

110
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,668
my dear kara.
you're all right.

111
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:40,967
i had a feeling i might
find you at this farm.

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,568
oh.

113
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:49,767
i know you tried to kill
your brother.

114
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
i've changed, kara.

115
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:57,000
i'm a better man
than i was.

116
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,568
after all you've done...

117
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,401
why should i believe you?

118
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,767
i've been given
a second chance,

119
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,301
in a new world.

120
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:15,201
i won't make
the same grave errors.

121
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:18,700
especially taking my family
for granted.

122
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,367
our planet is gone,
kara.

123
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,767
family is the only thing
we have left.

124
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:32,700
i want to start over
with you.

125
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,000
i want to be
your real father.

126
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,000
i still remember
the songs you sang me to sleep.

127
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:47,034
we can be together again.

128
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:52,067
with lara and kal-el,
as a family.

129
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:59,100
you just have to trust me.

130
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,301
i want to.

131
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,100
it's all right.

132
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:13,833
it's all right, my angel.

133
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:22,601
go to the fortress, kara.
wait for me.

134
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,234
jor-el's vessel.

135
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,434
you can't hide
your identity.

136
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,900
the crystals led me
right to you.

137
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,934
as his emissary,
you speak on jor-el's behalf.

138
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,434
lara and her son
will listen to you.

139
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:05,167
you must convince them
to heed my words.

140
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:09,733
your words
won't help you here, zor-el.

141
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,767
just as stubborn
as my brother.

142
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,201
soon you could be
just as dead.

143
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:26,301
if you value your life,
tell kal-el to trust his uncle.

144
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,100
you'll be better off
in the end.

145
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:31,334
kal-el is following
his own destiny.

146
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,534
i will do nothing
to stop his course.

147
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,001
let's get moving.

148
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,168
clark?

149
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,034
you need to lie still,
sir.

150
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,434
i have to speak to clark.

151
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,801
lionel, i'm here.

152
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,967
clark, he's looking
for a woman.

153
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,367
lara.
her name is lara.

154
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:19,767
hey, cuz.

155
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,400
what's the latest headline?

156
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,734
"busy writing story."

157
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,233
looks like someone woke up

158
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,134
on the right side of the bed
this morning.

159
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:29,901
at least i woke up
in my own bed.

160
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,667
what's that
supposed to mean?

161
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:33,767
i told you,
i was working on a story.

162
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,967
a story about a reporter
and her editor

163
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,034
getting an exclusive
between the sheets?

164
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:46,934
look, chloe.

165
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,901
i know you're impulsive,
but come on.

166
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,567
it wasn't an impulse.

167
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,734
it's not like i did a double
gainer blindly off a cliff.

168
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,367
but don't be surprised if you
pancake faster than you think.

169
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,168
of all the people
in the world,

170
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,267
you had to end up
with your editor.

171
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,333
so i strayed into the minefield
of misguided romance again.

172
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,801
but i swear to you,

173
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,667
it had nothing to do
with me getting the job

174
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:06,901
or getting ahead.

175
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,834
you don't believe me,
do you?

176
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,801
i do believe you.

177
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,600
the problem is,
will anyone else?

178
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:20,068
lois, gossip spreads
faster than a bad rash.

179
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:22,634
and sooner or later, people
are gonna start scratching,

180
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,333
assuming one thing --

181
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,534
lois lane jump-started
her career

182
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,134
on her managing editor's
diehard battery.

183
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,068
let them think
what they want.

184
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:35,267
i am not gonna let watercooler
chitchat splash cold water

185
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,834
on my previously nonexistent
personal life.

186
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,967
you're a big girl.
you can do whatever you want.

187
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,634
but if you want to be
taken seriously as a reporter,

188
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,600
you have to break this off
before it breaks your career.

189
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:01,333
kara's standing guard
at the farm.

190
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,634
you should be safe here
until i can locate zor-el.

191
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,367
i won't put you
in any more danger, kal-el.

192
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
let zor-el
come and find me.

193
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,534
i have nothing to fear.

194
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,901
look.

195
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:23,934
ever since i found out
i was adopted,

196
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:27,334
all i could do was imagine what
my real mother would be like.

197
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:30,842
and now you're here.

198
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,651
i don't want to lose you.

199
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:38,267
you already lost me.

200
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:41,684
your real mother died
with jor-el.

201
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,256
i'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

202
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:48,468
the kents
have raised you well.

203
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,934
lana,
what are you doing here?

204
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,800
kara told me
you were here.

205
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,834
she said you might need
my help.

206
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:05,101
what i think she wanted was
for you to meet my mother, lara.

207
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,434
hello, lana.

208
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,334
it's an honor to meet you.

209
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,000
lana,
now that you're here,

210
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:15,000
would you mind
staying with my mother?

211
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,033
i have to go
meet up with kara.

212
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,901
yeah.
of course.

213
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,334
i'll go make some tea.

214
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:27,567
kal-el, before you leave,
i want you to have this.

215
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,567
it was your father's.

216
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,100
his victory ring,

217
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:34,300
given when he first became
a member of the council.

218
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:36,801
it's kryptonian tradition to
pass it on to the firstborn son

219
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,534
when he comes of age.

220
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,634
kal-el?

221
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,300
are you okay?

222
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,133
yeah.

223
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,033
i think so.

224
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,934
of course.
jor-el's son.

225
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,667
with the same devious look
in your eye.

226
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:12,367
how did you find me?

227
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,734
kara told me.

228
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,834
she'd never do that.

229
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,868
your cousin only wants
what's best for the house of el.

230
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,968
she's waiting for us
at the fortress

231
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
so we can begin our mission
to save our race.

232
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,534
i saw what you did
to lionel.

233
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,267
you don't want to save
anyone.

234
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,000
the weak must be sacrificed
for the greater good.

235
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,868
something your father
could never understand.

236
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,868
he could have
saved krypton

237
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:37,000
if he wasn't such
a feebleminded pacifist.

238
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,601
jor-el did the best
that he could.

239
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,901
yes.

240
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,701
and where is he now?

241
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:44,067
what is he now?

242
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,434
a voice.

243
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:50,601
i'm here, in the flesh,
ready to serve my people.

244
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,434
come, kal-el.

245
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,467
let's go get your mother.

246
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,501
i'll never join you.

247
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,667
if i had raised you,

248
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:05,434
you would understand about duty
and responsibility.

249
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,367
my abilities.

250
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,234
what did he do to me?

251
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,234
father's ring might symbolize
victory back home,

252
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,434
but here it means defeat.

253
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:27,434
my mother gave me
this ring.

254
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,868
she had no way of knowing

255
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,701
the blue mineral
robs your powers.

256
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,667
i, on the other hand,
did a little research

257
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:36,667
in one of my earlier
walkabouts on earth.

258
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:39,167
i knew she'd slip it
on your finger,

259
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,434
like the good kryptonian
mother she is.

260
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:44,167
she was so proud
of your father.

261
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,534
it was a trick.

262
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,167
her voice.

263
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,567
all so i would activate
the crystal.

264
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,067
if kara failed
to activate the crystal,

265
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,367
i knew i could appeal
to your human tendencies.

266
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:00,701
kal-el, the blood
of the house of el

267
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:03,667
runs through your veins
just as it does mine.

268
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:07,934
as much as you want to deny it,
your destiny is to rule.

269
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:11,567
and we can do that together
as a family.

270
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:14,067
but you're not my family.

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
if you weren't lara's son,
i'd end your life right now.

272
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:32,033
i don't know much
about human behavior,

273
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,968
but you seem
ill at ease.

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,968
no.
no. not at all.

275
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:41,901
you're worried i'll discover
the darkness you're concealing.

276
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:46,634
don't let it overpower
the goodness.

277
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,467
you must fight it.

278
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,734
lara!

279
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,300
lana, leave.

280
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,334
you don't have to fear,
my love.

281
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,067
there's a new life waiting
for us up in the frozen north.

282
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,067
let her go.

283
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,734
lana?

284
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,534
oh, my god.

285
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:31,934
you said it was bad, but i
didn't expect "raging bull" bad.

286
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,668
the good news is
the e.r. doctor

287
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,401
said that lana has
no internal injuries.

288
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,568
she'll be fine.
yeah, but you're not.

289
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,467
blood and sweat on clark kent
are never a good combination.

290
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,934
hey, listen.
a little advice.

291
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,367
until your wedding day,

292
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,867
refrain from wearing rings
of any kind.

293
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,201
i was tricked, chloe.

294
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:47,067
it's all part
of zor-el's plan.

295
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,733
she was crying out for me.
i couldn't just ignore her.

296
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,067
trust me.

297
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,301
i get wanting to see
your long-lost mother.

298
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,568
but, clark, the sad reality
is your mom died.

299
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,733
you can't bring people
back from the dead.

300
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,733
she's not a zombie.
she's my mother.

301
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:01,234
i have to do everything
in my power to save her.

302
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:05,267
powers which at this point
are sorely lacking.

303
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,134
this is where having
a supercharged cousin

304
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,134
comes in handy.

305
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,501
kara betrayed me.

306
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:12,833
she's on her father's side.

307
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,267
wow.

308
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,867
i guess no matter how twisted
and evil zor-el is,

309
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,301
he's still her dad.

310
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,067
this is why i need you
to give me a ride.

311
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,833
i need to get this ring off my
finger and go to the fortress.

312
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,067
look, clark, my yaris
gets awesome mileage,

313
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,601
but i seriously doubt

314
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,434
it'll get us all the way
to the north pole.

315
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,733
how about to my barn?

316
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,434
i told you you'd come to
love this town.

317
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,334
there's no finer women
in the world.

318
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,568
but you've probably
figured that out by now.

319
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:44,067
actually, work is all
i've had time for.

320
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,367
wait a minute.
you're not dating anyone?

321
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:47,700
come on.

322
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,867
what about all the legions
of female reporters

323
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,367
scurrying under your feet?

324
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,434
what about them?

325
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:55,067
lois lane, for example.

326
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:01,201
sexy, smart.

327
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,668
all true.

328
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,434
doesn't mean
i have to date her.

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,401
was that not
poetry in motion?

330
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:12,833
so i guess you've been
researching an article

331
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,601
on her bra size lately?

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,467
word travels fast.

333
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,800
why not tell me?

334
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,334
i didn't think
it was relevant.

335
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,100
look, for all i care,

336
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,167
you could date every girl from
the copy room to the boardroom,

337
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,234
just not lois lane.

338
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:30,934
i don't get it.

339
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,367
what's wrong with lois lane,
other than her bad spelling?

340
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,833
the woman has
an insatiable curiosity.

341
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:39,568
it's only a matter of time
before she connects the dots.

342
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,334
the situation's
under control, lex.

343
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,000
i can easily keep her
out of our business.

344
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:58,201
i know you're careful,
but it's not worth the risk.

345
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:00,700
i'm sorry.
you have to end it.

346
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,301
look, i'm fully aware of
everything you've done for me,

347
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:08,900
but that doesn't give you
the right to control my life.

348
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,434
i beg to differ.

349
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:14,000
remember, if it weren't for me,
you'd be nothing.

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,833
kara! leave now!

351
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,367
no.
we're a family.

352
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:46,167
lara, it's our duty
to repopulate this planet.

353
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:49,167
the humans, they would
call us adam and eve.

354
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,601
but it won't happen because
i will never be with you.

355
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:54,568
even with your son's life
at stake?

356
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,668
no.

357
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,234
father, you can't possibly
think of hurting kal-el.

358
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,634
it may be a necessary step.

359
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:08,800
you have me.

360
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,067
i'm here.

361
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:19,234
don't lay a hand
on my son.

362
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,301
what are you doing?

363
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:36,067
pulling a dark curtain
over this yellow sun.

364
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,867
soon, the human detritus
will be killed off

365
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,234
and we can begin
our mission.

366
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:42,267
no.

367
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,334
you don't need to kill
anybody!

368
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,301
only kal-el can remove it.

369
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:50,000
kara, these human pests
will overrun us.

370
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,800
they need to be eradicated.

371
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:57,034
what will happen to my son?

372
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,733
i'll go and bring him into
the shelter of the fortress.

373
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:11,034
but you must promise not one
more word of protest, lara.

374
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,967
hey! hey! hey!

375
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,234
i know the blue "k" is seriously
cramping your style,

376
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:41,301
but you don't have to
grind your finger off!

377
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,434
i don't know what else to do.
it's unbreakable.

378
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:46,367
considering what all the other
flavors of kryptonite do,

379
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:48,434
being normal might not be
such a bad thing.

380
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,900
not when the people
i care about are in danger.

381
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:53,034
i have to get to the fortress
with or without my abilities.

382
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,967
don't forget your book.

383
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,134
what's happening?

384
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,967
we're looking at sunny skies
this weekend in the smallville,

385
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,067
granville,
and the surrounding areas.

386
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,501
now let's take a look
at our seven-day forecast.

387
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,534
there's no storm
on the horizon.

388
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,401
it's too dark for a storm.

389
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:21,568
it's an eclipse.

390
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,900
that's astronomically
impossible.

391
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:27,367
the next one
isn't for years.

392
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,634
zor-el.

393
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,968
oh, god.

394
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:38,334
if this is the apocalypse,
i'd better get my dogs.

395
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,834
i'm sure there's some really
boring scientific explanation.

396
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,233
the sun is not some birthday
candle you can just blow out.

397
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,601
okay, everybody.

398
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,233
time to stop gawking,
start reporting.

399
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,467
you're journalists,
not stargazers.

400
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,001
let's move!

401
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:54,300
lane, i knew you'd be burning
a hole in your retina.

402
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,334
i've been searching
all over the planet for you.

403
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,167
wow.
we have something in common.

404
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,901
i need to see you in my office
five minutes ago.

405
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,500
lois --
grant --

406
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:14,934
look, for a girl who's not
easily swept off her feet,

407
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,634
i am basically
blowing in the wind here.

408
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,334
well, for a guy
who usually

409
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:20,968
pulls the rip cord
after the first date,

410
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:23,334
i'm soaring
through the clouds.

411
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:26,001
lois, the truth is...

412
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:29,467
we need to stop
seeing each other.

413
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,367
let's face it.

414
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,667
this relationship
is inappropriate.

415
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:36,400
totally unprofessional.

416
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,567
i'm your editor.

417
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:39,367
i'm a reporter.

418
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,133
and if there's one thing
we can do,

419
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,701
it's separate our feelings
from our work.

420
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,100
are you kidding me?
easy as pie.

421
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,767
i never even liked you
that much.

422
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,167
so it's settled, then.

423
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,467
like it never happened.

424
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,534
aunt lara, i am so sorry.

425
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,567
this is all my fault.

426
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:27,634
i thought my father
had changed.

427
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,034
i had no idea
he wanted to hurt anyone.

428
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:32,001
of course you didn't,
sweetheart.

429
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,267
my husband always kept
a dagger at home.

430
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,100
he was a peaceful man,

431
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:43,467
but he believed in protecting
his family at all costs.

432
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,034
i won't let your father
hurt my son.

433
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,367
neither will i.

434
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,133
give it to me.
i'll do it.

435
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,133
no, kara.
this is not your fault.

436
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,367
it's about me.

437
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,867
i will defeat him.

438
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,068
but if you fail,
he'll kill you.

439
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,367
and you mean way too much
for me to ever let that happen.

440
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,500
zor-el: kara.

441
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,068
i've searched everywhere.

442
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,133
kal-el is nowhere
to be found.

443
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:11,367
you had no intention
of finding him.

444
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,400
it was a ruse,
just to placate me, wasn't it?

445
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,434
when are you going to
trust me, lara?

446
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,601
you would kill
your own father.

447
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:31,567
if it meant protecting earth
and every living creature on it.

448
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:35,200
i may not have been here long,
but i've learned one thing.

449
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,834
everything you've told me
about humans is wrong.

450
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:42,968
they are good people,
and they're worth defending.

451
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,400
then you leave me
no choice.

452
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,534
zor-el,
she's your daughter!

453
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:54,233
you have no idea
how much this pains me,

454
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:57,200
but my duty far surpasses
the bond of blood.

455
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:00,634
father, i can't breathe.

456
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:03,400
sorry, my angel.

457
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,667
kara, back away.

458
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,801
kara: clark.

459
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,634
clark!
the crystal!

460
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,600
you're the only one
that can stop the eclipse.

461
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,734
kal-el.

462
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:43,734
zor-el must be destroyed.

463
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:44,934
shatter the crystal.

464
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,068
no.

465
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:47,834
you could be destroyed
along with it.

466
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:49,801
as long as this ring remains
on your finger

467
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:52,333
and you have no power,
you cannot fulfill the destiny

468
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,400
your father and i
have envisioned for you.

469
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:55,901
it doesn't matter anymore.

470
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,467
what's important
is we're together.

471
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,834
i will always be with you.

472
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:00,934
destroy it.

473
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:07,867
no!

474
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:09,101
do it, kal-el.

475
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,101
save kara!

476
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:24,333
mom.

477
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:32,567
kara?

478
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,367
kara?!

479
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:40,467
kara?

480
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:23,101
i was gonna close early,
but...

481
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:25,734
you look like you could use
something warm.

482
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,034
where am i?

483
00:32:28,068 --> 00:32:29,701
detroit.

484
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,001
motor city.

485
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,333
michigan.

486
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,034
i know the street signs

487
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:45,867
can be awfully confusing
around here.

488
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:48,767
but i've never seen anyone
this lost.

489
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,701
what's your name, hon?

490
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:55,101
i don't know.

491
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,667
still no word?

492
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,567
none.

493
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,534
i don't think kara's
ever coming back.

494
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,934
all because of me.

495
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,333
i just...

496
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,467
i hope she's still alive
somewhere.

497
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,001
clark, you only wanted
to see your mother.

498
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:41,233
if anyone can understand that,
it's me.

499
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,934
there's no point
in beating yourself up.

500
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,267
why not, lana?

501
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,967
people i care about
got hurt.

502
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,801
and jor-el was right.

503
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:51,967
i shouldn't let emotions get
in the way of my common sense.

504
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:54,134
you grew up
on a planet of human beings.

505
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,634
it's okay to feel.

506
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,867
your emotions are a part
of who you are.

507
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:02,400
yeah. they're more dangerous
than kryptonite.

508
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:05,300
clark, you got to meet
your mother.

509
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:12,134
lana, i always thought that
if i ever did meet my mother,

510
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:16,467
she wouldn't live up to the idea
that i had of her.

511
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,168
she did.

512
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:22,400
clark, i will never be
as strong as your mother.

513
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:24,701
and after everything
i've done,

514
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:28,001
i'm not sure i'm as good
a person as you deserve.

515
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,267
lana, we all make mistakes.

516
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,801
i'm living proof of that.

517
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:37,134
it's how we come back
from the mistakes.

518
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:38,333
that's what matters.

519
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:42,534
how do you come back

520
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:47,034
when you feel like you're
at the point of no return?

521
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:50,567
lana, look at everything you
went through to help my mother.

522
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:56,168
you're not that far gone.

523
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:18,068
looks like someone's
on a lethal deadline.

524
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:20,168
i'm trying to get this
eclipse story in

525
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,001
before the sun sets
on my career.

526
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:23,901
what genius invented
the keyboard?

527
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:25,701
i mean, how hard
would it have been

528
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:27,233
to put the letters
in alphabetical order?

529
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,834
i hate to break it
to you, lo,

530
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,333
but i think
that the fact checkers

531
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,300
are gonna have a field day
with that one.

532
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,534
astronomers are saying that
it wasn't an actual eclipse.

533
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,801
it was just some huge,
circular shadow

534
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,934
that was caused
by water molecules.

535
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:41,867
not the astronomer
i talked to.

536
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:43,168
trust me, chlo.

537
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,001
i'm thinking
two-inch-tall headline.

538
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:47,500
lane, of all the days
on the calendar,

539
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:50,001
you pick this one
to shift into slo-mo.

540
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,934
just keep your pants on.
i'm almost done.

541
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,600
i need a couple more
milliseconds.

542
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,233
no.
you snooze, you lose.

543
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:56,600
larkin has already submitted
his piece.

544
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,400
i'm running it
as tomorrow's headline.

545
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,267
might want to try
a typing class.

546
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,068
give you a legp.

547
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,934
why do i get
the gnawing suspicion

548
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:08,267
that you two have had
the dear john conversation?

549
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,634
yes, we sure have.

550
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,767
and let me tell you,
those conversations

551
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:14,367
tend to quickly veer
into awkward territory.

552
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,333
you know, you think
he'd be man enough

553
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,667
to suck it up and treat you
like everyone else.

554
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:20,834
yeah.

555
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:23,001
you'd think so.

556
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:42,867
none of our satellites
were affected.

557
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,434
just a few lost megawatts
at our solar facilities.

558
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,200
proceed as planned.

559
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,467
you'll be happy to hear

560
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,068
lois lane and i
no longer share a toothbrush.

561
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:58,200
it's over.

562
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,434
look, i know
she's not the type

563
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,634
you want to catch
and release.

564
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,001
but trust me,
it's for your own good.

565
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,001
are these
for my own good?

566
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:15,200
what am i, lex?
your own private reality show?

567
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,400
i'm keeping an eye on you
so you don't get into trouble.

568
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:18,867
you're spying on me.

569
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,600
and it stops now.

570
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:22,667
i don't care how much
you've helped me.

571
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,534
i'm not a rat
in one of your labs.

572
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,600
you're right.

573
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,134
i'm sorry.

574
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,333
i went overboard.

575
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,600
we can't keep this secret
forever, lex.

576
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:39,534
i'm not afraid
of lionel luthor.

577
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,267
well, you should be.

578
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,467
no one can know.
do you understand?

579
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,200
if he found out the truth,
he could kill you.

580
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,934
i'm his son.

581
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:50,801
you're my brother.

582
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,300
how could he?

583
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,068
our dear old dad told the world
that you were dead

584
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:57,134
and then secretly gave you up
for adoption

585
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:59,168
all because his wife
was terminally ill.

586
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,667
he's not gonna want
that skeleton

587
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:02,134
stepping out
of the closet.

588
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:04,967
what he did
happened a long time ago.

589
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:07,068
in the public's eyes, there's
no statute of limitations

590
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:08,634
in leaving your infant
out in the cold.

591
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,034
trust me.

592
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:12,101
it's better the world knows you
as grant gabriel.

593
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:15,634
my name is julian luthor.

594
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:20,300
not outside of this room.

595
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:35,300
i know that her father was your
enemy, but kara is my cousin!

596
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,267
with everything
this fortress can do,

597
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,267
there must be some way
to track her down.

598
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,801
if you had heeded my warning,

599
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,333
this would have never happened.

600
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:49,101
kara's well-being is no longer
our concern, kal-el.

601
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:52,034
i know what you were like
on krypton!

602
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,967
what happened to dedicating
your life to help others?

603
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,068
that is not my mission.

604
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,767
i don't believe you.

605
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:04,701
 her disappearance
was not my doing.

606
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:08,267
zor-el is the only one
who knows that answer.

607
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,901
zor-el is gone.

608
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:13,034
jor-el: you have chosen
to defy me yet again, kal-el.

609
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:17,168
and you seem to lack the
capacity to learn your lesson.

610
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,267
i am sorry, my son.

611
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,934
this defiance cannot go
without consequence.
