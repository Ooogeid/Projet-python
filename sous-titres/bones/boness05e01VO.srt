1
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:07,147
First card she turns over
is literally your name.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,480
Are you gonna tell me
that this is a coincidence?

3
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:11,055
A one in 78 chance.

4
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:14,305
It was on top.
It's not really speaking to me.

5
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:17,475
I see a sick man in a hospital.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,660
He takes refuge in a dream life.

7
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:22,563
You're there in the dream,

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,254
and you're helping him
to create that dream life

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,029
by telling him a story.

10
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:29,362
You're both so happy in the story,

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,014
so happy, it's almost sad
when he awakens.

12
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:34,193
No offense to you and your psychic,

13
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,245
but I just got off a
flight from Guatemala.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,163
I want to go check in with Cam
and then shower and change.

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,193
The man whose life you saved

16
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:47,768
is really excited to see you again.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,528
I don't save lives.

18
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,550
They are already dead
when I get to them.

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,039
I'm pretty sure
you saved somebody's life.

20
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:56,847
A man with the heart of a lion.

21
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,474
Booth has a lion heart.

22
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>I do not like cats.</i>

23
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,271
That's consistent with the person
you were before your brain surgery.

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,774
I don't own a nightclub,
I'm not married to Bones,

25
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,527
you are not a singing bartender,
and I hate clowns.

26
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:10,945
Can I go back to work?

27
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,569
When our sense of reality
is challenged, you know,

28
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:17,718
really challenged, it can some take time
to regain our footing.

29
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:21,177
It's been six weeks since they put
my brain box through the blender, OK?

30
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:23,021
I am back, baby!

31
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:26,127
Special Agent Seeley Joseph Booth.

32
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:28,587
Have you been in touch
with Dr. Brennan

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,098
since you were released
from the hospital?

34
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,877
She's, you know, in Guatemala there,

35
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,181
digging up Aztecs.

36
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:45,604
Do you miss anything about the
alternative life you experienced

37
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,707
while in a coma?

38
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:56,024
The clothes.

39
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,910
I miss those clothes.
They were great clothes.

40
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:04,561
- I'm certifying you as fit for duty.
- I am fit for duty.

41
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:07,018
- That's what I'm saying.
- What I'm saying to you is

42
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,171
you don't have to certify me, pal,
because I told you, I'm back.

43
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:13,299
In fact, you had amnesia,
slurring of speech,

44
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,468
identity confusion, headaches,

45
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,641
irritability and double vision.
So, yeah, as a psychologist,

46
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,639
I do have to certify you for duty.

47
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,844
- Why... why are you arguing?
- I'm not arguing.

48
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,189
<i>This man was lost.</i>

49
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:31,099
You brought him the light
that showed him the way home.

50
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,938
Without it, he would've died.

51
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:34,375
Booth was in a coma.

52
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,447
She read him
the book that she was writing.

53
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,687
When he woke up,
he thought that they had

54
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,577
a whole different life together.
He thought that they were married.

55
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,080
- He thought that for days.
- You were joined at that time.

56
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,399
You're still joined.

57
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:48,876
Nothing either of you is saying
makes sense.

58
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,441
- Were you pregnant?
- What? No, of course not.

59
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,264
I mean, in your book.

60
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:00,047
No, I deleted the book.

61
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:04,517
I'm tired, I'm gonna go check in
at the office and then go home.

62
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,901
Nice to meet you, Ms. Harmonia.

63
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:12,525
Underneath the icy exterior
beats a very warm heart.

64
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:16,551
Her life is at
a very critical turning point...

65
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:18,739
... between great happiness...

66
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,388
That's Death.

67
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:32,452
- Would you care to hug?
- Why?

68
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,064
Okay. I'm good with that.

69
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,874
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

70
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:40,094
What did Booth do while I was gone,
solve boring, normal murders?

71
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,919
He hasn't been reinstated yet.

72
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:44,965
The doctors told me that he'd be fine
in a couple days, that's why I went.

73
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,738
Sweets is examining Booth today.
Fingers crossed.

74
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,646
I'm happy to see you, too.

75
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,446
I'm happy personally
and professionally.

76
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,443
You know, unsolved murders
have gone up 1,000% since you left.

77
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,558
I find that hard to believe.

78
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:00,683
Rough estimate.
Welcome back.

79
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,030
Thank you.

80
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,882
Look at that. I'm reinstated on the day
that you come home.

81
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,975
That's the weirdest
coinky-dink ever.

82
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,735
It's not even the weirdest
coinky-dink today.

83
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,665
If you were reinstated, why
are you dressed like a furniture mover?

84
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,479
Sweets, he just, cleared me,
so I came straight over to tell you.

85
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:35,965
- What took you so long to recover?
- Don't worry.

86
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,818
Nothing's wrong with me.
I'm 110%.

87
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,529
You know there's nothing
more than 100%, right?

88
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,368
Listen, guys,

89
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:48,704
there are a bunch of bodies
buried under the Teversham Fountain.

90
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,664
- How do you know that?
- Avalon told me.

91
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,042
- Who's Avalon?
- Avalon is Angela's psychic.

92
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,843
See, even superstitious Booth
doesn't believe in psychics.

93
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,506
That's interesting, because
she says that you two were linked

94
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,233
in a very profound
and spiritual manner.

95
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,431
Really?
Well, she also says that in

96
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,367
your weirdo alternate
shared life experience thing

97
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:12,519
that Brennan was pregnant.

98
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:17,232
It's odd that neither of you
mentioned that.

99
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,816
- Let's go check it out.
- What?

100
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,496
- No. Why?
- Six weeks, Bones.

101
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,706
I'm going stir-crazy here, OK?
Let me suit up.

102
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:36,043
- Can I at least take a shower?
- Yeah, I need to shave.

103
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,363
So, this ground-penetrating radar
can really see things?

104
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,474
Yeah, a lot clearer than a psychic.

105
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,859
- You're dressed very oddly.
- What do you mean?

106
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,300
This is regulation FBI.

107
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,830
What about the garish
socks and the gaudy tie?

108
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,242
What, you don't remember?

109
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,585
You resist regimentation
with these tiny symbols of rebellion.

110
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,315
I remember. I remember, okay?
Let me just...

111
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,447
re-acclimate myself
at my own speed here.

112
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,966
- What is that?
- Nothing.

113
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:03,529
`Cause there's nothing here,
there's no such thing as a psychic.

114
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,280
In my coma dream, you were pregnant.

115
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,792
Sweets said that your dream
was nothing more than

116
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,696
your comatose brain processing
what I read to you from my book.

117
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,145
Wait, the point is, how did the psychic
know that if she isn't psychic?

118
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:16,625
She was right.

119
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,169
What, about us being linked
in a very profound manner?

120
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,463
What do you see?

121
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,293
It's human remains.
Lots of human remains.

122
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,947
Bones - Season 05 Episode 01
"Harbingers In the Fountain"

123
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,157
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,
Dark_Chii

124
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,763
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

125
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,891
- What's that supposed to be?
- Bones says dead people.

126
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,820
At least eight, maybe more.

127
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,854
Is there any chance these are
very old remains of settlers

128
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,939
or Indians,
who should be left in peace?

129
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,848
Yes, except for that.

130
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,818
- What's that?
- A plastic disc.

131
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:28,072
She wants to start digging, I want to go
question the psychic who sent us here.

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,241
I did not hear "psychic."
I heard "anonymous source."

133
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:34,787
Just get Bones the warrant
that she needs so she can start digging.

134
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,801
You are keen to get back to work.

135
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,292
- Got something to prove, cherie?
- It is plausible that

136
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,295
Booth feels the urge to prove
he's no longer brain damaged.

137
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,924
You can start.
I'll get the warrant in ten minutes.

138
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:49,134
Yes, we're back.

139
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,303
You're the one who told me
never to look happy at a crime scene.

140
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:53,788
Right.

141
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:57,142
We'll look happy after we find out
who did this horrible crime

142
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,602
and get them behind bars.

143
00:07:58,949 --> 00:07:59,949
All right.

144
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:07,236
It's very hard for me
to explain my process.

145
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:11,031
Well, you're going to have
to do better than, "I'm a psychic."

146
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,230
You're the man that was
in the coma, aren't you?

147
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,502
Would you pick a card, please?

148
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,185
You're worried, you lost something.

149
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:44,128
Ms. Harmonia, I really don't need
a tarot card reading right now.

150
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,568
What I need to know is how you knew
that those people were buried

151
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,979
- under the Teversham Fountain.
- It's all in the cards, agent Booth.

152
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:54,021
You can't argue
with what's in the cards.

153
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:57,369
You never lost anything
in that coma, agent Booth.

154
00:08:57,749 --> 00:08:59,299
You gained something.

155
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,294
So the remains are all

156
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,215
in the soil beneath
the layer of gravel.

157
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,029
Ten years ago,
they renovated the fountain.

158
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:20,613
They raised it on hydraulic
lifts, sunk a series of shafts,

159
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,354
mucked out the clay,

160
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,175
laid down a layer of gravel,
and then poured cement over that.

161
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,108
So it's reasonable to assume
that the bodies were tossed down

162
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,809
the shaft before
the gravel was dumped.

163
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:34,865
I've got samples of the soil,
the gravel, scrapings from the cement

164
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,617
and this.

165
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,912
If we're lucky, it's something
the murderer left behind.

166
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,180
You might as well head back to the lab,
start analyzing your samples.

167
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,376
Oh, my God.

168
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,421
This is like climbing down
into a grave here.

169
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:51,841
Isn't this great?
Us back together again,

170
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,366
chasing criminals.

171
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:56,839
Yeah, pit full of mass murder victims,
what's not to love?

172
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,807
As soon as I get this skull free,
I'd like you to facial reconstruction.

173
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:04,728
Does the fact that Avalon was right
make you rethink her abilities?

174
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,439
Ange, I've met dozens of shamans

175
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,484
and medicine men,
so-called holy people over the years,

176
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,468
and I've never seen any hard evidence
that they were in touch

177
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:17,586
with any spirit world where
the laws of physics don't apply.

178
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:19,326
Until now.

179
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:23,330
This is actual evidence, Angela,

180
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,125
not some mumbo jumbo from
a deck of tarot cards.

181
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,316
First drink since
the brain operation?

182
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,740
And since,
you know, getting back to work.

183
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,537
I'm honored.
An auspicious occasion.

184
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:42,854
- So, what do you want?
- Just want to share a drink,

185
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:46,061
you know, with one of my closest
and dearest friends,

186
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:50,406
who, you know, I can trust
with, certain things.

187
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:52,359
- God.
- What?

188
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,104
There's lasting brain damage?

189
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,780
Something you haven't told anyone.
Are you hearing voices?

190
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,877
Seeley, if you're hearing voices,
that's really serious.

191
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,696
Nice. Thank you.
I know. I'm not hearing voices, OK?

192
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,121
Relax. I just...

193
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,733
Well, I did forget
that I wore goofy socks,

194
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,875
so we can do one for that?

195
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,683
The things that make you a great cop
have nothing to do with the socks.

196
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,466
What's really on your mind?

197
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,975
All right...

198
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,556
That, place that I went to,

199
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:25,100
you know, in my coma dream...

200
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,521
It was just, Bones and I,
it was so real...

201
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,481
You're in love with Dr. Brennan.

202
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,865
What I'm wondering is,
am I the same guy?

203
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:44,443
A sweet, kick-ass FBI murder-solver

204
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,718
with hard fists and a lion heart?

205
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,290
You're still him.

206
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,386
My advice, for what it's worth:

207
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,717
forget the bruised brain

208
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,633
and go with your lion heart.

209
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,440
Right. Right?
Yeah, and tell Bones how I feel.

210
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,197
Yes. Except,

211
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:08,603
be sure about your feelings,
because if you crack that shell

212
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,141
and you change your mind,
she'll die of loneliness

213
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,628
before she'll ever
trust anyone ever again.

214
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,331
Right.

215
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,111
- What time is it?
- It's early.

216
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,735
What are you doing here?

217
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:50,370
I... I hate this part of the case.
Where you're doing stuff, and I'm just

218
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:52,463
at home doing nothing.

219
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:55,375
- I have something for you to do.
- Right.

220
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:02,007
It's, the disc we saw on the GPR.

221
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:08,680
Look at that.
Minidisc. Definitely'90s technology.

222
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,235
- Don't you want to go to breakfast?
- No. I got to get this to my people

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,270
so they can find out the manufacturer
and get it to Angela so she can

224
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,230
get the information
she needs off this.

225
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,814
But no one is awake,
except for you and me.

226
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,656
Avalon Harmonia
is her professional psychic name.

227
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:30,423
Born Stephanie Susan Janes,
no criminal history,

228
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,370
no known criminal associations

229
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,374
and, in my professional
psychological opinion, not a nut bar.

230
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:40,691
Law abiding and sane does not
explain 12 buried skeletons.

231
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,089
She thinks that she's psychic.
She really does.

232
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,675
If she's not psychic,
then she's involved.

233
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,462
I don't believe in psychics.

234
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,429
Well, neither did I...
Do I.

235
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,474
- Present tense.
- She got to you, Sweets?

236
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,412
Okay, check it out.
My dad's watch goes missing

237
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,817
three months ago.
I have no idea where it is.

238
00:14:57,942 --> 00:15:01,111
She tells me it's in the pocket
of a jacket that I forgot I owned

239
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:03,652
at the unclaimed goods
at the FBI dry cleaner.

240
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,060
<i>Booth, how many fingers
am I holding up?</i>

241
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,630
Yeah, brain damage joke.
That's real funny.

242
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,065
- What do you got?
- What I got

243
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,874
are multiple degrees in botany,
geology and entomology

244
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,294
which allow me
to discern vital clues...

245
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,672
like this one.

246
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,791
What's that, a graph of
Russian wheat production in 1955?

247
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:31,443
It's a microspectrophotometry
scan indicating that the fabric

248
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:33,098
we found with the remains

249
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,393
<i>is lint-free,
static-resistant polyester.</i>

250
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,728
<i>It was designed for use
in fire-hazardous,</i>

251
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,564
oxygen-enriched atmospheres.

252
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,276
<i>U.S. Navy refers to them
as "poopie suits."</i>

253
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,778
- Right, you mean for submarine crews.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

254
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,974
Now, my conclusion is
we have uncovered

255
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:52,492
the anonymous grave of the crew
of the super secret stealth submarine

256
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,661
<i>Hawkfish, which disappeared
in the late'90s.</i>

257
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:57,664
<i>The U.S. Government denies
the very existence of the submarine...</i>

258
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,293
The way it works, Booth, is that

259
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm impatient and curt, while
you somehow keep the squints

260
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,124
motivated and productive.

261
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,572
- Right, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.
- Good.

262
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,071
Hiya, Bones.

263
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:13,054
There's no sign of any violence
on any of the skeletons we found,

264
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,599
- except for this one.
- Could the victims have drowned?

265
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,135
No, drowning leaves diatoms
in the marrow,

266
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,728
and Cam didn't find any. Why?

267
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,563
Hodgins said they are
a submarine crew.

268
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,167
Preliminary histological
analysis shows

269
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,026
that the victims were of both sexes,

270
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,233
encompassing Mongoloid,
Negroid and Caucasoid features

271
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:33,908
and ranging in age from
the late teens to the early 70s.

272
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,828
- That is a bullet hole.
- No.

273
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,500
Micro-fractures indicate
that the projectile

274
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,231
was moving much slower
than any bullet.

275
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,461
Also,

276
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,294
I can't feel any beveling
on the inside of the skull.

277
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:51,695
But there's very slight beveling
on the outside.

278
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,179
He was killed from the inside out.

279
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,350
Awkward.

280
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,717
Awkward, awkward.

281
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:58,767
Very awkward.

282
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,310
Angela, what is awkward?

283
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:03,451
The casing on the minidisc
that you found at the dig was cracked,

284
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,844
so there was damage.

285
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:06,585
I did what I could, but...

286
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,779
I got this one frame
off the corrupted file.

287
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,786
- What's so awkward?
- This isn't the awkward part yet.

288
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,524
"Glen Echo Car Rentals."

289
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,498
And a license plate.

290
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,632
I figure you have 12 bodies
and this vehicle

291
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,293
holds between 12 and 15, so...

292
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,715
Ange, you shouldn't
feel awkward about this.

293
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,923
You should be very proud
of your excellent work.

294
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:32,030
Now comes the awkward part.

295
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,421
- Why did you make a picture of her?
- This isn't Avalon.

296
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:46,294
This is a facial reconstruction
of the first fountain skull.

297
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,787
Hello, Seeley.

298
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,140
Hello, Temperance.

299
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,748
Nice to see you two together.

300
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,793
- This is an official visit.
- Am I in trouble?

301
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,004
We just need you to explain
a few things, that's all.

302
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:16,428
We're still trying to identify
the 12 victims under the fountain.

303
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,935
You see, Dr. Brennan and her people

304
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,141
were able to give
one of them a face,

305
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,621
and we need you to
take a look at it.

306
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,564
Oh, no.

307
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:46,374
This can't be.

308
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:48,835
It can't be what?

309
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,422
It's my sister.

310
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,763
- Avalon told me she had no family.
- Obviously telling the truth.

311
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,809
Her sister's been dead
for ten years.

312
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,395
You'd think it's something
that would show up in the cards.

313
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,853
Well, the future consists
of the culmination

314
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,775
of a near infinite number
of variables.

315
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,588
Turning over a card
has no effect at all.

316
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,807
Well, then how did the cards tell her
where her sister was buried?

317
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:19,456
Well, I'm certain that

318
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,667
her knowledge of
her sister's remains

319
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,510
did not stem
from pictures on a card.

320
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:25,614
You're gonna have
to work late tonight.

321
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:28,166
"Hello, Angela.
You look so pretty today."

322
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,084
Thank you.
And hello to you, too.

323
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,100
She's being you and herself.

324
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,834
I don't know why. What do you
want Angela to work on?

325
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,403
"Harbingers of a New Day."

326
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,593
Glen Echo Car Rentals,
it went out of business,

327
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,637
but we find this guy
who rented this van

328
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,014
to the Harbinger group,
the group never brought it back.

329
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,554
- Some kind of cult?
- Exactly. And you know what?

330
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,619
Angela is gonna get to work
on the Internet

331
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,073
and find out information.

332
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,212
Yes, sir. On my way. You bet.

333
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,107
All right, I'm sorry, Ange.

334
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:55,610
You know, it's...

335
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,986
first case back.

336
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,405
It's been a long day.

337
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,449
Maybe I got something to prove.

338
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,369
Sorry. You look...
you look beautiful.

339
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,960
Would you like me
to kiss you on the forehead, too?

340
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,169
Sure.

341
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,393
<i>... an ordered, clean society,</i>

342
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:25,974
<i>where we will no longer live
amongst the poisons</i>

343
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,846
<i>and pollutants of this modern world.</i>

344
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:30,930
I managed to get a partial
video file off the minidisc.

345
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:32,313
This...

346
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,524
is Tom Fargood.

347
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,742
<i>El Supremo.</i>

348
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:39,863
He sold places in a secret
undersea facility he called Harbinger.

349
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,489
So these people are all nuts?

350
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,543
Not at all.

351
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,897
People pay a fortune to visit the giant,
underwater hotel in Abu Dhabi.

352
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,162
Yeah, Dubai.
There's another one in Istanbul.

353
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,028
Key West, Sweden.

354
00:20:50,153 --> 00:20:52,292
So where did Fargood
locate his new Atlantis?

355
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,087
- A secret site in French Polynesia.
- Buried under a fountain...

356
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:58,631
it's a bit of a come-down
from Bora-Bora.

357
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,052
I count 14 people in this video.

358
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,052
We dug out 12
from under the fountain.

359
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:04,547
Look at this.

360
00:21:10,742 --> 00:21:12,812
- Is that Avalon?
- No...

361
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,439
that's her sister.

362
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,441
- How do you know?
- Because...

363
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,641
... that is Avalon.

364
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,075
Look like they were pretty close.

365
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,167
Her sister ended up in
a mass grave that she led us to.

366
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,122
Not sure that adds up
to "pretty close."

367
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:39,923
It was my idea to join Harbingers.

368
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:44,020
It cost every cent my
sister Jenny and I had

369
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,970
from my parents' insurance.

370
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,557
- How much did Fargood get from you?
- Almost a million dollars.

371
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,851
What motivated you
to join Harbinger?

372
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,811
Jenny suffered from MCS.

373
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,605
Multiple chemical sensitivity.

374
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,357
Allergic to the whole world?

375
00:21:57,715 --> 00:22:00,568
Fargood put these
gold seals on our diplomas

376
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,071
whenever we passed
part of his training.

377
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:07,158
This day was how to use
a speargun to hunt fish.

378
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,369
Fascinating.
I need to know how you knew

379
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,454
where your sister's body got dumped.

380
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,596
I think you're hiding something.
It rankles me. I'm rankled.

381
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:19,457
I suppose this
whole time you thought

382
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,464
your sister was living
in a Yellow Submarine?

383
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,841
The Harbinger's facility, yeah.

384
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,094
Why would she go
and leave you behind?

385
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:29,472
You did something that got
you expelled, didn't you?

386
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:30,827
What was it?

387
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:34,102
I went to an outside doctor
for my headaches.

388
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,372
It wasn't allowed.

389
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,439
We're gonna need a list
of all these people's names.

390
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,150
And the name of
the Harbinger doctor.

391
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,821
There never was any
underwater facility, was there?

392
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:48,836
He just killed everybody
for their money.

393
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:50,927
My sister...

394
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,299
was killed for money.

395
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,465
I'm Dr. Leacock.

396
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,684
As you can see,
I'm a little pressed for time.

397
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:08,428
We're here about Tom Fargood

398
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,513
and the Harbingers of a New Day.

399
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,099
- Okay, he knows them.
- Would you like to come with me?

400
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,851
Fargood wanted me to be the physician
in his underwater utopia.

401
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:18,946
I declined.

402
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:20,930
Why,
because you thought it didn't exist?

403
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:22,614
No, I believed it existed.

404
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,611
But the idea of spending
the rest of my life underwater

405
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:29,302
babysitting a bunch of people
who are allergic to the 20th century?

406
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:31,129
I'm more useful here.

407
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:34,594
So, they all suffered from MCS?

408
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,859
Yeah, pesticides, power lines,

409
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,459
incinerators, gas stations,
fresh paint,

410
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,519
even perfume made them sick.

411
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:44,495
These people are canaries in a coal mine
when it comes to pollutants.

412
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,720
I always thought they'd head down there,
move into some renovated

413
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,700
Russian submarine, then come up and,

414
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,597
you know,
live happily in grass huts on a motu.

415
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:53,946
Was I wrong?

416
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,199
Maybe you've heard of
the 12 human skeletons

417
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:58,311
that were found under
the Teversham Fountata.

418
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,896
Oh, my God, are you serious?

419
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,829
If you still have
the medical records,

420
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:04,192
it would be helpful in positively
identifying the victims.

421
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,152
Of course.
How...

422
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,279
Dr. Brennan is
a forensic anthropologist.

423
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,490
She's still trying to figure
out the cause of death.

424
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,208
If they had MCS,

425
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,577
it should show up fairly
obviously in their bones.

426
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:15,912
Do you have a warrant?

427
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,253
- Do we need one?
- This is a state-funded clinic.

428
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,752
I have to abide
by the letter of the law.

429
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,243
- I'm sorry.
- Right.

430
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:25,882
We'll be back.

431
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:30,426
Can I ask... how you connected me
to the group?

432
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,512
You see, we have our own rules.

433
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:36,983
Dr. Leacock was right
to require a warrant.

434
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,858
Right, and I was right to tell him
that we have rules too, right?

435
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,254
Yeah, you know what?

436
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,577
- I'll have it for you in the morning.
- Great.

437
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,302
Thanks, Caroline. You're the best.

438
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,152
Don't touch the bobblehead!

439
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,269
I'm working, everything's great.

440
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:55,053
Look at me, I'm fine,
my brain's feeling good, so bye.

441
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:58,121
I've been informed that your brain still
thinks it's in love with Dr. Brennan.

442
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:01,457
Great, Cam ratted me out.

443
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,129
No, I found out through Avalon.

444
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,863
- You told Cam?
- Great.

445
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:07,638
She finds your watch so now
you believe everything that she says?

446
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:09,048
Okay, you just admitted

447
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,509
that you told Cam
you're in love with Dr. Brennan.

448
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,555
You know what you're looking at?

449
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,182
I'm pretty sure you haven't been
this close to one in a long time.

450
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,601
- It's a PET scan of your brain.
- Then I was wrong.

451
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,924
This is called
the ventral tegmental area.

452
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,606
This is the dorsal caudate body.

453
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,940
Now, these two areas

454
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:29,318
have been proven
to be linked to romantic love

455
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,001
and sexual arousal.

456
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,030
If this is your version
of dirty pictures,

457
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,115
it's really not working for me
right now.

458
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,242
This...

459
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,494
this scan was taken
before your operation.

460
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,757
The green and blue colors
indicate very low activity.

461
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:43,624
Same scan while you
were in the coma.

462
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,459
Just lit up like the 4th of July.

463
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,546
You were dreaming of being in love.
Of being married, right?

464
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:51,212
Same scan...

465
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,342
three days ago.

466
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,048
Before your operation,
you were not in love.

467
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:58,582
After your operation, you were.

468
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,108
Conclusion: your feelings
are not real and will...

469
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:03,603
fade away,

470
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:06,197
like every other symptom
of your coma.

471
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:08,232
Now, I think you and I both know

472
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:10,443
that Dr. Brennan's hyperrationality

473
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,946
is really just a cover for a very
vulnerable and sensitive core.

474
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,407
Great, so we're talking
about Bones' brain, too, here?

475
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:19,994
So, if you breach those defenses

476
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:22,361
and it turns out
you don't really love her...

477
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:26,116
I left you hard copies.

478
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:31,212
Based on the Harbinger video,

479
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:33,393
Avalon's names,
and Dr. Brennan's analysis,

480
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:35,718
this is most likely Louis Lampcov.

481
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,678
The man with the hole in his skull.

482
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,680
The only victim we know
died violently.

483
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,934
My 3-D imaging suggests
that a shaft shot

484
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:44,590
from a speargun

485
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:46,991
through the soft palate

486
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,257
would've caused the wound.

487
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,253
I know how everybody else died.

488
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,529
Not Mr. Hole-in-the-Skull,
but the others.

489
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,346
That's the crystallized calcium
oxalate you found in the soil.

490
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:00,660
Right, minute amounts in the soil layer
beneath each and every body.

491
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,847
Is it poisonous?

492
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:03,963
No but we had
to ask ourselves what processes

493
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,040
might result in crystalline
calcium oxalate.

494
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,043
- Liver or kidneys.
- Kidney would do that to plain oxalate

495
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,921
- which is derived from glycolate.
- Glycolate's poisonous.

496
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,456
Glycolate is a conversion
of glycoaldehyde

497
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:18,135
via the aldehyde dehydrogenase
in the liver.

498
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,763
A poison that isn't a poison
until it's metabolized?

499
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,474
- Ethylene glycol.
- That's antifreeze.

500
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,985
Sweet to the taste,

501
00:27:25,275 --> 00:27:26,689
easily disguised,

502
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,062
administered over time

503
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,481
which gives the kidneys
time to crystallize the stuff.

504
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,857
Virtually untraceable.

505
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,777
Unless some brilliant bug
and slime wonk finds it in the soil.

506
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:36,684
And that, ladies,

507
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:39,657
that is why
they call me King of the Lab.

508
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,536
- Nobody does that but you.
- The early symptoms of ethylene glycol

509
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,831
poisoning:
fatigue, nausea, headache.

510
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,083
Indistinguishable from MCS.

511
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,896
Dr. Brennan's gonna want to confer
with that Harbinger doctor.

512
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,089
Is that true about
the King of the Lab?

513
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,279
That only you care?
Yeah.

514
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,661
<i>I always thought Jenny</i>
<i>was alive and happy somewhere.</i>

515
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:14,441
Some psychic I am.

516
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,736
I don't know
if you're psychic or not.

517
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,322
Then why would I send you
to the fountain in the first place?

518
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:21,574
Remorse.

519
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:33,854
Neurosurgeons are telling me
right here

520
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:37,078
that this part
of my brain shows love,

521
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,296
and this...

522
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:41,733
What?

523
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,554
Let the neurosurgeons
have your brain.

524
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,295
They know about your brain,

525
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,185
they don't know jack
about your heart.

526
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:51,436
Here.

527
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:57,360
- Cut the deck.
- Come on, what is this?

528
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:58,778
Cut the cards.

529
00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:01,189
All right, fine, I'll cut the deck.

530
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:09,436
She's in terrible danger.
You gotta go to her now.

531
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:12,791
I'm still a cop. I know when
someone's looking to escape.

532
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,810
So chain me to the railing.

533
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:18,089
Do what you gotta do,
but you better go to her now.

534
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:20,257
Go to her now.

535
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,842
Go to her right now.

536
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,552
Go to her now. Now!

537
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:26,408
Go right now!

538
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:45,186
Hello?

539
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,012
Dr. Leacock, it's
Dr. Brennan with the FBI.

540
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:52,827
<i>Dr. Brennan,
come on back to my office.</i>

541
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,572
<i>Lock the door behind you, please.
This isn't the best neighborhood.</i>

542
00:29:56,697 --> 00:30:00,505
There's been an interesting development
in the Harbinger case.

543
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,591
It appears that
the victims were poisoned.

544
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,219
Is there any chance

545
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:08,681
that what appeared to you to be MCS
was actually a result...

546
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,236
He's shredding the Harbinger files.

547
00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:54,194
You all right?

548
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,116
- You okay?
- I'm fine, I'm okay.

549
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:58,305
- Your arm...
- Oh, God.

550
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,875
No, don't pull it out.
Don't touch that!

551
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,223
Easy, I gotcha.

552
00:31:02,348 --> 00:31:04,413
- He tried to kill me.
- All right.

553
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:05,862
- Thank you.
- Easy.

554
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,007
- The ambulance is on the way, okay?
- Keep pressure on the wound.

555
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:11,289
I got it.
Just relax.

556
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:15,057
Just trust me, all right?
I'll take care of you. I got you.

557
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:18,375
I'll take care of you, I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

558
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,574
That's a lot of blood.

559
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:33,432
I'm fine.
This is Bones'blood.

560
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:36,345
- That's supposed to be good?
- She's fine.

561
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,979
They fixed her up and sent her home.

562
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:42,996
- I should've been there for her.
- You were there.

563
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,610
You killed the bad guy dead.

564
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,110
I know you hate that, but it always
makes me a little glad.

565
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:50,448
Does that make me a bad person?

566
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,867
I guess that closes the case.

567
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,831
None of the remains have been
identified as Fargood.

568
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,861
You think the bad doctor
was working for Fargood?

569
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:05,083
Used to be that my hunches were
good enough to keep us working a case.

570
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,590
Cheri, they still are.

571
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,735
That means our little psychic
friend is still a suspect.

572
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,512
And change your shirt.

573
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,268
Hello?

574
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,007
Ms. Harmonia?

575
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:26,678
<i>I'm down here.</i>

576
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,881
- How are you feeling?
- They gave me medication,

577
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,954
so I feel how I imagine

578
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,760
people of average intelligence
feel all the time.

579
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:55,801
I came here
to see if you'd run away.

580
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:59,447
I'm here looking for clues.

581
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:03,057
- Something I might have missed.
- What, in your cards?

582
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,482
Because that is a waste of time.

583
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,901
You say that after I sent
Agent Booth to save your life.

584
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,051
You knew where
the bodies were buried.

585
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:13,576
You knew Dr. Leacock
would attack me.

586
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,957
You were an abandoned child.

587
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:27,478
The world scares you

588
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,882
so you wrap it up neatly

589
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,469
in bonds of reason,
education and proof.

590
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:37,180
All riddles are solvable to you.
Except for one.

591
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,184
Yes. The riddle of how you knew
where your sister was buried.

592
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:43,929
The riddle you can't solve is how

593
00:33:44,682 --> 00:33:46,106
somebody could love you.

594
00:33:47,673 --> 00:33:50,273
Well, I'm beautiful
and very intelligent.

595
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:53,587
The answer to the question

596
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:56,331
that you're afraid
to say out loud is...

597
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:58,661
yes.

598
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:01,664
He knows the truth of you.

599
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:04,654
And he's dazzled by that truth.

600
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:14,635
I'm pulling up Web sites
containing the words "harbinger,"

601
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,639
"utopia," "undersea" and "MCS"
and running them through

602
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,807
my facial recognition program.

603
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,413
Fargood's arrogant.

604
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,308
He'll think he changed
his modus operandi,

605
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,271
but it'll only be superficially.

606
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,981
What, so you think these
keywords won't work?

607
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,432
No, not specifically.

608
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,246
By the time we finish a more
general search, you'll have to shave.

609
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:37,633
Why is facial hair the marker
of an adult male?

610
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:39,558
Why not height?
I'm tall.

611
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:41,770
Right, keywords.

612
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:45,581
Fargood targeted a group of people
who were sick of the world, literally,

613
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:49,043
and promised them a new life, right?
A life without suffering.

614
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,248
Sick of the world, of course.

615
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,151
- You know who you're referring to?
- People who are in pain,

616
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:57,093
who lost hope, who are
sunk in existential despair.

617
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,101
That's not literal enough, Sweets.

618
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:02,851
You're talking about old people
who have nobody else to turn to.

619
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,311
Angela's right.

620
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:11,580
The bone structure
is a very close match.

621
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:15,550
We're trying to figure when you changed
your name from Fargood to Gallo.

622
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:18,281
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

623
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,535
You're selling shares in a very
exclusive retirement community.

624
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:25,164
Very sound investment in your future.
I recommend you buy.

625
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:29,099
We won't be doing that anytime soon,
because a significant number of people

626
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:31,713
who put down their
nonrefundable deposits,

627
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,701
they died before they moved in.

628
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:36,376
Probably from ethylene
glycol poisoning.

629
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:39,595
I want a lawyer.

630
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:42,961
And I won't be drinking
anything from that glass.

631
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:45,287
You want my DNA, get a warrant.

632
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,645
There's no point in getting your DNA.
We have nothing to compare it to.

633
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,567
Excuse us.

634
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:00,320
Alexender Gallo's
identity is bullet proof.

635
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:03,220
- I am certain that's Fargood.
- She is certain.

636
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:06,163
That's good enough for me. We gotta keep
him in custody, or he's going to run.

637
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:09,208
Good enough for you is not
good enough for a judge.

638
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:13,252
That man poisoned 11 people
and used a speargun to kill a 12th.

639
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:17,323
- We gotta find a way to hold him.
- Don't arrest him till shift change.

640
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:18,674
- Right.
- Why?

641
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,641
- We'll lose him in the system.
- FBI stall tactics, Bones. Thank you.

642
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:24,575
Do not thank me.
He'll be out of here in 24 hours.

643
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,099
And even if you prove

644
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,745
that Gallo and Fargood
are the same man,

645
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,423
I don't see a shred of evidence
prooving that he killed those 12 people.

646
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:45,053
I need proof that before he was Gallo,
our bad guy was Fargood.

647
00:36:45,178 --> 00:36:46,421
So, I need the van.

648
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:49,479
What are the chances of finding
a vehicle stolen ten years ago?

649
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:50,904
And I need this.

650
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:53,295
You want us to find
a ten-year-old stolen van

651
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,188
- and a speargun all in the next...
- 12 hours, tops.

652
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,590
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Go. Perform miracles.

653
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:02,682
Even miracles aren't going to help.

654
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:05,141
We can't prove that Fargood
and Gallo are the same persons.

655
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,561
- What is that?
- Avalon's Harbinger certificate.

656
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,561
Remember she said Fargood
applied these seals himself?

657
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:14,481
The saliva on the seal is
how we get Fargood's DNA.

658
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,918
- But how do we get Gallo's?
- Human nature.

659
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:19,735
Human nature, Bones.

660
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,625
You found Tom Fargood?

661
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,526
- That's what we need you to tell us.
- Only if you're up to it.

662
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:27,785
Why wouldn't I be?

663
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,900
All these years you thought your sister
left you without saying good-bye.

664
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:33,792
- And really this man murdered Jenny.
- And then buried her

665
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,419
in a mass unmarked grave.

666
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:38,005
Why are you trying to make this
harder for me?

667
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,633
Is that Tom Fargood?

668
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:59,693
Is this the man who murdered
your little sister?

669
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,408
- You killed my sister!
- I got her.

670
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,199
You killed my little sister!

671
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:09,924
You sit there so smug!

672
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,467
That is sneaky.

673
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,679
- Is sneaky good or bad?
- Good, if it holds up in court.

674
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,747
Next time, make it look more

675
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:21,450
like you're taking advantage
of a situation, not scripting it.

676
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:23,091
Don't keep me hanging, people.

677
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,052
Are Alexander Gallo and Tom
Fargood the same person?

678
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,262
Perfect match.

679
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,223
Well, your facial expression
suggests that you are dissatisfied.

680
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,429
You proved that Gallo
is Fargood, fine,

681
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:36,063
but now you gotta prove that
Fargood killed those people

682
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:38,690
- and dumped them under that fountain.
- Charge him with murder,

683
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,734
give us time to find
the speargun and the van.

684
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,736
What are the chances
of that happening?

685
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:46,061
- A million to one?
- We don't have all the variables, so...

686
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:48,317
You're not being precise,

687
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:50,577
you're simply
illustrating the difficulty.

688
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:53,452
Everything maybe adds up
all the time in the lab,

689
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:56,177
but in real life,
sometimes you lose one.

690
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,877
What do we do, kill him?

691
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:02,255
Still an earshot,
cherie, still an earshot.

692
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:10,397
Fargood is going to get away
with mass murder.

693
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:14,042
- I don't want to talk about work.
- What do you want to talk about?

694
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,506
- You all right?
- Not really.

695
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,552
I just... I have something that I want
to say to you from inside my heart.

696
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,945
Blood is in your heart.

697
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:28,775
The idea that the heart
is the seat of love

698
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,411
and strength of character
is ancient but metaphoric.

699
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,744
I mean, in reality, these qualities
are based in the amygdala,

700
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:38,430
- which is part of the brain.
- Ever since I woke up from my coma

701
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,668
I been wanting to say something
to you about you.

702
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,740
Why didn't you say
something earlier?

703
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,245
Because I wanted to finish this case.
You know, to make sure that I'm back.

704
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,677
That, that I'm me again.

705
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,346
Does the fact that we didn't close
the case give you doubts?

706
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,744
We did the best that we can.
Hold on. You...

707
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:56,977
- You don't think I'm fully back?
- No, I know you're fully back.

708
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,104
- You do?
- You're wearing your socks.

709
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:05,021
No, he hates...

710
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,278
Do not kill the clown.

711
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:25,004
You hate clowns.
You do not think they're funny.

712
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:29,885
Right. Before my coma,
I shot a clown off an ice cream truck.

713
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:35,693
Well, I'm... sure in a few weeks
you'll hate clowns again.

714
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,851
Be back to normal.

715
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:42,647
- Yeah, a few weeks.
- Well, what did you want to tell me?

716
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:46,443
That I love you.

717
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:52,949
In a professional, you know,
attagirl kind of way.

718
00:40:54,197 --> 00:40:55,946
"Attagirl kind of way"?

719
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,606
Well, right back at you, Booth.
I love you, too.

720
00:41:02,156 --> 00:41:03,156
Attaboy.

721
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:09,413
You two got a moment?

722
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,755
<i>What's going on?</i>

723
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,975
<i>I thought I'd give you the honor
of arresting Mr. Fargood,</i>

724
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,391
Alexander Gallo, whatever you
want to call him. Arrest both of him.

725
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,730
- We didn't have enough evidence.
- For murder.

726
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,042
We didn't have enough to
charge him with murder.

727
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:27,263
But murder isn't the only crime in
the world. It just seems like around us.

728
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:29,319
Grand theft auto
regarding the rental van?

729
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,444
Fraud by wire?

730
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,657
That man sold people
a luxury hotel under the sea.

731
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:35,951
If he can't show it to us,
then he defrauded them.

732
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,037
- Illegal wearing of the uniform.
- Those poopie suits were Navy issue.

733
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,108
These are just federal
crimes, mind you.

734
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,547
I've got the District Attorney
coming up with his own list.

735
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,294
- What does this add up to?
- About a 100 years, give or take.

736
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,213
He should be convicted of murder.

737
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:51,925
Luckily, you two have me to pick up
the slack when you fall short.

738
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:56,720
That's right, you should kiss me.
What's wrong with you, Seeley Booth?

739
00:42:01,741 --> 00:42:02,936
On what charge?

740
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,443
A whole bunch of'em.

741
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:07,315
I'm sorry we couldn't get him
for killing your sister.

742
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,069
Sometimes you gotta just settle
for the second best situation.

743
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:16,087
I'm sorry, too, for how we manipulated
you into scratching his face.

744
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:17,534
It was rational.

745
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:21,689
And yet, irrationally,
I still feel bad about it.

746
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,747
The cards say only your
top layer is rational.

747
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:28,152
Underneath, you're as crazy as I am.

748
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:31,517
- And that's a compliment.
- Doesn't sound like one.

749
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:33,840
This is usually when we go
and get a drink.

750
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:37,968
You two are going to keep
doing things as usual.

751
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,516
Sometimes you gotta settle
for second best.

752
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:46,014
By the way,

753
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,018
my cards tell me
this all works out, eventually.

754
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:57,199
- Really?
- What all works out eventually?

755
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:00,859
What?

756
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:04,129
What all works out eventually?
