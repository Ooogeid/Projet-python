00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:10,217
On Tuesday morning, a dead tiger shark
washed up on Rehoboth Beach.

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,386
Its stomach contained
the undigested remains

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,138
of a human leg.

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,075
- What's wrong?
- That's got to hurt.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,226
A seasoned law enforcement agent
who still has empathy for a victim.

6
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:21,103
I'm glad to know you're out there.

7
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:22,970
At your service.

8
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:25,534
Dr. Bryar is from the National
Atmos-Ocean Association.

9
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:26,906
Called us this morning.

10
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,445
The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,947
Andrew was joking.
He likes to put people at ease.

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,615
It's a nice quality.

13
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,203
Everybody likes to laugh.
Except that guy.

14
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:41,791
Well, the weird thing is nobody reported
a shark attack <i>anywhere</i>

15
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,111
along the Seaboard.

16
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:44,835
You can make an I. D from the leg?

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,505
I've seen Temperance I.D. a victim
from a single fingernail clipping.

18
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,964
I've never done that.

19
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,508
Well, maybe not that, but,

20
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,415
you know, things <i>like</i> that.

21
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,096
You know? She's my partner;
I'm sure we could help you out.

22
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,767
I'd be grateful.

23
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,856
Yeah, I should, go and clear out.

24
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:07,879
I'll let you do your thing.

25
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,324
Well, that was a speedy exit.
Shall we?

26
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,681
The victim is likely male.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,886
These shallow cuts

28
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:24,340
and deep gouges, in conjunction
with location of recovery,

29
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:26,335
are likely indications of COD.

30
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,130
We need to count osteons
to determine age,

31
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,719
but the length of the tibia
indicates a height

32
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:33,551
of between five foot and five six.

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,970
- A short guy got bit by a shark?
- Now...

34
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,915
These look like six-ridge
dermal denticles.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,680
That can't be. A tiger shark
doesn't have dermal dticles.

36
00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:46,030
Then the victim encountered
multiple predators at the same time.

37
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,855
That is highly unlikely.

38
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,941
Well, this...

39
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,110
simple symmetrical bite.

40
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,237
- That's a tiger shark.
- This is different.

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,994
Some kind of...

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,949
small, conical canine.

43
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:59,827
- That's red snapper.
- Then...

44
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,067
this serrated bite.

45
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,122
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,249
A hammerhead.

47
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:08,141
- What? This sounds good.
- Hammerheads are tropical.

48
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,254
It's unlikely
you'd find one this far north.

49
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:11,881
Where's the nearest place

50
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:16,043
a tiger shark, a hammerhead,
and a red snapper could coexist?

51
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,843
How about the aquarium?

52
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,792
You don't get to be
deputy director of the FBI

53
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,054
by just dressing well
and kissing ass.

54
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,812
Okay, yeah, that's most of it, but
I'm probably right about the aquarium.

55
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,111
According to NOAA,
this facility focuses

56
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:38,531
on mare rescue and preservation.

57
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,266
A rehabilitated tiger shark

58
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,818
was permanently released
into the ocean this Saturday.

59
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:46,123
Jaws grabs a quick snack before
heading back out into the wild?

60
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,662
Shark attacks are very rare.

61
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:51,003
I mean, sharks,
they don't even like to eat people.

62
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,519
- That's true. How do <i>you</i> know that?
- "Shark Week," you know?

63
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:56,008
Where they do nothing
but make you afraid of sharks.

64
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:59,637
Wait, they have a week
set aside just for sharks?

65
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:00,971
It's a TV thing.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,227
Dr. Stoddard.

67
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,653
Marilyn. I work in
the Animal Husbandry Department.

68
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:10,940
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

69
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,650
Was someone eaten here this weekend?

70
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,060
The tiger shark that you released
this past Saturday,

71
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,739
can you show us where you kept him?

72
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,408
Yeah. Come-come right this way.

73
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,200
Since when do fish have husbands?

74
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,711
Animal husbandry is the science
of breeding livestock.

75
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,347
Since when are fish livestock?

76
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:29,625
Well, the term can be
applied loosely.

77
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,452
This is the tropical reef tank

78
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,913
where the tiger shark
was kept prior to release.

79
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,927
Originally, he required isolation,
but once he recovered,

80
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,679
we placed him in here to see
how he would interact with the others.

81
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,479
- Recovered from what?
- His fin was very nearly severed,

82
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,267
probably from a dragnet.

83
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:48,513
How'd he get on with the other fish?

84
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:50,229
Just fine, as far as I can tell.

85
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,064
You also have a hammerhead?

86
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,925
Hiding somewhere.

87
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,175
This tank is over 600,000 gallons.

88
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,336
You can only see
a portion from this side.

89
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,538
- It's like an ocean in itself.
- It is.

90
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,867
But I'm pretty sure
we would see evidence

91
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,743
if a human being
had been eaten in there.

92
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:07,121
- Anyone missing?
- Employees, you mean?

93
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,525
Or guests? No.

94
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,307
How about missing a leg?
No.

95
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,569
I think we would notice
something like that.

96
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,211
Anything unusual?

97
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,756
The Facilities Department
lost an expensive filter.

98
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,967
There was slight spike
in the ammonia levels,

99
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,469
but nothing out of the ordinary
here, certainly nothing

100
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,170
close to a fatal accident.

101
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:38,152
Okay, now, who's gonna go
in there to get <i>that?</i>

102
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,141

105
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,547
You know what?
You don't have to go in.

106
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,738
I do. We need to recover
what's left of the victim

107
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,934
to have any hope of identification.

108
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,935
Okay, time-out, okay?
Have Hodgins do it.

109
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,984
I look like Richard Dreyfuss,
don't I?

110
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,746
"We're gonna need a bigger boat. "

111
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,165
We don't need a boat.
Why are you wearing that hat?

112
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,328
Keep his brain warm, okay?
Make Hodgins go in there and do it.

113
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:38,205
There is nothing to be afraid of.

114
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,571
Yeah. You know,
sharks, they don't eat people.

115
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:43,968
Really? Tell that to the guy who got,
you know, coughed up by a grouper.

116
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,978
Okay, who's going in?

117
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:50,432
You guys know what you're doing?
It isn't a swim in a fish tank.

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,140
Isn't that exactly what it is?

119
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,353
Yeah, a really big, cool one.

120
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,813
It's a recovery of a body

121
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,023
in the investigation
of a potential homicide.

122
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,110
Any questions, you ask me, understand?
Keep your eyes on me.

123
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,278
Ready?

124
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,919
- Yes. I am.
- Ben here will escort you to the tank.

125
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:07,475
Agent Booth,  you'll be able

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
to communicate with her on our
intercom system.

127
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,370
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

128
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,712
Bones? Bones, are you there?

129
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:23,144
We're right here, Booth.

130
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,392
This is beautiful.

131
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:30,106
I'll get the skull.

132
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,809
You see if the's
any other bone particulates.

133
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,133
I have the interior aspect
of the skull.

134
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:55,622
- You'd call it a face, Booth.
- Pipe down there, pal.

135
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,449
Hodgins, over here.

136
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,063
Look.

137
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:46,325
I thought I would stop by and see
if you'd made any progress today.

138
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:49,760
Dr. Brennan, she's still working
on the identification.

139
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,137
It's... what we do.

140
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,432
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Sure.

141
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:58,018
Come on in...
It's my office.

142
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,728
It's very nice.

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,140
Yeah, right?

144
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,024
I was wondering if you
wanted to go out sometime.

145
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,528
Maybe this weekend.

146
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:12,309
Unless, of course, I'm a suspect.
'Cause I know you can't date me if I am.

147
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,368
I can't date anyone who's a suspect.

148
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,161
I understand.

149
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,525
Yeah, right?
It's FBI, rules, regulations...

150
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,127
But,

151
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,588
you know, when we're done with you,
I can give you a call,

152
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,132
and...

153
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,051
you can go out with me, or...
I can go out with you.

154
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,762
- How about both?
- Look at that.

155
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,142
I'm looking forward
to not being a suspect.

156
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:39,536
I am too.

157
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:43,689
Let me know if you hear anything
more about the identification.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,232
Yeah, yeah, I will.

159
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,630
All right.

160
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,217
The pelvis verifies
the osteon count.

161
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:59,604
He was between
the ages of 30 and 34.

162
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,811
The fusion of the vertebrae

163
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:04,042
could indicate an injury
to the spinal cord.

164
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,003
Anything off the spectroscope?

165
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,149
The distal tibia from the
leg we found originally...

166
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,211
it confirms the presence
of perimortem bruising.

167
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,633
When the shark attacked
the victim, he was alive?

168
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,477
Yes. Take a look right here.

169
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:20,159
I found a cleft fracture
of the styloid process.

170
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,970
Probably blunt-force to the throat.

171
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,104
And here,
several multidirectional grooves

172
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,478
along the glabella and
the supraorbital ridge.

173
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,358
The victim was stabbed in the eye?

174
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,860
Varying degrees of force

175
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,319
may suggest that someone tried
to stab the victim in the face

176
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,115
with a narrow, sharp object.

177
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,792
Okay. Well, that makes this
an official homicide.

178
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,206
The victim was assaulted and then dumped
into the tank alive

179
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,063
as a means of disposal.

180
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:46,463
I think I know when it happened.

181
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,264
Meet <i>deploria labyrinthiformis,</i>

182
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,883
better known as
the groovy grooved brain coral

183
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,153
native to the Caribbean,
Bermuda and Bahamas.

184
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:55,617
Why is it here?

185
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:59,556
Coral skeletons a create tiny crystals
of calcium carbonate at night.

186
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,184
So for us, this provides
a timeline similar to

187
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,604
tree rings. Coral can tell us what was
in the water and when it got there.

188
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,231
If you have a year to wait.

189
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,151
No. That is the beauty. Because
of the rapid nature of the growth,

190
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,778
the timeline is condensed.

191
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,821
- How specific is it?
- Within hours.

192
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,746
Now,
a spike in ammonia and nitrate levels

193
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:20,827
found within
the coral skeleton tells us

194
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,218
that something died
in tha tank on Friday night

195
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:25,999
between midnight and 6:00 A.M.

196
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,335
Something big...

197
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,317
like...

198
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,180
human being big.

199
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,081
These here are the 28 people we know
who were at the aquarium

200
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,011
Saturday morning between
the hours of midnight and 6:00 A.M.

201
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:45,143
Most of them are,
employees and security guards.

202
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:48,355
- Are all of them still alive?
- We're working on that right now.

203
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,734
This NOAA thing is turning
into a full-fledged investigation.

204
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,069
Who is that?

205
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,237
It's Hacker.

206
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,571
Tell I said I.

207
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:58,949
Bones says hello.

208
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,910
Hello. Tell her
I'm really looking forward to our date.

209
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,117
Did you two
want to speak to each other,

210
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:07,541
or is there something
that you wanted to tell me, sir?

211
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,446
I called 'cause I got a heads-up
on your missing person.

212
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,473
Gotcha.

213
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,759
- What did he say?
- He's looking forward to our date.

214
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,886
Your date.

215
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,048
Well, so am I.

216
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,407
He e-mailed me
and said he had tickets to a play.

217
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,728
- He e-mailed you? What, for a play?
- I believe that

218
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:30,647
"play" is Andrew's code for sex.

219
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,526
Is it okay for us to talk like this?

220
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,211
When he invited me to the play,

221
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:40,449
I thought it was code for sex,
so I said no.

222
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,200
I said yes to coffee.

223
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:43,994
Maybe that's a code.

224
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,294
Angela informed me that coffee

225
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,165
isn't a code for anything.

226
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:51,152
I have a date, too.

227
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:52,836
Good.

228
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,421
Catherine Bryar.

229
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,673
Every at the aquarium is a suspect.

230
00:11:57,105 --> 00:12:00,052
And once she's eliminated
as a person of interest...

231
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,762
Why did Andrew call?

232
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,933
Number 19 on our list

233
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,850
isn't accounted for.

234
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:11,310
- Jazz Gunn?
- Yeah.

235
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:13,065
What a ludicrous name.

236
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:14,775
You don't know who that is?

237
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,107
<i>My name is Jazz Gunn.</i>

238
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:20,697
<i>And I have a secret to tell you.</i>

239
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,905
<i>In the simplest terms,
the terrestrial world we live</i>

240
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,370
<i>in mirrors the underwater world
you see right here.</i>

241
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,059
<i>The same rules</i>

242
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:29,583
<i>that govern the sea</i>

243
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,125
<i>also govern</i>

244
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,053
<i>the sea of life.</i>

245
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,586
Jazz Gunn is your average

246
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,459
and I do mean, "average,"
self-help guru.

247
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,299
His half-baked theory

248
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,803
is based on nothing more than
the concept of natural selection,

249
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,681
but

250
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:46,223
his sea of life seminars are packed.

251
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,196
The shape of his skull
is consistent with that of the victim.

252
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:51,853
- I have never heard of him.
- I have. He spent Friday night

253
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,898
getting ready to prepare for
this speech that he was supposed to give

254
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,222
this morning at the aquarium,
he never showed up.

255
00:12:57,347 --> 00:13:01,154
He said that he had a car accident
in '93 that left him unable to walk,

256
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:04,533
but after he swam in the sea
off the coast of Brazil,

257
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,159
he was cured.

258
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,083
What, like a miracle?
Like this power of positive thinking?

259
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,416
- It's preposterous.
- He swam with sharks.

260
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:13,917
He said that by

261
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,997
forcing himself
to face his atavistic fears,

262
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:21,007
he gained the strength to fight back.
That's the whole theory behind

263
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,402
- the Sea of Life.
- What, so now this guy, what?

264
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:27,375
He gets paid a hundred bucks a pop to
talk about that in front of fish tanks?

265
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,191
<i>Let's begin with life lesson #1.</i>

266
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:30,679
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

267
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,228
<i>What if your friends and neighbors</i>

268
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,677
<i>tried to eat you?</i>

269
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,466
Look at this guy.
His name is Tad Benedict.

270
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:38,358
Benedict

271
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,073
used to be Jazz's assistant, but,

272
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,112
now Jazz does it solo.
They had

273
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:45,240
a widely publicized falling out.

274
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,203
What does he have in his hand?

275
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:50,871
- That's a pen.
- It looks like a metal stylus.

276
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:54,140
The victim was stabbed with a small,
sharp object.

277
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:56,042
Theodore Benedict.
He's on our list

278
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,336
of people that were there
at the aquarium Friday.

279
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,671
Maybe Jazz hired him.

280
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,965
Or he showed up on his own
with a chip on his shoulder.

281
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,468
- And a pointy pointer in his hand.
- Or,

282
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,511
like life lesson #1...

283
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:09,370
"Eat or be eaten. "

284
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:24,196
Tad, is it?

285
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,166
Yeah.

286
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,407
No. I can't believe this happened.

287
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,367
Who would want to kill him?
People love him.

288
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,994
The easy answer is "you. "

289
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,997
- You worked for him three years ago?
- Off and on

290
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,665
starting three years ago, yes.

291
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,294
Let's forget about the on. Just focus
on the off. It says you were dismissed

292
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,631
- after an argument over compensation?
- I wanted a share of the profits.

293
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,717
I felt like I did a lot of work,
he made all the money.

294
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,032
- I couldn't think of a clearer motive.
- Come on.

295
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:49,804
Do I look like I could do that?


296
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,016
But, I've seen the video.
Jazz is about, what? 5'4? And you?

297
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,519
The way you were wielding
thatpen around of yours

298
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,020
that you had, it was fierce.

299
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,523
You do know
that that fight was all over, right?

300
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:03,766
He called me a couple months ago when
he oversold a seminar in Santa Fe.

301
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,309
He needed help and apologized.

302
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:09,735
- I needed the job, so I went back .
- He pay you?

303
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,077
I get a percentage after each seminar,
like I asked.

304
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,671
And he took me
and my wife to Aspen for Christmas.

305
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:16,623
I more than forgave him.

306
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,585
You want to know what I think{\,
Agent Booth}?

307
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:22,945
Sure.

308
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:25,160
Jazz loved the sea.

309
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:28,980
He wanted to swim in that big tank
at the aquarium.

310
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:30,550
He told me.

311
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,978
Is this a live feed
of the tropical reef tank

312
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,629
- at the aquarium?
- Yep.

313
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:42,649
With an interactive interface
I implemented myself.

314
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:43,900
Check this out.

315
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,375
Click on this guy.

316
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,890
The program has an index that catalogs
anything organic.

317
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,718
This is incredible, Angela.
May I try?

318
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,994
Look what I found in
the filter from the aquarium.

319
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:58,540
It's a five-inch piece
of tanned putrescible animal raw hide.

320
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,791
From a fish?

321
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,750
A wallet.

322
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,003
If you go
into a fish tank willingly,

323
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,130
you remove your wallet, right?

324
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,626
You should leave this up.

325
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,173
It's beautiful.

326
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:14,389
Peaceful.

327
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:15,432
Pure.

328
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,642
It's kind of scary, though, right?

329
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,060
I like scary.

330
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,458
Yeah, so do I.

331
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:30,111
Clark is trying to determine
what sort of weapon

332
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:33,033
the killer may have used
when stabbing at the victim's face.

333
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,620
Hodgins, please keep me posted
about what you find in the filter.

334
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:49,589
Did you have time
to examine the grooves?

335
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:51,112
I did.

336
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:53,713
Syringe?

337
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,430
Taking a closer look,

338
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,267
I saw some of the deeper grooves had a
faint semi-circular ridge near the point

339
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,301
of contact.

340
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:03,196
I thought it would be consistent
with the hub of a hypodermic needle.

341
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,402
In terms of diameter,
14-gauge is about right.

342
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,771
There are no matching
grooves on the styloid process.

343
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:10,153
No. That injury
is simple blunt-force.

344
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:13,406
If the victim was stabbed
with a hypodermic needle,

345
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:16,409
- something may have been injected.
- hard to tell with the body being

346
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,103
submerged and I can't find
the perfect needle to match either.

347
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:22,082
Maybe I can.

348
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:27,420
Excuse me. We're back.

349
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,132
I see that.
Can I help you with something?

350
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,104
- Why is she taking that tone?
- She just doesn't like being

351
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,720
pinned as a murder suspect.

352
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,488
I can deal with that. What I don't like
is having every piece of information

353
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:41,810
I give you double-checked.
What can I do for you?

354
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,910
- We wanna see your hypodermic needles.
- All right. What sort of needles?

355
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,980
The 14-gauge
with a round hub and a blunt tip.

356
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:50,527
- Exactly.
- We don't carry anything like that.

357
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:52,195
Okay. Anything similar?

358
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,281
I realize you need to double-check,
so please,

359
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,325
- go right ahead.
- Also need

360
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,202
to know who had access to it

361
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,427
- on the night the victim died.
- I wasn't back here that night.

362
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:05,458
What's wrong with these angelfish?

363
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,502
They've been listless
the past few days,

364
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,879
most likely due to something
they ingested.

365
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,005
Or someone.

366
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,815
We should take these fish
back to the lab.

367
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,971
No, you can't.
These are a gift from Morocco.

368
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,276
They need to be tested for trace
evidence in a murder investigation.

369
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:23,397
- We'll get them back. Don't worry.
- I may or may not get them back to you.

370
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,774
Wait. You just said
that you weren't here that night.

371
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,573
- You already said that you were.
- Not in this area.

372
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,503
No one was back here after midnight.

373
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,823
I was out in the lobby,
helping with the kids.

374
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:38,616
Kids? What kids?

375
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,886
Our education department hosts field
trips for local elementary students.

376
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:43,621
I was helping the teacher.

377
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,296
I teach fourth grade.

378
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,984
My students are mostly
nine- and ten-year-olds.

379
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,416
We usually do
the Natural History Museum

380
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,918
and I thought
we'd try something new.

381
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,769
So we tried the aquarium.

382
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:03,476
36 kids overnight.
That's...

383
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,778
that's very brave of you.

384
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,989
Kids that age, when they fall asleep,
they're like little corpses.

385
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,941
- Did you have any help?
- Yes.

386
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,470
Four mothers,
the same four mothers who do everything.

387
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:17,238
- I can give you their names.
- That would be great. Thanks.

388
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:20,617
- Where did you sleep?
- In sleeping bags on the floor.

389
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:24,229
The aquarium people left the lights
in the big tank until midnight.

390
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:25,413
It was beautiful.

391
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,508
I'm just wondering.
How is it

392
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,375
that so many people can spend
the night in front of a tank and not

393
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,337
see a man being eaten by sharks?

394
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:36,703
When they turned the lights off,
it was dark.

395
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,595
Agent Booth, believe me.
If one

396
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,765
of those kids had seen anything,
they would all know about it by now.

397
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,616
- Why?
- First of all, they're blabbermouths.

398
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,562
And second, they were all
issued these disposable cameras.

399
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,981
And they take pictures
of everything.

400
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:54,984
- Everything?
- Everything.

401
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,731
Pam, stop hitting Steven.

402
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:03,735
Just tell me if any of these kids
is a killer.

403
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:06,161
It's tough to tell your average
nine-year-old

404
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:08,832
- from your average psychopath.
- Don't say that, all right?

405
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,871
- I have a kid nearly that age.
- Children are still forming their sense

406
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:15,445
of ethics at this age. Like I said,
they're basically sociopaths.

407
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,090
It's true.

408
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:18,879
Kids, don't touch the TV.

409
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:20,510
Thanks, Lucy.

410
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,242
Your photos will be returned

411
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,806
after they're developed
and perused for the investigation.

412
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,808
But what about the contest?

413
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,477
We told the kids it
was a photo contest.

414
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,564
That's good. Spare them
the trauma of the murder. Good idea.

415
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,315
- Murder?
- No, no.

416
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,109
- No murder.
- Photo contest.

417
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,736
- First prize: amusement park.
- No one said "murder. "

418
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,864
First place goes to amusement park.
Go ahead.

419
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,907
- I saved you on that one.
- I know.

420
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,909
You'll thank me later.
Next.

421
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,243
So I'm looking for evidence
of shark attack

422
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:51,255
and murder while
simultaneously judging a photo contest.

423
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,724
You possess
the necessary overlapping skills.

424
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:56,278
Well, between 36 disposables

425
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:58,528
and ten cell phone cameras,

426
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,591
we've got quite a selection here.

427
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:07,418
You said that "coffee"
isn't code for anything, right?

428
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:10,059
Sweetie, I think you need to
stop worrying about sex codes.

429
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,021
Hacker is a very up-front guy,

430
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,732
who is also
extremely politically savvy.

431
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,619
- Talk about strange overlapping skills?
- I don't know what it is.

432
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,490
Hacker is very sophisticated
in his job,

433
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,502
but he's much more transparent
in his personal life.

434
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:27,570
- Does that sound like anybody you know?
- Me?

435
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:32,290
- So you mean we're compatible?
- You know who I think you belong with.

436
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,376
I don't belong with anyone, Angela.
Do you?

437
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:38,666
Well, I'm grappling
with those same issues. So,

438
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:41,695
yes, go have coffee with Hacker.

439
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,593
And if it goes well,

440
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,220
then maybe you guys
can graduate to lunch.

441
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,015
What should I wear?

442
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,433
Clothing.

443
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:55,063
Look at this.

444
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,170
Let me see that one.

445
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:00,503
Let me see if I can, scan this.

446
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,040
- It's definitely a person.
- That's not our victim.

447
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:15,875
The proportions are wrong.

448
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,127
But no one
was supposed to be back there.

449
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,148
At 2:38 A.M.

450
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:21,047
Hodgins

451
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,382
said that the victim
died in the tank

452
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,593
between midnight and 6:00 A.M.

453
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,096
So this could definitely be
our killer.

454
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,778
That is the most unpleasant smell.

455
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:45,405
Angelfish smoothie?

456
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,240
You killed the Moroccan angelfish?

457
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:50,517
No, I did not.
They died on their own.

458
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:54,122
- Only afterwards did I puree them.
- I really hope you can prove that.

459
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,610
- Those aquarium people love their fish.
- Don't worry.

460
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:59,833
The angelfish died from
a generic organic protein-based

461
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,047
neurotoxin that's found in
lots of different yummy places,

462
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,251
like the flagellum of bacteria.

463
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,176
Did they absorb it
through their gills?

464
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,110
- I think they ingested it.
- By snacking on our victim?

465
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,473
No. This neurotoxin's not strong enough
to kill a fully grown human male.

466
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:14,559
What if

467
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,532
it was injected through his eye?
You know, more than once.

468
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,422
It'd be disorienting,
as would any injection into the eye.

469
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,593
Perhaps Dr. Saroyan can find traces
in what's left of the body. Thank you.

470
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:25,776
- Clark.
- Yeah.

471
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,698
Feel I should warn you.
Angela and Wendell... they broke up.

472
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,950
What's that got to do with me?

473
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,119
She may be on the market
for a new intern.

474
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,553
Listen. I'm gonna...

475
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,905
break my cardinal rule for you
and offer some good advice.

476
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:44,255
Don't do that.

477
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:45,423
Do what?

478
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,394
Channel your own frustrations
into snide illusions.

479
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:52,305
"Snide" is a strong word.

480
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,394
I found this for you.
It was in the vacuum.

481
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,565
Looks like an enterolith.

482
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,551
In cats,
you would call it a hairball.

483
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,004
Though, in this,

484
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,781
I see some bone fragments
within its composition.

485
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,407
Take it.
It's all yours.

486
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,469
Thanks.

487
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,038
What is it now, Dr. Hodgins?

488
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,687
Thank you
for breaking your cardinal rule.

489
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,503
I'll take
what you said under advisement.

490
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:24,891
Good.

491
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:28,257
Just know that I really don't need
to know the outcome.

492
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,844
Why can't you just

493
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,722
lighten up the guy's face and,
you know, zoom in?

494
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:37,637
Because it was a cell phone camera
that was aed by a child.

495
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,923
The Plexiglas at this point
is a foot thick.

496
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,896
- And 30 feet of water.
- At night.

497
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,440
- I was just asking.
- Okay, so I use

498
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,737
some warping software to reverse
the direction of the distortion

499
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,233
that was caused by the waves
on the surface of the water.

500
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,592
Then I lit it up.

501
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:54,492
- But this is the best that I can do.
- Okay.

502
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,699
We'll print that up
and get it to Booth.

503
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:58,621
- I know this man.
- You do?

504
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,582
Yes, his name is Ben.
I saw him working at the aquarium.

505
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,590
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

506
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,443
So why didn't you clock in, Ben?

507
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,431
- Probably 'cause I wasn't working.
- Really?

508
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,619
There you go. You see? And on top of it,
we have photographic evidence

509
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,152
that shows that you were.

510
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,414
Right.
That night.

511
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,250
Right, that night.
Just a routine night at the aquarium.

512
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,696
Man gets murdered and then
he gets fed to the sharks.

513
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:34,547
I wasn't supposed to work
that night.

514
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,738
But I switched shifts.

515
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:39,245
- I didn't clock in using my own card.
- Doesn't matter.

516
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,859
Fact is, you were there.
So let's start this

517
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:43,791
all over again, shall we, okay?

518
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,796
There's a check made out to you,

519
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,628
Ben Marcus...
that's you, right?...

520
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,663
for $10,000, deposited

521
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,620
the day after the murder.

522
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:55,720
- I can explain that.
- Signed by one

523
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,367
Dimitri Vladov.

524
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,050
Oh, man.

525
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:05,646
This looks bad 'cause he's
a big Russian mobster type.

526
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,230
Of course it looks bad.

527
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,381
It's made out to you for $10,000.
For what?

528
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,977
It's not what you think,
but if I tell you...

529
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:18,953
Vladov will kill me.

530
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:22,371
I want a lawyer.
I'm not saying anything else.

531
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,998
I'll just go ask Vlad.

532
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,233
Do you think you could
leave my name out of it?

533
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,006
- No?
- No.

534
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,524
Dimitri Vladov?

535
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:35,890
Vladov the Impaler paid
for a hit with a check?

536
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,221
I mean, why would
Vladov hire an amateur?

537
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,992
And pay by check? That's not
a good sign for law enforcement.

538
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:43,955
Not a good sign for culture as a whole.
You know what we ought to do?

539
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,729
Pool our money together,
buy a buffalo ranch in Alberta.

540
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:50,524
Sir, why do I feel like you're stalling
so I don't talk to this guy?

541
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,620
- I am, yes.
- Why?

542
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,974
Why go out on a limb when you know
it's gonna break?

543
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,541
Vladov's under surveillance by about
five federal agencies,

544
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,408
- and nothing ever happens.
- How'sthat?

545
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:02,391
- What's the Russian word for "Teflon"?
- Teflofistan?

546
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,297
He has been brought up on 50 charges

547
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,749
everything from homicide,
RICO, prostitution.

548
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,126
They've been smuggling
counterfeit vodka for years.

549
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,337
He has a brilliant trick
to keep himself out.

550
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,345
- What's that?
- He denies doing it.

551
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,092
It's gotten to the point, when
he denies, it's his way of saying yes.

552
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,511
I'm not afraid to bring this guy in.

553
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,461
You should be. If you value
your pension, you should be.

554
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:23,715
I'm not, even when
you sound like Yoda.

555
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,352
You want me with you?

556
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,230
- Why?
- The nickname is self-explanatory.

557
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,008
- I can handle it.
- Good.

558
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,069
But I truly hope that you don't
end up getting eaten by sharks

559
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,092
because your successes
have done wonders for my career. 

560
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,705
This looks like
your friendly neighborhood

561
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,873
gill raker.

562
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:48,292
What's that?

563
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:51,002
That... that would be

564
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,488
your friendly
neighborhood gum wrapper.

565
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:57,272
It's Booth.

566
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,471
Listen, you got to help me.
I got a hot lead and a funny feeling.

567
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,387
I don't understand
the juxtaposition.

568
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:06,309
I just need a really strong,

569
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,352
really compelling piece of evidence.

570
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,647
Usually, all you say you need
is your gun and your wits.

571
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,558
I've come to depend
on your wits, too.

572
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,331
What kind of proof do you need?

573
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:17,445
I need something that links
a Russian mobster

574
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,549
to a self-improvement guru

575
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:22,116
who gives speeches
in front of fish tanks.

576
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,330
I'm witless.

577
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,828
This is the Russian mobster
who smuggles booze?

578
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,793
That's the nicest thing he does.

579
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:33,419
Is somebody doing something there?

580
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,780
Hodgins is doing a demonstration
in his beaker.

581
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:37,881
It's a fact

582
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:40,883
that Russian "businessmen"
add blue dye

583
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:44,388
to tankers of clear alcohol
and import it as glass cleaner,

584
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,974
thus avoiding
the high tariff on booze.

585
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,758
Now, once it gets to the States,

586
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:50,269
they need to remove the dye

587
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,369
so that they can bottle
the booze as vodka.

588
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:53,763
Only way to do that...

589
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:57,857
is from a reverse osmosis filter.

590
00:28:58,383 --> 00:28:59,981
I got "filter" out of that.

591
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,786
Marilyn at the aquarium told us
that they're missing a filter.

592
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,756
- The mob can't go buy a filter?
- This one is special.

593
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,538
It's really huge and extra good.

594
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:11,999
- See?
- No, I don't see. I'm in another place.

595
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,227
I'm driving.

596
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,002
If you were, you'd be impressed.

597
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,962
Our victim witnesses a filter theft

598
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,507
- and gets killed for it.
- Hit him with the filter.

599
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:22,593
- That's your connection.
- Hodgins means metaphorically, Booth.

600
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:25,124
If you hit a Russian mobster
with an actual filter,

601
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:26,931
he'd probably impale you.

602
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,759
That's great.
Thanks for the tip.

603
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,984
Mr. Vladov, could you,

604
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,814
please describe your line of work?

605
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,169
For the purposes
of this conversation,

606
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:40,027
importing and exporting
mostly glass cleaner.

607
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:41,904
Is that 80 proof?

608
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,173
You know what you know, fine.

609
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:46,450
But what we are talking
about here is different.

610
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:50,467
How about you tell me
what it is you think I did.

611
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,282
Then I tell you
I did not do this thing.

612
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:55,374
Then we part ways amicably.

613
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:00,798
You know a motivational speaker
by the name of Jazz Gunn?

614
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:03,843
That's a silly name.

615
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,594
How about Ben Marcus?

616
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,514
Works at the Aquarium
of the Atlantic.

617
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,489
I even more vehemently deny
knowing this person.

618
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:13,644
Did you hire Ben Marcus
to steal a filter

619
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,380
- from the giant tank?
- I deny this categorically.

620
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,375
That your check?

621
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:24,158
That's your name.

622
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:26,449
Right there... Dimitri Vladov.

623
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,325
And that's your signature.

624
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:32,135
Check was written out to a man who was
photographed at the scene of a murder.

625
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,664
He cashed it the next day.

626
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,749
No, that is not my check.

627
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,793
- It is.
- It is not.

628
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,172
It's illegal to provide false info
that may impede an investigation.

629
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,757
I'm not aware of this.

630
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,925
You're aware of it now
'cause I'm telling you.

631
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:48,232
Am I under arrest?

632
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,980
I don't know. Are you?

633
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:54,275
I like you, Agent Booth.

634
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:57,192
And I've told you everything
I know on this issue.

635
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:58,731
You now owe me a favor.

636
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,333
I owe you a favor?

637
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,410
- I don't owe you anything.
- You do.

638
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:06,135
No, I don't.

639
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:23,672
May I interest you in our final
selections from the filter?

640
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:26,624
Dorsal fin
from a foxface rabbitfish.

641
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,260
I believe this is some sort of

642
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,804
sea turtle feces,
a rusty paper clip,

643
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,575
and the broken spine of a lionfish.

644
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,893
- That's all she wrote.
- Throw in the embryonic cells

645
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,938
of a blue shark and the remains
of a human vertebra.

646
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:40,981
Embryonic cells.

647
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:52,076
I need to see your virtual aquarium.

648
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:54,722
Sure.

649
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:58,594
Is there a blue shark in this tank?

650
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,501
I don't think so.

651
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,213
No. No blue shark.

652
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:05,596
That's not possible.

653
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:07,835
How would those embryonic cells
get into the tank?

654
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,935
- It's a closed system.
- They weren't.

655
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,805
They were in the victim.
The embryonic cells

656
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,166
of a blue shark can be injected
between the vertebrae

657
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,113
to form an infrastructure matrix

658
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,229
that facilitates
neural transmission.

659
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,231
It restores the spinal cord.

660
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,483
It was progressive surgery

661
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,622
that restored Jazz Gunn's
ability to walk.

662
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,238
It had nothing to do
with his ridiculous theory.

663
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,531
What a little liar.

664
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,532
I have to tell Booth there's
a scientific explanation for this.

665
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,329
You know what else
is missing from this tank?

666
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:39,664
Lionfish.

667
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:44,599
Looks like a 14-gauge.

668
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:58,316
Jazz Gunn was a liar.

669
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:00,686
He wasn't cured
by swimming in Brazil.

670
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,541
He underwent experimental surgery.

671
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,316
Think of all the people he misled.
That's motive for murder.

672
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,134
Is this what you're looking for?

673
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:10,193
The edge of this tank is damaged.

674
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,781
It still holds water. We're on
a tight budget around here.

675
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,701
This explains the cleft fracture
on the victim's styloid process.

676
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,036
You lost me, Bones.

677
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,120
The lionfish

678
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,664
protects itself with venomous spines

679
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,180
containing the same neurotoxin
that stunned our victim

680
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,837
- prior to his death.
- So no hypodermic needle?

681
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,664
There were several spines
from one venomous fish

682
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:32,926
all coming into contact with
the victim's face at the same time.

683
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,967
So this fish stabbed him in the eye?

684
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:37,428
That is consistent
with the wounds, yes.

685
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:41,039
- This the only lionfish you have here?
- That's it. Pterois antennata.

686
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:42,870
- I call him Bob.
- Bob.

687
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,747
Bob is our murder weapon.

688
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,048
The victim and the killer

689
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:00,349
gained access to
the back area of the aquarium

690
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:02,058
before the door was locked.

691
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,912
Jazz saw the lionfish in quarantine.

692
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:06,816
This represents the quarantine tank.

693
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,339
Jazz was all about facing his fears.

694
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,133
He saw one of the world's
most venomous fish and

695
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,678
was taking a look at it
from above the surface,

696
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,264
when someone forcibly pushed
his head down into the tank,

697
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:21,433
causing a cleft fracture

698
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,292
of the styloid process.

699
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,690
We used to do that in junior
high, but we used a toilet.

700
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,985
This man died of a lionfish swirly?

701
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,736
Now several of the venomous spines

702
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,719
penetrated the eye area.

703
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,657
A few broke and remained embedded.

704
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,909
Now with the victim disoriented

705
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,246
and unconscious, it was easy to
drag him off to the big tank nearby.

706
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,374
Unconscious underwater,
he was dead with his first breath.

707
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,668
And those fish tore him apart.

708
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,878
That's where this theory
actually holds true:

709
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,255
eat or be eaten.

710
00:34:54,298 --> 00:34:56,835
Jazz Gunn flew to Brazil
every six months.

711
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,679
He had his surgery
at a special clinic

712
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,394
in a small town called Itamarca.

713
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,583
That would be consistent
with the maintenance injections

714
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:04,931
required semiannually.

715
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:07,618
Although Itamarca, Brazil
is a long way to go to get them.

716
00:35:07,743 --> 00:35:09,412
He's got to keep up the front.

717
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:12,710
Tell everyone he's going for
another swim in the sea, right?

718
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,321
But guess who else paid a visit
to Itamarca this year?

719
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:22,555
So Brazil's a pretty expensive
vacation for a schoolteacher.

720
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,205
I love to travel.

721
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,885
To the very same beach where Jazz Gunn
claimed to have been healed by the sea?

722
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:34,189
How many of his seminars
did you attend?

723
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,761
- The FBI will find out.
- You said you didn't know

724
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,229
who Jazz Gunn was.

725
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:43,807
I went to nine of his seminars.

726
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,973
I have fibromyalgia.

727
00:35:56,797 --> 00:36:00,216
And that bastard convinced me
that if I just faced my fears,

728
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,970
that magically all of this pain
would just disappear.

729
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,246
- He lied.
- You brought a group

730
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,774
of fourth graders along
as an alibi for murder?

731
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,726
It was a coincidence.

732
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:15,677
He took me back to see
this poisonous fish.

733
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,219
"Come face your fears", he said.

734
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:21,428
Last thing he should have
said to me right then.

735
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,590
I'll tell you what, though.

736
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,350
He might have been on to
something, that bastard.

737
00:36:27,222 --> 00:36:29,794
Because ever since
I shoved his lying face

738
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:33,356
into that poisonous fish,
I haven't felt any pain.

739
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm going to have
coffee with Andrew.

740
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:50,175
All right, have a good time.

741
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Thank you.

742
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:53,439
I'm going to see someone, too.

743
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,349
- Dr. Catherine Bryar.
- The case is closed.

744
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,968
She's very nice.
The two of you seem compatible.

745
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,279
Maybe. You know, we'll see.

746
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,423
She's easily as pretty as I am.

747
00:37:05,548 --> 00:37:08,157
I mean, using me as a standard.

748
00:37:10,404 --> 00:37:11,887
Bones, you are the standard.

749
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:16,358
Andrew is not as handsome as you.

750
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,399
Using you as a standard.

751
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:20,208
He is, however, taller.

752
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:24,491
Catherine isn't as smart as I am.

753
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:28,477
- I'm not as smart as Hacker.
- You once said he was a doofus.

754
00:37:28,602 --> 00:37:30,489
He is a doofus.
A smart doofus.

755
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,281
I hope you have
a good time together.

756
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:36,478
Yeah, you, too.

757
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:38,968
Thanks.

758
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,298
- I'm not late, am I?
- Not at all.

759
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,258
We were catching a murderer.

760
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,719
This is the best excuse
for being late I've ever heard.

761
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,242
You said I wasn't.

762
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,298
I was putting you at ease.
One of my strengths.

763
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:31,850
That, and I can write longhand
perfectly in the dark.

764
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:36,552
Sorry.

765
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,037
Sit down.

766
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:42,529
Congratulations
on solving the murder.

767
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,478
Now Booth can
have sex with Dr. Bryar.

768
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:48,514
Because she was involved
in the investigation,

769
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,517
and the FBI does not
allow socialization

770
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,719
with suspects or consultants.

771
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,650
And for a while, she was both.

772
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:57,709
My God.

773
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,159
Are you allowed to see me socially?

774
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:02,714
Absolutely. I got clearance.

775
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:05,217
- From whom?
- From myself.

776
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:10,097
In fact, I not only granted permission,
I insisted that I see you socially.

777
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,101
That's funny because you're
satirizing bureaucratic rules

778
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,656
by adhering to the letter
of the regulations

779
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,397
instead of the spirit of it.

780
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:23,944
You've got a great laugh.
You do. It's a Rat Pack laugh.

781
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,947
- I don't know what that means.
- You don't know about the Rat Pack?

782
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:29,866
That's awesome.

783
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:33,954
Why? The Rat Pack does not sound
like a good thing.

784
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,792
'Cause you will notresist the man

785
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:38,247
who showed you that the Rat Pack
is a good thing.

786
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:49,636
Tell me the truth:
did you think, even for a second,

787
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,561
that I might be the murderer?

788
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,039
I may not know who did

789
00:39:55,386 --> 00:39:57,644
commit the murder,
but I definitely know who didn't.

790
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:00,105
Yeah, yeah, I know,
you're a scientist,

791
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,066
so that whole intuition thing
is just a load of crap, right?

792
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,714
I have an intuition about you.

793
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:07,891
Really?

794
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,323
It tells me

795
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,117
that you could use some company.

796
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,569
I could use some company, really?

797
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,791
I make you laugh.
You make me laugh.

798
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:21,858
You're going to make me laugh?

799
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:24,187
Do you think these
diamond earrings are real?

800
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,362
- I don't know.
- I could tell that they were real

801
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:29,259
the minute my ex gave them to me.

802
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,372
- How so?
- Because no one

803
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,305
would buy fake diamonds this small.

804
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,158
All right.

805
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:40,062
So give me a call
if you want to have dinner sometime.

806
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:49,988
You want to have dinner sometime?

807
00:40:50,922 --> 00:40:51,922
Sure.

808
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:10,163
Angela and Hodgins find the
fish tank to be very romantic.

809
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,031
The mystery of the deep.
The great unknown.

810
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:15,472
It's a body of enclosed water

811
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,642
filled with aquatic
ectothermic vertebrates.

812
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,572
Not unknown at all.

813
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:22,442
But pretty.

814
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,815
Maybe that's what they like.

815
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:28,646
That's probably what it is.
I bet that's what it is.

816
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,488
So, your date... how was that?

817
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:33,216
Quite enjoyable.

818
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:35,851
Andrew is charming and very funny.

819
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,519
I can see you're still smiling.

820
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:40,679
What about you and Catherine?
Did you have a good time?

821
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:44,826
We laughed.
A lot.

822
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:46,738
It felt good.

823
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:49,089
I'm gonna see her again.

824
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:51,766
Excellent.

825
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,428
- You deserve a good woman.
- So do you.

826
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,086
I mean, not...

827
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:59,391
a woman, but you know what I meant.

828
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,807
I know.

829
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:05,490
So, what did you laugh about?

830
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:08,472
She said something
about her earrings.

831
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:10,735
She wore amusing earrings?

832
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,654
She said that they were a gift
and she knew that they were real

833
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:17,409
'cause no one would buy
fake diamonds that small.

834
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,995
They might if they were
on a tight budget.

835
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,400
No. It's...

836
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,371
It doesn't matter.

837
00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:26,042
You had to be there.

838
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,462
Andrew is going to introduce me
to a Rat Pack.

839
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,840
He was very excited about it.

840
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,981
They must be extraordinary rodents.

841
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,720
Yeah. Talented, too.

842
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,971
Do you know them?

843
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:41,534
