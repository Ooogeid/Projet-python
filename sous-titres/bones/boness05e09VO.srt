1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,678
Sucking fry oil from
these seafood restaurants is the worst.

2
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:11,061
I don't mind the chicken places,
but the seafood makes me sick.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,513
Quit moaning and put the hose in.

4
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,689
Smells like shrimp!

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,937
Okay, suck it!

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,627
Hold it! Hold it!

7
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,813
I got hair.
A lot!

8
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,248
- It's gross.
- Probably a rat.

9
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:39,023
Let's just open her up.

10
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:43,918
Pull it out.

11
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,291
Fishing is not a sport.

12
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,602
But monuments to sporting events

13
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:08,087
in ancient Egypt include fishing,

14
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:10,328
as well as swimming and wrestling.

15
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:12,121
Come on, no sweat, no sport.

16
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:16,391
Boris Spassky at chess.
He used to perspire profusely.

17
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,828
Why do you got to make things
so complicated?

18
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:21,362
Basketball, football,
hockey... that's a sport.

19
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:23,650
Board games, fishing... not a sport.

20
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:26,846
No problem going easy on the
fried food after this one.

21
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:30,900
The International Olympic Committee
is considering adding chess as a sport.

22
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,550
- Not a sport.
- See? Not a sport.

23
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,970
Neither is, ribbon twirling,
bridge or synchronized swimming.

24
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,681
Synchronized swimming...
that's not a sport, that's for sure.

25
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,266
God.

26
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,432
I'm in the middle of something,
aren't I?

27
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,145
Look. Dead guy.

28
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,430
Look at that.
The Colonel's not gonna like this one.

29
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,365
Male.
No sign of clothing.

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,206
All other stats still unknown.

31
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:52,653
He was found at the bottom
of this grease receptacle

32
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,039
by those lovely
gentlemen over there.

33
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,491
The remains are covered in flesh.

34
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,119
- Why am I here?
- I don't know. I told Booth.

35
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,691
God. In the middle again.

36
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:06,814
I heard murder victim, in cooking oil,
I thought, "Bones would love this one."

37
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,399
How long has guy been in there?

38
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:10,337
Tank hasn't been emptied
in a couple weeks.

39
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,465
- Two weeks.
- I could be biking now.

40
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,383
An activity during which I perspire.

41
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,259
Daily addition of hot oil
hastened decomposition and led

42
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:20,239
- to early hydration of body fat.
- So he drowned, or maybe fried?

43
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:23,267
Billiards is considered a sport
by the International Olympic Committee.

44
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,853
- Bones, we're working here.
- Not me.

45
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,216
Can we get the body out
of the here, please?

46
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,989
Slowly, slowly...
Careful now...

47
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,282
Okay, careful.

48
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,870
Is the skin slipping?
The skin is slipping!

49
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,606
Oh, my...

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,314
Bones, look at that.

51
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,881
- This is good for me.
- Yeah. Right?

52
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,608
You're kidding. <i>Avatar</i>?

53
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,503
There were over 10,000 entries
for 500 tickets.

54
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:17,638
And you won?

55
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:20,145
Good fortune!
If I thought that good fortune existed.

56
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,898
And you're taking us?

57
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,733
All friendship is fleeting
and ends in abandonment.

58
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:28,199
So, why not spend a few good hours
with you guys until it all falls apart?

59
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,241
- Works for me.
- Heck, yeah, it does.

60
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,516
Nice! <i>Avatar!</i>

61
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,249
You guys do realize that being
this excited about a sci-fi film

62
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:38,301
will drastically cut down on the number
of women that will sleep with us.

63
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm into high double digits,
sex-wise, so not worried.

64
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,955
You're closing in
on a hundred women?

65
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,142
Mr. Fisher, I'm ready.

66
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,843
Coming, Dr. Brennan.

67
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,299
A hundred women?
That's... that's a lot.

68
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,527
Yeah, yeah, hats off to the guy.

69
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,196
Compound depressed fracture
to the temporal bone.

70
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:03,200
More hairline fractures on the
femur, humerus and scapula.

71
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,268
And here on the right ilium.

72
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:09,469
There are puncture marks on the ilium,
iliolumbar and sacroiliac.

73
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,544
So he was beaten and stabbed.

74
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,497
Somebody really went after this guy.

75
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:15,162
Those injuries didn't kill him.

76
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:17,627
There's grease
in all levels of the bronchi,

77
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:21,273
which means, our victim was alive
when he was tossed into the vat.

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,221
Cause of death is drowning
and cooking,

79
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,609
or vice versa.

80
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,933
Saturated fats.
They're a killer.

81
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,180
Also... Carboxyhemoglobin test shows

82
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,939
our victim had a 17%
carbon-monoxide level.

83
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,811
Triple the norm and double what
even a heavy smoker would have.

84
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:40,195
He could've worked with cars,
along a freeway, maybe a told Booth?

85
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,656
Let's review occupational markers.

86
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,467
Acute asymmetrical
spinal subluxation,

87
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:50,526
which, in life, would have been apparent
in a pronounced leftward lean.

88
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,877
Chronic periosteal reaction
with bone formation over the clavicle.

89
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,409
Constant pressure on his collarbone.

90
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:00,341
Remodeled bite marks on the tibia.

91
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:01,853
Probably canine.

92
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:04,518
Sounds like this guy spent
most of his life carrying something

93
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,097
heavy on his left shoulder
while dodging dogs.

94
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,308
Together with the high levels
of carbon monoxide,

95
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,666
I posit that our victim
was a mail carrier.

96
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,729
Someone went postal on this postman.

97
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,601
Bones - Season 05 Episode 09
"The Gamer in the Grease"

98
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,826
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Dark_Chii

00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,516
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

100
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:54,186
Steve Rifton, 26-year-old mailman,

101
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,522
reported missing by his wife
12 days ago.

102
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:59,487
You figured out he was a
mailman, and guess what?

103
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,440
- He's a mailman!
- Why are you surprised?

104
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:04,362
It surprises me, it amazes me sometimes
how you figure that stuff out.

105
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:06,865
- He's a mailman. You figured that out.
- I'm good at my job.

106
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,227
Wait until you see what I got here.

107
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:10,911
Here...

108
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,701
- Marked in red.
- Right, is Steve Rifton's postal route.

109
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:16,000
- And here...
- Marked in black.

110
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,677
Is the grease truck route.

111
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:20,295
- See what I've done here?
- Obviously, you've created a geographic

112
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,922
Venn diagram.

113
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,979
Incorrect. What I've shown here
is they've overlapped in the same area.

114
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,470
You need to Google Venn diagram.

115
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,528
You know, lonely housewife,
husband away on a business trip.

116
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,518
Bow-chicka wow-wow.

117
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,437
What's bow-chicka wow-wow?

118
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,981
You know, A-boom-clicka-mow-mow.

119
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:41,980
It's a very common porno plot theme,

120
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,909
which, in real life is
jealous husband stuffing,

121
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,990
you know, horny mailmen
into grease traps.

122
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,575
- Who's that?
- Victim's wife.

123
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,803
Well, are we going to tell her
about the clacka-mow-boom?

124
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:55,695
No, it's bow-chicka wow-wow.
Boom-clacka mow-mow.

125
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,098
It's so unfair.

126
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,029
All those years of effort,

127
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,463
Steve finally gets somewhere,
and then gets killed.

128
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,959
- Who'd want your husband dead?
- You know who Steve is, right?

129
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:07,885
- I mean was.
- A postman.

130
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:08,951
A mailman.

131
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,597
That was Steve's job, his vocation.

132
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,850
His avocation was gaming.

133
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,519
- He was a professional gambler?
- Video gaming.

134
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,396
He became the reigning world champ

135
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,857
in Punky Pong
after he got a perfect score.

136
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:24,145
- It was on the news.
- Did he have any enemies?

137
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,861
Sure. The thousands of people he
beat out for the world title.

138
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:28,964
It's a very competitive sport.

139
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,597
Agent Booth would never accept
Punky Pong as a sport.

140
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,472
Did your husband
have any trouble at work?

141
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:36,865
Steve was never going to be
Postmaster General, that's for sure.

142
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,291
He had a very high IQ,
you know how those people can be.

143
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:42,400
- Very absent-minded.
- I don't think that's true at all.

144
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,797
Sometimes it was tough
to get his attention, but

145
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:46,638
he was a good man.

146
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,843
Please find whoever hurt him.

147
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,002
Does Dr. Brennan know you're
soaking the body in beer?

148
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,519
Yeast speeds up
the putrefaction process.

149
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,566
It's the kinder, gentler way
of removing the last vestiges

150
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,565
of flesh and cartilage
from the skeleton.

151
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,760
Is that beer?

152
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:11,031
Beats being scraped
or eaten by beetles.

153
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,119
Technically, his remaining cells
will be very drunk

154
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,620
before he ceases to exist.

155
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,164
So, how long's
this thing take to marinate?

156
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,506
- Few hours.
- Good. Both of you, come with me.

157
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:33,001
Okay, I am no longer able to discern
special effects from live action.

158
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:36,028
This is 2D.
3D's gonna blow your mind.

159
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:38,921
One of us needs to be
in line right now.

160
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:41,436
We're up against freaks
and fanatics for the best seats.

161
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,244
To defeat them, we must
become freaks and fanatics.

162
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,216
All right,
I've cleared most of my days,

163
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,817
but I am a mental health
professional with responsibilities.

164
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:51,374
Between me and Hodgins,
we'll have the forensics covered.

165
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,949
- What's with the blue people?
- The Nav'i.

166
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,515
- I beg your pardon?
- Denizens of a lush planet

167
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,773
- called Pandora.
- You boys are not allowed

168
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,873
to watch movies on my monitor.

169
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,116
This is so much more than a movie.

170
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,122
Yeah, I mean, we're sorry,
but the screen is so big.

171
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,299
- You get porn on this thing?
- Get out. Out!

172
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,943
All right, I'll take the first shift,
you guys cover me.

173
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,470
Everyone e-mail me your projected
availabilities, I'll set up a schedule.

174
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:28,494
Our mailman had a clean record, except
for complaints from this guy Seeger.

175
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:32,633
Right. Seeger claims that he trespassed
and was acting creepy around his son.

176
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:36,471
Protecting the well-being of your kid
seems like a good reason to kill.

177
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:39,323
I'm not saying that I approve.
I just saying, I understand.

178
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,429
This is probably the child who
got creeped on by the victim.

179
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,533
Hello?

180
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,437
Excuse me?
Hello?

181
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,588
Hi. I'm Agent Booth.
I'm with the FBI.

182
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,514
- Show him your gun. Kids love guns.
- Let me handle this.

183
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,317
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, Agent Booth, the FBI.

184
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:58,597
We're here to talk to you
about the, mailman incident.

185
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,308
- That was 3 months ago.
- Right, and what was the problem?

186
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:04,750
Problem was, I come out,
the guy is here, staring at my son.

187
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:06,793
Dougie...

188
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,317
is autistic. He can't watch out
for himself in that way.

189
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,861
He's very focused on this game.

190
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,279
Punky Pong.

191
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,032
Dougie plays it most of the day.
We take it away, he shuts...

192
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,592
shuts down.

193
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,796
So...

194
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:24,091
someone else complain about the mailman?
That why the FBI's involved?

195
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:27,417
Look, you're aware that this mailman
was the Punky Pong world champion?

196
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:31,747
You got to be kidding me.
That's why he was checking out Dougie?

197
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,502
He should have said something.

198
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:36,122
He just took off.
That's why I made the complaint.

199
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,470
If I... If I was out of line,
I'll apologize.

200
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:56,335
<i>Punky Pong</i>
is kind of an old school game,

201
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,154
but it takes a lot of skill.

202
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,881
There are a lot of message boards

203
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:01,847
and Web sites dedicated
to it, even today,

204
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:03,787
but I found something
on one of them that...

205
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,455
How many people play?

206
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,666
Thousands.

207
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,032
They put out a retro version
on modern platforms like Xbox,

208
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,087
and it's having this
whole resurgence.

209
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,630
But what I found...

210
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,737
Why do they only allow world records
to be attained on a vintage machine?

211
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,636
Well, I guess the purists
like it old school.

212
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:23,724
- But, I think you need to see...
- Are there many of those machines?

213
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,564
Because the autistic boy had one.

214
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:28,145
I think around 20,000 were
made and there are probably

215
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,144
about 1,500
that are still in existence.

216
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:34,693
I think this is something
that you really need to see.

217
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,236
This is Billy Gabel.

218
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,230
He was the Punky Pong world champion

219
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:41,330
before our murder victim
claimed the throne.

220
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,934
<i>I am still the rightful champion.</i>

221
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,414
<i>The manner in which Steve Rifton
stole my crown</i>

222
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,623
<i>is shameful.</i>

223
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:50,208
<i>I will not put up with this.</i>

224
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,810
<i>Steve Rifton, I am the rightful
and eternal world champion</i>

225
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:55,285
<i>and you are dead!</i>

226
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,841
Angela, you should have
shown me this first.

227
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,372
Well...

228
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:08,477
<i>I am still the rightful champion.</i>

229
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,312
<i>I will not leave this alone.</i>

230
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,066
<i>Steve Rifton, I am the rightful
and eternal world champion</i>

231
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,817
<i>and you are dead!</i>

232
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,162
Okay, so video games provide
the outlet for aggression

233
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,393
that more physically taxing
sports also provide.

234
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:24,341
- Come on, video games are not a sport.
- Well, technically, they are,

235
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:27,736
sport being a competitive activity
governed by a set of rules...

236
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:29,581
- Dr. Brennan is correct.
- Right, so you

237
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,226
actually think that this geek
is capable of murder

238
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,878
because some guy beat
his high score?

239
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,730
If one's instincts
are deeply rooted in the status

240
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,738
that they've enjoyed from the game,
and someone takes that away...

241
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:43,435
They would just be another geek
lining up to see a space movie.

242
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,634
No, it's not just
another space movie.

243
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,391
It's a symbol-laden
alternate reality with...

244
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:56,946
So...

245
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,492
this guy was the recognized
champion for nearly ten years.

246
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:03,573
Right? If he feels that
his notoriety was stolen,

247
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,270
he might take revenge.

248
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:06,118
Sorry.

249
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:19,711
This is Dr. Lance Sweets.

250
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,389
Fisher just called
from the movie line.

251
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:25,533
He's got to get back to the lab, so
you have to relieve him because I can't.

252
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:27,180
<i>I understand.</i>

253
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,089
That's a fascinating case.

254
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:31,698
I'm needed for a consult.

255
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,146
- We're through here, right?
- You're coming with us to see

256
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,648
if this geek is actually
psycho or not, pal.

257
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,885
So I'm afraid you're going to have

258
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:44,407
to take care of the patient
on your own, at this juncture, now.

259
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,466
Sweets, I'm knee-deep
in larvae and dicotyledons here.

260
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:48,702
I'm sorry, Doctor.

261
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:50,871
- Bye now.
- Sweets, don't...

262
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,057
This is it;
this is all I got so far.

263
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:59,717
Please tell me these all crawled
into the Dumpster

264
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:02,299
after the oil was removed
from the restaurant.

265
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,677
They had antemortem burns, which means
they flew into while it was cooking.

266
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,929
- It's easy to diet around here.
- So I assumed that

267
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,390
the fragment of the cricket
exoskeleton from the skull wound

268
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,392
had migrated  from the grease, but

269
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,746
definitely uncooked,

270
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,563
so my 3 mysterious particulates
were all transferred from the weapon.

271
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:19,690
Exoskeleton is from the <i>Gryllidae</i>
family, probably a nocturnal cricket,

272
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,550
the graminoid seed is from a
fescue grass,

273
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,987
and I thought the silk-like
fiber was from a tetrapod,

274
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,072
but what kind is
indeterminate at this point.

275
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,639
You're talking really fast.
Are you late for something?

276
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:31,073
Why?

277
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,206
Do you want me to go through
it all again more slowly?

278
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,674
No, that's okay.

279
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,187
Do you know where the cricket
and the grass came from?

280
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:43,043
- North America.
- Great. So Asia is out.

281
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:46,958
I'm still analyzing what was
in the water where the fescue grew,

282
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,737
but, you know, I can check that
against specific water districts

283
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,723
and narrow down
the location further...

284
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,691
Great.

285
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,647
Have you seen Fisher?

286
00:14:57,832 --> 00:15:00,607
No, no, but I'll go find him.

287
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,484
That's not necessary.
He'll turn up.

288
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,444
But,
the mass spec is doing it's thing

289
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,396
and the computer... really checks

290
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,705
all the districts, so I'm on autopilot
here for at least the next two hours,

291
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,822
and we know Fisher,
how depressed he gets, I'll go find him.

292
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,917
FBI.
You Pong Master Bill?

293
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:35,285
That's right.

294
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,583
We're here about the threats you made
against Steve Rifton on the Internet.

295
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,065
That guy cheated. I don't believe
he played a perfect game.

296
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,370
I want my title back.

297
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,485
Is this how you make a living,
repairing vintage arcade games?

298
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,068
It's a skill.

299
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,864
I know why he called you. Because
he knows what he did was wrong.

300
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,533
He's dead, murdered.

301
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,410
- What?
- Did you kill him?

302
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:56,413
These are very complex devices
and it appears you have

303
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,623
to machine many
of the parts yourself.

304
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:01,376
If I was going to kill
somebody, it would be The Ref.

305
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,300
He's the one that accepted
Steve's crappy videotape

306
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,381
as evidence of a perfect game.

307
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,599
- And this ref's name is...?
- Chris Ballinger.

308
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,617
He heads the Gemini Constellation,

309
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:14,124
the organization that decides
on world records for Punky Pong.

310
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:17,058
Right after Ref declared Steve
world champion,

311
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,144
they went into business together.

312
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,354
- What kind of business?
- Going out on tours,

313
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,710
signing autographs.
The way I hear it,

314
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,668
the Ref has hooked up with some babe

315
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,504
and now he's doing better than ever.

316
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,321
Maybe he killed Rifton.

317
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:38,747
Excuse me.

318
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:42,125
There you are. You got to get going.
Cam's looking for you.

319
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,780
- I got to set this tent up.
- This is good.

320
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,422
This is really good
positioning, man.

321
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,521
- Not bad.
- You might want to step back.

322
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:50,508
Look out!

323
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,973
- You do this often?
- You got to come prepared.

324
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,812
Fresh Meat Tarts and a box of wine.

325
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:04,765
Have at it.

326
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:08,318
Nice.

327
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,080
Are you out of breath, Mr. Fisher?

328
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,389
No, I'm, I'm just thankful
I'm breathing, you know.

329
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,086
Never know
when that luxury will end.

330
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:30,350
So I examined
the... marks on the pelvis.

331
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:33,895
They were made by... a hollow,

332
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,341
rigid weapon,

333
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:37,605
9.4 millimeters in diameter

334
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,974
Was the same weapon
used on the victim's skull?

335
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:42,852
That seems unlikely

336
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,713
because the cranial injury

337
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,092
was made by a blunt instrument,

338
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:50,729
that left a 12-centimeter fracture

339
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:54,364
- right there.
- Any guess as to what it could be?

340
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,659
Not at all, no,
but I did scrape what looks like

341
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,906
metal shavings
from both the cranial fracture

342
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:03,581
and the... stab wounds
on the pelvis.

343
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,961
Maybe Hodgins can find a match.

344
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:08,086
Very good, Mr. Fisher.

345
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,380
Right, I've always been
a multitasker.

346
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,740
Multitasker?

347
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,175
What would be splitting your focus?

348
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,228
The head

349
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,473
and the pelvis completely separate parts
of the body.

350
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,558
Right.

351
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,023
Did Hodgins come back with you?
'Cause I haven't seen him.

352
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,402
Yeah, he should be out there.
I got to get back to work here,

353
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,153
but he's check the men's room.

354
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:35,572
Or don't.

355
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Good luck.

356
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,441
There is some excellent
hand-eye coordination here.

357
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:50,542
This is an activity that could
definitely be considered a sport.

358
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,465
Yeah, there's an intense
competitive edge, skill...

359
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,888
- stamina.
- For something to be a sport,

360
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,825
there has to be some chance of injury.
Okay, guys?

361
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,765
That man dressed
in traditional stripes

362
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,726
- could be The Ref.
- Not that kind of ref, okay? FBI.

363
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,966
What can I do for the FBI?

364
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,355
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about Steve Rifton.

365
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,184
Well, I've got a few myself.
The guy just disappeared on me.

366
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,506
We had a business deal
and he left me high and dry.

367
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,529
FBI, what,
he wasn't kidnapped, was he?

368
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,574
He's dead, which is probably why
he didn't keep his business commitment.

369
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:20,837
He's dead.

370
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:22,973
Man.

371
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,663
Yes!
Take that, Steve Rifton!

372
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,416
I am the reigning empress
of Punky Pong.

373
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,462
She must be the babe
who replaced Steve.

374
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:36,516
- You didn't waste any time, did you?
- I had business commitments with Steve.

375
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:39,431
I had to move quickly or I was
going to lose a ton of dough.

376
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:42,144
- What's up, Chris?
- These people are with the FBI.

377
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,000
Plus, gamers are predominantly male,

378
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,524
so a lot more are going to turn out
to see her compete, right?

379
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,437
Sexist twerp, it's not about looks,
it's about ability.

380
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,483
Steve is dead, Deirdre. We are suspects,
so you don't say a thing to them.

381
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,159
The front of this machine
has been scrubbed.

382
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,758
What do you got?

383
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,918
- Blood.
- Okay, that's it.

384
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,672
The machine is coming with us.
It's part of a Federal investigation. 

385
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:27,559
Did you sign this check,
Mr. Ballinger?

386
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,871
It's made out to Steve Rifton.

387
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,778
$12,000-- that's a lot of money
for an old arcade machine.

388
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:36,636
Steve not only got the world record
in Punky Pong on that very machine,

389
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:38,373
he got a perfect score.

390
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:41,572
What that machine is there,
is a piece of gaming history.

391
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,533
Serious gamers will drop
50 bucks a pop

392
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,784
to play on a unique piece
of equipment like that...

393
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:49,269
- 100 if he was standing beside it.
- That is a conflict of interest...

394
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:52,206
You decide if Rifton
gets the world record

395
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,709
and you profit from it.

396
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,721
You've been talking
to Billy Gabel?

397
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:58,502
We got a tape proving that Steve
Rifton won fair and square.

398
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,258
- Am I right?
- That's how we do it.

399
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,752
If you guys want it for verification...
Fine... I'll hand it over.

400
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,848
Can you explain
the blood on the machine?

401
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:09,230
Kids play the game.

402
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:12,805
They get anxious, hyper even.
Sometimes their noses bleed.

403
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:15,607
Sometimes they put a little sauce
into it and they bash their heads.

404
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,443
Either way, I'm cleaning blood
off the floor every day.

405
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,273
We had a business plan.
Why would I kill him?

406
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:24,548
I don't know, maybe he reneges,
you take exception.

407
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,241
Heat of the moment, an accident.

408
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,912
I'm not like that. Ask anybody.
What I am like

409
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,446
is a guy who's smart enough
to ask for a lawyer.

410
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,550
No problem.

411
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,426
What's with the formalwear?

412
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:46,003
Little light reading you got there.

413
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:49,098
What are you, like a first-year
psychology student or something?

414
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,266
Sort of... not first-year, though.

415
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,834
I'm Lance.

416
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:59,566
Very phallic name you got there.

417
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:05,865
My name's Payne. And if
your name's as accurate as mine,

418
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,200
then we should
get better acquainted.

419
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,379
Well, that's...

420
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,249
I have a girlfriend, I'm sorry.

421
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,577
So, I have a boyfriend, but
he's not coming to this movie.

422
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:20,254
Is your girlfriend?

423
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:25,142
We're just talking, right?

424
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:30,815
- All be it somewhat suggestively.
- So, I'll change the subject.

425
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:35,185
Do you like my tattoos?

426
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Very much.

427
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:41,644
I've always enjoyed calligraphy.

428
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:52,412
What is that,
ten centimeters in length?

429
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,647
- Twelve.
- One of us needs to relieve Sweets.

430
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,431
I got to write a report up on this.

431
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,587
There's a lip here.
I'm thinking a smooth, rounded edge.

432
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,819
Sweets said he had an
appointment he can't miss.

433
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,674
Follow me on this.
The mailman

434
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,272
is delivering his package

435
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,088
to the lady of the house,
if you catch my drift,

436
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,340
the husband comes home, finds
the nearest blunt instrument,

437
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:15,201
which is a cast iron frying pan.

438
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:16,465
And wham!

439
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:21,455
The postman who rang twice
never rang again.

440
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,277
That totally works.

441
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:25,277
If the husband is a peacock wrangler

442
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:27,905
who fights crickets after
work in a Creeping Red

443
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,478
- Fescue field.
- Peacock?

444
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,659
What I thought was silk
turns out to be the thread

445
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,610
from the after-feather of a peacock.

446
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:36,288
Your particulates
always ruining the day for me.

447
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:38,405
I'm gonna go relieve Sweets.

448
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,863
If anyone asks, tell them I'm....

449
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:43,627
defligisterizing Tachymosis
Franklangellacum.

450
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,841
Is that a real thing?
Or are you just trying to be funny?

451
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,531
'Cause that didn't sound real.

452
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:52,263
At all.

453
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,315
This is Steve Rifton's winning tape.

454
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,416
- How many times have you watched this?
- I'm not watching it.

455
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,062
- I'm analyzing it.
- And?

456
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,479
Uninterrupted control track,
which means no tampering.

457
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,754
The only thing you
seeis the game playing.

458
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,541
No hands, no audio, just the screen.

459
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,780
For three hours.

460
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,293
This perfect game has been
downloaded and watched

461
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,106
hundreds of thousands of times

462
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:14,942
by expert gaming eyes.

463
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,358
Not one anal-retentive,

464
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:19,067
detail-oriented,

465
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:21,416
paranoid geek is calling foul, so...

466
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,891
Can I see the last part?

467
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:26,257
The last stage of the game
is called the "kill screen."

468
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:31,467
Three hours of his life
to get to this point.

469
00:24:31,592 --> 00:24:32,804
Flipping the monkey.

470
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,607
Wait... can you play that again?

471
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:39,894
What do you see?

472
00:24:40,198 --> 00:24:43,798
The injuries the monkey suffers
are the same as the victim's.

473
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,540
Oh, my God.

474
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,437
Sometimes I taste salt

475
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,439
in my mouth when there isn't any.

476
00:25:00,606 --> 00:25:02,583
What mental illness do I have?

477
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,876
Do you taste salt now?

478
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,870
You tell me.

479
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,953
- Who's your friend?
- This is Tory Payne.

480
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,348
This is Jack Hodgins.

481
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,998
I'm sorry, I should have called you.

482
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,063
There's a sudden opening
in my schedule.

483
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,567
This doesn't have anything to do
with Fisher's double digits?

484
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,380
Of course not.

485
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:33,197
That is not this situation.

486
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:35,991
You need anything, just call me.

487
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,827
No, I'm good.
We're good.

488
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,025
Salt.

489
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,886
Did the blood come from our victim?

490
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,555
It seems to have come
from a number of people,

491
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,579
and it's been totally
degraded by a liquid.

492
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:01,893
- What liquid?
- Mostly cola.

493
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,483
Here's the mikrosil cast
of the wound, Dr. Brennan.

494
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,330
I don't see any
protuberances on the machine

495
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:11,962
that correspond to the
shape of the wound.

496
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:14,530
Also, no sign of crickets,

497
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,900
grass seed or peacock feathers.

498
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,371
The particulates Dr. Hodgins found.

499
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,829
Those particulates were
found in the head wound?

500
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:25,583
Is there anything on this machine
that could explain the groin wound?

501
00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:28,089
There's an access panel
at groin level.

502
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,583
- I don't see anything.
- Shall I get an ALS?

503
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,959
I don't see how something
could pop out of there,

504
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,428
stab our victim and
then withdraw again.

505
00:26:38,412 --> 00:26:40,271
- Are you all right?
- That was dumb.

506
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:44,101
I just jammed my hand against
the bottom of the control stick.

507
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,603
The dimensions and the
shape are very similar

508
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,377
to the marks on the victim's pelvis.

509
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:52,131
This isn't long enough to pass through
the abdominal wall and the intestines.

510
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:54,418
Billy Gabel had a whole supply

511
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:56,378
of this piping at his workshop.

512
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,069
Uncut. 

513
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:07,185
Hey, Pong Boy.

514
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:08,626
Now what?

515
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,142
Get your hands off everything.
Got a search warrant.

516
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:13,673
Are you guys following me?

517
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:15,799
Some babe, Billy?

518
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,302
- You knew her all along.
- I'm not allowed to fix my game?

519
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:20,928
Billy's the only one
with first-generation Qbert parts.

520
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:24,224
It seems to me that you two
had reason to get rid of Steve.

521
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,768
I didn't have to kill him.

522
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,380
I got a nice rack, a cute ass, and
can wipe out anyone at Punky Pong.

523
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:31,995
Right, except for Steve,
which is why you two teamed up.

524
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,880
She's just here for parts.

525
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,694
These are the types of piping
congruent with the wounds

526
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:43,827
on Fisher's hand
and the victim's groin.

527
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,037
Pipe.

528
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,858
Okay, bag that.
Bag the pipe.

529
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:52,820
An actual shrink.

530
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:54,109
That is so

531
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:56,188
so hot.

532
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:59,631
But you know my profession
doesn't really preclude me

533
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,543
from my fascination with sci-fi

534
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,931
and fantasy.
Really?

535
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:08,325
Does this tent zipper
have a lock on it?

536
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,358
There's no kind of privacy here...

537
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,527
Gosh, you really have fleet fingers.

538
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,073
- I've got a girlfriend.
- Yeah, so you said.

539
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,525
That shouldn't have happened.

540
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,044
- Why did that happen?
- I know, it's like

541
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,448
that one scene in Mimic where
you're in a hot kiss one minute,

542
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:39,314
and then the next, you're getting
your brain sucked out by a mutant.

543
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:44,256
I'm sorry, I got to make a call.

544
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:48,651
Would it help you get over
this whole girlfriend thing

545
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,763
if maybe you saw my tattoos again?

546
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,645
<i>Where are you guys?
I need backup.</i>

547
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,382
You told me to get lost, so now,

548
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,166
<i>I got to test the tensile
strength of the...</i>

549
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,781
Please, I need to be released.

550
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:03,074
Relieved.

551
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,242
Please.

552
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,743
Sorry, Doctor.

553
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:08,579
Oh, and save me a Meat Tart.

554
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,273
Bye now!

555
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,174
That was...

556
00:29:13,658 --> 00:29:15,836
Emergency, family emergency.

557
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,717
This could be an anomaly
of the scaphoid.

558
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:23,761
Magnify that, please.

559
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,430
Looks like resorption.

560
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:29,308
- What could have caused that?
- A cyst.

561
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,644
The victim had De
Quervain's tenosynovitis...

562
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,688
a painful condition caused
by extreme stress on the wrist.

563
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,395
- Which means?
- Billy Gabel was correct.

564
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,023
Steve Rifton must have cheated.

565
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:41,086
On the date the videotape was made,

566
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:43,406
he would not be capable
of playing the game.

567
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:56,168
Brennan found five types of
piping of the same dimensions...

568
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,249
Aluminum, brass, steel,

569
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:01,508
stainless steel and copper.

570
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,427
I'm testing to see if any of
them shatter under pressure.

571
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,418
Well, so far, they just bend.

572
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:10,529
Tensile strength is 760 megapascals.

573
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:15,312
So far, I've tried torsion,
impact, and got nothing more

574
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,960
than bending and denting.

575
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:19,593
So, the pelvic injuries
couldn't have been caused

576
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,236
by the piping we found
in Billy's workshop.

577
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:27,216
I'm tattooed on your arm.

578
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,989
We're looking for
a more brittle substance.

579
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:32,655
Ange, it's not what you think.

580
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,443
What I think is that there's
a very large tattoo of me

581
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,787
that's indelibly
affixed to your skin.

582
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,033
I'm going to flee right now.

583
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:45,474
I didn't do it.

584
00:30:46,824 --> 00:30:48,358
Wait a minute.
My dad?

585
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,765
My father did that to you?

586
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,321
Let's just say, I think
he was trying to prove a point.

587
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,539
I am so going to kick
his Texan bad ass.

588
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:59,440
You... You need to get that removed.

589
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,025
- Why?
- Because we are

590
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,069
not together anymore,
and I don't want you sweating

591
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,799
all over my face, and I-I...

592
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:07,808
You need to get that lasered.

593
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,973
Why are you avoiding me?

594
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:18,792
Doctor, it's just sex.

595
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:21,826
I know, it's just
the combination of Meat Tarts

596
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:24,858
and boxed wine
has gotten me a little queasy.

597
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:26,634
Sorry.

598
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,513
You okay?

599
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,224
Yeah, I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

600
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:36,371
- This is Fisher.
- Are you a shrink, too?

601
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,729
Forensic anthropologist.

602
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,982
He works with the dead.

603
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
The dead?

604
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:46,111
- Really?
- What can I say?

605
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:48,731
I can relate to the boundary
between this existence

606
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:51,551
and whatever screaming,
cold hell comes next.

607
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:55,371
Do you want to see my tattoos?

608
00:31:58,128 --> 00:31:59,510
I love that poem.

609
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:14,431
I analyzed the game's chip.

610
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:16,780
Since the programming
is from the '80s,

611
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:18,556
it's pretty basic, but still...

612
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:20,673
One would certainly
need to be in command

613
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:22,464
of their rapid cycling beta level,

614
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:24,900
as well as being
exceptionally dexterous.

615
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,368
Which, according to you,
Steve Rifton was not.

616
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:33,075
The computer has
played a perfect game.

617
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,683
So, this is the second time

618
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:37,329
that this machine was played
to the perfect game.

619
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,039
The first time
was Steve Rifton's perfect game.

620
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,242
If Steve Rifton
played a perfect game,

621
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,810
he had to have done it before
he developed tenosynovitis.

622
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,497
That makes sense.

623
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:49,550
Can you pull up the videotape
showing this perfect game?

624
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,597
Could you freeze it, please?

625
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:56,557
What do you see?

626
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,500
These are not the same machine.

627
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,249
Sweetie, these look identical.

628
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:05,126
No, see here?

629
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:08,683
This banana has exposed
central and lateral incisors

630
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:11,801
as well as a white section
of peeled epicarp.

631
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,935
The teeth and the peel?

632
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,701
Who would notice that?

633
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,921
Me. I'm extraordinarily observant.

634
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:23,002
So, this is the same machine
that was in the photo.

635
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,381
But not the same one
as in the videotape.

636
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,795
See?

637
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:31,175
No incisors
and yellow epicarp section.

638
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,775
Steve Rifton cheated.

639
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,278
He didn't play the winning
game on this machine.

640
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,849
What other machine
do you think he had access to?

641
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:40,735
Dougie Seeger's.

642
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,512
The autistic boy.

643
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,148
This is Dougie's machine.

644
00:33:52,273 --> 00:33:55,044
This is the one that The Ref bought
from our murder victim.

645
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:57,542
We have photographic
evidence that our victim

646
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,203
actually played a perfect
game on his own machine.

647
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:03,140
- Maybe the photo there is doctored?
- Angela says no.

648
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:05,986
Who wants to know
about peacock poop?

649
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,214
Not the greatest opening, but...

650
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:14,014
I was looking
at this thing all wrong.

651
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,513
I kept asking myself, how do feathers,
graminoid seeds, and insect legs

652
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,236
get onto the same blunt weapon?

653
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:21,613
That is exactly the question
we need answered.

654
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,435
Sometimes peacock feathers are

655
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,105
in peacock poop because
they preen themselves.

656
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:28,685
The Indian Blue Peacock,
to be precise.

657
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,392
The murder weapon was dipped in
Indian Blue Peacock excrement.

658
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:35,030
- <i>Pavo cristatus.</i>
- Why would the murderer

659
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,075
dip his weapon into
peacock excrement?

660
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,327
What if he didn't do it on purpose?
Check this out.

661
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,787
The only two places

662
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,827
with Indian Blue Peacock are the
United States Botanic Gardens

663
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,992
and the Annapolis
Valley Golf Course.

664
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:49,669
The murder weapon
could have been a golf club.

665
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,088
That would also explain
the crickets and fescue.

666
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,049
Let's see which one of our suspects
golfs at Annapolis Valley.

667
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,305
Who deserves a little
love here, huh?

668
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,130
A little love? Just a...

669
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:01,890
If that's all, I've really gotta go.
King of the Lab!

670
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:10,686
Why are you standing over here?

671
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,410
What?

672
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:22,002
So, he pitched his tent
when you didn't?

673
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:24,620
If by "pitch his tent," you mean...

674
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,884
- That's what he did.
- It's not a toy!

675
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:29,168
He said that in the
short amount time that I've been

676
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:32,375
with Daisy, he pitched his tent
with seven women.

677
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:33,942
Yeah, but, come on.

678
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:37,189
Fisher, he only ever pitches
his tent once with each woman.

679
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:40,062
You... you're the kind of guy,
you don't just pitch a tent,

680
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:41,794
you homestead the land.

681
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,809
So he's the rock star
and I'm the farmer? That's great.

682
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,945
Sweets, let's do
the math here, okay?

683
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,505
Fisher's seven women
versus your one Daisy.

684
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:55,322
Seven one-night stands,
let's give him the benefit of the doubt,

685
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,633
and say that he's had
sex, what? 21 times.

686
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,441
Now, rough estimate...

687
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:02,629
how many times have you
and Daisy pitched a tent?

688
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:06,914
Daisy and I are together
approximately

689
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,699
five nights a week,
so that's ten times a week,

690
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:12,445
over seven months,
you add in the mornings...

691
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,772
Silent math.

692
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,571
You got a number?
Don't... tell me.

693
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,595
- Is it more than 21?
- It's way more than 21.

694
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:25,556
Quality of the experience... it's much
more important than the quantity.

695
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,038
Everybody get your tickets out!

696
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:31,450
We are going in.

697
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,665
Everybody step in!

698
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,762
Should we
tell Fisher we're going in?

699
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:41,144
Screw him.

700
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,288
But he's going to miss the movie.

701
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,015
Serves him right.

702
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:50,079
If you were in my shoes,
you would've gone for it, wouldn't you?

703
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:51,461
You kidding me?

704
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:54,083
- Did you see those tattoos?
- Oh, epic.

705
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,332
Oh! There we go!

706
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:01,480
Why do you want my golf clubs?

707
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:04,210
I mean, you're a member
of Annapolis Valley, right?

708
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,583
For three years.

709
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:08,021
My golf clubs are in here somewhere.

710
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,659
I don't get out there
as much as I'd like.

711
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,814
Dougie stands there,
waiting for his machine.

712
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,774
I'd like to get it back
as soon as possible.

713
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,398
You're very cooperative.

714
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:21,071
Graphite shafts.

715
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,078
These would snap.
We're looking for a broken shaft.

716
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:27,119
- It would explain the stabbing wound.
- Any of them damaged?

717
00:37:29,111 --> 00:37:31,150
None of these is the murder weapon.

718
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:35,337
You think I killed the postman?
Why would I do that?

719
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,968
Perhaps it's a coincidence that

720
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:40,716
Mr. Seeger is a member of that golf.
Perhaps we should

721
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,406
check out the possibilities
at the Botanic Garden.

722
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:45,189
Where's your three iron?

723
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,896
- Never needed one.
- What... three iron?

724
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:51,518
A course like Annapolis...

725
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:53,713
you would definitely need a
three iron.

726
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,138
So, where is it?

727
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,767
My son only ever had one thing.

728
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:23,077
One thing his whole life.

729
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:26,927
Dougie can't even speak.

730
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,959
Do you understand?

731
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,430
He looks at me or my wife,

732
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:36,578
there's no glimmer of recognition.

733
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:40,131
But that machine...

734
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,161
It turns on, makes that noise.

735
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,578
And he gets this look on his face.

736
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:52,287
Maybe you wouldn't notice it in
a regular kid, but I know what it is.

737
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:53,733
It's joy.

738
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,596
And this guy, this-this mailman,

739
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,755
he watches Dougie play
a perfect game.

740
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,839
And then, next thing you know,

741
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,264
he's on TV, saying
he played the perfect game.

742
00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:07,178
It's a miracle.

743
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:13,485
That's too much of a
coincidence for me.

744
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:18,429
You accosted him with
your own golf club.

745
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,607
You scared him
into telling the truth.

746
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:24,181
He admitted it.
He said he videotaped Dougie.

747
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,948
But he refused to credit Dougie.

748
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,701
- I lost it.
- You beat him...

749
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,057
with your golf club and
when the head broke off,

750
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:34,803
you stabbed him with it.

751
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,853
The only thing my boy has
in this world... one thing...

752
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:41,049
this man stole it from him.

753
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,074
It wasn't right.

754
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:17,102
It's not as crazy as you think.
I'm a father, so I sort of understand.

755
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:21,175
I can't imagine you killing someone
for stealing credit from Parker.

756
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,669
Not kill someone, but...

757
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,249
threaten 'em.

758
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:27,316
Even about something as frivolous
as bragging rights to a video game?

759
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:32,971
All right, how-how
do we choose who goes first?

760
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,902
- Go ahead, you go first.
- Why?

761
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:37,184
Because once I start
I ain't going to stop.

762
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:43,440
Besides, it's not how the dad feels,
it's how the son feels.

763
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,380
We're discussing the murder again?

764
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,153
Someone breaks your kid's heart,

765
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,870
your own heart rises up,

766
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,594
gets fierce.

767
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:55,581
Just a natural response.

768
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:59,007
There's a flaw in your reasoning.

769
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:03,585
I believe that due to my superior
learning curve,

770
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,494
I can beat you at this game,
despite your superlative strength

771
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:08,153
and your remarkable reflexes.

772
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,938
How-How do start the game?

773
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,405
What's the flaw in my reasoning?

774
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,969
Dougie Seeger is autistic.

775
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,817
He didn't care.

776
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:22,479
His heart wasn't broken.

777
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,856
So the dad loved him twice as much.

778
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,651
You don't like
the reasoning of my math.

779
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,071
I've realized recently that you
use a different number system.

780
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,317
Like the Babylonians,
which was base 60.

781
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,661
I don't understand your system,

782
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,014
but I can see that it works.

783
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:49,348
How do I start the game?

784
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,645
Here you go.

785
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:57,404
A quarter.

786
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:01,865
Knock 'em dead.

787
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,522
I will.
I will knock you dead.

788
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:09,109
I will prove you wrong!

789
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,277
Big words.

790
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,588
Level one, baby.

791
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,519
- What happened?
- My turn.

792
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:18,076
It's not your turn. What do you mean?
It just stopped.

793
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,127
Step aside.

794
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:20,581
- Go sit.
- I didn't lose.

795
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,623
You put the quarter
in, the game's over...

796
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:28,633
