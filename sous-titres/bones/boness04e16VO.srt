1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,453
We love you guys!

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,626
Dale and Ellie met at base camp
on Mt. Everest two years ago,

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,350
so you know that they are comfortable
with life's ups and downs.

4
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:22,129
But know that your love will allow you
to absorb these with new strength

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,399
as you are joined for life
in holy matrimony.

6
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,827
Do you, Dale McGilliard,
take Ellie Spiller

7
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,431
to be your wife in sickness
and in health,

8
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:35,117
through good times and bad,
till death do you part?

9
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,377
I do.

10
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:38,954
And do you, Ellie,
take Dale as your husband in...

11
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,373
I do, I do, I do.

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,499
Then by the powers vested in me
by the State of Maryland,

13
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:45,297
I pronounce you man and wife.

14
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:48,631
Kiss and take the plunge
into married bliss.

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,864
Well, my guess is, that this is going
to put a crimp in their wedding night.

16
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,091
- Why?
- Come on,

17
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:13,948
Coming face-to-face
with death like that,

18
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,030
kind of kills the desire,
don't you think?

19
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,428
I work with remains every day
but if I'm sexually attracted to someone

20
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:21,871
I'm perfectly capable of engaging
in spirited...

21
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:24,955
Okay, Bones, I get it.
I'm just saying, you know what?

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,920
You have to be kind of crazy
to bungee jump. Watch yourself.

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,131
I got it.
It's perfectly safe.

24
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,699
Tell that to Captain Splat
over here.

25
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:36,095
- First bungee accident I ever saw.
- Probably because you're ten.

26
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,848
This was no bungee accident.

27
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:42,601
The victim is fairly well-dressed,
tie, sport coat.

28
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,145
Definitely not bungee attire.

29
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,253
And this compound tibial fracture,

30
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:50,067
if he was still alive when he fell,
the bone should have bled.

31
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,547
Meaning...?

32
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:54,572
Meaning someone threw him off the cliff
after he was already dead.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,783
Yeah, suspicious circumstances,
foul play, dirty deeds...

34
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,305
I think you get the point.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,287
Let's get it back to Jeffersonian

36
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,621
- Right.
- Gloves.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,623
Right. Wrap that up, kid.

38
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:14,018
Took 10 minutes to hike down to the foot
of the cliff to find the body.

39
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:17,646
Local fauna include a wide
variety of birds, rodents and crabs,

40
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,889
all of which
have had a go at the remains.

41
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,360
Fascinating that one would risk

42
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,375
intraocular hemorrhaging,
peroneal nerve damage,

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,021
not to mention quadriplegia,

44
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,940
just to experience
a simple beta-endorphin rush.

45
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,269
What fascinates me
is that we've ruled out death

46
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,403
by bungee and yet
you remain fascinated.

47
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:37,357
Okay, I'm ready to start
the facial reconstruction.

48
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,130
Gross.

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,683
This is really gross.
I'm going to come back.

50
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,304
Dental X-rays indicate the victim
was undergoing dental restoration

51
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,833
for abfraction lesions
on his molars.

52
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,044
Heavy grinder.
High stress job?

53
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,380
I'll send pictures to Booth,
see if he can check with local dentists.

54
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,147
Dr. Brennan, there is staing

55
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,419
on this Le Fort 1 fracture.

56
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:02,257
Hemorrhaging
into the maxillary sinuses.

57
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,265
Classic...

58
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,352
punch in the nose at
or around the time of death.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,938
Which would be between
two to five days ago.

60
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,167
If this body's been dead
more than five days,

61
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,405
the tissue shows
a much higher rate of decomp.

62
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,440
I got late second instar Phormia regina
and Chrysomya rufifacies.

63
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,361
Which, I admit, seems weird, but

64
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,369
my little squads of death don't lie.

65
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,691
Forgive me, Doctors, but...

66
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,509
is his skin moving?

67
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,209
God, that's strange.

68
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,201
- Insect activity?
- Never seen insects like that.

69
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,256
Except in Alien.

70
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,341
I'm secreting adrenaline.

71
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,401
I guess we should see what's inside.

72
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,892
What the hell is that?

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,228
I have no idea.
Everyone, away from the body!

74
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,372
We're in lockdown.

75
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:09,498
Bones - Season 4 Episode 17
"The Bones That Foam"

76
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,501
Synchro: ShalimarFox

77
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,149
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

78
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:47,661
- Do you have any idea what the foam is?
- No idea at all.

79
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,691
But we could be dealing with a poison,
a virus, or a biotoxin.

80
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,074
So no one touches or...

81
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,103
sniffs it or anything else
until we've run tests.

82
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:58,605
This is a first for me.

83
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,051
Perhaps if Mr. Nigel-Murray and I
could examine the bones...

84
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:05,262
I'm annoying you.

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,120
Patience, Dr. Brennan.

86
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,705
Curiosity killed the cat.

87
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,874
I'm running the bugs
through the Mass Spec.

88
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,563
I'm not getting any toxins, but
they might not have fed on the remains.

89
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:17,191
In other words, I need more samples.

90
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,358
- We all need more samples.
- I know.

91
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,270
I would just like us all to stay alive
during the process.

92
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:25,516
In 400 BC, Hypocrites declared that

93
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,785
disease was not caused by demons.

94
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,168
Great. So we can rule out demons.

95
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,915
Alex Newcomb, 33.

96
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:35,118
The FBI got an ID off his dentals.

97
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:38,212
The dentist has the brother listed
as the emergency contact.

98
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,171
Perhaps you should help Agent Booth
question the victim's brother.

99
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:45,970
I'll call when you can have access
to the remains.

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,138
Service Department, you've got
a customer waiting, line three.

101
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:02,934
- I thought the guy was dead.
- He is dead, but his skin was moving.

102
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:05,596
Wait a second.
Moving skin on a dead guy?

103
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,482
Yes. Then he started foaming.

104
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:08,807
Wait a second.

105
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,353
Foaming? Okay,
what would cause that?

106
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,002
Too much beer?
Or maybe he ate soap?

107
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:17,038
You should stop using cartoons
as a scientific reference point.

108
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:20,472
Okay, you know the guy
who owns this place, he has a monkey.

109
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:23,791
Does he feel that a monkey
will inspire me to buy a car?

110
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,050
Bones, it's marketing, okay.
Look, "We don't sell cars..."

111
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,675
"We sell adventure!"

112
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:33,017
So, what can the Mighty Mo
put you in today?

113
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:38,274
- You look like a sporty two-door man.
- Actually, he has a very nice car.

114
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,899
I'll say.
That Sequoia's a honey.

115
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,823
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Roomy enough,

116
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:46,071
you could have a Super Bowl party back
there. What is that, GPS, side air bags.

117
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,278
- We're looking for...
- Such great gas mileage for,

118
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,097
you know, a can-do machine.

119
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,328
- Are you looking to trade in?
- No, we're looking...

120
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,243
Because I can offer you a sweet deal

121
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,791
from the heart of the jungle.

122
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,753
We're here to see Chet Newcomb.

123
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,225
Between us, as much as
we all love Chet,

124
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:10,038
as Bwana of the Month, I'm really in
a better position to offer you a deal.

125
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,384
- So...
- Right. And that'd be great, Mighty Mo,

126
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,975
if we were here to buy a car,
but we're not.

127
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,809
You know, FBI.

128
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,466
- Well, he's back there.
- Thank you.

129
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,263
What?
She roared me first.

130
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:29,862
Doesn't mean
you have to roar her back.

131
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:32,367
The doctor said you have to take
all of these on a full stomach.

132
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:34,983
Desmo...

133
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:37,953
- Desmopress...
- Desmopressin?

134
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,166
- Do you have kidney problems?
- No, it's just a,

135
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:42,984
slight infection.
Hi.

136
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,804
What can I do for you today?

137
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,230
With the FBI. I'd like to ask you
a few questions, you know...

138
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,179
in private.

139
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:54,788
This is my wife, Vanessa.

140
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:57,523
How do you do, ma'am?
Pleasure to meet you. We just,

141
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:59,259
have to have a few words.

142
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,826
Well, I was just going.
I have a fitting anyway...

143
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,876
a client waiting
on a bridesmaid's dress.

144
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,234
You might want to stay.

145
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,849
Booth has some bad news about
your husband's brother.

146
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:10,030
He may need consoling.

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,866
- Wasn't that sensitive?
- What happened to my brother?

148
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:16,180
He was found at the base of a cliff
at Whitney Cove.

149
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:17,204
Oh, my God.

150
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,858
I told him he that was crazy
to try that bungee thing.

151
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:21,583
There was an accident?

152
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,901
No. He was...

153
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,005
What's a sensitive way
of saying murdered?

154
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,271
Murdered?!

155
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:30,217
Sorry.
When you're ready,

156
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,568
we'd like to ask you a few questions
about your brother.

157
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:33,971
He was murdered?

158
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,515
Yeah, we're very sorry
for your loss.

159
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,360
Where was the last place
your brother worked?

160
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,231
Until a couple of weeks ago
he worked... he worked here.

161
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,277
Then he left and he went to work
for Criterion across the street.

162
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,696
Can you think of anyone
who wanted to do him harm?

163
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,464
He was a car salesman.

164
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:56,118
Jungle Jim and Alex
got into it pretty bad when Alex quit.

165
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,664
Perimortem fractures
on the victim's parietal.

166
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:16,278
Cause of death?

167
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,516
No, though, you know,
might stun him for a moment.

168
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,853
Is there any chance we can remove
the remains from the iso-tank?

169
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,755
I can't get a definitive
reading yet.

170
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,782
I have organic matter,
from the victim

171
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,109
and numerous creatures
that took a piece from him.

172
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,571
I'm running test for viruses that
could've been transmitted from animals.

173
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,115
Dr. Saroyan, the bones,
there's more foam.

174
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,201
- Where?
- It's spreading.

175
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,660
Originating from where?

176
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,539
The Chinese throw away 900 billion
chopsticks every year.

177
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:46,105
- Any relevance whatsoever?
- No, no, none.

178
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,879
I'm just...
I'm a tad disoriented.

179
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,049
So when you spout facts,
it's your way of maintaing focus.

180
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,022
Facts are the stitches that hold
the fabric of existence together.

181
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:59,348
In that case, is it individual
chopsticks or pairs?

182
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,010
Individual.

183
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,943
The foam is coming
from inside the bones themselves.

184
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,565
Through the periosteum.

185
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,383
Alex Newcomb.

186
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:21,119
- That's terrible.
- Is that thing tame?

187
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,177
Banas?

188
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,414
He ain't flung poo
since I bought him this hat.

189
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:28,586
Alex.

190
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,755
He was one ornery son of a bitch,
but what a salesman.

191
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:35,008
- Why did he quit working here?
- He didn't quit. I fired him.

192
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,427
He was Bwana of the Month
every month for over two years.

193
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,557
The last two, he dropped
to bwana number three.

194
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,469
I told him if he didn't pick it up,
we'd have to reduce his commissions.

195
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:46,626
I mean, why pay top bwana money
for a number three bwana?

196
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,772
And how did he react?

197
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:55,882
This is tough to talk about.
It's just tough.

198
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:03,706
He shoved Banas off my shoulders.

199
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:06,071
Just... shoved him.

200
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,209
I've been waiting for an apology.

201
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,757
I would've taken him back
if he'd just apologized to Banas.

202
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:15,220
- Apologize to a monkey?
- He's got a heart just like you and me.

203
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,925
I think it shows a basic lack
of humanity to push a monkey.

204
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,846
No wonder somebody killed him.

205
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,052
Alex shoved Jungle Jim's monkey?

206
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:25,892
There's your motive. That man has
an unnatural attachment to his monkey.

207
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,228
Everyone knows
you don't touch the monkey.

208
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,188
We need some actual evidence.

209
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,857
What can you tell us about Alex?

210
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,734
Alex was a very good salesman.

211
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,986
You see, in the one month,
he broke every sales record we had.

212
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,114
Buddy, is it?
Looks like he took your spot.

213
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey, family business, man.
It's all good.

214
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,086
My God,

215
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:44,994
this is such tragedy.

216
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:47,456
How did his, brother take the news?

217
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:49,958
Oh, you, you know Chet?

218
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,361
Sure, Alex wanted me to hire him.

219
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:54,463
But now I feel bad that I could not.

220
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,073
- Why couldn't you?
- The poor man is sick.

221
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:59,743
- I need a strong man to sell my cars.
- Why?

222
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:03,096
'Cause you want to buy a car
from a guy who's, you know, vital.

223
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,348
Makes a...

224
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,059
a man feel like, you know,
he's on the winning team,

225
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,394
makes a woman feel
all protected and safe.

226
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,688
- That makes no sense.
- No, I believe he's correct.

227
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,231
As do I, yeah.

228
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,816
Did Alex have any enemies?

229
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,153
- Lemon guy.
- Lemon guy.

230
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,447
Is that another car dealer?

231
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,741
No. Angry customer
took a golf club...

232
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,660
Like that to Alex's windshield.

233
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,049
- Seven iron.
- No, it was a nine iron.

234
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,174
Oh, yeah.

235
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:31,929
He said Alex, sold him a lemon car.

236
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:35,212
- Bashed in Alex's ride.
- Did Alex sell him a lemon?

237
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,597
No way.
We are a class act.

238
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:40,322
Yeah, that's simply not
how we roll, man.

239
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:47,380
Every serologic and biologic diagnostic
I've run comes up the same...

240
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:50,056
no drugs, viruses, poisons.

241
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:54,079
Mine show no evidence of arsenic,
ethylene glycol or cyanide.

242
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:56,608
- No signs of any toxins.
- Then...

243
00:12:57,294 --> 00:12:59,069
we could let him out?

244
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:05,325
But we proceed with extreme caution.

245
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,495
In the Dark Ages,

246
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,273
it was believed that holding
wine in the mouth

247
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,800
while breathing through the nose
would prevent the plague.

248
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:25,011
That's the best idea I've heard today.
Does it work with tequila?

249
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,493
- What?
- This bone is,

250
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:34,229
it's gone quite soft.
Gelatinous.

251
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,857
- I believe it's disintegrating.
- We're losing our evidence?

252
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,775
How much time do we have?

253
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,361
- Tell me a little known fact.
- What?

254
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:45,513
Did you know that the international
telephone dialing code

255
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:47,159
for Antarctica is 672?

256
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,035
Did you know that, Mr. Nigel-Murray?

257
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,534
I did not.

258
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,509
I estimate that we are losing

259
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,180
approximately 12% bone mass
every hour.

260
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:56,377
Which means...

261
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,002
We could lose our evidence long
before we solve our murder.

262
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,836
Nice grip on this iron.
So,

263
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,146
is this the type of club
that you used to

264
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,315
bash in Alex Newcomb's windshield?

265
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,243
Hey, this guy took my money.

266
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,445
And when there was a problem,
it was like I didn't even exist.

267
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:26,573
He's lucky the only thing
you went after was his windshield.

268
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,087
That isn't what Booth really thinks?

269
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,445
No, no.
Booth sees that the man

270
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,581
is humiliated
and he displays empathy.

271
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,666
So, lying.

272
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,212
Manipulating.
Much like the car salesmen.

273
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,650
I used to teach psychological
techniques to car salesmen

274
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,257
to make money for grad school.

275
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:48,345
Not one of my finest moments.

276
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,163
A lemon is a car that craps out

277
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,224
on you 3 months to a year
after you buy it.

278
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,220
I didn't get more than ten miles off
that lot when the brakes failed.

279
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,521
That's not a lemon;
that's a death trap.

280
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,800
- Yeah, you feared for your life.
- No, not my life, my kid...

281
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:03,445
who was in the backseat,
four years old,

282
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,278
he cracked a rib, he...

283
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,782
... hit his head, he got stitches.

284
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,244
I mean, you expect a car like that
to be safe.

285
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,167
- That's damn right.
- Yeah, right? I got a kid.

286
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:18,083
If someone endangered his life,
I'd kill the guy.

287
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:19,899
Wait...

288
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,796
Somebody killed this guy?

289
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,014
Killed him.

290
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,757
Dead.

291
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:27,803
Hey, look...

292
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:31,705
I busted up his windshield, all right.
Lost my temper.

293
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:34,541
But there is no way

294
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:37,479
I'm gonna let my kid
live without a father.

295
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,069
- I want to do that.
- Do what?

296
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:49,406
Connect to people, like Booth does.
You could teach me.

297
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:51,731
I don't know.

298
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,509
In the spirit of scientific inquiry,

299
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,204
I'd like to see if what you say
about psychology is true.

300
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,498
Did you just dare me, Dr. Brennan?

301
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,558
Hey, got something.

302
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,796
I found some particulates
on our victim's clothing.

303
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,883
Simmondsia chinensis,
mica Red 7 Lake, and Fragaria anassa.

304
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,385
Also known as Lust Dust.

305
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,636
Lust Dust?

306
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,222
On his pants.
His, lap.

307
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,876
Strawberry body glitter.

308
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:22,355
Such as might be utilized
by a lap dancer?

309
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,442
Well, that's something
I can tell Booth.

310
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:29,204
That makes me King of the Lab.

311
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,811
A large percentage of the monarchy
are actually

312
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,542
mentally handicapped
due to inbreeding.

313
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,953
Can't ruin it for me.
King of the Lab!

314
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,875
Bones, look, this is
the only strip club in proximity

315
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,136
to Alex's home and work, all right.

316
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:52,268
You didn't have
to come inside with me.

317
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:54,513
No, I look forward
to observing your behavior.

318
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,999
- My what?
- Sweets says you're manipulative.

319
00:16:57,124 --> 00:17:00,145
Like a salesman.
I want to study your technique.

320
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,339
My technique?
Wait, I'm gonna smack that guy.

321
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:05,120
You put people at ease,
get them to do your bidding.

322
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:06,732
It's a very useful skill.

323
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,675
One I wish my father
had passed on to me.

324
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,076
Look, your father is a con man,
I am not a con man.

325
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:14,229
Let us just remember that.
Okay, just watch. Don't say anything.

326
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,920
Excuse me, ladies, if I may,

327
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:20,789
which one of you likes
to use this stuff?

328
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,208
It's strawberry Lust Dust.

329
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,993
Well, that would be me.

330
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,238
- Strawberry Lust.
- Right. Strawberry Lust.

331
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:31,175
The one and only. I'm sure you thought
long and hard about that stage name?

332
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,885
- We'd like to speak in private.
- No, not in private.

333
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,264
I could just ask you
a few questions here.

334
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,557
Bones, it's a little weird that you're
here watching. Why don't you go outside.

335
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,600
It's not weird, baby.
Lots of people like to watch.

336
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:45,725
Oh, thank you.
I get tremendous satisfaction

337
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,566
out of observing
a whole variety of activities.

338
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,758
I'd just like to ask you
a couple questions.

339
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,842
Your boyfriend's shy, isn't he?

340
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:53,738
Sweet.

341
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,282
- That'll be 60 bucks.
- Okay, I got that.

342
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:57,817
- Bones?
- Here you go.

343
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,544
Thanks.
Hey, relax.

344
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:01,764
She's going to be
enjoying this, too.

345
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,089
Right, just...

346
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:06,577
Whoa, all right.

347
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,678
Not so interested in
talking now, are you, baby?

348
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,723
You have excellent
control of your hips.

349
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:20,974
So I've been told.

350
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:23,887
Miss Lust,

351
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,481
Miss Lust, actually,
I'm with the, FBI.

352
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,982
I need to ask you...

353
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,027
few question about maybe a client?

354
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,080
FBI?

355
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,156
I'm a criminal science major
at Georgetown.

356
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,524
Yeah, and yet,

357
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:40,577
here you are, right?
Working off student loans?

358
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,537
You know it.
School's a fortune.

359
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,749
Well, I think you will pay
off your loans very quickly.

360
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:50,503
She's quite arousing, which I imagine
translates into excellent tips.

361
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:54,090
All right, Miss Lust, Alex Newcomb,

362
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:58,331
Criterion Cars, salesman.

363
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,180
Maybe a client of yours?

364
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,098
Yeah, sure, regular.
What about him?

365
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:06,019
Well, we have evidence
that you, gave him a lap dance

366
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,099
on the night that he died.

367
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:09,892
Died?

368
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,493
- Murdered?
- Can you just answer the...

369
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:19,115
Right, cooperate fully. I aced
my freshman criminology class.

370
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,826
I gave him a couple
of dances Thursday night.

371
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,286
He was pretty drunk.

372
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:26,122
Started a fight
and Billy had to kick him out.

373
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,707
Wait... wait a minute.

374
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,125
Am I a suspect?

375
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,086
Because all I do is gyrate
and that never killed anyone.

376
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,547
Did he get into a fight
with one of the bouncers?

377
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,675
No, with another car salesman.
You know, the Indian guy?

378
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,676
Buddy.

379
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,386
From Criterion.

380
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,304
He lied to you.
You should go talk to Buddy.

381
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,329
Yes, I... I should.

382
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:47,852
Then tell Miss Lust to get up.

383
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,652
I think that might be

384
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:52,524
a little embarrassing
right now, baby?

385
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,442
That's my gun.

386
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:57,971
- Give us a minute?
- OK.

387
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,335
Outside.

388
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:06,996
Did we get
our 60 dollar's worth yet?

389
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,026
We'll start with a simple exercise,

390
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,696
to recognize

391
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,090
emotions from facial expressions.

392
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,093
Then I'll give you skills to deal
with those emotions.

393
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,256
Okay, just give me a moment.

394
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:30,019
You're ill.

395
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,476
Ill?
No, Dr. Brennan, no.

396
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:34,162
Ill is not even an emotion.

397
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:37,051
My brow is furrowed,
mouth slightly open,

398
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:39,571
eyes quizzical.

399
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,125
I'm expressing confusion,
and its corresponding vulnerability.

400
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,329
- What are you confused about?
- That's not important at this point.

401
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:50,171
Now it's just important to recognize

402
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,484
that when someone is vulnerable,
you have the opportunity

403
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,253
to help them feel secure.

404
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,131
Thereby gaing their trust
and forming a relationship.

405
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,899
Having this skill can,

406
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,344
it can enrich
all aspects of your life.

407
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,848
And not just supply the world
with dishonest car salesmen.

408
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,892
No.

409
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:10,752
Let's try another one.

410
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,455
What is wrong?

411
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,002
I... You are very intolerant, Sweets.
I am doing the best that I can.

412
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,425
That's right, that's right,
I was expressing anger.

413
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,027
Excellent recognition.

414
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,199
Very poor response to it, though.

415
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:28,620
- Should I have become physical?
- No.

416
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:32,248
Well, not if you're trying to establish
an emotional connection.

417
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,125
Booth was trained like this?

418
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,252
Some people just have
a natural ability.

419
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:39,174
But, dr. Brennan,

420
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,151
you're a brilliant woman.

421
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:43,259
And you'll get there, okay?

422
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,763
The skull is melting.

423
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:50,953
We can use this c- ring magnifier
to enlarge a greater area.

424
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,378
The fire appears not to have
damaged the remains.

425
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:26,853
How did it start?

426
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:31,280
I see, so we're going with the old
"blame the corpse" defense.

427
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:34,252
I just... I turned on
the c-ring magnifier,

428
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:36,729
and then there was a little pop,
and then...

429
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,969
But if the light
was the ignition source,

430
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,612
that suggests the body
was emitting some kind of gas.

431
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:49,492
Diatomic gases emit a distinctive
ultraviolet hue when they oxidize.

432
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,995
These remains
were emitting hydrogen gas.

433
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,038
Not anymore, it all burned up.

434
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,938
Whatever mysterious process

435
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:59,168
is destroying these bones
emits hydrogen gas as a by-product.

436
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,320
Agent booth...

437
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,149
Is it the FBI's intention
to confiscate our automobile?

438
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:12,542
Oh, no, but, you know, I might be
in the market to buy one, Mr. Shirazi.

439
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,846
Base price starts at $114,000,
agent Booth.

440
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,476
Family money.

441
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,239
Well, please, call me buddy.

442
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:26,946
4.2 liter v8,

443
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:30,199
carbon ceramic brakes
with monobloc brembo calipers.

444
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:31,852
Zero to 60?

445
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,674
4.6 seconds, but...

446
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,100
Please, not during the test drive.

447
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,232
Right.

448
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,194
- You married, buddy?
- Yes, indeed, bro.

449
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,086
Four blissful years, but,

450
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:45,541
I know you must be a bachelor,
because this car is for prowling.

451
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,716
That's right.
I am a bachelor.

452
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,856
I do like to prowl.
I usually head over to that...

453
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,431
That strip club, imperial showgirls

454
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,558
over on, washtenaw.

455
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,311
- Where they have all that lap dancing.
- I don't know that place.

456
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:06,152
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh, god, please...

457
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,197
- Imperial showgirls?
- Did my wife send you?

458
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,076
Okay, please,
I implore you to slow down.

459
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,618
- The railway tracks.
- What?

460
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:16,908
The railway tracks are there,
you must please slow down

461
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:19,947
to five miles an hour before we... OK.
What do you need to know?

462
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,031
You got into a fight
with Alex Newcomb

463
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:24,128
at imperial showgirls
the night he was murdered.

464
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,630
I want to know why.

465
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,174
He stole a client from me.
I punched him in the nose.

466
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,577
- Please, the tracks.
- How do I know you're not lying?

467
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,913
I'm not lying, I swear.
I'm not lying. I'm not a liar.

468
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,348
The tracks! The tracks!
The tracks! The tracks!

469
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:40,311
Thank you, agent Booth.

470
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,896
Thank you.

471
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,725
OK! We were both
thrown out of the club.

472
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,736
I foolishly drove home drunk,
and I apologize. I won't do it again.

473
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,570
- What did Newcomb do?
- I don't know.

474
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:52,698
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

475
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,036
Wait, wait!

476
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:57,203
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

477
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,421
Wait, wait!

478
00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:00,385
Wait, wait.

479
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,967
He... He took a cab.
He told the driver to...

480
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,904
To... to take him back
to Jungle Jim's.

481
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:08,338
He said to me, "screw you
and everyone who works at criterion.

482
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:10,305
I'm going to get my old job back."

483
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:15,211
Right.

484
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:18,013
You know what, this baby
definitely pulls to the right.

485
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:19,632
You have alignment problems.

486
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:22,645
You know what, I'm going to call
my partner and get a ride back.

487
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,320
Did you check with the taxi company?

488
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,636
Oh, yeah. Alex Newcomb,
took a taxi to Jungle Jim's that night,

489
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,160
and the cabbie said
that he was intoxicated.

490
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,674
Do you think that Newcomb

491
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,247
was going to apologize
to the monkey and get his job back?

492
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,791
Yeah, he definitely wanted
to get the monkey off his back.

493
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,692
But the monkey
was on Jungle Jim's back.

494
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,743
Well, alex felt guilty
for leaving his brother all alone

495
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:51,340
at Jungle Jim's.

496
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,052
So Alex Newcomb's brother, Chet Newcomb,
was the monkey on the back.

497
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,975
Oh, you know what, I am getting off
that merry-go-round right now, Bones.

498
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:05,278
Update?

499
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:08,142
I found perimortem colles' fractures

500
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:11,027
on both the right
and left distal radii.

501
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,779
- Possibly from the breaking of a fall.
- Where?

502
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:17,491
- Already dissolved.
- Any definite cause of death?

503
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:22,324
Areas on the left lateral thorax
near the rib fractures show...

504
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:24,556
It's gone.

505
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,542
More evidence is gone?

506
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:28,711
The rate of dissolution
is accelerating.

507
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,005
Are you hearing this, dr. Hodgins?

508
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,315
We're losing the bones.
We have to figure a way

509
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,984
to arrest the destruction of...

510
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,844
Ion chromatography takes time.

511
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,263
Yeah, let's give him a little space.

512
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:43,287
So we know that the bones are dissolving
faster than the rest of the body.

513
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:44,602
Why should that happen?

514
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,854
What do bones have
that the rest of the body doesn't?

515
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,282
Calcium.

516
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,609
Oddly enough, calcium is the fifth
most abundant element in

517
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,589
both the crust of the earth
and the ocean.

518
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:56,547
We're looking for a corrosive
that produces hydrogen gas

519
00:26:56,672 --> 00:26:58,157
when it breaks down calcium.

520
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,177
Fluoride ions
would tear through cells

521
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,411
and soft tissue until
they met up with calcium.

522
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:04,666
All acids contain hydrogen.

523
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:06,862
Hydrofluoric acid.

524
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:10,967
Used in various, pesticides,
rust removers,

525
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:14,505
petrochemical development,
to clean and brighten certain metals.

526
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:17,633
Antacid.

527
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:20,096
You think he's troubled
by indigestion?

528
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,473
Antacid contains
magnesium hydroxide.

529
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,867
If we cover the hydrofluoric acid
in enough magnesium,

530
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:28,060
- it will stop attacking the bones.
- Makes sense... I hope.

531
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:32,149
The first recorded antacid
was an amalgam of ambergris and musk,

532
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,610
though since ambergris could
only be obtained from whales,

533
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,891
it wasn't readily available to all.

534
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,033
Wh... It's working.

535
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,201
Yeah.

536
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,703
What's happening?

537
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:50,307
The good news is that
the bones stopped dissolving.

538
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:52,461
The, bad news is...

539
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:57,619
Our foamy friend
seems to be petrifying

540
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,427
right before our very eyes.

541
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:02,283
Oh, god.

542
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:19,238
Mr. Nigel-murray, perhaps
you and Dr. Hodgins

543
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,738
can figure out a way
to free the victim's remains

544
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:24,076
so that we can discover
cause of death.

545
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,257
Well, how do we do that?
Drop it on the floor like a piggy bank?

546
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:29,566
I suggest we cut off
one of the limbs.

547
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:33,252
One of the less crucial limbs,
of course, and run some tests.

548
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:35,283
Are you serious?

549
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:37,485
No.

550
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,934
- Would it interest you to know...
- No, at this moment,

551
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,509
it... it would not.

552
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,852
Please, booth, I'm ready.

553
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:04,575
One lesson with sweets doesn't turn you
into the master interrogator.

554
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,577
What, is master interrogator
a real thing?

555
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,716
Technically, no.

556
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:11,123
You got to know exactly what you want
to find out when you go in there.

557
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,209
Really, if you can do it, I can.

558
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,628
Seriously.
You think you can do anything I can do?

559
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,628
Not the big, strong, sheerly
physical things, but otherwise...

560
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,967
- Yes.
- Fine, be my guest.

561
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,464
Be the big cheese.

562
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:24,762
Fill the shoes.

563
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,598
Here, take an earpiece in case you,
you know, need help.

564
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,416
Okay, but don't distract me
unnecessarily.

565
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:36,324
- It's all your fault. You know that?
- Why?

566
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,399
You're the one that said yes.

567
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:47,118
I'm Dr. Brennan.

568
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,436
Yeah, I know.

569
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:50,454
We met, like, five times.

570
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,166
Together, you and I are going
to help each other out here.

571
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,002
If by "help," you mean
put me in the electric chair.

572
00:29:57,323 --> 00:30:00,797
Was that a confession?
Because it sounded like a confession.

573
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:03,259
No, no, no, I was...
I was being...

574
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:07,201
Are you serious?

575
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,223
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,309
Did you enjoy sex with Alex Newcomb?

577
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:14,038
No, I did not.

578
00:30:15,657 --> 00:30:18,461
It was over too quick, and he didn't
put enough weight on his elbows.

579
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:21,123
So... You admit
to a sexual relationship?

580
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:23,297
No, no.
No, once again, I was...

581
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,906
I was joking, so...

582
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,991
No.

583
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:31,078
- We just worked together.
- Where were you last thursday night?

584
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,538
Bowling.

585
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,039
Did you kill Alex Newcomb?

586
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:36,025
No.

587
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,619
Did you?

588
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
No.

589
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:42,613
Will you just...

590
00:30:42,738 --> 00:30:46,171
Ask her if Alex Newcomb
ever stole any of her customers.

591
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,471
Did Alex ever skate
any of your sales?

592
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:50,444
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he did.

593
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,931
I'd have referrals
come in on my days off,

594
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,455
- and he would tell them I'd been fired.
- That's terrible.

595
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,189
Look, the only person that
he really cared about was his brother.

596
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,065
How do you know?

597
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,527
Why do you think Alex went
from number one to number three?

598
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,709
He punted sales to his brother.

599
00:31:07,954 --> 00:31:09,283
Made me number one.

600
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,369
So, you had no reason to kill him.

601
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,371
Nope.

602
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,750
Thank you for your cooperation.

603
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:19,543
That's it?

604
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,795
Okay.
I'm sorry.

605
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:24,215
I'm sorry.
You were right, she wasn't ready.

606
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,927
No, she wasn't ready, but we found out
something really, really important.

607
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:29,678
What, the woman bowls?

608
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:33,921
No, we found out that the victim
was secretly carrying his brother.

609
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:41,877
Any good news?

610
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:45,003
I think I may have
discovered cause of death.

611
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,822
Even though the victim is still wearing
his hard candy coating?

612
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,840
I went back over the x-rays
and the mri scans.

613
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:55,871
This defect on the posterior aspect
of the sternum.

614
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,862
There.

615
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:58,496
That's very small.

616
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:01,518
This shadow suggests
that the margins bevel inward,

617
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:03,514
which suggests
that it was left by the tip

618
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:05,714
of whatever weapon
was used to kill the victim.

619
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,258
How can we confirm that?

620
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:10,758
By cracking this baby open
and taking a good look.

621
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:16,600
So...

622
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,664
Ic results confirm
anions of chloride, sulfate,

623
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,288
phosphate, nitrate and fluoride.

624
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:25,484
So his body was exposed to highly
concentrated hydrofluoric acid.

625
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,320
Ah, we got something right.
Now, how do we get him out?

626
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:29,989
No idea.

627
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:30,990
Perhaps...

628
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:34,785
One good sharp shock with a mallet
would free the remains inside.

629
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,932
I also found some fecal matter
on the bottom of the shoes.

630
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,605
90% of the world's population

631
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,649
have fecal matter
on the bottom of their shoes.

632
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,879
- Not from a cebinae cebus.
- A what?

633
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:48,911
Capuchin. Jungle jim's monkey banas
is of the capuchin variety,

634
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,782
named thus for their uncanny
resemblance to the,

635
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:55,107
capuchin monks, the,
an offshoot of the franciscan order.

636
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:57,182
- They had...
- Motile flagellates

637
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,643
in the poop date
the freshness to five days ago.

638
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,854
The same day
Alex Newcomb was killed.

639
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:04,842
Has anyone suggested
a piñata scenario?

640
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:07,378
I'll leave you to it.

641
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,369
You people better have a warrant.

642
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:21,582
We have reason to believe that
Alex Newcomb was here the night he died.

643
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,400
Well, I didn't see him.

644
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:24,977
Monkey crap?

645
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:27,838
You're here looking for monkey crap?

646
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,001
Feces, yes.

647
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:30,617
It won't be hard to find.

648
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,870
Maybe banas should wear
a diaper all the time.

649
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:33,761
Diaper.

650
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,095
All right, if Alex was here,
I didn't see him.

651
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,099
Okay, what is going on now?

652
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,268
- They think that banas killed Alex.
- We never said that.

653
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,855
Okay, wait a minute.
You think Alex was killed here?

654
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,524
No, nobody here killed Alex.

655
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,722
Would you just
go back to the floor? Go. Go.

656
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,072
Agent Booth, dr. Brennan,
we found blood.

657
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:00,224
So there's an additional
wide stain around the blood

658
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:02,681
- where the concrete is clearly pitted.
- What is it?

659
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,749
It's congruent with a strong acid.

660
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:07,235
- What is this, please?
- That's gleam-o.

661
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,242
- What's that?
- It's a tire cleaner.

662
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:10,756
It's real concentrated.

663
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,380
- Is it corrosive?
- 60% hydrofluoric acid.

664
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:16,053
That would explain what happened
to Alex Newcomb's bones.

665
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,431
So we got blood,
we got a method of disposing the body.

666
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,910
Looks like you're going to have
to shut the Jungle down, pal.

667
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:21,767
Why?

668
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,353
Because everyone
who works here is now a suspect.

669
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,272
Including you, Jungle Jim.

670
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:38,462
So... The blood from Jungle Jim's
is a match for Alex Newcomb.

671
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,092
- He was killed in the service area.
- He was killed and then

672
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:42,800
soaked in corrosive tire cleaner.

673
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:45,499
So, the killer thinks the body
is going to dissolve instantly,

674
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,032
like it does in the movies,
then nothing happens except

675
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,796
every alarm in the lab
goes off time and again.

676
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:52,589
You OK?

677
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:57,938
Yes.
This is just really good wine.

678
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:01,849
Right, OK, so the killer still has
the body, so he tosses it off the cliff.

679
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,972
What was Alex Newcomb
doing back at Jungle Jim's that night?

680
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:07,563
Ah... Bones here
already figured that one out.

681
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,648
I did? How?

682
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,694
Alex was there for his brother,
trying to save Chet's job.

683
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,469
You got that one right.

684
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,756
I've got dipsticks, pry bars,
ceremonial weapons,

685
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:26,215
but the defect in the sternum
is too small to make a definitive match.

686
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,543
The stab perforated the spine.
What about injury to the vertebrae?

687
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,217
According to my calculations, reversing
trajectory of the nick in the sternum,

688
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,897
Alex was stabbed between
the seventh and the eighth vertebrae.

689
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:37,955
But we won't get anything
from those vertebrae.

690
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,421
They were already jelly
when the x-rays were taken.

691
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:41,689
I hate this case.

692
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:46,251
Did you know
that the earliest production of wine

693
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:48,979
took place in 6,000 bc
in what is now Iran?

694
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,058
From grapes.

695
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:54,332
Rice was used in China in 7,000 bc.

696
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,586
- Is there anything you don't know?
- Yes, the murder weapon.

697
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:01,596
Dr. Brennan is very adamant
that without a murder weapon

698
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:03,987
it's much more difficult
to prosecute a homicide.

699
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,954
We have to find a way
to unseal this body.

700
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:10,251
Dr. Saroyan, okay, I'd just like
to point out that this could

701
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:14,088
very much resemble what happens when
one strikes an egg with a sledgehammer.

702
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,589
Can you see another choice?

703
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,052
Could we at least don
some rain gear first?

704
00:36:20,337 --> 00:36:21,787
Maybe I could help.

705
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,340
Why is it that nobody
ever says to me,

706
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,684
"gee, Angela, this looks impossible,

707
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:30,604
but maybe you're the person
who could solve the problem"?

708
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,264
Cam says you might be able to do
a virtual examination of the body.

709
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:41,881
I've been working on a new program

710
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:45,244
that uses configuration-bias
Monte Carlo method.

711
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:47,585
Here are the bones
currently left in the body.

712
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,014
Now, there's not much left, but
by factoring in rate of decomposition

713
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,559
and bone destruction
from the hydrofluoric acid,

714
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:56,926
I can attempt to virtually
regrow the bone.

715
00:36:59,124 --> 00:37:01,619
I have been to 74 interrogations
with Booth,

716
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:04,721
42 in the room and 32 observing.

717
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,989
I should be able to do it.

718
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:09,393
What, interrogate?

719
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:13,062
Yes. I even engaged
in a very interesting session

720
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:16,316
with Sweets to improve
my ability to manipulate people.

721
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,863
- That wouldn't work.
- Why not?

722
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:22,872
Because

723
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:26,676
what Booth has, you can't learn
from baby boy shrink.

724
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,037
Booth's brilliant

725
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,374
at pretending to be stupider
than he actually is most of the time.

726
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,020
Brilliant at stupidity?

727
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,104
Especially around you.

728
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:41,719
OK, here is what Alex Newcomb's skeleton
looked like 12 hours ago.

729
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,544
Why would Booth do that?

730
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:46,797
Well, he knows
that you like to be the smart one,

731
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:48,672
so he lets you have that.

732
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:54,897
All right, here's what Alex's bones
looked like at the time of his death.

733
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,819
Jagged crenellations between
the seventh and eighth vertebrae

734
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,238
indicate the path
of the murder weapon.

735
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,762
Combing trajectory analysis
with force and thrust ratio.

736
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:10,037
This suggests a square-edged blade
with an overlying step

737
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,831
that was at least
16 centimeters long.

738
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,750
You know I am smarter than booth.

739
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:17,641
Okay, so

740
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:20,758
maybe you should just let him
have the people skills

741
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,008
part of the job to himself then.

742
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,357
Can you zoom in there?

743
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:29,264
OK, look at this.

744
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:33,359
A curved notch,
maybe from a small pin?

745
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,228
Yeah, or a screw.

746
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:36,988
Screw.

747
00:38:38,629 --> 00:38:40,734
Two blades held together by a screw.

748
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,986
Scissors.

749
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:46,628
You are amazing, Angela.

750
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:49,313
I just program the computer.

751
00:38:49,438 --> 00:38:51,681
You're the whiz master
who makes the calls.

752
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:53,809
You're welcome.
Hey, sweetie?

753
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,211
I think you'll find that the murder
weapon was a pair of tailor shears.

754
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,545
Why?

755
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:02,960
Why don't you run
this information by booth and

756
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:05,467
see how quickly he comes
to the same conclusion?

757
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,612
Agent booth, Dr. Brennan,
how you doing?

758
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:15,560
Have you made
any progress on the case?

759
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,128
Yeah, here you go.

760
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:18,837
- What's this?
- A warrant

761
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:20,890
to seize all your scissors
and sewing shears.

762
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:21,779
Why?

763
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:24,695
Newcomb, how long does it take
to swallow a couple of pills?

764
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,739
We got customers on the floor.
Get your hat on.

765
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,399
- What's going on?
- Get back inside, Chet.

766
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:32,651
- What's happening?
- Just go back inside.

767
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,038
Don't lose your job.

768
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,120
Oh, look at that.

769
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:51,171
See, our lab discovered that the murder
weapon was a pair of tailor shears.

770
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,995
And booth immediately
remembered that you're a seamstress.

771
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,097
We're pretty sure we're going to find
Alex Newcomb's blood on those.

772
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,943
- Alex caught me with someone.
- Sexually, you mean?

773
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,111
Who?

774
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:08,155
Jungle Jim?

775
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:09,948
Whoa, how did you get there?

776
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,931
That's how your sick husband
kept his job.

777
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:15,736
First his brother tried to help,
then you.

778
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:18,040
It was just one time.

779
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,464
I told Jungle Jim
I'd have sex with him just once

780
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:23,272
if he wouldn't fire chet, and...

781
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:26,590
My luck, Alex walked
in looking to get his job back and...

782
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,844
Alex wouldn't listen to me.
He said he was going to tell Chet and...

783
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,804
I couldn't let that happen, so...

784
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:34,348
So you killed him?

785
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:40,395
- Look, I love my husband.
- Yeah, so did his brother.

786
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,132
- Just give me a ten.
- But you had most of the potatoes.

787
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:57,607
Then you have that, okay?
All right.

788
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:01,384
Bones, you ready?

789
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:04,812
You haven't said anything
about my interrogation.

790
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:07,631
Okay, you know what?

791
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:12,694
You did great, okay,
better than I thought.

792
00:41:13,343 --> 00:41:14,769
I was terrible.

793
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:18,475
Everybody's right.
I lack empathy.

794
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,958
You got empathy.

795
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:22,282
You're awkward.

796
00:41:23,218 --> 00:41:24,568
That's different.

797
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:27,528
My stuff is bones, yours is people.

798
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,263
Right.

799
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:34,038
So you're admitting that
I'm better at something...

800
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:36,409
- than you are?
- No...

801
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:42,221
Yes.

802
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,146
A lot better.

803
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,171
Thanks, bones.

804
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,092
Can we go now?

805
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,387
- Yes.
- Yes, wait till you see what's outside.

806
00:41:57,178 --> 00:41:59,256
So... What do you think?

807
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,269
Right?
Buddy let me borrow it.

808
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,230
- Can I drive it?
- No, no, wait a second.

809
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,050
This is a very powerful machine.

810
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,035
Well, I can handle it.

811
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:12,154
Okay, look, once around the block.

812
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,532
Maybe.

813
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,643
Hey, driving a machine
like this is like making love.

814
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,378
- You have to go gently.
- I go more for passionate

815
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:22,372
and uninhibited rather than gentle.

816
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:24,082
Bones, gently.

817
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,543
Go ahead.

818
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,234
Gentle, Bones, gentle.

819
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,747
Bones, easy on the gas.

820
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,674
Easy. Whoa, stop!

821
00:42:40,397 --> 00:42:41,882
- Brakes...
- The car broke.

822
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:43,831
- Okay, let me drive.
- No.

823
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:46,398
Okay, fine, you know what?
Just do it without me, okay?

824
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,577
No, it's no fun by myself.

825
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:51,875
No, but at least help me
get into first gear.

826
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,419
First gear?
You're a scientist.

827
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:56,948
- You can figure it out, right?
- I'm a scientist, not a mechanic.

828
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,758
A mechanic? What did I say?
Drive it gently, but no,

829
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:01,749
you don't listen to me.
I'm done, forget it.

830
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,097
No, come on, come back.
I am an excellent driver.

831
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:06,362
Buddy's going to be very upset
you're leaving it here...

832
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:09,461
He will understand because
of the way that you drove that car.

833
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:13,179
I told you to go gently...
Everybody back out, back out.

834
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:15,732
Come on, Booth!

835
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:17,568
