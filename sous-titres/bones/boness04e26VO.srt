1
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:06,548
<i>People say, "You only live once."</i>

2
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,205
<i>But people are as wrong about that</i>

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,130
<i>they are about everything.</i>

4
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>In the darkest moments before dawn,
a woman returns to her bed.</i>

5
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,759
<i>What life is she leading?</i>

6
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:27,953
<i>Is it the same life the woman
was living half an hour ago?</i>

7
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:30,098
<i>A day ago?
A year ago?</i>

8
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:33,426
<i>Who is this man?</i>

9
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:38,993
<i>Do they lead separate lives
or is it a single life shared?</i>

10
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:42,265
Do you love me?

11
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,211
Yeah.
Do you want me to prove it to you?

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,330
If you're not too sleepy.

13
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,274
<i>A storm approaches.</i>

14
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:54,095
<i>It is still over the horizon,
but there is lightning in the air.</i>

15
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:57,848
<i>Are either of them aware
of the gathering turbulence?</i>

16
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:04,076
<i>Can they feel the crackle
of electricity in the wind?</i>

17
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>Or are they aware of only the power
that they generate between themselves?</i>

18
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,577
I love when you do that.

19
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,149
<i>The first hint of this storm
is not a thunderclap.</i>

20
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:26,332
<i>It is a knock.</i>

21
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,257
- Get it.
- No! You get it!

22
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:38,480
- No! You get it!
- You get it.

23
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,359
Great. I get it.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,352
What?! What?!

25
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,402
Good morning.
I'm Detective Saroyan.

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,493
I know who you are.
You're my brother's partner.

27
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:55,271
She prefers the term "boss."

28
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,786
Official visit. See the badge?

29
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,211
What's going on?

30
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,785
There's my robe.

31
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,051
A body was found at your nightclub.

32
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:15,217
Who was still at work when you left?

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,096
Zack came in just before 4:00,
brought the car around for me.

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,977
And then Fisher was supposed to come in
at 5:00 so they could do inventory.

35
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:26,508
- Do you think it was one of them?
- They should have said more than,

36
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,897
"There's a body."

37
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:31,313
- They found him laying in the bathroom.
- Is it terrible?

38
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:33,544
When Zack saw it, he, he screamed.

39
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,112
I heard him from the kitchen.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,530
Yelped, not screamed.

41
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,173
Ready?

42
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:41,368
- I was taken aback.
- It was a scream.

43
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,843
<i>She has never seen
a dead body before.</i>

44
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:47,082
<i>He was in the Army,
and has seen too many.</i>

45
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:56,352
- Recognize him?
- No.

46
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,365
- You didn't see this guy last night?
- No.

47
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,849
Neither of us
was on the floor much last night.

48
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,063
What about this?

49
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,066
You ever hear of a place
called Amicangelo's?

50
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:15,653
Which one's closer to the washroom,
your office or the kitchen?

51
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,132
My office.

52
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:20,533
How is it the chef heard your assistant
shout, but you didn't hear a gunshot?

53
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,276
Maybe I'd already gone home.
I left at 4:00 A.M.

54
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:26,427
Blood coagulation suggests time of death
occurred between 1:00 and 3:00 A.M.

55
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,666
You weren't where you said you were.
So where were you?

56
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,085
From midnight until 4:00 A.M.

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,795
I was in my office.

58
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,636
Then I went home.

59
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:40,242
Let's go, honey.

60
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,294
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

61
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:47,367
- You think that was insensitive?
- Implying that she was cheating on

62
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:50,145
her husband we could've waited until
he wasn't standing right next to her.

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,085
Why? They bust up
and you finally get a crack at her.

64
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,525
That's what you want, right?

65
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:07,329
I know you all worked late last night.
Maybe short on sleep,

66
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,265
but I need to prepare you
for what happens next.

67
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,501
Anybody not heard about our murder?

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,171
Bones - Season 4 Episode 26
"The End in the Beginning"

69
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,875
Good, because you are all suspects.

70
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:22,097
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Camy

00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,975
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

72
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,145
Somebody turned off
the security cameras.

73
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,855
You think one of us is the killer?

74
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,358
You mind, Detective Saroyan?
I am conferring with my clients.

75
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,195
Are you, in fact,
acting as our solicitor in this matter?

76
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,370
I'm the nightclub's lawyer.
You are welcome to call up your own.

77
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:45,576
If we didn't do it,
why do we need a lawyer?

78
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,004
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Zack screamed when he saw the body

79
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,039
- so he's off the hook, right?
- Yelped.

80
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,584
He screamed like Slutty Girl #1
in a teen horror flick.

81
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,841
From here on in,
you do not answer questions

82
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,466
you don't get asked!

83
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,760
Consider me your top suspect.

84
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,365
For God's sake.

85
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,217
I'm a trained chef, all right?

86
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:09,183
Finest schools in Europe,
but my professional life consists

87
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,151
of cooking chicken wings designed
to make people drink more beer.

88
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,356
I'm a man on the edge.

89
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:20,140
Your wings have been voted
"Best in the City" 2 years running.

90
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,935
Not best. "Tallest."

91
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,740
I'm the originator
of the "Tower of Wings."

92
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,825
Which'll probably be
on my tombstone.

93
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,451
- Never seen him in my life.
- You're the hostess.

94
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,362
You see everyone who comes in.

95
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,749
Maybe if you had
a picture of him alive?

96
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,979
I don't have a very good
visual imagination.

97
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:39,429
He looks like a lot of guys.

98
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,407
Is that his real hair?

99
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:46,345
Let the record show that my client
is indicating with his head

100
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,926
that he does not recognize the victim.
Like all my clients.

101
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:51,725
Next question.

102
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,896
Have you witnessed any altercations,

103
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,732
any differences of opinion
at the club lately?

104
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:02,027
Well, Mr. B...
that's what we all call Mr. Booth,

105
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,785
told this hip-hop impresario,
"C-Synch"

106
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:07,355
who is actually very cute,
by the way...

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,536
that he would never book him
or any of his acts into the club.

108
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,830
C- Synch, yeah.
He's, he's all right, isn't he?

109
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,689
Right hand full of talent,
left hand full of street cred

110
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:18,409
due to the fact that his brother
is a big-time gangster.

111
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,424
Clark Edison?
AKA C-Synch?

112
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,671
You restrained him
from lunging at your boss?

113
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,820
I heard C-Synch shouting all the way
at the back of the coat check.

114
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:33,058
He was mad.

115
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,145
Are you aware of a city councilman
named Max Keenan?

116
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,689
Everybody knows Max.
He's around all the time.

117
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,707
Max Keenan is upset because
he never got his "facilitator's fee"

118
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:44,398
for getting City Council to rezone us
for live entertainment.

119
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:47,281
Why would a crooked
politician tell you

120
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,266
that he was upset
about not getting a payoff?

121
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:52,329
I'm a bartender.
I'm practically a psychologist.

122
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:57,003
A Persian named "Ara" something

123
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:58,542
wants to buy the nightclub.

124
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,628
- Arastoo Vaziri?
- Bren's met with him about 40 times.

125
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,696
Mr. B does not want to sell.

126
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:05,883
It was me who shut off
the security cameras.

127
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,428
I wanted some privacy with my boyfriend,
whom I will not name.

128
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,598
Okay, me and Daisy, we got a thing,

129
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,128
but the thing that we have isn't,
you know, isn't...

130
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,019
a boyfriend/girlfriend thing.

131
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,591
It's a thing.
It's just not a thing.

132
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:22,274
Ms. Julian warned us that
you've to make an arrest in this case.

133
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,986
I just want to say that because Jared
and I went out on a couple of dates,

134
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,691
he cannot accept it's going nowhere,
doesn't mean that I should go to jail.

135
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,451
She didn't tell you not answer
questions that you weren't asked?

136
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,995
Should I mark your people down as
"stupid" or "uncooperative"?

137
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,914
Put 'em down as "well-represented."

138
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,541
How about I put 'em down as
"accessories after the fact"?

139
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,674
How long will they keep
the club shut down?

140
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,183
As long as they want.
It's a murder scene.

141
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:51,845
- Financially, that's gonna hurt.
- I'm your councilman. Maybe I can help.

142
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,264
How much is that gonna set us back?

143
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:58,060
I want you to consider the possibility
that this unfortunate incident...

144
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,530
You mean the homicide?

145
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:03,381
Maybe if you had remembered to reimburse
the people that went out of their way

146
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,025
to get you that zoning change.

147
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,724
Really? What, are you gonna put
the squeeze on us retroactively?

148
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,239
Why is it so hard for you husband
to see the ways of the world?

149
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:12,988
Because he wants me
to be proud of him.

150
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,607
I'm afraid you won't be able to reopen
the nightclub for quite some time.

151
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,790
Where can I appeal that decision?

152
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,238
- What they said about you is true.
- What's that?

153
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,091
That you're kind of a cold fish.

154
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,008
If by "cold fish," you mean

155
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,774
pragmatic and rational,
then that's what I am.

156
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,030
No, I meant more like
somebody when a

157
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,669
human being is murdered,
cares more about reopening

158
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:39,986
the club than catching the murderer.

159
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:42,521
I have my job, you have yours.

160
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,983
Where were you really last night?
Who were you with?

161
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:50,195
I had a very satisfying
go around with my husband

162
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,573
at about 5:00 this morning.
How about you?

163
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,866
The victim was killed
by a gunshot wound to the chest.

164
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:58,024
Guns are loud,
but you did not hear it.

165
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,940
You were not in the building.
Either we talk about this now,

166
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,333
maybe it goes no farther.

167
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,296
Otherwise, I gotta pursue this line
of inquiry in a graceless manner.

168
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,021
- So this is blackmail?
- You pride yourself on being pragmatic.

169
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:10,546
I figured
you'd appreciate the logic.

170
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,276
This guy, the Persian, whatever.

171
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,264
How bad does he want your place?

172
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,462
Kind of guy who won't take no
for an answer. Why?

173
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:21,115
Because the guy comes up shady.

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,520
But he's got an alibi for last night.
Twin hooker alibis.

175
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:27,454
I'm gonna tell you something,
something Cam doesn't even know yet.

176
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,652
Coroners found
fibers inside the bullet track

177
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,423
- from something used to muffle the gun.
- That would explain why Bren

178
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:34,823
didn't hear the shot.

179
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,659
It's amazing what forensics
can do these days.

180
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,885
Now, if we happen to find
that particular item,

181
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,832
it could lead straight
to the killer.

182
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,927
So you think I know where it is?

183
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,758
I'm just saying the best thing is
that item never turns up.

184
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,475
Cam says
everybody thinks I'm a cold fish.

185
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,518
What you are is Iceland.

186
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,064
Cool to the touch, but underneath,
you're all volcano.

187
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:13,654
I don't like people thinking
that I'm a cold fish.

188
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,199
Look, if you were really a cold fish,
you wouldn't care.

189
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,118
You used logic on me.
That's sweet.

190
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,945
Cam says the reason
I didn't hear the gunshot is

191
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,904
because I'm cheating on you.

192
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,849
Jared thinks, you know, I'm the killer
and is helping me get away with it.

193
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:33,630
So, you're a murderer, I'm unfaithful?
We're a very exciting couple.

194
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:36,426
Except the real reason
you didn't hear anything

195
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,694
is that the gunshot was muffled.

196
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,933
That's Caroline's phone.
What's she calling for?

197
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:46,436
Hello.
You've reached Bonnie and Clyde.

198
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,633
- Murder, Incorporated.
- How may we help you?

199
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,525
Yeah, it's, it's Max.

200
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:54,660
- What are you doing on her's phone?
- I don't own a cell phone.

201
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,445
Big Brother always knows where you are
when you got a cell phone.

202
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,497
I guess when you're as shifty
as Max here, paranoid is good.

203
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,246
You're open for business tonight.

204
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,889
- Well, how'd you pull that off?
- Let's say I went in the front door,

205
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,627
Max slipped in the back,
and we got it covered.

206
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,963
- What does that even mean?
- Just you got to remember

207
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,200
what they say about one hand
washing the other.

208
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:18,888
That particular cliché
pertains to people with clean hands.

209
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,463
You do not qualify.

210
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,831
There's a blood stain
on the bathroom wall.

211
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,117
Yeah, someone smashed
the victim's head against the wall,

212
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,927
knocked him out, and then came back,
finished him with a shot to the chest.

213
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,409
Very cold-blooded execution,
in fact.

214
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,324
- How did you know that?
- I eavesdropped on the cops.

215
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,494
They're looking for something that was
used to smother the sound of the shot.

216
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,581
Why do you have a gun?

217
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:51,918
I'm English, OK? We don't use guns.
We use our foreheads.

218
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,005
What you've just picked up
is most likely the murder weapon.

219
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,984
Why would the murder
hide the gun in your stuff?

220
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,843
Perhaps because he sussed me out as,

221
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,765
you know, the type of fellow
who'd be smart enough to get rid of it.

222
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,756
Evidently, he didn't expect you
to be here when I discovered it.

223
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,881
Maybe we should get rid of it.

224
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,898
- You and I are not in collusion.
- Why not?

225
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,317
'Cause you're the type of moron who goes
to jail for a murder he didn't commit,

226
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,986
and I... am not.

227
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:19,571
Then what do we do?

228
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:22,018
What I should do
is kill you with the gun

229
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,644
and tell the cops that you attacked me
after confessing to the murder.

230
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:40,594
It's hard to believe that someone
was murdered just over there.

231
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,927
Means nothing to me.

232
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,036
I'm a bestselling
pulp crap crime novelist.

233
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,811
I trade in death daily.

234
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,675
Theoretically.

235
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:50,185
What liquor

236
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:53,553
best exemplifies
death by substance abuse?

237
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,325
Irish whisky, of course.

238
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,026
But...

239
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,663
what spirit best represents
murder most foul?

240
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,738
You know, everyone
that works here is a suspect.

241
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:06,281
I'm working with a murderer.

242
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:09,557
Now, do you have a picture
of this poor bastard that was murdered?

243
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:13,208
Fisher sent this to me this morning,
before the cops arrived.

244
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,961
I'll only show you
if you lose the Irish accent.

245
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:18,916
Take a look.

246
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,047
- The man is obviously a hired killer.
- You get that from a phone pic?

247
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,513
His hair, his suit, his ring,

248
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,256
the fact that I talked to him
last night... here.

249
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:30,781
Here? In this bar?

250
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,727
I didn't see him.

251
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,579
Gotcha.

252
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,571
Yeah, right.
None of us did.

253
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,152
Very good.

254
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,670
Murder most foul.

255
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,122
Do you feel that?

256
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,078
I mean, this place is magic.

257
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,498
Your stage has mystic properties.

258
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:56,601
That is a ridiculous urban legend.

259
00:13:56,726 --> 00:13:58,346
Explain how
so many people that played

260
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,527
here over the years have gone
on to fame and fortune.

261
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,049
- Because we have good taste.
- This place had the power

262
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,636
before you got here,
and it'll have it after you're gone.

263
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,930
All I want
is my piece of the legacy.

264
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,515
Sing, sing, baby.

265
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,603
And if you had good taste,

266
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,500
you would book me first and then each
of my protégés thereafter, you dig?

267
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,899
Dig this.
I recognize your personal talent.

268
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,695
But I don't book you or your...

269
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,614
- Protégés.
- ... because of your brother.

270
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,325
- So you're just brazenly racist?
- Sorry? Speak louder.

271
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,300
This is exactly where I did not
want this conversation to go.

272
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,954
My husband is

273
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,582
concerned about your gang ties.

274
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:38,229
Which is not you,

275
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:40,337
but is your brother.

276
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,217
There's Cain and then there's Abel.

277
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,628
You see a mark on my forehead?

278
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,721
That makes me Abel.

279
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,849
On top, how are you gonna penalize
my protégés because of my brother?

280
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:56,186
- How is that fair?
- As your lawyer, I must advise you,

281
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,347
if Mr. Edison lodges a suit,
the outcome is not assured in our favor.

282
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,900
We will discuss it.

283
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:04,694
Since we are partners.

284
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,783
Look, I know whatever
you're doing is very important.

285
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,618
It's... C-Synch.
C-Synch.

286
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,415
- What's up?
- Be glad you're a pasty Brit albino.

287
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,042
Cheers.

288
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,917
I need to talk.

289
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,056
200 million

290
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,216
unregistered guns in the country,
this one finds its way into my gear.

291
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,769
Anybody touch it?

292
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,652
- Did anybody touch it?
- Zack did.

293
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:37,357
Legally,
if it's with my stuff, can I just,

294
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,355
like, claim it as my own
and toss it into a volcano?

295
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,163
Caroline is an officer of the court.
She has to report it, right?

296
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,068
I sure as hell do now.

297
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,470
.38, right?
Matches the murder weapon.

298
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:48,895
Zack touched it.

299
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,220
Will you two let me do
some of the detecting, please?

300
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:56,993
Saturday night special.
Totally disposable.

301
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,310
My theory,

302
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,054
it's the murder victim's gun.

303
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:03,902
Taken away from him
by persons unknown,

304
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:06,683
who shot him in the chest
then hid it here

305
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:08,592
thinking that Vincent would find it,

306
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,272
panic and throw it away,
because he's,

307
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:12,864
well...

308
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,012
- English.
- Who's this, now?

309
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,864
- Very successful crime novelist.
- They never get anything right.

310
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,210
I'm not gonna fare well in jail.

311
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,193
- I'm lovely.
- Don't worry about it.

312
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,775
I'll bail you out.

313
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:28,987
You, too, Zack.

314
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,079
No Vincent, no DJ.

315
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,291
No DJ, no entertainment.

316
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,057
Time to carpe your diem, bub.

317
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,582
You mean the band?

318
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:48,107
Get a girl to smack the tambourine,
you maybe got a shot.

319
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:51,235
- You mean Angela?
- Of course I don't mean Angela.

320
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,692
You don't stand a chance with Angela.
Her.

321
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,349
Pansy or Buttercup.

322
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,120
Mysterious Persian real estate mogul

323
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,228
who's been trying to buy
our home away from home.

324
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,095
What nefarious reasons does he have?

325
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,566
I want this club 'cause I know
how to turn it into a gold mine.

326
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,068
- Boring.
- Good business,

327
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,945
like a good marriage,
is outwardly boring.

328
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:12,965
Sorry.

329
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:18,456
Last night,
I go home a little before 3:00.

330
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,872
I check to make sure Bren
is locked in safe. I wonder,

331
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,723
did somebody tape the door
after I checked it?

332
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,251
'Cause this guy got in somehow.

333
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,837
You mean the dead guy or,
whoever killed him?

334
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,817
There's nothing tacky on the bolt here,
so it wasn't taped.

335
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,158
That means either the dead guy
hid in the club after closing

336
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,492
- or Bren let him in after my sweep.
- She didn't.

337
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:39,265
Whoever killed this guy either had
a key or was also already in the club.

338
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,643
Bren was the only one
inside the club.

339
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:47,348
You seem pretty sure
this is the way it played out.

340
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,394
The dead guy...

341
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:53,697
chats me up last night.

342
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,281
Why didn't you tell the police?

343
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:58,453
Creepy old guy, trespassing around
our club during the night...

344
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:01,107
I know what I'd do if I caught him.

345
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,874
Did you catch him?

346
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,005
Nope.
Did you?

347
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,842
'Cause until I get the specific
answer to that question,

348
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,610
my loyalty's with you.

349
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,683
I didn't catch him,
but I appreciate your loyalty.

350
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,338
Hey, Arastoo, how you doing?

351
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,876
He's making me
another offer on the nightclub.

352
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,929
Really? How big of a bump
do we get for murder?

353
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,504
The offer is lower.

354
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,350
This place is under a cloud.

355
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:56,176
Things like this occur
when people are not reasonable.

356
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,010
Implying that you are behind the murder
trying to scare me to sell.

357
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:00,346
Ballsy move, pal.

358
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,183
Behind it? No.
Merely taking advantage.

359
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,763
It's good business.
Right, my nightclub is not for sale.

360
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:09,105
But my booze is. So either get a drink
or get the hell out of here.

361
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:16,404
Heard about Vincent being arrested.
Can my band audition?

362
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,991
Come on, what's the harm?
Be ready in one hour, pal.

363
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:22,954
Yes! Yes!
You won't be disappointed.

364
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:25,205
Why?

365
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,284
- I got a soft spot for the kid.
- Well, you're made of soft spots.

366
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:30,126
You're still
gonna make the call, right?

367
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,004
Of course I'm gonna make the call.
I'm not soft in the head.

368
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,048
What is the call?

369
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,475
It's why I own this place
and you never will.

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,928
So, drink or you gonna leave?

371
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:48,096
Awkward.
Very awkward.

372
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,774
- Awkward.
- Angela, what is awkward?

373
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,019
It's a floor plan for the nightclub.

374
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:01,199
Yeah. I drew it.

375
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,702
For the murder victim, last night.

376
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:08,248
You know how what I always really
wanted to do is interior decorating?

377
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,906
I mean, I'm very good.
I sort of have a knack.

378
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:14,170
And he told me that he owned
a nightclub and that he'd hire me to...

379
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,840
And I figured he was probably
hitting on me, but then Jared

380
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,175
showed up and asked me out for,
like, the hundredth time.

381
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,302
Why are you showing this to me?

382
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,294
Because if I show it to Mr. B,
his head will explode.

383
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,387
- You're a cooler customer.
- I'm not a cold fish, I'm Iceland.

384
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:34,566
If I had a firmer grasp of geography,
I might know what you mean.

385
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,730
- Why would his head explode?
- Well, note the X at this office.

386
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,322
Traditionally, X marks the spot.

387
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,893
The safe?
You think he wanted to rob us?

388
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,618
Well, yeah, maybe.
Or...

389
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,257
it's possible that the X marks
a whole other objective.

390
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,084
The only thing left is...

391
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,970
Me.

392
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,322
Why didn't you show this
to the police?

393
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:15,460
'Cause they'll take it without telling
me if it means what I think it means.

394
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,435
What do you think it means?

395
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:20,945
People know
the best way to hurt him...

396
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,280
Is to hurt you.

397
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,827
The Persians are capable
of sending a very bad message.

398
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,538
- What do you mean, bad message?
- Head cracking.

399
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:34,417
Leg breaking. Neck snapping.
Finger snipping. Like that.

400
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:38,574
- It's possible they sent this guy.
- To break my legs?

401
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,658
And the gangbangers make him

402
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:42,592
and they kill him
to make a statement.

403
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,639
So, Booth was right
about the gangbangers?

404
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,735
Everyone serves somebody.

405
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:55,021
Something your husband
refuses to accept.

406
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,505
I know he's stubborn.

407
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,239
He's a man of principle,
and I mean that as a terrible insult.

408
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,531
Now, if he had just paid me off,
none of this would have happened.

409
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,619
Who do you work for that could scare off
the Persians and the gangbangers?

410
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,246
Ask your brother-in-law
about the Gravedigger.

411
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:14,967
Because he's a cop?

412
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:19,096
Because he and I
work for the same guy.

413
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:28,721
Hello?

414
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:33,309
The murder victim has been identified
as Dick Vorstenbach.

415
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,998
He was a security consultant
for a waste disposal company in Newark.

416
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,733
A mobster named Vorstenbach?
What's the world coming to?

417
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,142
- So, what was he doing at our place?
- That's a mighty fine question.

418
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,547
- Where did you get this?
- What's that?

419
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,499
It was slipped to me anonymously

420
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,451
by someone who drew it
for Vorstenbach last night.

421
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:00,753
Your office is marked.

422
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,927
Meaning Vorstenbach was in your club
last night, but nobody saw him.

423
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:06,106
Excuse me, Cam,
but this napkin proves

424
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:08,678
that Vorstenbach was sent
to hurt my wife.

425
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,625
That is one of our theories.

426
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,556
- Could the Gravedigger have sent him?
- Now, where'd you dig that up?

427
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:16,519
Isn't he some old mobster type?
Has his finger in every pie?

428
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,521
- There's no Gravedigger.
- Max likes to say

429
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,314
he works for him.
It makes him scary.

430
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,073
- Exactly, so forget the Gravedigger.
- Look, our first job

431
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:24,815
is to find out
who killed Vorstenbach,

432
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,102
finding out who sent him
is totally secondary.

433
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:30,199
Right, but here in the real world,
when do we get our DJ back?

434
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,201
Never. Your people are lying to me

435
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,204
and till I find out why,
you can't have your DJ,

436
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,367
nor your assistant,
nor anybody else I can scoop up.

437
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:39,417
Now, now,

438
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,557
it's blatant police brutality to use
the word "nor" so aggressively.

439
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:53,139
<i>Violent death, murder,
it sends out shockwaves.</i>

440
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,964
<i>The closer you are to it,
the greater the shock.</i>

441
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,784
Max told me
that he works for the Gravedigger.

442
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:01,439
But he told me something else.

443
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:04,734
He said that Jared
works for him, too.

444
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,037
Don't get so mad.
Max could be lying.

445
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:12,390
Look, I'm mad because
I don't find it hard to believe at all.

446
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:14,160
All right.
Did Max give you the napkin?

447
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:15,745
Nope. Angela.

448
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,178
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

449
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:21,501
Why are all our employees
holding out on the cops?

450
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,148
They love us.
Especially you.

451
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,841
They love us. We're lovable.
What math gets them to obstruct justice?

452
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:32,887
They all know that you'd kill anyone
who was going to hurt me.

453
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,681
And that man, Vorstenbach,
was going to hurt me.

454
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:38,392
They think I'm the killer?

455
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,883
That's the math that gets them
to lying to police

456
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:43,523
and obstructing justice.

457
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:49,487
So, we're Gormogon.

458
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:52,073
I mean the name of the band is
"Gormogon."

459
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,659
Some people think
that I'm Gormogon, but I'm not.

460
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:57,085
It's like there's no one named
"Floyd" in Pink Floyd.

461
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,996
- Just play, Sweets.
- Yeah.

462
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,208
Gormogon? That's a stupid name.
What does it even mean?

463
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,555
Man, I'm telling you,
I'm looking at Sweets

464
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,483
in a whole different way.

465
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:40,608
Really?

466
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,305
- Thank you.
- That was wonderful, wonderful.

467
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,414
- Why did they even invent piano?
- The thing is, it's a...

468
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,889
It's a nightclub.

469
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:04,627
And people,
they got to dance, not just...

470
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:05,902
Fall in love.

471
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,959
- You're really good.
- Stop.

472
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,069
It was great stuff, though.
You know...

473
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:14,624
People, they got to...

474
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:17,617
It's a dance club. Big beat. Big noise.
You understand.

475
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,202
All right.

476
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,882
My brother would like to talk with you.
He's waiting for you.

477
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,710
Right. Sweets, why don't you play
another song for the girl there?

478
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,059
What's going on?

479
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:37,413
I got a meeting with an angry
gangbanger in the alley.

480
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:39,002
- I got my gun.
- You got a gun?

481
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,661
He's the leader of a gang.
He's killed people. He hates your guts.

482
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,681
I ain't no mathematician,
but that adds up bad.

483
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,356
Hang back. All right.

484
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,979
I want my brother
to play in the club!

485
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:59,387
Open the door, boss!
I'm right here. Come on!

486
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm coming!

487
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:25,476
- Who is that?
- C- Synch's brother. Head of the gang.

488
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,109
Don't move
or I'll blow your head off.

489
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,020
You want to drop that?

490
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,670
Thank you.

491
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:40,640
Hi, honey.

492
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:42,910
- You okay?
- Yeah, you should see the other guy.

493
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:45,267
So, who do you want to arrest?

494
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,998
Let's take them all.

495
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:52,475
Look, man, my brother don't sag,
slang or bang.

496
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:54,627
What about you?

497
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,657
Clark barely talks to me, you dig?

498
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,440
- Why do you care?
- He's my brother.

499
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:02,253
And your club is on my block.

500
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,620
- Do the math, man.
- Look, I been here before, okay?

501
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:07,155
Place becomes a gang hangout,
East Coast meets West Coast.

502
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,570
- Somebody gets popped.
- Says the dude with the dead body

503
00:28:09,695 --> 00:28:11,813
- in his bathroom.
- For all I know, you did it.

504
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:15,359
I pop somebody.
I don't muffle the shot, brother.

505
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,220
I shoot him straight on in his face.

506
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,904
Ask anybody.
Look, man.

507
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,325
What if I decree your place off-limits
to my crew or any other crew?

508
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,050
- You can decree?
- He's my brother, man.

509
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,706
I want to see him get his cheese,
see his face on buses.

510
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:31,834
Fine.
C- Synch in the house.

511
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,131
- You still think it could be him?
- Nope.

512
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:40,176
He'd have taken credit if he did it,
used it to scare your brother.

513
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,802
That guy's got nothing to do with
Vorstenbach's murder. Let him go.

514
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,940
Thanks.

515
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:51,940
Now they have my assistant,
our doorman, and our DJ.

516
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,259
I can watch the door
until they release Wendell.

517
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:55,691
What about entertainment?

518
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,409
I thought
Sweets was fantabulisticulous.

519
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,072
- We got the crew.
- What crew?

520
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:06,687
So, Daisy told me something
and I figured you need to know.

521
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:07,980
That murdered guy?

522
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:11,636
- I sort of had a conversation with him.
- And you didn't tell the police?

523
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:14,001
Well, it's what they discussed
that's important.

524
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,128
It's Daisy, so they discussed sex.

525
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:19,587
- That's mostly true.
- Please, what is the point?

526
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:20,674
Lance's songs

527
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,981
were so romantic,

528
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:26,596
- which made me amorous.
- Oh, maybe skip ahead a little.

529
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,393
Well, Lance was nervous we'd get caught
because I'm unabashed about noise.

530
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:33,729
Okay. Is it "skip" or "ahead" or "point"
that she doesn't understand?

531
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,064
Well, I told Lance that

532
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,943
I knew a place where a couple in love
could find some privacy.

533
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:43,114
- Which is the way I told Vorstenbach.
- That's the point.

534
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,442
When Wendell does his sweep,
he never checks the lost and found.

535
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,248
Vorstenbach could have hid back here

536
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,791
and waited for the club

537
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,465
- to be empty.
- Remember all those wooden matches,

538
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,444
- around the body?
- He was here.

539
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,799
Why didn't you tell the police
you saw Vorstenbach?

540
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,884
Fisher says that Mr. B
probably killed the guy to save you

541
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,995
and we should do everything we could
to impede the investigation.

542
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,474
Was that wrong?
It felt right.

543
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,315
- They let you out?
- Yes.

544
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,942
Someone stole my shoes.

545
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,445
Of course, they did.

546
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,155
Sweets found your coat.

547
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:27,867
- I don't get the connection.
- It was jammed into a case of gin.

548
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,661
He brought it to me.
I found the bullet hole.

549
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:34,206
Someone used my coat
to muffle the gunshot?

550
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:36,333
What did you do with my coat?

551
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,035
That's my expensive
Belgian corduroy coat?

552
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,143
I decided to douse it
with pure grain alcohol and burn it.

553
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:51,118
So, you two conspired to...

554
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,559
keep this big secret
from the rest of us?

555
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,269
Mr. B had the strength

556
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,685
to bash the guy's head against the wall,
and you have the...

557
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,940
Will to shoot him.

558
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,662
Is that why you picked up the gun?
In case my fingerprints were on it?

559
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:03,986
I've learned a lot
from Mr. Hodgins' books.

560
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,975
Zack and Sweets found
my Belgian corduroy coat and burned it

561
00:31:09,728 --> 00:31:12,036
because it had a bullet hole in it.

562
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:14,788
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

563
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,708
They figured that you bashed his head
against the wall, and then,

564
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,127
- I shot him.
- Should I be upset that everyone thinks

565
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,850
that we're murderers or just...

566
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:24,465
happy that everyone's trying
to help us get away with it?

567
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,170
You should recognize
that everything they do to help

568
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,802
makes us look more guilty.

569
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,871
- Especially you.
- Why me?

570
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:34,838
Because you are strong enough to smash
his head into the wall and I'm not.

571
00:31:34,963 --> 00:31:35,768
So,

572
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,085
we having...

573
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,310
some doubts?

574
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,796
Not about anything important.

575
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,570
Here.

576
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,093
Yeah, the fibers we found
in the victim's wound are...

577
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:56,569
- Belgian corduroy. How'd you know?
- We can't find Bren's coat.

578
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:59,831
If it's in that club,
we'll eventually find it. So...

579
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:02,785
I heard you the first time: find the
coat, get rid of it, burn it, whatever.

580
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,930
The only problem is:
I didn't kill the guy.

581
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,633
Max says you're in the Gravedigger's
pocket. Did he send him?

582
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,901
Max is nuts.

583
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,403
And crooked as a stick in water.

584
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:13,995
Look, hey, hey.

585
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,275
Somebody put this Vorstenbach guy
on Bren.

586
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,320
- What?
- You're not going to like it.

587
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,275
Somebody comes into my club
to hurt my wife, of course I'm not.

588
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,734
Bren was cheating on you
with the Persian.

589
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:28,305
You got that wrong.

590
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,072
Met with him over a dozen times.

591
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,241
Over 70 phone calls
in the past three weeks.

592
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,809
How many times a day
you talk to her?

593
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:37,705
This is what happened.
They get into a thing.

594
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,320
It goes South. Bren figures out
that it's not true love,

595
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:42,390
that the Persian wants her
for your nightclub.

596
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:45,838
And then he threatens her. He sends
this Vorstenbach guy on the job.

597
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,924
You don't see it, you don't use your
head. You think what you feel is true.

598
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,303
<i>Take it outside.</i>

599
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,367
You need to grow up.

600
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:00,940
Hey, Mr. B.

601
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,590
- Anybody else get arrested?
- Not that I know of.

602
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,233
Listen, Ange, you know the napkin
you drew for Vorstenbach?

603
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,200
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I didn't know what he wanted it for.

604
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,530
No, I know that.
It's just, why wasn't it finished?

605
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,988
Well, I got interrupted.

606
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:14,950
- Interrupted? By who?
- By Jared.

607
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,750
He came in to ask me out.

608
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,414
Jared saw Vorstenbach
and the napkin?

609
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:22,935
Right.

610
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,500
You see Max?

611
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:27,880
Table 11.

612
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:35,149
As soon as the crew gets here,
we'll do a sound check.

613
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:37,310
- Great.
- What time you want us to go on?

614
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,470
- Midnight.
- You got it, give or take.

615
00:33:39,595 --> 00:33:41,852
So, the cops think
I committed the murder.

616
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:44,525
The cops are the least of your worries.
Pay.

617
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,803
Right. Tell the Gravedigger
unless he's willing to kill me,

618
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:48,901
It's over.

619
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:51,070
One more thing.

620
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:54,073
Anything happens to my wife,
it's you I'm coming after.

621
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,140
- Oh, me? I'm just the messenger.
- Right.

622
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:59,173
You know, I don't know
how you got Jared to believe that crap,

623
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,970
but my gut is telling me
you're nobody's messenger.

624
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:04,865
It's only money.

625
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:08,105
I hate when people say that.

626
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:18,463
So, did the police try to convince you
I was having an affair with Arastoo?

627
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:21,484
That's what they do, you know.
Drive wedges.

628
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:25,688
But it wouldn't be irrational to think
I was having an affair with him.

629
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,857
- He's very handsome.
- I'd feel it if

630
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,061
the energy was bad
between the two of us.

631
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:31,979
I'd know.

632
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:36,052
Same way that you would know
that I couldn't murder someone.

633
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:39,299
I believe you would murder someone
for me.

634
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,829
And I believe you'd lie about it,

635
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,280
so I wouldn't have
to carry the burden.

636
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:51,357
Hey, Nikki, Vince.
What's up?

637
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,007
Excellent update on the lid, Mick.

638
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:58,679
Hello, hello, hello.

639
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,397
Check, check, check, check.

640
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,317
Listen, go bigger, go louder,
or just go home.

641
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,991
How did you convince them to leave
Cruefest and appear here tonight?

642
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,666
Benefit for the kids.

643
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,234
We're doing a benefit for sick kids?

644
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,611
Poor Cam and Jared.

645
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,140
If this murder is any indication,

646
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:31,503
I don't know how
any homicide is ever solved.

647
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:34,006
Everyone lies, everyone...

648
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,695
has a secret agenda.

649
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,804
I'm glad we're nightclub owners
and not crime-solvers.

650
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:44,706
I know who did it.

651
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:47,508
So do I.

652
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,625
Awesome, it's the Crue.

653
00:35:54,345 --> 00:35:56,495
I've been bounced by a rock band.

654
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,265
When did you realize it wasn't me?

655
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,835
You would kill for me, I know that,

656
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,796
but whoever did this,
knocked him out,

657
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,340
then went and got my coat
before executing him.

658
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:18,496
You would never do that.

659
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,497
Jared is different.

660
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:22,679
He killed a man

661
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,681
to save my wife.
What are we going to do?

662
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,517
Do?
Thank him and shut up.

663
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,525
Bren,

664
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,019
this is murder.

665
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:30,813
It's more like a rescue.

666
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:34,004
- Everything is just so clear to you.
- It is, this time.

667
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:38,325
I don't think I can live with this.

668
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,250
Boss.

669
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:48,372
I'm not going to prison.

670
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,922
GPS puts you in this building
at the time of the murder.

671
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:54,461
I told you: no cell phone, no GPS.
You should have listened to me.

672
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,730
Lose the weapon, Detective.

673
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,927
Jared, just take out your gun.

674
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,846
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

675
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:07,365
You ready?

676
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:09,852
I'm a quick bastard.

677
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:12,115
By the barrel, very slowly.

678
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,800
That's not how it's gonna go.

679
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,610
We know how this is gonna go.

680
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:28,555
It's okay.

681
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,540
It's all okay.

682
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:41,925
Thank you.

683
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,435
You helped us.

684
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:58,901
Now please, let us help you.

685
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,605
<i>Please welcome Motley Crue!</i>

686
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:28,931
Put the handcuffs on, Jared.

687
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:14,135
<i>You love someone,
you open yourself up to suffering.</i>

688
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:15,905
<i>That's the sad truth.</i>

689
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,975
<i>Maybe they'll break your heart.</i>

690
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,292
<i>Maybe you'll break their heart
and never be able</i>

691
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,425
<i>to look at yourself in the same way.</i>

692
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,050
<i>Those are the risks.</i>

693
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,630
<i>Locking up, boss.</i>

694
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,625
Thanks, Wendell.

695
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,116
You know...

696
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,137
You're right,

697
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,306
you know.

698
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:39,846
- We should sell out.
- You're not afraid of this Gravedigger?

699
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,541
I told him if he doesn't leave us alone,
I'd kill him,

700
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,116
and he believed me.

701
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:47,986
You mean, you told Max to tell him.

702
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:53,283
Caroline says if they can't trace
the gun to Jared,

703
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,998
they can't find my coat,

704
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:57,726
he's going to walk.

705
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,415
We can't sell the club.
Your brother might need a job.

706
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:02,542
Plus, I have another confession.

707
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,170
What?

708
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:08,173
<i>You see two people and you think</i>

709
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:09,930
<i>they belong together,</i>

710
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:12,105
<i>- but nothing happens.</i>
- Well,

711
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:16,382
you know that glass of wine
that we share every night?

712
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,268
- I have to stop that.
- Oh, come on.

713
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:24,761
Just because you have one glass of wine
every night with your husband,

714
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:27,442
doesn't mean you're an alcoholic.

715
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,405
That's not why.

716
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:38,727
You are pregnant?

717
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,998
A little baby boy?

718
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,365
Or girl.

719
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,840
<i>The thought of losing
so much control</i>

720
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:49,180
<i>over personal happiness
is unbearable.</i>

721
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,158
<i>That's the burden.</i>

722
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:55,635
<i>Like wings.</i>

723
00:41:56,855 --> 00:41:58,100
<i>They have weight.</i>

724
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,195
<i>We feel that weight on our backs,</i>

725
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,520
<i>but they are a burden that lifts us.
Burdens...</i>

726
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,442
<i>that allow us to fly.</i>

727
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:26,501
It was such a weird dream.

728
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,480
You're awake.

729
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,540
So real.

730
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:44,269
Your operation was a success, but
you reacted poorly to the anesthesia.

731
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:47,017
You've been in a coma for four days.

732
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,495
It took you so long to wake up.

733
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,870
It felt so real.

734
00:42:57,713 --> 00:42:58,963
It wasn't real.

735
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,240
Who are you?

736
00:43:07,374 --> 00:43:10,537
