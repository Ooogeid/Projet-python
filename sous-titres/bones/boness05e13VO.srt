1
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,020
Sayler's Creek was the beginning
of the end for the South.

2
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,730
We dug in and held you
Yankees off for two days.

3
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,435
Which is why we live in the Confederate
States of America, I guess, right?

4
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:31,364
Our boys had set up a perimeter
along this here creek.

5
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,616
If we had been able
to get supplies...

6
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:37,787
I hate to rub it in, Duval,
but you rebels had more soldiers

7
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,104
surrender at Farmville than in
any other battle of the war.

8
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,793
You could always switch sides,
join the winners.

9
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:45,987
What the...?

10
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:50,674
What is this?

11
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:53,803
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:56,722
Is that a dead soldier?

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,376
- That's one of them Yankees we killed.
- Yankee?

14
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,238
That's a rebel yell
if I've ever seen one.

15
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:08,746
He's screaming for his mother.
That's how you can tell this.

16
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,089
General Sheridan, we got dead
rebel over here, sir!

17
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:13,540
- Dead Yankee...!
- Dead rebel!

18
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,317
- Clearly a rebel!
- Clearly a Yankee!

19
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:22,556
Is that work or Solitaire?

20
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,275
Little brother, look at you.

21
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,492
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

22
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:30,651
- I thought you were biking in India.
- I was. You know what else?

23
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:32,258
- I survived.
- Survived.

24
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:36,345
I biked through Sikkim.
I hiked to the top of Himachal Pradesh.

25
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:39,056
I learned a few dirty jokes in Hindi.
You want to hear one?

26
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,409
You didn't get yourself
in any more trouble?

27
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,311
Not unless
you count falling in love.

28
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,175
Falling in love. Really?
How?

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,192
I was swimming with elephants
in the Andaman Islands,

30
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:53,519
when out of nowhere,
Padme swan dives off a cliff,

31
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,081
nearly killing both of us.

32
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,155
Padme Dalaj.

33
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,739
It's a beautiful name, right?

34
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,294
I'm thinking of asking
this girl to marry me.

35
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,095
You... Congratulations.
That's...

36
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:13,841
It's my special murder line.

37
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,260
Okay, you... you go ahead
and save the world.

38
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,429
All right, I'll catch
up with you later.

39
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,077
Jared's only known her for a month.
One month.

40
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,264
The Confederate soldiers
were so hungry,

41
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,024
they scavenged seed
and corn from horse excrement.

42
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,401
Tasty. But who marries someone
after a month?

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,154
I thought you believed
in love at first sight.

44
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,582
In movies, all right?
And not for Jared.

45
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:41,285
Look at this.
What is with the red dirt?

46
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:44,580
Well, the pine needles left behind
tannic acid, which acts like red dye.

47
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,500
- Who are these guys?
- He's right. And years of tobacco

48
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,086
farming drained
the land of nutrient.

49
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,168
Which caused the topsoil
to wash away...

50
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,767
Which left behind ha clay.

51
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,592
You're better informed scientifically
than your apparel might suggest.

52
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,637
As amateur historians,
we've studied this battle, the terrain,

53
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,646
- military maneuvers.
- You don't say.

54
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:04,550
Could you by any chance tell us if
that's a fallen Union soldier,

55
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:05,810
or a dead rebel?

56
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,746
The angle of the jaw
indicates a male.

57
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,315
Otherwise, I can't tell anything until
we get the remains back to the lab.

58
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,946
- OK, we're gonna need a backhoe.
- And a cement cutter.

59
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,319
And a cement cutter.

60
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,863
You really love the heavy machinery.

61
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,376
This trauma to the sternum
is degraded.

62
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,620
It's as though the bone has
demineralized over time.

63
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:28,374
Maybe he got bayoneted, and then
the clay leached out the calcium.

64
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,543
During the American Civil War,

65
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,170
diseases such
as typhoid fever, dysentery

66
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,215
and tuberculosis killed twice
as many men as battle wounds.

67
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,301
That could be relevant.

68
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,677
- It is not.
- Why?

69
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,114
That was not a Civil War casualty.

70
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,288
- Reconstructive surgery.
- Titanium screws.

71
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:48,522
Which were not introduced
until the mid-sixties.

72
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:51,272
Completely relevant to the
matter at hand, I believe.

73
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,400
It's going to be very difficult
to extract the remains from

74
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,500
this clay
without damaging the bones.

75
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,379
Perhaps we could
spray it with liquid nitrogen?

76
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,877
- Give it a short, sharp shock.
- No. Freezing the clay with gas

77
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,355
would make the bones brittle
and could destroy evidence.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,998
But as an idea,
the fast-freezing option needed stating.

79
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,641
What happened?

80
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,047
Spiders.

81
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:21,052
I don't like spiders, and there are
thousands of spiders coming out...

82
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,600
I'll go get Hodgins.

83
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,267
- I really don't like spiders.
- I don't mind them, actually.

84
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,503
Bones - Season 5 Episode 13
"The Dentist in the Ditch"

85
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,691
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,
Dark_Chii

86
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,339
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

87
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:04,428
The spider eggs were on the body
before it was encased in the clay.

88
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,847
The heat in the lab
caused the eggs to hatch,

89
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,393
and when you shone your flashlight,
they headed for the light.

90
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:13,562
Based on mandibular dentition,
the victim is late

91
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,207
20s, early 30s.

92
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:18,359
Dr. Hodgins, I can, still see one

93
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,677
in his mouth.

94
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:23,030
These bad boys
are Frontinella communis.

95
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,416
They're non-poisonous.

96
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,369
Yeah, still with those gross
spider faces and legs, though.

97
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,497
This spider is not found in the area
where the body was discovered.

98
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,001
Indicating that the victim was
most probably offed elsewhere.

99
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,754
Any idea how to remove
the body from the sediment?

100
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,799
Well, I mean, if we remove
the moisture from the clay,

101
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,938
then it should just fall away
without effecting the bones at all.

102
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,887
I just need four dehumidifiers.

103
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,890
You okay there, Dr. Saroyan?

104
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,919
Yeah, I'm just itchy all over.

105
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:56,314
I'm gonna go burn all of these clothes
and maybe my hair.

106
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:02,121
Some male spiders are known
to actually... to pluck their webs,

107
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,780
like a guitar,
to attract the females.

108
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,366
Someone should tell them,
it's drummers that get the girls.

109
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,139
We were in Bangalore visiting
the Karnataka Belur temple

110
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:15,254
when a pickpocket stole my wallet.

111
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,772
Jared climbed onto the roof
of the building and tackled the thief.

112
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,342
You know, all that hero stuff?
I learned it from my big brother.

113
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,842
That along with hotwiring cars
and stealing cable.

114
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,416
- Jared's very proud of you.
- What can I say?

115
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,430
It's normal
big brother stuff, that's all.

116
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:32,507
I'm amazed at how good your English is.
It's perfect.

117
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,236
That happens when you grow
up in Alexandria, Virginia.

118
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:37,722
- I'm third generation American.
- Yes, you are.

119
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:40,066
Thank you for setting me up
and making me look like idiot.

120
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,776
It's normal little brother stuff.

121
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:45,363
So, basically, you went
all the way to India to meet a girl who

122
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,000
lives down the street from you?

123
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,192
Seeley thinks every decision
I make is wrong.

124
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:51,617
Like you said, typical big brother.

125
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,535
So, what is it
that you do for a living?

126
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,730
- She's a bank robber.
- It's a normal question, you know?

127
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:04,257
She's very glamorous. I thought maybe
she worked at some glamorous job.

128
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,300
Hardly. I teach grade school.

129
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,220
He's got a kid in
third grade, Parker.

130
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,264
There's no Parker at my school.

131
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,349
She's the kid's
favorite teacher, Seeley.

132
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,697
Phosphate and calcium
have leaked from the bones

133
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,429
into the clay in several places,

134
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,571
making the bones softer
and the clay harder.

135
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,783
I see you started with dentition.

136
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,802
Interesting juxtaposition.

137
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,411
Substandard dental work,

138
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:35,454
but top-of-the-line materials.

139
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,540
That might help with identification.

140
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,836
I've seen that before in people who get
their treatment at a dental school.

141
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:44,081
Suggesting that the victim was poor.

142
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,257
Specious leap, Mr. Nigel-Murray.

143
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,426
Tendonitis in his elbow.

144
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:51,387
The hook of the hamate shows
wear from torque,

145
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,556
rotational force
and repeated tugging.

146
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:58,672
I only have inappropriate comments
off the phrase "repeated tugging. "

147
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:01,098
These are occupational markers
for many professions,

148
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,668
including funeral directors,

149
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,312
surgeons, dentists, mechanics.

150
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,851
A dentist would most likely have
his dental work done

151
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,740
by other students,
while in dental school.

152
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,326
That would explain
the work on his teeth.

153
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,952
I'd like theories

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,955
as to what might have caused
the initial damage to the sternum.

155
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,251
Even though it's been severely
degraded by demineralization?

156
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,710
I'll have to remove
the rest of the clay first.

157
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,675
I will get you
to praise me, Dr. Brennan.

158
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:33,197
I will have you look at me with
admiration and astonishment at my...

159
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,514
I'm sorry, were you speaking to me?

160
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,808
I was simply... I was running
through my knowledge

161
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,274
of clay.

162
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:53,240
You think your brother's girlfriend
is <i>hinky?</i>

163
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,160
Is that slang for pretty or buxom?

164
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,037
No, it's just slang for iffy.

165
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:02,208
Iffy is already slang. I don't see
the need for slang for slang.

166
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,605
The point is, there was just a hinky
vibe between me and her.

167
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,911
You know what?
I don't expect you to understand.

168
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,528
The victim's dental records
confirm his identity.

169
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:14,997
Dan Pinard.

170
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,139
Dentist. Lives alone.

171
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,877
- Are they happy together?
- What?

172
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:24,355
Jared and Padme. Do they seem happy?
You've put a high premium on feelings.

173
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,716
- Don't go twisting this around.
- You used to think

174
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:30,392
- that people could find true love.
- I still do, but this is Jared.

175
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:32,405
He only just got sober.

176
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:35,167
Well, if he's sober,
he should be able to find love.

177
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,837
- I don't understand the rules.
- There are no rules.

178
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,453
There's just life.

179
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:42,081
There's just life.

180
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,171
Big house for a single man.

181
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,889
Looks like he's doing
some serious remodeling.

182
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:02,760
Door's open. Hold on.

183
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:19,510
- Hands up.
- No, no, no.

184
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,704
Okay. Okay, this is not
what it looks like.

185
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,873
- I'm allowed to be here.
- Who are you?

186
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,123
Lucas Pickford.

187
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:28,044
My Social Security number is
three-zero-eight, one-two...

188
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,254
Okay, Mr. Pickford,
what are you doing here?

189
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,058
I'm Danny's contractor.
I live over the garage.

190
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,385
He said I could come in any time
and use his TV.

191
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:37,991
Danny is dead.

192
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:39,347
He's dead?

193
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,100
- That's where he's been?
- That's right. He's been dead.

194
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,596
I thought he just...

195
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:45,895
met someone.

196
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,481
Danny once took off
for three weeks and

197
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,834
never said a word.

198
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,317
Big-screen TV,

199
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,544
cold beer... it's not
a great motive for murder,

200
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,307
- but I've seen people killed for less.
- Why would I kill Danny?

201
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,075
He owes me money...
like three grand.

202
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,619
You shouldn't be hassling me.
You should talk to his ex.

203
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,037
They had a bad breakup.

204
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,872
- Right. What's her name?
- Chris.

205
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,874
But she's a him.

206
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:10,086
I mean, it's a Christopher Chris,
not a Christine Chris.

207
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:12,806
He rents a place on Dalgren Road.

208
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:20,448
There's no faster way
to clean the skeleton?

209
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:23,015
Oddly, no.
Not in a localized fashion.

210
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,935
Dr. Brennan seemed very anxious
to get at the sternum.

211
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,896
Not to come across
as in any way needy,

212
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:34,251
but have you ever seen Dr. Brennan,

213
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:37,571
compliment or praise
one of us interns?

214
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,825
I wouldn't worry about praise,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

215
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,285
Strive for... mild approval.

216
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,588
Then, back to work I go.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.

217
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:48,916
Did you... clean the victim's teeth?

218
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,806
A small sign of respect
for a dentist.

219
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:55,298
If you want praise,
I'd concentrate on the sternum

220
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,069
if I were you.
Something hit him there. Hard.

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,928
Let's see if we can't
figure out what that was

222
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,888
and whether it killed him.

223
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,790
I worked two jobs to put Dan
through dental school.

224
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,400
As soon as his practice was up
and running, he dumped me.

225
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,654
And since Virginia
doesn't recognize gay marriage

226
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,549
or civil unions, you weren't entitled
to anything when he left you.

227
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:21,490
- How is that fair?
- It's not.

228
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:25,462
I'm sorry to inform you
that we have identified

229
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:28,122
some human remains as Daniel Pinard.

230
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,599
Wait.

231
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:33,210
Dan is dead?

232
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,840
- When was the last time you saw him?
- I haven't heard from him, but...

233
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:40,508
it's got to be a year.

234
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:44,194
All right. Were you...

235
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,934
Were you upset when he broke it off?

236
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:48,935
What?

237
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,562
Like you said,
you didn't have any legal options.

238
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,231
Not upset enough to kill.
I moved on.

239
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,195
I met someone after a couple months,
and bygones are bygones, right?

240
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,797
Is that everything?

241
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:02,031
Because Danny was a part of my past,
and like I said, I've moved on.

242
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,449
No. I'd like to ask you,

243
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,507
quite a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

244
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,377
I do mind, so,
if you'll excuse me...

245
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,233
What do you got there?

246
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,960
Looks like an arrowhead.
Is that yours?

247
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:16,003
I'm a bow hunter... whitetail deer.

248
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,423
I'm gay and I hunt. Get over it.

249
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,094
That bow in his truck would
generate sufficient velocity

250
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,888
for this arrowhead to cause
the trauma in the victim's sternum.

251
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,557
What is she saying?

252
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,250
She's saying you have a choice.

253
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,985
Either you come with us willingly
and answer my questions or...

254
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,924
I arrest you.

255
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,489
The damage to the sternum
is not the cause of death.

256
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,032
So, the ex is off the hook?

257
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,743
At a velocity
of 82 meters per second,

258
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,453
a hunting arrow would not only

259
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,915
pierce the sternum and the heart,
but would sever the spinal column.

260
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,916
I will point out,

261
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,254
however, at the angry ex-boyfriend
might still have killed the victim,

262
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:01,355
but either he didn't use
a hunting bow

263
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,011
or he made an amazing shot

264
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,845
from the absolute, the limit

265
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,514
of the bow's range,
which-which would be...

266
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:10,609
very far.

267
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:13,688
I sounded very much
like Dr. Brennan then, did I not?

268
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,022
Up until the "very far," yes.

269
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,232
What did strike our victim
in the chest?

270
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,266
It could easily
have been postmortem.

271
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,112
Probably as a result
of beingipped into a creek.

272
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,850
So, we don't have cause of death.

273
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,490
Rhubarb.

274
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:28,805
Rhubarb?

275
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,120
The victim was killed by rhubarb?

276
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,496
Approximately ten kilos.

277
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:34,457
All right. I'm usually pretty good

278
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,543
with following your jumpy little brain,
but you've left me in the dust here.

279
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,905
If you can acquire for me the rhubarb,
I can deliver unto you

280
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,674
a skeleton free of clay.
Rhubarb!

281
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:45,927
Rhubarb it is.

282
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:49,603
Okay, well, you know,
our victim wasn't killed by an arrow.

283
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,943
But hey, you know, the good news...

284
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:55,436
our victim's dental hygienist says
that he gave her hepatitis C.

285
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,502
- The dental hygienist is gay, too?
- I don't know. I'm going to ask her.

286
00:14:58,627 --> 00:14:59,632
Her?

287
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:02,656
Did the victim
have heterosexual relations

288
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,780
- with his hygienist?
- I don't know. I'm going to ask her.

289
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:09,367
Miss Bryson, I'm Agent Booth.

290
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:12,995
They said Dan is dead.
What happened?

291
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:16,009
We were hoping that maybe
you would be able to help us with that.

292
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:17,250
Me?

293
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:24,012
How did you work this up without me?

294
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,483
When I told Dr. Saroyan
that the sternum wound

295
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,400
was not caused by a hunting arrow,

296
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,797
my brain jumped to
different types of arrows,

297
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,057
which led me to the image
of a giant wasp,

298
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:36,560
which was silly, but which then led me
to stinging nettles,

299
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,688
which are covered in thousands
of little arrows,

300
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,107
and on the tip of each
tiny little arrow is a drop

301
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,613
of oxalic acid,
which not only stings,

302
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:45,701
but works very well
at dissolving silicates.

303
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,793
Silicate causes clay to adhere...

304
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,665
And rhubarb is full of oxalic acid.

305
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,080
Okay. Next time someone
says your brain

306
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:56,831
is a jumble of disconnected chaos,
you just send them to me.

307
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,000
People say that?

308
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,447
You need me to stir?

309
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:03,754
Don't you have lots of spiders
to trace?

310
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,132
Well, there's over 30
separate breeding grounds

311
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,709
within a 200-mile radius
of the body site.

312
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:13,022
I'm analyzing the egg sacks
to see if I can narrow it down further.

313
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:14,655
I've got some time.

314
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:18,869
And this is so cool.

315
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,826
You want to know
if I had sex with Dan?

316
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,930
You filed a grievance against him
requesting the ADA revoke his license

317
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,742
because he gave you hepatitis C.

318
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,716
No, we didn't have sex.

319
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,997
- Dan nicked me during a procedure.
- Really?

320
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,977
So, he nicked himself and you?

321
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:45,015
- What about the patient?
- It was while preparing a syringe.

322
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,506
My husband and I tested positive
after that.

323
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:49,673
Who believed that story?

324
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:52,595
- Did your husband believe that story?
- It happened.

325
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,599
How did you really get hepatitis C?

326
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,987
Tell you what,
before you answer that,

327
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,366
this here's a report from the ADA
saying that Dan

328
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,201
never had hepatitis C.

329
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,670
I had an affair.

330
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:09,642
I got hep C.

331
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:13,115
I just... I needed a way
to explain it to my husband.

332
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,993
So maybe you killed Dan,
or your husband did.

333
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,912
No, neither
of those things happened.

334
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,409
On the day Dan Pinard disappeared,

335
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,500
he canceled all of his
appointments so he could,

336
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,195
go see Dr. Hibbert.

337
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,712
Only problem is,
we can't find this Dr. Hibbert.

338
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,449
Dr. Hibbert is the name
that Dan wrote in his appointment book

339
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:33,010
when he canceled patients
at the last minute.

340
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:36,342
- Any idea who it might have been?
- I was already fired.

341
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,099
Right.

342
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,055
You ran a background check
on Jared's girlfriend?

343
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,350
You do things like that
for people you care about.

344
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,932
- Do you do that when I go out?
- Look, Bones, you're the one who says

345
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:52,652
not to jump to conclusions
without all the facts.

346
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,876
But you always say,
in matters of the heart...

347
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,311
The heart is just a muscle.

348
00:17:57,436 --> 00:17:59,194
See? I'm learning from you.

349
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,039
Anyways, this whole
background check came up hinky.

350
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,207
Hinky how?

351
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:07,143
Four years ago,

352
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:10,089
this woman was an escort.
Jared's going to be crushed.

353
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,811
Why? I'm sure she possesses
sophisticated sexual skills,

354
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,218
and if she's reformed...

355
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,554
She's just reformed?
She's a reformed escort.

356
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,616
Well, maybe Jared already knows.

357
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,221
No, he doesn't know.

358
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,548
- How do you know that?
- If he knew,

359
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:24,509
he wouldn't be talking
about getting married.

360
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:26,434
He wouldn't be saying
stuff like that.

361
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:32,855
Look what Vincent did.

362
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,729
He turned our victim
into rhubarb pie.

363
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,447
Fractures are evident
on at least half a dozen bones,

364
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,204
including possible cause of death.

365
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,977
Fracture to the glabellar
region on the frontal bone.

366
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:47,251
Head trauma could definitely
be cause of death.

367
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,840
Tendonitis of the shoulder,
broken ribs,

368
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,298
knee trauma and a nick to the ankle.

369
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,593
- That's all just the right side.
- Sounds like he was tortured.

370
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,707
He also had Bennett's fracture
of the thumb,

371
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,013
broken left clavicle,

372
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,373
- and his knee...
- You know what?

373
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,392
These are all common
football injuries.

374
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,984
Some of the injuries
are over a decade old,

375
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:08,439
but others show almost
no remodeling, which means...

376
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,983
He was still active in the sport.

377
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:14,849
A gay dentist who plays football.

378
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:20,451
Do the significant looks
you are exchanging

379
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,205
mean that you doubt a gay man
can play football and be a dentist?

380
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,331
No.

381
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,793
I mean, for me, the answer is no.

382
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,900
What I'm thinking
is that American football

383
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:34,757
is a bastion of testosterone-
fueled masculinity.

384
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,009
Maybe one too many lingering glances

385
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,941
in the locker room
got him in trouble.

386
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:40,602
Does that happen often?

387
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,683
I mean, with me,
it happened all the time.

388
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,660
If I'd killed everyone
who looked at me lustily,

389
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,809
I wouldn't
have made it out of school.

390
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,650
There's only one amateur
full-contact league in the DC area,

391
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,114
so it wasn't hard to find out
which team Dan played for.

392
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:13,254
They are not unlike mountain rams

393
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,516
that butt heads in an attempt
to attract a mate.

394
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:17,993
It's hard to believe that
brain damage isn't a result.

395
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:20,184
It's amazing.
You can even make football sound bad.

396
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:22,555
Come on, ladies.
My little sister hits harder than that.

397
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,558
Do you want me to get you a skirt?

398
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,061
He's challenging their masculinity
to enhance aggression.

399
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:30,187
That's coach talk.
It's the way coaches talk. Excuse me.

400
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,523
Coach, FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

401
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,192
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

402
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
Like to ask you a few questions
about Dan Pinard.

403
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,113
Yeah, he better be in prison.

404
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:41,866
It's the only excuse I'll accept
for how long he's been gone.

405
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:43,590
We found his body.

406
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:46,704
Oh my God.

407
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,582
Did any of Dan's teammates
or opponents have any problems with him?

408
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,520
What, he was murdered?

409
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:53,478
No, no.

410
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,379
All the guys loved Dan.

411
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,322
Is it possible that someone's
masculinity was threatened

412
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:00,801
and that person killed Dan
because he was a homexual?

413
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:03,095
Way to ease into that one.
That's smooth.

414
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,389
No, that's definitely not
an issue with my guys.

415
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,391
What makes your team so
highly evolved?

416
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,062
Meet the Cardinals, Agent Booth.
We're all gay.

417
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,170
Good hit!

418
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,277
So, anybody here
have any problems with Dan?

419
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:21,665
Disagreements, arguments, fights?

420
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,554
Everyone here joined this team

421
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,077
because a lot of players
don't want us on their teams.

422
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:27,502
We're like family.

423
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,622
No one here hurt Dan.

424
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,282
- No way.
- And you're all gay?

425
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:34,769
I suppose, statistically,

426
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,338
we could have 2 or 3 straights
who are still in the closet.

427
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,142
This is Dan's equipment bag.

428
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,386
I found his protective
headgear inside.

429
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:44,850
That's a helmet, Bones.

430
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:47,444
There's blood
on the inside of the lip.

431
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:50,434
It approximates the location of
the fracture on Dan's forehead.

432
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:53,190
The force could have cracked
his skull and killed him.

433
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:55,439
Are you sure nothing happened here?
One of your guys,

434
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,818
they probably could have hit Dan,
a little too hard, try to cover it up.

435
00:21:58,986 --> 00:21:59,704
What?

436
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:02,201
You lose your insurance,
you're kicked out of the league.

437
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:04,298
It was just an accident, right?

438
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:08,132
All right, I'll tell you what.
Anybody who's got plans

439
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,037
for this weekend, just cancel 'em.

440
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,083
Because of blood on a helmet?

441
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,711
Because of blood inside
of a football helmet. Isn't right?

442
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,045
That's correct.

443
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,040
I was draining the vat when
I noticed these white things

444
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:29,515
floating in the rhubarb stew.
Spider eggs, right?

445
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,309
No.

446
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:35,722
The boiling water
would have destroyed the eggs.

447
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,942
- So what are they?
- I have no idea.

448
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,784
Always glad to sow confusion.

449
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:45,799
This man endured
a remarkable amount of abuse.

450
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:47,199
It must have been tough.

451
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,159
This ain't England, pal.

452
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,162
Being gay in America
is still a tough go.

453
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,206
I was referring to being
a football player.

454
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:57,480
Yeah, I knew that.

455
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,505
Four years ago
Jared's girlfriend was a hooker?

456
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,527
An escort.

457
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:04,678
I believe,
in the hierarchy of prostitution,

458
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:06,093
an escort ranks equal to

459
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,836
"high-class call girl".

460
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,931
And now she teaches grade school?

461
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,828
I don't see any other injuries
to the bone

462
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:15,394
that could be cause of death.

463
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:19,593
That leads us back to the head trauma.
Apparently the rule is:

464
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:22,118
once a sex worker,
always a sex worker.

465
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,946
It really would have been better
if Booth never ran her record.

466
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:28,741
He said it was my influence,
that it was the rational thing to do.

467
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,906
No, sweetie, he's rationalizing,

468
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:34,534
which makes what he did
irrational because he's rationalizing

469
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,032
that Jared cannot make
rational decisions for himself...

470
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:39,293
You do the same thing all the time.

471
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,370
Maybe that's what
he learned from you.

472
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:42,964
In order to be fatal,

473
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:46,063
whatever struck the frontal bone
had to be pointed enough

474
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,343
to pierce the brain.

475
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,263
Now, wait a second.
Is Booth going to tell Jared about this?

476
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,065
I believe that's his plan.

477
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,296
What if Jared and this woman
are really in love?

478
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:55,810
He could ruin everything.

479
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,647
Well, not if, as Booth always asserts,
love conquers all.

480
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,580
This is going to be
one hell of a test case.

481
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,905
I ran blood tests on the items
in Dan's athletic bag.

482
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:10,919
I found evidence
of someone else's blood.

483
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:12,356
Football is a contact sport.

484
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:15,288
There are bound to be traces
of other people's DNA on his uniform.

485
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:18,192
This was more than a trace,
and it wasn't on his uniform.

486
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:19,667
It was all over his towel.

487
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:22,178
We ran it through
CODIS and got a match.

488
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:24,297
32-year-old man named Cyd Zigler.

489
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:28,791
Zigler is a firefighter
and a former marine.

490
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,104
He lives in Greenbelt, Maryland.
He plays for one of the,

491
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:32,764
the other teams in Dan's league.

492
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:35,787
- One of the straight teams?
- Yeah, was a big game.

493
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:37,608
Zigler fumbles,

494
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:40,605
the victim recovers,
scores a touchdown, game over.

495
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,535
Well, I doubt even a homophobe
would kill for that.

496
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,028
Yeah, but a fight ensues.

497
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:46,311
So they fought?

498
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,781
If Dan won a physical altercation
in front of both teams,

499
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,768
then there's
a certain personality type

500
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,952
that might feel impugned enough
to strike back.

501
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,722
- Go on.
- Gay guy beats up

502
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,597
a certain type of straight guy,
straight guy can't handle it.

503
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:01,273
That's what I wanted to know.

504
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:05,313
Now, did the victim and Zigler
have any contact since their fistfight?

505
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,465
The two of 'em,
they played against each other

506
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,461
in a game the weekend
before Dan disappeared.

507
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,808
Seeley, your message sounded urgent.
What's going on?

508
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,099
Thanks for the gay insights.

509
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,273
You're welcome.

510
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,651
You got that big brother
look all over your face,

511
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,511
like the time you had to tell me
the puppy I brought home was a rat.

512
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:36,327
- That sort of happened again.
- What the hell are you talking about?

513
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,665
There are some things that
you need to know about Padme.

514
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:44,627
You ran a background check
on my girlfriend?

515
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:46,879
She was arrested
for prostitution 4 years ago.

516
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,323
Shut up, Seeley.

517
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:52,760
The charges, they didn't stick,
but you need to know she was an escort.

518
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,804
You just can't see me happy.

519
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,474
That's not true. If I were you,

520
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,599
I'd want to know if my
girlfriend hide something.

521
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,184
No, you wouldn't.

522
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,491
I have watched you for years.
I learned.

523
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,191
You would make your own judgment.
You wouldn't care what people said.

524
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:09,186
You'd say exactly
what I'm gonna say.

525
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:11,032
Go to hell.

526
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,597
I called him a fag,
the dude kicked my ass,

527
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:27,930
- end of story.
- You got a problem with gays?

528
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,007
No, that was over a year ago.
Look, what's this all about?

529
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,635
I'm trying to put together a sequence
of events before Dan Pinard disappeared.

530
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,888
Disappeared?
W-What do you mean "disappeared"?

531
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:41,456
We found your blood on his towel.

532
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,774
I-I cut myself during a game...
big gash on my leg.

533
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,009
Danny used his towel
to stop the bleeding.

534
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:51,001
- What do you mean "disappeared"?
- He came up to you in the locker room

535
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,356
and he presses that towel
on your leg?

536
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:55,448
I thought...

537
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,243
It was only me.

538
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:01,287
I thought Danny

539
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,669
didn't want to see me anymore.

540
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,497
I-I called him,

541
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:09,520
I went by his place a hundred times.

542
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,405
Nothing.

543
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,687
Why do you think he didn't
want to see you again?

544
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:18,379
Because, Danny had it all figured...

545
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,006
who he was.

546
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:22,988
I wasn't ready.

547
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:25,561
To come out of the closet.

548
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,441
For any of it.

549
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,234
That made Danny mad sometimes,

550
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,437
frustrated.

551
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,887
Is Danny dead?

552
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:44,747
You think I killed him.

553
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,404
Danny was...

554
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,093
The only time I've ever been happy

555
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:59,144
was with Danny.

556
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,703
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

557
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,969
I don't guess
anyone would understand.

558
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:18,489
- Looks like cause of death to me.
- Cause of death,

559
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:19,828
yes, yes,

560
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:23,828
but I cannot discern the cause
of the cause of death, so to speak.

561
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,610
Okay, bugs and slime, pal.

562
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:27,414
Different discipline entirely.

563
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,079
There appear to be three
separate fractures on the skull.

564
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:34,589
We couldn't see them before because
all of the fracture lines connect.

565
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,716
The victim was hit three times.

566
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,196
Dr. Brennan thinks
that the brain was pierced

567
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:42,430
- when the skull was hit.
- Brain piercing,

568
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:45,516
sounds very death-causing to me.

569
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:49,273
The beveling on the exterior
of the skull suggests

570
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:52,690
that all three fracture points
emanate from inside the skull.

571
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,277
His forehead
exploded from the inside out.

572
00:28:56,657 --> 00:28:58,154
Again, very deathy.

573
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,230
Wait a minute.

574
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,409
What would cause someone's forehead
to explode from the inside?

575
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,061
I was hoping that you'd say
it had something to do with those

576
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:08,497
bulbous seedy jobbers
that I thought were spider eggs.

577
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,165
I mean...

578
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:19,613
Wow?

579
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:22,118
What wow?

580
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:24,441
So Zigler was a marine.

581
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:27,350
He gets married to a woman,
it lasts six years. Why?

582
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,283
- Why did it last six years?
- Why did he get married?

583
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:33,147
Most likely Zigler was trying
to conform to social norms.

584
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,816
In many cultures,
homosexuality is revered.

585
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:37,443
Anthropologically,

586
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,905
it makes no sense
for heterosexuals to be

587
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,356
threatened by homosexuals

588
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:44,116
because they are removing themselves
from competition for mates.

589
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,337
So Zigler forces himself to conform,
and the dentist comes along

590
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:49,664
and forces, you know,
Zigler to confront...

591
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:52,792
Zigler couldn't come to terms
with his sexual orientation,

592
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,502
so when the victim elicited this

593
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,462
flood of unwanted feelings

594
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,798
in him, he transferred
the self-loathing

595
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,508
from himself to the victim.

596
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:04,247
Native Americans believed that
homosexuals were of two spirits,

597
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:07,223
held them in high esteem.
So what's the problem?

598
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,975
It's no problem.

599
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:10,643
I was a soldier.

600
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,937
Gay guys saved my life
in battle more than once.

601
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:15,940
So are you saying that
if a former prostitute saved

602
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,402
your life in battle, that would solve
the problem with Jared's girlfriend?

603
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,278
What?

604
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:22,446
You're going to bring that up
right now?

605
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,115
It's a rational question.

606
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:26,450
Sorry, Jared's involved
with a prostitute?

607
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,369
Former prostitute.

608
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,371
What?

609
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,665
Did you run a background
check on Jared's girlfriend?

610
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,835
Why is everybody saying that to me
like it's some sort of terrible thing?

611
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,169
'Cause it is.

612
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,126
I'm just looking out for my brother,

613
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,465
so can we just, you know,
focus on the case?

614
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,678
The fact

615
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:48,180
that the suspect carries
in his wallet a photo

616
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,599
of them doesn't

617
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,726
really jibe with homosexual panic.

618
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,936
Thanks, that's all I need to know.

619
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:55,938
Thanks, appreciate it, Sweets.

620
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:00,985
- That was...
- I have to go, too.

621
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,015
Thank you,

622
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,060
for your invaluable psychological
insights into the human condition.

623
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,849
Do you know
what Vincent Nigel-Murray is?

624
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,181
He's a genius.

625
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,624
But so are we all,
except for Angela.

626
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,755
Right, and yet, who do you turn to
when you need pretty pictures?

627
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:22,581
Dr. Hodgins figured out

628
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,561
what caused the fracture
to the frontal bone.

629
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:26,915
Vincent found these
small particulates

630
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,812
floating in the rhubarb stew, right?

631
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:30,848
I identified them
as silica phytolith,

632
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:31,886
which is a

633
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:34,894
a razor-thin, clear hard shell
which protects seeds.

634
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:36,687
The victim was tossed

635
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,964
into the creek bed where
his body quickly decomposed.

636
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:40,358
Flooding from the rain

637
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:43,694
washed the clay and debris into
that creek bed, which encased the body.

638
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,071
In all that muck,

639
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,783
three periwinkle seeds became
embedded within the victim's skull.

640
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,787
It's called floral turbation.

641
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:53,245
Over time,

642
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,616
soft can become even
harder than hard,

643
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:58,751
like a sliver of grass
that grows through cement.

644
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,613
The same kind of process

645
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:03,256
that causes tree roots
to destroy pipes.

646
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:06,259
So a seedling fractured
the frontal bone?

647
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:07,943
Three of them.

648
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:14,483
So head trauma was
not cause of death.

649
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,414
We have no cause of death.

650
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:20,477
Did she seem disappointed
to anyone else?

651
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:23,028
She definitely seemed
disappointed to me.

652
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:33,679
The pollen from the egg sack
is from hickory pine trees.

653
00:33:34,024 --> 00:33:35,700
But they don't grow
where the body was.

654
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:38,184
She didn't even want me
to help her examine the bones.

655
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:40,728
Okay, you're not listening to me.

656
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,767
The-the keening
shriek of intern anxiety

657
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,524
is interfering with my hearing.

658
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,520
There is a slice
on the medial malleolus.

659
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,572
Yes, duly noted in my report.

660
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,699
But you didn't note
what that might mean.

661
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:56,619
I would, most

662
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,412
definitely have done so, if-if

663
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,706
I had the slightest inkling
of what it might mean.

664
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,803
Whatever caused the nick
on this bone

665
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:05,211
must have cut the posterior
tibial artery.

666
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:07,088
Oh, yes. Tissue.

667
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:08,798
Um, posterior

668
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,171
tibial artery...

669
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:12,343
massive bleeding.

670
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,054
Dude, you should totally just
toss culpability onto Cam.

671
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,389
I need to know

672
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,975
if the weapon that caused this
left any trace in the bone.

673
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,519
Vincent's rhubarb stew

674
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,105
completely washed away all
the surface particulates.

675
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:26,357
See how that's done?

676
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:30,143
We can sand down the top
layer of bones cells

677
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,904
and analyze what lies beneath.

678
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:33,406
Thank you.

679
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:40,454
My bad.

680
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:48,045
You can't blame Mr. Nigel-Murray.
The nick was on the bone,

681
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,581
but I should've realized
the implications for the flesh.

682
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,300
- And I didn't.
- I agree.

683
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:56,137
Then why are you letting him worry
that he's disappointing you?

684
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,391
Mr. Nigel-Murray
should be aware by now

685
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:01,218
that I don't hold others
to my level of expertise.

686
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,549
Otherwise I'd have
no one to help me.

687
00:35:03,674 --> 00:35:05,971
How would he know that
if you don't tell him?

688
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:08,316
Tungsten carbide,
which is a compound

689
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,880
used to coat various types of tools.

690
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:12,933
Including dental tools.

691
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:18,793
I distinctly remember saying
to you once,

692
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,911
"Good job, Mr. Nigel-Murray."

693
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:23,791
- I'm saying it again now.
- Cheers.

694
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:25,322
Brilliant, that.

695
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:27,793
One of the suspects was
Dan's dental hygienist...

696
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,086
Grace Bryson.

697
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,797
- Where does she live?
- Fairfax, Virginia.

698
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,441
Okay, the pollen I found

699
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,927
in the sheet weaver spider's
egg sack came from hickory

700
00:35:36,095 --> 00:35:37,261
pine trees.

701
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:38,888
Don't grow where the body was,

702
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:41,390
but you can find them all over
that part of Virginia.

703
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:42,975
Motive,

704
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,443
theoretical weapon, spiders.

705
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,724
That should be enough for an arrest.

706
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:55,099
According to Grace's statement,

707
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:58,491
she and her husband were at a yoga
retreat when Dan Pinard disappeared.

708
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,836
The retreat was in Silver Spring.
That's close enough to drive back,

709
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,121
kill Dan and then return to the spa.

710
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,248
Right. It could be both her
and her husband.

711
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,834
When your gut speaks to you,

712
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:12,046
do you think it could be an increase
in stomach acid, due to anxiety?

713
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:15,988
I feel some anxiety.

714
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:17,811
About what?

715
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:20,346
About your sudden abandonment
of a belief system.

716
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:22,602
It's making my stomach upset.

717
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:24,410
You are really just...

718
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,811
crack a window there.
Just get some air.

719
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:30,182
You told me that my father's
criminal past didn't matter.

720
00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:33,234
That the love between us was real
and that was all that mattered.

721
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:35,119
Because I believed you,

722
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:37,693
my father and I have
a relationship today.

723
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,080
I'm glad I could help out.

724
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,547
But I'm anxious because I can't
see any meaningful difference

725
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:46,285
between my father and your
brother's girlfriend.

726
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,786
Can you explain that to me?

727
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,333
It's a question of logic, so
I'm going to be quiet

728
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,188
while you work your way through it.

729
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:08,060
I already told you where I was,
at the yoga retreat.

730
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,548
But you would have had

731
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:11,856
more than enough time to
leave the retreat and return.

732
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:14,317
I didn't.
So, can you leave me alone?

733
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:16,444
After Dan fired you, you
couldn't find a job.

734
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,988
That wasn't Dan's fault.
That was the hepatitis.

735
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,782
Ms. Bryson, do you own
a set of dental tools?

736
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,285
I had to buy a set
when I was in school. Why?

737
00:37:24,686 --> 00:37:25,870
Can we see 'em?

738
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,967
Not without a warrant.

739
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:34,757
When did you put in this driveway?

740
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,085
- Excuse me?
- When were these paving stones laid?

741
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:42,094
A few months ago.
Is there something

742
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:43,763
illegal now about that?

743
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,251
- What's going on?
- Look at the stones.

744
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,059
You know, these stones look just

745
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:50,019
like the ones that
were at Dan's house.

746
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:52,579
It's the same contractor.
Lucas.

747
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,515
I met him at Dan's office,
before I was fired.

748
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,692
He said he had

749
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,654
some extra materials left over from
Dan's job and he could give me a deal.

750
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:00,552
A scam.

751
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:03,074
Lucas was reselling the supplies
that Dan had already paid for.

752
00:38:03,562 --> 00:38:04,957
I didn't know that.

753
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:09,121
Was Lucas working on the driveway
when you were at the yoga retreat?

754
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:12,618
He was finished
by the time we got back.

755
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,745
Was the fastest
he ever finished anything.

756
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,338
We need to dig these up.

757
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,255
Backhoe and a cement cutter.

758
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:30,649
The bottom of the paving stones
are covered in blood.

759
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,481
All the samples I've taken are
a match for the victim.

760
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,549
He bled out on the ground.
Then it was paved over.

761
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:40,421
Behold, Lucas Pickford's
grout scraper.

762
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:42,422
He used it for installing
the paving stones.

763
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:45,032
- Coated in tungsten carbide.
- Tell me it's a match.

764
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,926
It is, in fact, a perfect match

765
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,852
for the injury to the
victim's ankle.

766
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:53,238
Cheers.
Brilliant.

767
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,898
No, she didn't say anything.

768
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,235
I-I discerned a lovely...

769
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,028
a little glint of
approbation in her eye.

770
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,023
I-I admit it.
We had an argument.

771
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,774
About the paving stones?

772
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,651
- Yeah.
- Did you call him something?

773
00:39:21,129 --> 00:39:23,154
A vulgar slur for "homosexual?"

774
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:25,581
In the heat of the moment, maybe.

775
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:27,867
But you should've heard
what he was calling me!

776
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:30,620
Dan knocked me down and
he started kicking me.

777
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:32,330
So I grabbed the scraper,

778
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,081
and swung it at him
to get him off me.

779
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,256
Self-defense.

780
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,700
Yeah, that's it.

781
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:39,420
I... I'll admit it.
It was self-defense.

782
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,734
Yeah, except you didn't call 911.

783
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,740
No. You just watched him
bleed to death,

784
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,732
and then you dumped
his body in a ditch.

785
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:49,343
If he charged me with theft,

786
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,766
I lose my license.

787
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,106
My whole livelihood.
For what?

788
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,520
A few dozen paving stones?

789
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,524
The guy attacked me
for a few dozen paving stones.

790
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:01,840
You robbed him.

791
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,167
You lied about it, and
you called him a "fag."

792
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:07,116
To him, that was a big deal.

793
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:21,970
I'm sure Jared wants
to talk to you alone.

794
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,106
He asked you.

795
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,171
I don't want to be in a fight.

796
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,802
There's going to be no fighting.
I promise, all right?

797
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,054
So, you really think I was wrong?

798
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,265
I don't know.

799
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,059
But I fail to see the
point of being right.

800
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,315
I've really been thinking
about what you said.

801
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:45,127
What if I ruined it for him?
What if he was really happy with her?

802
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:46,904
You would never forgive yourself.

803
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,492
- Thanks.
- On the bright side,

804
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:52,076
- he might totally ignore you.
- Great. Thank you.

805
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,003
Well, perhaps Jared
will think for himself.

806
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:57,540
Isn't that all you've ever
really wanted for him?

807
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,314
Sorry we're late.

808
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,169
Padme, this is Temperance Brennan.

809
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:04,338
This is my brother's partner,

810
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:05,590
slash friend.

811
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,906
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

812
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:12,255
Here we are.

813
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,453
Think we can talk outside,
privately?

814
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:18,603
Whatever you want to say,
you can say to both of us.

815
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,236
See, we don't have secrets, Seeley.

816
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:24,121
Never did.
About anything.

817
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:27,528
I suspect Jared is implying
that he already knew about Padme's

818
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:28,946
past as an escort.

819
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,511
Great, thanks.
I got that.

820
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:33,694
Jared and I have come to grips
with... everything.

821
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:38,188
So, the question is:
Are you in or are you out?

822
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:41,584
- I'm in.
- Good.

823
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:42,735
Good, 'cause

824
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,138
I really wanted to know
if you'd be my best man.

825
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:51,302
So soon. It's only been, what,
a month?

826
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,670
What?

827
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:55,848
She kicked me under the table.
Pretty sure she was aiming for you.

828
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,266
Definitely meant for me.

829
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,977
If that's true, I like her.

830
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,146
I'd like to make a toast.

831
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:04,148
What is this?

832
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:06,684
It's her new thing.
She's really good at it, though.

833
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:09,612
- Maybe we should get some champagne.
- No, Jared is an alcoholic.

834
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,033
No secrets.

835
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:15,353
When Booth and I first met,

836
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,760
I didn't believe that such
a thing as love existed.

837
00:42:20,656 --> 00:42:23,185
I maintained that it was
simply brain chemistry.

838
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:27,722
But perhaps Booth is correct.

839
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,799
Perhaps love comes first

840
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,102
and then creates the reaction.

841
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:35,799
I have no tangible proof, but...

842
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:39,832
I'm willing to accept
Booth's premise.

843
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:42,741
To love.

844
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:44,146
To love.

845
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,080
To love.

846
00:42:45,205 --> 00:42:46,107
To love.

847
