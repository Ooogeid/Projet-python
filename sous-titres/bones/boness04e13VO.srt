1
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:05,963
Let's have
a nice clean game, everyone.

2
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:10,157
Down.

3
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:14,305
Move the puck, Wendell!
Move it! Move the puck!

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,973
Up here, Booth. Up here!

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,392
Back on D.

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,864
Pick 'em up, on D, pick 'em up.

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:26,995
Go, Booth!

8
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:29,987
Go, Booth! Go, Booth!

9
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,552
Kill 'em, Booth!

10
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,292
- What did he do that for?
- It's what Booth does.

11
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:42,041
Keeps the other team honest.
He's what you call an enforcer.

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,751
What, like law enforcement?

13
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,587
- Yeah, okay.
- Well, let's go with that.

14
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:49,465
Oh, what was that?

15
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:52,051
What about the cross-check?
Ref, are you blind?

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,734
Pass it! I'm open!
Pass it! I'm open!

17
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,607
Pick him off!

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,600
That was a cheap shot, Carlson.

19
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,103
Yeah, you guys suck.

20
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,128
That's 24 Blue,
two minutes for charging.

21
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:07,858
- For what?
- What about the cross...

22
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,984
Get in the box!

23
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,569
Come on, man. It's hockey.

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,322
Club hockey, and some of us
have to go work in the morning, OK, pal?

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,908
- Enough. Let's go.
- Carlson, calm down! Skate away.

26
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,552
Go in the box. Go on,
get in there and sit down.

27
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:21,288
Sit down, crybaby.

28
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,575
Let's go.

29
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:25,114
So, this is punitive, right?

30
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:27,420
To be sent to this little area here?

31
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,472
Keep your head up next time, number 12.
Keep your head up.

32
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,385
Yeah, yeah, I'll be waiting.

33
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:34,816
Come on!

34
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:38,224
It's called a penalty box,
you know, send in.

35
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,873
Yeah, Booth committed a penalty
when he checked the big guy

36
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:42,751
when he didn't have the puck.

37
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,019
Stay with him, Paul.

38
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:47,440
There's a hit right there,
Ref, that you missed again.

39
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:51,468
Booth seems quite anxious to get out
of the disciplinary box.

40
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:54,196
Yeah, I've never seen him
this agitated before.

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,239
Open man!

42
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:03,956
- That's not good, right?
- No.

43
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:06,996
Go, Booth!

44
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:15,239
Wendell might get a basket!

45
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:20,514
Elbow, Ref! Elbow!

46
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,642
- Is Wendell okay?
- That can't be legal.

47
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,311
It definitely is not.

48
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,317
Come on,
what are you doing, Carlson?

49
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,688
Want to go?

50
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,528
Come on, come on.

51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,530
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

52
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,285
You're a dirty player, Carlson.

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,503
You don't take shots at my guys.

54
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:53,005
You got that? Ends here.

55
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:54,673
OK, Carlson?

56
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,637
Ends here.

57
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,723
- Booth seems to be winning.
- Well, it's Booth I'm worried about.

58
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,229
No more.

59
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,021
I'm gonna have to call
a game misconduct on that one.

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,088
You get up off the ice, we'll finish
this in the parking lot. Come on.

61
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,110
If you did your job,
I wouldn't have to do it for you.

62
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,403
He's hitting my guys.

63
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,491
Son of a bitch.

64
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,170
Get up. You all right?

65
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,718
- Oh, did I score, man?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah...

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,303
Come on.

67
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:34,755
I do not know how I feel about this.

68
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:36,991
It's very primal. I like it!

69
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,051
It just a little too much.

70
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,842
- Come on, team.
- All right, come on, let's focus.

71
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,887
So, you still seeing double?

72
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,519
Only when I open more than one eye.

73
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,677
Your hand's busted.

74
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:53,941
Yeah, well, you know,
guy left his helmet on.

75
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,653
Hey, you two all right?

76
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,408
- What?
- Want to wait outside?

77
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,996
Your hand might be broken.

78
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,453
- Do you want me to look at it?
- It's OK. Wait outside please.

79
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,485
It's a men's locker room, Bones.

80
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,888
There comes a time in ice fishing

81
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,988
when it's time for the father
to turn the drilling over to his son.

82
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,082
Man, this is a great day.

83
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,099
You give me a beer,
let me run the augur.

84
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,112
You're 18, Leo.

85
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,404
You start drilling holes,
it's safety first.

86
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,269
- You got me?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,890
Nothing I'm saying here
applies only to ice augurs.

88
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:47,974
You get me?

89
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,311
- All right.
- Good.

90
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:54,014
You know, that way,
you don't fall through the ice and die,

91
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,754
or get a disease,

92
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,380
- or get pregnant.
- Dad, come on.

93
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,259
- Okay. Go ahead.
- All right.

94
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:04,832
That a boy.

95
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:06,722
Keep her perpendicular.

96
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,345
Once you get it in a little bit,
you can speed her up, let her rip.

97
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:13,479
All right, let her rip.

98
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,274
Dad, she... she's bleeding.

99
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,983
- I... she's bleeding.
- Pull out. Pull out.

100
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,667
Oh, I hope that's fish.

101
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,249
You better go wait in the truck.

102
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:42,151
What do you think there, Bones?

103
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,255
I would surmise that the body
went into the lake before it froze,

104
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,879
then the lake froze,
then the body floated up

105
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,015
and became attached
to the bottom of the ice.

106
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,044
I meant, was he murdered?

107
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,685
Maybe. Could have been

108
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:57,647
an accident or a suicide, except...

109
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,025
- You shouldn't do that.
- It itches, okay?

110
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,932
Yeah, well, except for what?

111
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:06,031
Trauma to the left

112
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,534
maxillary orbit suggests violence.

113
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,634
- It's kind of gross, what you're doing.
- Gross?

114
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,038
You got your finger
in some guy's maxillary orbit.

115
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,581
I don't think there's anything else
to be learned here, so

116
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:17,626
let's get this Popsicle
back to the lab.

117
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,045
Hey, look at that.
Bones, you made a joke.

118
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,227
Well, I can be quite amusing.

119
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,372
Wait a second.

120
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,386
You aren't wearing any gloves.

121
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,130
Bones, I...

122
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,144
Remember that guy I punched out
last month during my hockey game?

123
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,480
Yes. When you broke your hand.

124
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,230
That's him.

125
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,446
I'm a suspect.

126
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,367
Here.

127
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,364
Bones - Season 04 Episode 13
"The Fire in Ice"

128
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,587
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

129
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,276
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

130
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,001
Given that Agent Booth is currently
the prime suspect in this murder...

131
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,244
- We don't know it's a murder.
- Look at that, I'm the prime suspect.

132
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,456
Agent Payton Perotta here
will be working with Dr. Brennan.

133
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,589
I won't work the case without Booth.

134
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:42,294
In that case, I invite Agent Booth's
continued participation.

135
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:44,751
In the background as an advisor.

136
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:47,454
Agent Payton Perotta
has earned bachelors degrees

137
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,802
in both forensic science
and criminology.

138
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,597
Well, anything short of a doctorate
is virtually useless at my level.

139
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,279
- How would you like to proceed?
- Well, it's pretty obvious.

140
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:59,019
We definitely want to interrogate
the primary suspect, right?

141
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:01,323
Yeah.

142
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:06,746
Based on decomp,

143
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:09,652
I'd put time of death at about
five days prior to freezing.

144
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,740
Local cops say the lake froze
over 3 weeks ago.

145
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,298
Aside from some dormant
anopheles mosquito larvae,

146
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:17,329
whatever the water from the lake
tells us, it'll be through a microscope.

147
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,581
If Booth is a suspect,
then I should be, too.

148
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,186
This guy scrambled my brains.

149
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,101
Your alibi is that
you were seeing double

150
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,128
and being taken care
of by your mother.

151
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,579
I'll get on the fluid samples
you took from the lungs and esophagus.

152
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:31,635
Could be the vic was drowned somewhere
else and then dumped in the lake.

153
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,929
No. Drowning's not the way
Booth would kill someone.

154
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:38,449
Not that I actually suspect Booth.

155
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:40,060
At all.

156
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,889
Quit staring at me.

157
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:52,573
In the course of the game,
the victim and I exchanged blows.

158
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,409
- Who initiated the fight?
- It was hockey.

159
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:59,621
- So, it was spontaneous combustion?
- The guy hit two of my players.

160
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,708
- The ref... he didn't catch that.
- And that made you angry?

161
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,460
Not angry enough, you know,

162
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,712
to chase him down
after the game and kill him.

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,352
Where did you go after the game?

164
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,591
Bones drove me
and Wendell to the hospital.

165
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,302
So, no alibi that night or the next?

166
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,429
Bones and I are just partners.

167
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:19,715
Okay.

168
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,311
Now you're answering questions
I had no intention of asking.

169
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,005
Is it your contention that,

170
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,551
your argument with the victim
was constrained to the ice?

171
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,276
That is my contention.

172
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,255
'Cause I have a-a witness

173
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,612
who stated you told Carlson,
and I quote,

174
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:36,658
"You get up off that ice, and we'll
settle this out in the parking lot."

175
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,493
Trash talking.

176
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:41,506
Let me cut to the chase here.

177
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,583
- Did you kill Pete Carlson?
- No.

178
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,254
- Did you dump his body in the lake?
- No, I did not, Agent Perotta.

179
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,626
Do you feel that your experience

180
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,735
as the child of an abusive alcoholic
has made you more

181
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,222
prone to violence?

182
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,476
Excuse me.

183
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:11,636
What the hell are you doing?

184
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,904
It's part of my job
to assist the interrogating agent.

185
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,677
You know I didn't murder anyone.

186
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,658
What you're doing now is
you're studying me.

187
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,250
- That's part of our agreement, too.
- You have a question for me,

188
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,995
you ask me yourself.
Don't use her.

189
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,790
All right, okay, two questions.

190
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,126
One: am I picking up
some sexual tension

191
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,626
between you and Agent Perotta?

192
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,815
How the hell do I know
what you're picking up?

193
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,076
Two:

194
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:34,863
underneath your affable exterior

195
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,708
is a deep reservoir of rage.

196
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,640
My question is, do you always
have that under control?

197
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,977
You know, if I didn't, you'd be dead
right now instead of just wincing.

198
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,355
- I'm not wincing.
- Don't ever bring my old man up again.

199
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,418
Rats. I winced.

200
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
So...

201
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,040
Do you have any more questions?

202
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:09,916
Thank you.

203
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:11,927
Yeah.

204
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:15,048
- You work out much?
- Yeah, I'm pretty consistent.

205
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,968
You look like you take
excellent care of yourself.

206
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:22,726
Okay, this is useless.

207
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,857
Both patellas are fractured.

208
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,439
- As though he'd fallen to his knees?
- Yeah, with a great deal of force.

209
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:33,461
- During a hockey game?
- No, not if he wore pads.

210
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,964
I believe that this
is the cause of death.

211
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,234
Penetration
of the lachrymal sac here,

212
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,690
deep into
the inferior orbital fissure.

213
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:44,119
Yeah, I would have thought
a small caliber bullet, but...

214
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,704
No sign of bullet fragments.

215
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,788
Yeah.

216
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:54,852
This is Pete's apartment.
He wasn't the best housekeeper.

217
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:57,505
Ms. Withers, was Mr. Carlson
up to date on his rent?

218
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,437
Good question.
Great start.

219
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,554
Yes. Mostly.

220
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,348
500 bucks short.

221
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,018
He didn't need much.
He was a big kid at heart.

222
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,813
Poor Pete.

223
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:12,189
What he really loved was hockey.

224
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:15,959
I wouldn't be surprised if that's why
he joined the volunteer fire department.

225
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,271
I even got him this necklace.

226
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,282
Crossed hockey sticks.

227
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:26,061
- You attended his games?
- Oh, all of them.

228
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,205
- Yeah.
- You were a couple?

229
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,280
It looks like someone

230
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:34,252
went through all of his belongings
and then left them on the floor.

231
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,793
It always looked like that.

232
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,465
The car outside
with the flat tires, is that his?

233
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,760
Yeah, somebody slashed the tires
just before he disappeared.

234
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,537
Why didn't you report him missing?

235
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,156
I thought maybe...

236
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,475
I thought he was staying
with someone else.

237
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,812
There's a lot of bills here.
"Final notice, past due..."

238
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,481
Looks like he couldn't afford
to feed his fish, either.

239
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,636
"Albie, Thursday, 11:00 p.m."

240
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,904
Do you know who Albie is?

241
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,665
I don't know.

242
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,907
This is blood.

243
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,705
It's a hockey jersey.

244
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,953
Hockey players bleed
sometimes when they play the game.

245
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,413
Ms. Withers, how bad
were his financial problems?

246
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:13,120
Well, a couple days
before Pete disappeared,

247
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,919
he asked me for $2,000.

248
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,772
Did he say what for?

249
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,533
He liked me.

250
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,039
You know?

251
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:22,858
He was one of these guys, he...

252
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,883
he didn't say much,
but he could be real sweet.

253
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,764
And a man borrows money from a woman,
it means there's a bond of trust,

254
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,812
I don't understand your reasoning.

255
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,483
I do. It's definitely...

256
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,879
a bond of trust.
You're absolutely right.

257
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,057
We're terribly sorry for your loss.

258
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,541
- Is that our victim?
- Yes.

259
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:52,622
The last of the tissue samples.

260
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,333
Wendell can clean the skeleton now
and you can do your thing.

261
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,259
You still think cause of death

262
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:59,713
was a projectile
through the left eye?

263
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,974
Yes, but since we found no bullet,

264
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,801
nor any indication of gunpowder
residue in the wound,

265
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,929
we're stumped as
to what kind of projectile.

266
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,140
The alveolus
around the incisor is cracked,

267
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,027
the socket caked with blood.

268
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,685
This is a recent loss.

269
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,228
He was a hockey player.

270
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,709
So basically,
we're talking about gladiators.

271
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,107
And I love it.

272
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,736
Perhaps the sight of males
battling stimulates

273
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,582
the part of your brain which has
so far failed to find a suitable mate.

274
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:28,742
And thank God you're here.

275
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:32,717
The water I found in the victim's
esophagus, not from the lake.

276
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:35,070
Lake water
is microorganism infested.

277
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:37,494
Water in his throat,
deionized brine water.

278
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,228
He was killed, then dumped
in the ocean then dumped in the lake?

279
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,650
Deionized brine water freezes clear.

280
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,443
It contains an antifreezing agent,
which I know sounds counterintuitive...

281
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,468
Ice rinks.

282
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,124
Kind of jumped
my punch line there, Dr. B.

283
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,641
But, yes. We should see what
rinks are closest to the lake.

284
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,917
It's the one Booth played at.

285
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,660
I find it interesting that the evidence
keeps pointing toward Booth.

286
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,667
Pete Carlson was murdered?

287
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,960
He's indestructible.

288
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,503
Not so indestructible.

289
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,463
This guy took him down
a few notches.

290
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,920
Made him stay down, too.

291
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,300
It was the heat of the game.
Your guy crossed the line.

292
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,511
He was our enforcer.
Took the job real serious.

293
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,069
Whoever got Pete
must've got a drop on him.

294
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,258
- Pete wouldn't go easy.
- You mind my asking

295
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,809
why nobody reported him missing?

296
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,562
The night after you flattened Pete,
we go up against the State Police.

297
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,583
Then Pete gets into a beef
with a big State Police left-winger.

298
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,686
'Cause you handed him
his ass on a platter,

299
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,842
Pete maybe had something
to prove that night.

300
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,111
You got a name?

301
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:48,989
- Hey, Alex?!
- Yo!

302
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,272
Come here!

303
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,911
The fuzz player that Pete got into it
with his last game, remember his name?

304
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,621
Yeah, Lou Herrin, number five.

305
00:15:57,035 --> 00:16:00,166
He took Herrin down with a cheap shot.
He got tossed out the rest of season.

306
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,959
Any chance that Pete and this guy,
continued their fight off the ice?

307
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,506
- People threaten.
- Yeah, but nobody carries through.

308
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,216
Yeah, keep it on the ice, right?

309
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,572
If I were you,
I would talk to Chloe.

310
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:13,869
- Who's Chloe?
- Chloe Bratton.

311
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,248
Chloe's a puck bunny.

312
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,977
Here and Pete put in some quality
mattress time before he dumped here.

313
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,697
Well, mattress really isn't,
Chloe's style.

314
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,537
- No offense.
- None taken.

315
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,357
I favor backseats myself.

316
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,657
I can't believe Pete's gone.

317
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,671
- How long ago did you two break up?
- Break up?

318
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:38,179
We didn't break up.

319
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,056
- His teammates think you did.
- No,

320
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:42,125
we had this
on-again/off-again thing.

321
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,090
It was casual.
No biggie.

322
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,212
You didn't mind that
he slept with different women?

323
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:48,468
I wouldn't have minded if he did,

324
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:50,675
but I happen to know he didn't.

325
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,113
Well, I happen to know that he did.

326
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:55,138
- Right.
- Who?

327
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,017
It doesn't matter, does it?
Given that your relationship was so,

328
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,142
casual?

329
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:01,936
- You slashed his tires, right?
- Agent...

330
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,885
- No.
- We can prove you did it,

331
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,650
so here's the deal:
you tell us the truth from now on,

332
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,758
and we won't charge you with vandalism
and obstruction of justice.

333
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,558
Let's try it again. You slashed...

334
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,043
Yes. Of course.

335
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,275
Let's try this again.

336
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,911
You slashed his tires, didn't you?

337
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,318
Yes.

338
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,756
I mean, he was sleeping
with someone else.

339
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:27,087
I got passions
that take over sometimes.

340
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,188
You know how it is when
the guy you give yourself

341
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,508
to just goes off with someone else.

342
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,344
Who's... Albie?

343
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:36,085
Albie?

344
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:41,476
Albie runs this poker game in back
of a Chinese food joint off I Street.

345
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,538
Probably why Pete
was broke all the time.

346
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,356
So, who'd you say Pete
was sleeping with?

347
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:49,192
I think we've got enough
information for today, Ms. Bratton.

348
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,069
Thank you very much
for your cooperation.

349
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,314
Thanks.

350
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,951
- Any luck with the murder weapon?
- Yes.

351
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,631
We are certain it
is not a screwdriver.

352
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,665
The blood on the victim's jersey
was all his own.

353
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,209
The rib cage has been bruised.

354
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:08,748
- It has?
- Yes.

355
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,406
See this vague pattern
of bone bruising?

356
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,353
Yeah, it extends from
the right clavicle through

357
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:16,511
anterior ribs four through eight.

358
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,224
He was struck repeatedly.

359
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,180
Like, by a hockey stick?

360
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:23,233
- During the game maybe?
- Not during.

361
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:25,503
The, padding would prevent
that kind of bruising.

362
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,419
I'll take a closer look.

363
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:30,794
I can't believe I missed that.

364
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,327
No, I can't believe
you missed that, either.

365
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,726
I was signaling you
to encourage Wendell

366
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:55,049
by saying anyone
could've missed that, but...

367
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,729
You should have said so.

368
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:59,179
Booth says I stink
at nonverbal communication.

369
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:03,997
She said in the back.

370
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:07,940
Just don't be pulling your gun
until you go through the kitchen,

371
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,652
or Mama-san there
is going to hit the panic button.

372
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,012
Okay, just...

373
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,524
So you're ready to risk a gun fight
with your weapon in the wrong hand?

374
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:22,909
- I don't have a wrong hand.
- I'm curious.

375
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,599
When you shoot with your left hand,

376
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,737
does it feel like
somebody else is shooting?

377
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:35,381
- What do we do now?
- Okay, FBI.

378
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,760
Okay, I'd reach for my badge
right now, but...

379
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,991
- Drop your weapons, please.
- "Please"?

380
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:43,141
The FBI does not say "please."
Okay, look.

381
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:46,518
I really don't care
about the illegal gambling.

382
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:50,355
I just want to talk
to a guy named Albie

383
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,565
about a guy named Pete Carlson.

384
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:00,406
I'm Albie.

385
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,288
First rule: don't kill the people
who owe you money.

386
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:09,541
All you get then is
trouble and no money.

387
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,459
How much money did Carlson owe you?

388
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:16,596
Okay, so you got your operation
shut down and moved out,

389
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:19,175
because I can have my guys here
in about what, three minutes

390
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,259
to mop that back room up?

391
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:24,508
Pete carlson was not a bad
player most of the time, but...

392
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,182
You know, every once in a while...

393
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,851
He got brave and lost everything?

394
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,256
- Gamble a bit yourself, do you?
- I'm reformed.

395
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:33,314
Tell me, when was the last
time carlson got brave?

396
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,748
Last month.

397
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,860
But he paid up in full
a couple days later.

398
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:37,944
Cash?

399
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,756
Little garish, don't you think?

400
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:48,246
I don't know where pete got it,
but it covered his debt.

401
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,164
I'm going to have to take this.

402
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,001
If I didn't intend to give it to you,
you'd never have seen it.

403
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,903
Okay, you gave me the time
I needed to move my operation

404
00:20:57,028 --> 00:20:58,507
I gave you evidence.

405
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,841
I call us square.

406
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,841
You decide to get back into the game,
you look me up.

407
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,763
Right. Yeah.

408
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,851
We gonna call this in?

409
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,275
No point. Like the woman said,
she's moved on.

410
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,745
Hodgins confirmed
that the traces of rink water

411
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,128
in the victim's esophagus
came from this rink.

412
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,387
How did rink ice
get into his throat?

413
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:28,510
He was beaten, then a sharp
instrument was thrust into his eye.

414
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:29,898
There should be...

415
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,294
blood stains.

416
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:35,242
You're going to scan the
ice with one little wand?

417
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,462
I'll call in an fbi forensics team.

418
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,923
- We'll have the whole place searched.
- No need.

419
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,716
All you need is black light, right?

420
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:43,510
- Yes.
- Right?

421
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,342
I got a great idea, just stay here.

422
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,281
It's very slippery, don't move.

423
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,186
Ready?

424
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:52,621
How's that, huh?

425
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:53,746
Nice.

426
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Gonna work?

427
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,607
Well, I see some...

428
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:58,880
flecks of blood.

429
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,001
No we're looking for something
bigger than these...

430
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:02,987
small specs and spots.

431
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,685
The victim was stabbed in the eye.

432
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,663
We're looking for a
pretty significant puddle.

433
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:09,752
Two guys get into a beef, then they
put their street clothes on and then

434
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,163
come back here on the ice
to duke it out? No.

435
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:14,133
- Booth?
- Yeah?

436
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,011
My god.

437
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,922
This is going to turn out to be
where pete carlson was murdered.

438
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:32,116
This is all the ice from
the crime scene,

439
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,299
including the scrapings
from the zamboni.

440
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,308
We should be able to get
enough dna out of this

441
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,360
to confirm the blood is Carlson's.

442
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:41,165
Human tooth.

443
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,276
It's hockey.

444
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,445
That zamboni probably had
a hundred teeth in there.

445
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,493
Looks like we found where
the tooth fairy winters.

446
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,485
- Did you find a match yet?
- Just started.

447
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,711
Cam says it's definitely
the victim's blood.

448
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,546
I haven't found the murder weapon.

449
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,483
I know, I still haven't identified
the nylon polymer

450
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,111
I found on the victim's shirt.

451
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:08,531
So, I've looked at, like,
a thousand photos

452
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:10,304
of those blood patterns at the rink.

453
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,266
- And tons from the apartment.
- Why, what are you looking for?

454
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,123
Here's a blood pattern at the rink.

455
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:17,103
The body was dragged
in that direction.

456
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:19,981
The body was dragged that way,
but what are those drops over there?

457
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:22,923
- What drops?
- Those drops right there.

458
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:25,194
They parallel the dragging body.
And...

459
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,612
They aren't smeared.

460
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,284
These parallel drops
aren't from the victim.

461
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:32,076
They're from whoever
dragged him across the ice.

462
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,864
Well, that means we have to check
for more than just pete's dna.

463
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:37,257
Too bad we can't question the fish.

464
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,625
What killed those fish?

465
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,335
Not eating for three weeks.

466
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,901
If that happened,
they would eat each other.

467
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,634
Grab your coat.
We're going on a field trip.

468
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,743
And tell cam to check
the rink samples

469
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,985
to find out if there was
a second source of dna.

470
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,269
I'm not really a big fan of this...

471
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,886
barking out orders stuff.

472
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,026
Agent Booth,

473
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:07,950
it's come to the attention
of the deputy director

474
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,823
that you are a viable suspect
in a murder case.

475
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:14,118
Right, okay, and he wants you to
make sure

476
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,973
- that I'm not viable.
- That's correct.

477
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:18,391
Come on, sweets,
you know I didn't kill anyone, so...

478
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,962
You know,
put that in shrink talk and...

479
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,127
write out your little form
and send it in.

480
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,697
Yes, of course, but to do that,

481
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,291
I need to ask you some questions.

482
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:30,513
Great.

483
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,373
Shoot.

484
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:33,970
I saw you in that game.

485
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:36,516
You beat another man to the ice.

486
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:38,893
It's hockey.
I was protecting my teammate.

487
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,834
- You broke your hand on his helmet.
- It's hockey.

488
00:24:42,892 --> 00:24:44,524
Okay, you never played, did you?

489
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:46,948
Oh, I'd run track

490
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:49,559
and cross country
and did some wrestling and ch...

491
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:53,533
- Chess! Checkers?
- No.

492
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,287
- Didn't say that.
- You know what?

493
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,958
Then you know nothing...
It's about teams, okay?

494
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,624
And teamwork. Obviously you don't know
anything about that,

495
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:06,587
You joined the army.
You became a sniper.

496
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:09,011
You joined the fbi.

497
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:13,302
Do you see the the binding element
in those choices?

498
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:16,763
It's violence.

499
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:19,225
Or the love of uniforms.
You ever think that?

500
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,023
Agent Booth,

501
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:25,276
I believe that you are ready
to confront the fact

502
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:29,274
that the violence you may
have suffered in childhood

503
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,071
- Has followed you into adulthood.
- Fill out the form.

504
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,034
Not now!

505
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,086
Hiya, sweets.

506
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:41,164
If you're about finished here,
Booth,

507
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,243
in accordance with the warrant
you made me get,

508
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:45,126
Pete Carlson's phone records
are here.

509
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,378
I'm the one that decides
when we're done here.

510
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,755
Of course you are, cherie,
no offense intended.

511
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,338
I'll be delivering the phone
records to agent perotta.

512
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,093
I thought I'd do
that in your office.

513
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,596
Thanks, cherie.

514
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:58,014
We're done.

515
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:01,309
Well, we are done but that
was just a coincidence.

516
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,026
Sweets, I've killed but
I've never murdered before.

517
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:06,981
Look up the difference in your
little black book there, okay?

518
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:11,334
This is legal, right?

519
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,463
Absolutely.

520
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,904
Okay.

521
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,339
None of them look nibbled on.

522
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:22,167
They should've gone at each other
like a peruvian soccer team

523
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:24,165
stranded in the andes.

524
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,626
Then they all died at the same time.

525
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:32,089
I don't see what this
is going to tell us.

526
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,778
How they died.

527
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,855
No, no, I mean about the case.

528
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:39,305
If brennan were here,
she'd smack your face.

529
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,557
Her philosophy is

530
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,175
we find out the facts about everything,
then see how it fits together.

531
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:48,481
Photo opportunity.

532
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,428
Pete made eight calls right after
the game to the same number.

533
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:57,782
Lou herrin. Who's that?

534
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,343
A sergeant in the state cops.

535
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:01,684
He exchanged blows with the
victim the night that he died.

536
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:04,055
Make it official.
Question the cop.

537
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,891
Let's get some leverage
on the guy first.

538
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:08,251
Put him at the murder scene,
get a warrant to test his dna.

539
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:09,559
Here we go.

540
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,713
Get a warrant for this, Ms. Julian,
get a warrant for that.

541
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,030
You need grounds for a warrant,
cherie.

542
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,968
Don't they teach that
at quantico anymore?

543
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,078
What grounds have you
got for that warrant?

544
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,485
None! Nothing!
You're just wishing.

545
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,310
I know how to get some
blood out of this herrin.

546
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,646
- Legally?
- Yeah, of course legally.

547
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,136
How?

548
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:34,370
It's a big game tonight, right?
And sometimes during a game...

549
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,256
People bleed.

550
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,510
- I don't like it.
- Then you don't have to show up.

551
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,429
- What are you doing, man?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

552
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,075
You think that's a good idea?
You got a couple of weeks on that cast.

553
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,847
Considering I can't play with
a cast, then yeah, it's a great idea.

554
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:04,820
You clear about the plan?

555
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:07,299
Somebody bleeds, I collect a sample,
put it in a bag,

556
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,852
- pass it off to Dr. Brennan.
- Lou herrin, number five,

557
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:12,847
he's our prime suspect.
And I gotta make him bleed.

558
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:18,195
You've worked with Booth
for a while now, right?

559
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,408
Is he the kind of guy that...

560
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,732
you know, I...

561
00:28:24,378 --> 00:28:25,378
Is he...

562
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:26,454
flirty?

563
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:28,247
Flirty?

564
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:32,084
Would you say he twinkles
his eyes at all women?

565
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:36,387
Twinkly eyes actually result
when the pupils dilate very wide

566
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:40,509
which is an unconscious result of
intense interest or sexual attraction.

567
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,346
So, no,
he doesn't twinkle at everyone?

568
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,514
No.

569
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,890
All right.

570
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:51,812
Is that the guy?
That's him.

571
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:54,038
Lou herrin, number five.

572
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,579
You think he even
knows how to bleed?

573
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,444
Just keep your head up, all right?

574
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,519
Come on, you should've called that.

575
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,035
Pass it up!

576
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,933
Keep your head up, herrin.

577
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,615
What's your problem?

578
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,200
I got a little chip, all right?

579
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,472
Just play your hockey, pal.
This guy's hard to get mad.

580
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:51,098
He's maybe the only
one who hasn't shed a drop.

581
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,452
Stay out of my face!

582
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,093
Keep your head up, huh!

583
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,214
Take a warning, pal.

584
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,350
I think I'm finally
getting to this guy.

585
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,188
Hope you survive it!

586
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,808
Taking a little break?

587
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:57,480
Luc Robitaille?

588
00:30:57,788 --> 00:30:59,110
Seeley Booth.

589
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:00,653
Right.

590
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:03,014
Let's go, let's play.

591
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:05,111
Right.

592
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,159
You're the greatest
left-winger of all time.

593
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,283
And you're the best
player on your team.

594
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:13,969
For what that's worth.

595
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,752
All right, let's go.
Come on, let's play.

596
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,346
Here we go.

597
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,020
Come on, show me something!

598
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:34,450
Hey, come on, move, move!
Move, move, let's go!

599
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:40,160
Wait a second.
I can't play hockey with you.

600
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:41,562
I gotta solve a murder.

601
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:42,942
You know, Booth...

602
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,403
it's not about the blood.

603
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,781
It's our best forensic clue.

604
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:50,491
Forget the blood.

605
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,409
- Then what?
- You know what makes a team.

606
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:55,538
Look at the team.

607
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,414
It's about what brings
a team together.

608
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,797
The team.

609
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:00,584
Look at the team.

610
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,586
All right, let's go, one on one.

611
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,996
Let's see what you got.
Come on, b.

612
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,585
Geez, ugh.

613
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,639
I thought I could get by you there,
you know?

614
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,099
You'll never get by me.

615
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,141
Right.

616
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,186
Now, listen, Booth,
you're not your father, okay?

617
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,832
You protect the ones you care about,
on the ice and off the ice.

618
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:24,790
That's who you are.

619
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,127
You're not your father.

620
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,974
- you're not your father.
- Booth?

621
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,120
- You're not your father.
- Booth?

622
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,999
Bones,
what are you doing on the ice?

623
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:43,126
I get nervous when you
fall down and don't get up.

624
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,298
Come up here.

625
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:48,632
- Up you go, buddy.
- Come on.

626
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,799
Don't worry, I got the blood.

627
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:59,768
- Good work, Bones.
- But I'm Bones.

628
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:10,446
Smells like fish in here.

629
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,540
Yep.

630
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:13,498
It's the victim's goldfish.

631
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:15,159
They died of ammonia poisoning.

632
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:17,119
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

633
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,290
Maybe the victim washed his
aquarium with window cleaner?

634
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,540
I don't know.

635
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:24,070
How are things with you and roxie?

636
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:26,542
Uh, good... Good.

637
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,163
Taking it slow, you know.

638
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:31,410
Letting things unfold in a...

639
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,650
- Are you seeing anybody?
- I, um...

640
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,598
Actually went out
on a date last night.

641
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:42,559
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Any little twinge there?

642
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:46,417
Definitely a little twinge,
yeah, but...

643
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:49,068
Despite the twinge,
I'm glad you're back in the saddle.

644
00:33:49,414 --> 00:33:51,416
Oh, I'm not back in
the saddle exactly.

645
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,032
It was just a first date.

646
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,074
Barely got out of the barn.

647
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,328
You saw the victim's
apartment, right?

648
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,789
Yes... Yeah.
Yeah, it was a pigsty.

649
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:04,541
I don't think that
guy cleaned anything.

650
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,977
Not with ammonia.

651
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:07,753
Not with anything.

652
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,352
I came as soon as I heard
Booth had a brain injury.

653
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:15,177
- What part of your head hurts?
- The part above my shoulders.

654
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,163
The doctor said he has a concussion.
He shouldn't fall asleep.

655
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,793
Otherwise, not serious.

656
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,434
- Tell him about the hallucination.
- You hallucinated?

657
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,479
Luc robitaille gave me advice.

658
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,692
You got advice on a
murder case from...

659
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,235
What did he say?

660
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,029
He said, "don't worry about the...
The player's blood."

661
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:36,919
Very interesting.

662
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:39,128
Lucky Luc told me to look
in a different direction.

663
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:41,328
- That's interesting.
- Stop saying that... Just stop.

664
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,031
Preliminary dna tests show

665
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:45,981
that the blood mixed in with the
victim's did not belong to lou herrin.

666
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:47,209
Lucky luc was right.

667
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,337
All that means is that you got
your brains scrambled for nothing.

668
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,256
Lucky luc is never wrong.

669
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,342
This hallucination could be
Booth's subconscious speaking

670
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,595
to him through the voice and image
of someone that he idolizes.

671
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:01,348
Like a modern version
of a vision quest?

672
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,193
You know what,
hallucination or not...

673
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:09,142
lucky luc, he told
me something about myself that...

674
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,054
He told me something.

675
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,606
I'd be very interested
in knowing what he said.

676
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:20,166
Lucky for me,
you're never gonna find out

677
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,670
because Bones is gonna drive me
home and get me soup.

678
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,395
There has got to be some reason
these fish died of ammonia poison.

679
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:34,043
Last time I did this, I ended up
in juvie hall over the weekend.

680
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:36,092
- What?
- What?

681
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,482
Nothing.

682
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:47,131
Buried treasure.

683
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,354
What do we do now?

684
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:54,485
Find out why the hell he was
hiding jewelery in a fish tank.

685
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,602
Have any of you ever heard of
something called "chain of evidence"?

686
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:03,005
Why didn't you go with these
two idiots to the victim's home?

687
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,943
- Please don't call my people idiots.
- We're not idiots.

688
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,332
- I feel like an idiot.
- You don't speak right now.

689
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,612
Neither of you.

690
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,460
It's a crime scene.

691
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,129
My people are very often
at crime scenes, it's what we do.

692
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,350
No, it's not.

693
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:18,785
You've got it in your heads
that you're crime scene types.

694
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,540
This is Booth's fault for
indulging your fantasies.

695
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:24,848
You are not crime scene types.
You are lab rats.

696
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,600
No chain of evidence was broken.

697
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,839
When Dr. Hodgins and mr. Bray found
the items, they immediately called me.

698
00:36:29,964 --> 00:36:30,979
I called Booth,

699
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,370
and when his head hurt too much
to talk to me, I called agent perotta.

700
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:36,595
- What?
- A photograph

701
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,244
of dead fish led them to this.

702
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,960
I think that kind of
brilliance is worth it.

703
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,618
You've been taken hostage by
the squints, agent perotta.

704
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,833
Turns out these items were
reported destroyed in a fire.

705
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:53,048
The victim was a fireman.

706
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:55,546
The fbi could check to see if
the firedawgs put out that fire.

707
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,610
Stole from the fire,
cleaned off with ammonia.

708
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:00,500
Hidden in the aquarium,
killed the fish.

709
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:01,392
Okay.

710
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,554
Now you are straying
out of your territory.

711
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,986
No, they got it right.

712
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:08,506
The bracelet agents
Booth and perotta

713
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:10,697
recovered from the
victim's loan shark

714
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:13,981
was reported destroyed
by that same fire.

715
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,441
My people were right.

716
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,734
Your people?

717
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,236
We're Booth's people.

718
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,277
They're on the firedawgs,
but they also played

719
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:02,571
on the same high school team.

720
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:05,484
What brings them together?

721
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:07,984
I'm back.

722
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,787
Hey, what brings them together?

723
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,832
What brings the team together?

724
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,633
So, I got the soup from the place.

725
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:18,580
And, yes, I told mama that
it was for you especially.

726
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,300
It's all about the team there.

727
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,425
It's all...

728
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,346
- what are you doing?
- It's all about the team there.

729
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,760
Bones,
it's all about the team there.

730
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:31,350
These four guys...

731
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,436
they all played hockey together
in high school, and now...

732
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:36,340
they all play together

733
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:37,648
as a team.

734
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,046
They're all firemen?

735
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,497
They all worked the
jewelry store fire.

736
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:43,820
One of these three
guys is the murderer.

737
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:46,365
According to Mr. Lucky?

738
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,333
It's luc, okay?
It is... It...

739
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,827
It's not Mr. Lucky.

740
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,624
It is luc robitaille.

741
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:54,315
Left wing.

742
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:55,582
Great shot.

743
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,112
Luc robitaille... He's one of
the best left wings of all time.

744
00:38:58,237 --> 00:38:59,439
What is this?

745
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,421
It's a lace puller. Why?

746
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,753
I think it might be
the murder weapon.

747
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:08,521
We want to discuss the
jewelry store fire.

748
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,271
- I want a lawyer.
- What for, alex?

749
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,208
We didn't do anything wrong.
None of us did.

750
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,475
What about pete?

751
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,023
He break some kind of fireman code,
something like that?

752
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,242
Something like that.

753
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:19,107
I've got nothing to say
about any of this.

754
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,327
I want a lawyer.

755
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:23,144
We know carlson was beaten with
a hockey stick, after which

756
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:26,655
a lace puller entered his brain through
his eye and killed him.

757
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:28,433
What about your dream, ed?

758
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,395
You were gonna play
for the nhl, right?

759
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,725
"Local player scouted by the nhl."

760
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,709
Look at that one.
Oh, this one's good, too.

761
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,668
"Fralic's hat trick wins game."

762
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:42,992
I got injured.

763
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:44,715
This injury would end

764
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,467
any chance of a career
in professional hockey.

765
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,486
What does that have
to do with anything?

766
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,000
I got hurt, now I sell siding,
and I play hockey on the weekends.

767
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,807
Why you got to rub
his face in the past?

768
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,778
Who ruined you?

769
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,021
Pete carlson.

770
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,025
It was pete.

771
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:05,402
You knew about the stolen jewelry.

772
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,696
How many of you
were there the night he was killed?

773
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,083
None of us.

774
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:11,158
Nobody here had anything
to do with that.

775
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,149
We have the hockey stick,

776
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,704
the murder weapon and dna.

777
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,247
It's only a matter of time.

778
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:27,758
Yeah.

779
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,712
What?

780
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,969
It was me.

781
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,587
I asked to meet pete on the
ice after everybody left.

782
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:37,017
I told him to give back
the stolen jewelry,

783
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,560
and he said to me...

784
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,558
he said to me that I was a...

785
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:45,192
A coward.

786
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,722
That I didn't do anything to him

787
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:51,080
back in the day when he
wrecked my life

788
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:53,982
and I wouldn't do
anything to him now.

789
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:58,827
Well, he was wrong.

790
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,045
I'm not positive
this is a good idea.

791
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:26,832
Oh, I got you!
I got you. Stay up here.

792
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:29,029
Okay, it's all right.
Here we go, one more.

793
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,122
You know what,
I got to stay up all night,

794
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:34,199
so who better to keep me
company than you?

795
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:38,027
You and me skating is saving
you from slipping into a coma?

796
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,014
Oh, easy, Bones.
Now i'm gonna go down.

797
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:43,717
I have a lot of natural
athletic ability.

798
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:44,905
Yeah, natural.

799
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,342
I can... I can see that.

800
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,529
Real smooth and natural.
That's it.

801
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:49,654
Well done.

802
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:55,650
That agent perotta, she really...

803
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:57,841
enjoyed working with us.

804
00:41:57,966 --> 00:41:58,966
Yeah.

805
00:41:59,656 --> 00:42:00,712
But, um...

806
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,210
you're the only fbi agent
I want to work with.

807
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,735
Will you tell me what the
lucky luciano told you?

808
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,462
He's not an italian opera singer.

809
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:15,397
Why do you always say that wrong?
You do it on purpose, don't you?

810
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:17,357
I would like to know what he said.

811
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:22,019
He said that I'm
not like my old man.

812
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,250
He said I'm made of better stuff.

813
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,827
I don't know your old man,

814
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,114
your father, but...

815
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:36,961
I think you're made of very,
very good stuff.

816
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:39,780
Hey, you know what?

817
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:41,933
Forget about agent perotta,
all right?

818
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,186
Nothing's gonna change
between me and you.

819
00:42:44,554 --> 00:42:46,605
Well, entropy is a natural force

820
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,031
that pulls everything apart
at a subatomic level.

821
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:50,483
Everything changes.

822
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:53,593
- Not everything, Bones.
- Don't.

823
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,843
You're gonna make me fall.
I'm never gonna make you fall.

824
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:58,329
I'm always here.

825
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:02,786
Here comes the big spin.
