1
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:41,831
These are all the approvals
that you asked for, Agent Booth.

2
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:43,297
I think they're all in order.

3
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:45,670
Right, you, usually
just e-mail me these, sir.

4
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,756
Yeah, well, since I heard
Dr. Brennan was here,

5
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,783
I thought,
I would say hello and ask her

6
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:53,298
if there was anything she needed
from us suits upstairs.

7
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:57,139
No, thank you, but it's nice
to see you again, Agent Hacker.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,433
It's Assistant Director
Hacker, Bones.

9
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,117
Andrew is fine.

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,646
- Andrew, cool.
- For Dr. Brennan.

11
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,375
I'm still your boss, Agent Booth,
and since we're at work...

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,542
Sure.

13
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,443
I just want you to know I realize

14
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,537
how busy you are being
an author and scientist.

15
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,968
Loved the last book.
Not everyone can make crushing

16
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:15,521
someone to death charming.

17
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:16,460
Thank you.

18
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,028
The Bureau is grateful for all
of your help, and I hope

19
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,330
that you're pleased with him.
He's the best we've got.

20
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,249
I don't know about that.

21
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,551
I agree. That statement
is impossible to quantify

22
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,546
since there are no other agents
partnered with forensic anthropologists,

23
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,490
let alone one with my abilities.

24
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,834
You know what?
You're raining on my parade.

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,874
Agent Booth, would you mind if I had
a quick word in private with her?

26
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,034
No problem.

27
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,982
He probably wants a signed copy
of your book. It happens all the time.

28
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,475
No need to be embarrassed.

29
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,777
Director Hacker wants
to have sex with me.

30
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:53,975
He said that?
Wait, it's...

31
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,069
... and it's Assistant Director.

32
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,576
Well, he said "dinner,"
but the implication was clear.

33
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,820
OK, all you got to do
is just turn him down,

34
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:02,998
you know, be very polite,
and nobody gets hurt.

35
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,758
He's charming, good-looking.
Why would I turn him down?

36
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:08,546
Because he's my boss, okay?
It would just be awkward.

37
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,088
I'm the guy who's got
to report to him, Bones.

38
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,803
The victim seems to have fried.

39
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,799
Local cops think a radical
environmental group did it.

40
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:18,743
Last week, they torched a Hummer.
Sign was the same...

41
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,098
"Big energy is killing the planet. "

42
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,809
Seems to be a poor way to get
sympathy for your cause.

43
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,352
- You think?
- Yes.

44
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:30,507
- So, the plant have security tapes?
- Your people are getting them now.

45
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,486
First responders said the vic
looks like a beef jerky.

46
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,279
Dr. Brennan, do you have a moment?

47
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:36,822
I'm at a crime scene.

48
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:39,832
I called, but I guess you
didn't get my messages.

49
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,702
You know what?
This'd better be important.

50
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,579
Daisy and I have been talking,

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,957
and she'd like another
chance to prove herself as your intern.

52
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,531
And good-bye.
I'm going to focus on Mr. Jerky.

53
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:51,038
I'm aware of your concerns,

54
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:54,061
and I'll be the first to admit
that Daisy is very unique.

55
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:57,176
OK, let me guess. No sex until
you give her what she wants, right?

56
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,394
Am I right?

57
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:01,001
I realize she has
impulse control issues.

58
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:04,225
She can't stop talking.
She has no sense of personal space.

59
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,567
I've been teaching her
some breathing techniques,

60
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,379
- and I'm confident...
- Guys, I got a dead body over there.

61
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,023
Yes, I have to work.

62
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,818
I've never seen a burn
like this before.

63
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,321
Small stature, I estimate
late teens, early 20s.

64
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,198
If anyone's interested.

65
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:21,659
I'd consider it a personal
favor, Dr. Brennan.

66
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,663
Personal favors are kind of like penalty
shots. You kind of have to take 'em.

67
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,309
Unlike dinner requests from your boss,
which you are totally open to decline.

68
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:30,960
I will give Ms. Wick

69
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,754
a 24-hour probationary period.

70
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,147
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

71
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,439
This victim wasn't electrocuted.

72
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,440
That's what I thought,
but the plant engineer

73
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:56,569
- said if there was a power surge...
- Smell.

74
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:03,192
- It smells like Christmas.
- It's frankincense and myrrh.

75
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:06,287
This victim died
over 3,000 years ago.

76
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,280
This is an Egyptian mummy.

77
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,283
Like a mummy? Like a real mummy?

78
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:13,878
Well, a real mummy that appears
to be covered in fresh blood,

79
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,716
and given the trajectory,
it's an arterial spurt,

80
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,216
most likely from a stabbing,
and this is a lot of blood.

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,569
I doubt whether
whoever it was survived.

82
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,061
If it were a stabbing,

83
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,241
the mummy had to be
directly in front of the victim.

84
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,851
So what are you saying?
The mummy killed someone?

85
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,516
Bones - Season 5 Episode 05

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

88
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,050
Booth hasn't found any victims

89
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,243
who were stabbed, no hospital
or emergency room admissions.

90
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:14,872
Okay, well, he also checked
the National Stolen Art File,

91
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:17,808
and there were no reports
on missing mummies, but he's checking

92
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,944
with individual museums
and curators now.

93
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,376
If this mummy wasn't stolen
from a known collection,

94
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,115
it means it might be the product
of an illegal tomb raid.

95
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,214
That makes it a priceless
anthropological find.

96
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,501
Yeah, but is that worth killing for?

97
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:32,831
Well, it's a motive
I can easily understand.

98
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:36,418
We've to identity the mummy to determine
why someone would kill for it.

99
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,838
You are so brilliant, Dr. Brennan.
Thank you for giving me...

100
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,388
... another chance, and I swear

101
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,956
I will speak
in a more modulated tone

102
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,309
and then only when asked.

103
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,142
That's wise.

104
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,444
Cam is running DNA and
tox screen on the blood.

105
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,025
Booth questioned
those ecoterrorist freaks.

106
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,945
They said they found the mummy
when they went Dumpster diving.

107
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,615
They thought it would be a good symbol.
He said their story holds.

108
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,492
I identified flakes of natron.

109
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,620
It's a naturally occurring
sodium carbonate decahydrate.

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,789
It was used as a drying agent

111
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,959
during the mummification process
in the second century B.C.

112
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,295
- Permission to speak?
- Well, that lasted ten seconds.

113
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,701
Tissue condition confirms
the mummy is a daddy... male.

114
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,347
They let the females putrefy

115
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,803
prior to mummification to
discourage necrophilia.

116
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:30,474
- Ew and good.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,234
The weave pattern of the linen suggests
this was a top-notch embalming.

118
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,062
We may be talking about a pharaoh
or a prince here.

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,857
Someone cracked open
his chest cavity.

120
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,610
An area of compaction
in the mummified tissue suggests

121
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,733
something was stored in here.

122
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,823
I forgot to raise my hand.
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,877
And judging by the margins
of the fractures, the thoracic area

124
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:53,912
was opened quite recently.

125
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,457
Perhaps to remove
whatever was stored inside.

126
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,917
Buried treasure inside
the mummy's chest?

127
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,385
- Pretty good motive to kill.
- I love ancient remains.

128
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,797
I really do.

129
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,929
There are particulates imbedded
in the compaction.

130
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,346
Yep, I'm on it.

131
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,349
This could be a groundbreaking find.

132
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,119
We could be honored by the American
Anthropological Association.

133
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:20,091
Most definitely.
Our picture on the front of the journal.

134
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:22,357
I would love to see
my mother's face then.

135
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,242
There seems to be a separation
between the C6 and C5 vertebrae.

136
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,537
Some kind of wooden shaft
is connecting the head to the spine.

137
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,247
Let me see.

138
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:41,877
Hi, this is
Special Agent Seeley Booth

139
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,438
with the FBI, Dr. Malloy.

140
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,658
This may sound a little strange,
but we recovered a mummy

141
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:51,153
that may be evidence in
a homicide investigation, and...

142
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,179
Okay, and you're sure
that one hasn't disappeared?

143
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,432
Okay, great, thanks.

144
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,098
- Agent Booth.
- Assistant Director Hacker.

145
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,178
I just got a call from a Nobel Laureate
who claims you dragged him out of bed

146
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,695
to ask if he's missing a mummy.
I assumed it was a crank call.

147
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,115
No, no, investigating
a potential homicide, sir.

148
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,076
- And there's a mummy involved?
- Preliminary report.

149
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,875
So there is a potential
mummy-related victim out there.

150
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,711
Yeah, Bones is looking
at the old guy for clues.

151
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:25,897
A mummy.

152
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,466
Damn, you field agents
have all the fun. Good luck.

153
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:34,930
By the way, did Temperance mention
that I asked her out?

154
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:38,183
Yeah, I think she may have
said something like that.

155
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,907
I wanted to make sure there's
nothing going on between the two of you.

156
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,630
I wouldn't want to get
in the middle.

157
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,858
No, nothing whatsoever, sir,
strictly professional.

158
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,916
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, positive.

159
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:54,366
All right, then. I'll let you get back
to pissing off Nobel Laureates.

160
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,923
Okay, so you're spying on Daisy.

161
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:03,955
No, no, I'm just staying close

162
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,857
in case an intervention is required.

163
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:08,716
- This screen is so awesome.
- I know, isn't it?

164
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:11,669
I thought you fixed her.

165
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:13,891
I... it's a process.

166
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,044
Karloff was a genius.

167
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,182
You could feel
the mummy's pain, you know.

168
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,143
He was dead, Sweets.
He felt no pain.

169
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,770
Emotional pain...
that never dies.

170
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,348
- Cheery thought. Thank you.
- It's true.

171
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,400
Database has no match on the blood.

172
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:31,028
Hodgins found some 3,000-year-old bugs,
so he's all weepy.

173
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:34,865
I hope Dr. B. can get the mummy to talk.
Research, I assume.

174
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,649
Yes, sure.

175
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,745
Imhotep is looking for the reincarnation
of his ancient lover.

176
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,607
- This could be a motive.
- What are you doing here, Sweets?

177
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,282
He's Daisy's trainer.

178
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,785
If she attacks, he can put her down.

179
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,633
He was decapitated.

180
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,648
Can you do a facial reconstruction?

181
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,775
Perhaps we can match his face

182
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,950
to an Egyptian coffin painting.

183
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,390
The Mummy, 1932.

184
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,227
You don't know who Britney Spears is,
but you know this movie.

185
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,604
It's the film that made me
want to be an anthropologist.

186
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,607
Although I prefer Chaney's Mummy
to Karloff's.

187
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,014
There's an extra metacarpal
on the ulnar side,

188
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,058
likely caused by the high incidence

189
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,153
of inbreeding among Egyptian royals.

190
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,203
It could just be a
single gene mutation.

191
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,444
Or it could be one feature

192
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,890
of a syndrome
of congenital anomalies.

193
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,710
Bring up the X-rays of the forearm.

194
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,792
There, the ulna is bowed.

195
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,050
Antley-Bixler syndrome...

196
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:36,924
a recessive congenital disorder

197
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,513
characterized by
malformations of the skeleton

198
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,008
and the skull.

199
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,661
Flat forehead,
elongation of the parietal

200
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,205
and occipital regions.

201
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,090
Oh, my God, he's 18th Dynasty.

202
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:52,859
- Excellent, Ms. Wick, excellent.
- I try, I do.

203
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,990
Dr. Brennan, are you okay?

204
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,662
<i>Yours and mine...</i>

205
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,622
- I identified the mummy.
- I helped!

206
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,167
It is a find that is certainly
valuable enough to kill for.

207
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:12,012
I love this part.

208
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,464
<i>"And yet I shall awaken memories</i>

209
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:19,219
<i>of love and crime and death. "</i>

210
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:24,891
Of course. Sorry.

211
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,556
His name is Anok,
the Boy with the Bleeding Heart.

212
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,728
He was the second son
of the Pharaoh,

213
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,516
and according to legend,
Anok's older brother, Meti,

214
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,478
fell off his horse,
and Anok trampled him to death

215
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,948
to ensure that he would ascend
to the throne.

216
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,196
Anok insisted
that his brother's injuries

217
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:43,952
were the result of the fall,

218
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,829
but the Pharaoh didn't believe him,

219
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:48,916
and he went into a rage
and he cut off Anok's head.

220
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,909
He became the Boy
with the Bleeding Heart

221
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:54,773
because his grief was two fold.
Grief for the death of his brother,

222
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,257
and grief for the loss
of his father's love.

223
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,852
And what does this have to do
with the murder?

224
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:02,888
Anok is supposed to be here
on loan from the Egyptian government.

225
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:04,723
He's going on exhibit Friday.

226
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:08,143
But I should have let
Dr. Brennan tell you that.

227
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,520
- Why wasn't he reported missing?
- I don't know.

228
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,607
I... I've called Booth.
We have to talk to the curator.

229
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,710
Why are you here?

230
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:18,570
I was just watching the movie.

231
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,698
So, I'm like some kind of experiment
that you need to supervise?

232
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,923
- No. I just thought if you needed me...
- Do I look stupid?

233
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,698
Because I'm not, Lance.

234
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:30,874
In fact, there's lots of people
who think I'm scary smart.

235
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,432
Not about men, apparently.

236
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,167
Her lab is upstairs on the right.

237
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,285
Now, the Anok exhibit opens
on Friday,

238
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,330
so there's very little chance
that Dr. Kaswell

239
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:47,349
just let Anok get up and
walk out of her lab.

240
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,436
Of course not. Reanimation, while
extremely entertaining, is impossible.

241
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,818
Cellular death is cellular death.

242
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,360
Listen. When was the last time
you saw Dr. Kaswell?

243
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,861
I guess a day or so. She's just been
behind closed doors with Anok

244
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,964
while I've been helping
out with the dioramas,

245
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,255
which have been a nightmare.

246
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,757
In one scene, they painted

247
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,578
a group of female musicians,
and they have toes.

248
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,768
Toe differentiation in Egyptian art

249
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:13,614
didn't happen until much later,
particularly in women.

250
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:14,939
I know, right?

251
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,717
It's fascinating.

252
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,154
Dr. Kaswell?

253
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:23,343
She hates to be disturbed.

254
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:27,428
Just try the...

255
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,143
- It's locked.
- She's always here at this hour.

256
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,240
And she would never lock herself in.

257
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:35,313
- We should get the key.
- Of course.

258
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,565
Look at that.

259
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,123
It's a mummy's coffin.

260
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,566
Beautiful, isn't it?

261
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,870
I can't believe she's not here.

262
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:51,978
Look.

263
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,356
It's blood.

264
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,759
Let me get this thing out.

265
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,343
I got it.

266
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,384
Please, be careful with that.
It's priceless.

267
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,555
Geez!

268
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:07,804
Dr. Kaswell!

269
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,141
That would have been my guess.

270
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,429
The FBI has locked
down the Egyptian wing,

271
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:19,743
looking for evidence.

272
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,847
I can't believe Dr. Kaswell is dead.

273
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:23,998
I just met her a couple
months ago at a party.

274
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,104
- She seemed nice.
- She was pleasant,

275
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:29,740
but an unexceptional anthropologist
and obviously quite careless.

276
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:33,182
Perhaps, but it's sad
nonetheless, Dr. Brennan,

277
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,424
to lose one of our own
here at the Jeffersonian.

278
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,893
- Of course.
- Truth be told, we kind of flirted

279
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,670
- with each other...
- Not appropriate, Dr. Hodgins.

280
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,632
Dr. Kaswell's blood's a match
for the spray we found on the mummy.

281
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
There are some metal flakes
at the injury site.

282
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,371
- You say the word, I'll take them.
- One moment.

283
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:53,016
The weapon appears to
have penetrated the eye

284
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,060
and then entered the frontal lobe.

285
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,772
There's damage to the
superior orbital fissure and sphenoid.

286
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,205
It must have lacerated
the internal carotid artery.

287
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,448
That would be consistent
with the arterial spurt.

288
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:06,404
Given the injuries, the killer
must have used a narrow,

289
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,936
blunt-edged instrument.

290
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,532
The metal shavings might help us
identify the murder weapon.

291
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,478
Speak, Ms. Wick.

292
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,388
I used phenolphthalein
and hydrogen peroxide

293
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,290
in Anok's open chest cavity.

294
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,555
You can see blood traces
in the compaction

295
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,087
and evidence of a blunt-edged instrument
used to gouge out

296
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,922
whatever was hidden in his chest.

297
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,466
I extracted some metal shavings
for Dr. Hodgins.

298
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,010
Perhaps the murderer
used the same weapon

299
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,137
that killed Dr. Kaswell
to open Anok's chest.

300
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,568
Dr. Kaswell had been studying
this mummy for weeks.

301
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,725
She must have known
what was inside his chest.

302
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,521
The Egyptian government wouldn't allow
any invasive examination of Anok.

303
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,268
- And there was nothing in her notes?
- Her notes were missing.

304
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,607
So, you were overseeing
the exhibit, Mr. Turnbull?

305
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:46,736
Administrating.

306
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,489
I was the go-between,
coordinating things

307
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,034
with Dr. Kaswell and, of course,
the Egyptian National Museum.

308
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,413
The Egyptians lent Anok
to the Jeffersonian.

309
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,915
He survived 3,000 years
in the Egyptian desert,

310
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,875
but he couldn't make it
two weeks in DC.

311
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,589
Dr. Kaswell's notes were missing.
I assume she took notes.

312
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:07,325
Of course.

313
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,683
She had to turn them all over to me,
so that I could give them

314
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,762
to the Egyptians.
That was part of the deal.

315
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,065
We're gonna need all
the notes that she gave you.

316
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,016
Of course.

317
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,935
Did she mention finding anything
in Anok's chest?

318
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:20,140
Chest?

319
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:21,591
No.

320
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,983
No invasive examinations
were approved by the Egyptians.

321
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:27,256
It's not uncommon
for different departments

322
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:30,155
to vie for funds for exhibits, is it,
Mr. Turnbull?

323
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:31,902
No, but...

324
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:35,327
as you can attest, Dr. Brennan,
scientists usually don't kill for them.

325
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,743
Sure. I'm just curious...
was anyone angry at Kaswell

326
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,581
because she did get the funds?

327
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,253
I know that Dr. Wheaton was upset.

328
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,124
He's head of Ancient Rome
Culture and Artifacts.

329
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:49,466
Why was he upset?

330
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,930
He wanted the funds to exhibit
some new finds in Roman portraiture.

331
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,183
But Alex is a good man, a friend.

332
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,557
I mean, he's a Little League coach,
for God's sake.

333
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,768
Did he and Dr. Kaswell
ever have words?

334
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,105
Everyone has disagreements.

335
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,243
Well, not everyone winds up dead.

336
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,259
Heart like a marathon runner.

337
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,911
She probably would have made it
to 90 if this didn't happen.

338
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:19,537
This poor woman.

339
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,957
You know, she gave me a lift
last month when my car broke down.

340
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:24,709
Maybe there really is a curse.

341
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,410
Messing with mummies...
clearly not a good idea.

342
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,963
When I was in Rio,

343
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,950
some kid graffitied a mummy
in the National Museum.

344
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,928
The next day,
choked on his own tongue.

345
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,152
Seriously?

346
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,518
"Death shall come on swift wings

347
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,683
to he who disturbs
the peace of mummy."

348
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:43,670
I guess I'd be angry too, if someone
pulled my brain out through my nose

349
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,271
and stuck it in a canopic jar.

350
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,233
The urine of a redheaded boy.

351
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,651
We need so much more than that.

352
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,903
From the swab of Dr. Kaswell's eye.

353
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,489
A redheaded boy peed on her eye?

354
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:56,914
Not exactly.

355
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,424
See this?

356
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,320
The tool used to stab Dr. Kaswell
left traces of iron and carbon.

357
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:05,473
And, to a lesser extent,
silicon, manganese and phosphorous.

358
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:08,294
- Any of those things scream "pee"?
- Not that I'm aware.

359
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,763
Ancient metal workers turned
iron into steel by accident.

360
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,968
They accidentally carburized the iron
while heating it over charcoal,

361
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,610
thus turning it into low-grade steel.
But they thought

362
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:21,433
that it was the mode of quenching
the molten metal that hardened it.

363
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,539
The redheaded boy pees
on the molten metal.

364
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:26,275
The iron turns to steel,
and our ancient metal worker figured

365
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,941
that the little redhead did the trick.
It's an instant old wives' tale.

366
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,635
Wait. I didn't know they
had redheads in Ancient Egypt.

367
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,972
They didn't.
It was Ancient Rome.

368
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:38,316
Our murder weapon
was forged in Ancient Rome.

369
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:43,872
Dr. Wheaton's department

370
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,772
has a very extensive collection
of Roman tools.

371
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,928
Chisels, lathes, planes, files.

372
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:53,173
Eggheads killing each other over
exhibits no one really wants to see.

373
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,279
The King Tut exhibit
was immensely popular.

374
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,504
Bones, the only thing
that regular people learn

375
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,846
from going to a museum is
how to sleep standing up.

376
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:00,899
All right?

377
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,182
Pretty simple.

378
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:07,133
So, I did a little
checking on Hacker, by the way.

379
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:10,712
42, never been married.
Just in case you're interested.

380
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:12,734
Late marriage is often an indicator

381
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,431
of a discerning,
goal-oriented individual.

382
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:17,655
Why is this a problem for you?

383
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,349
Because he's my boss.
And if you're gonna go out with Hacker,

384
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:22,243
then you guys
are gonna talk about me.

385
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,038
- Why would I talk about you?
- Because I'm what you've got in common.

386
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,209
If you're concerned that I'd discuss
any perceived shortcomings...

387
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,940
Shortcomings? What shortcomings?

388
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,728
Honestly, Booth, Andrew and I
are attracted to each other.

389
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:37,091
I'm sure neither of us
will think of you for a second.

390
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,430
Trust me, Agent Booth.
I had no quarrel with Dr. Kaswell.

391
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,683
Really? Because, according to witnesses,
you were arguing with her in the middle

392
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,785
- of the Titan exhibit.
- He means Titian.

393
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,514
Titian was a 16th century Renaissance
painter from the Italian school.

394
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,900
- Titans were ancient Greek gods...
- Okay. I yelled at Dr. Kaswell.

395
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,529
Leslie was gloating because she
got the funding and I didn't.

396
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,905
I'm human. I got angry.

397
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,865
So stealing
her beef jerky man was just

398
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,660
some way of wrecking her
exhibit and seeking revenge,

399
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,787
but things got out of hand,
and before you...

400
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,164
A gouge is missing, Dr. Wheaton.

401
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:10,390
An early steel scalprum.

402
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:12,961
I don't know where that went.

403
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,635
I've been asking the candidates.

404
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,756
They have access
to these tools for research.

405
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,624
25 centimeters long, blunt end.

406
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,177
Two centimeters wide.

407
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,347
- That could be the murder weapon.
- Where were you Monday night?

408
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,081
Here.

409
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,515
Working.

410
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,947
I don't have to say any more.
If you have evidence, arrest me.

411
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,357
I have work to do.

412
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:37,986
Isn't it weird

413
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,739
that 3,000 years ago,
Anok was a real guy,

414
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,911
24 years old, like Sweets...

415
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,490
living his life and falling in love?

416
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,777
Yep. But he didn't
know his afterlife

417
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,991
was going to consist of being dissected
and analyzed, like what he really is...

418
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:54,943
just a mere mass of chemicals.

419
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,256
Yeah, that was the romantic
notion I was going for. Thank you.

420
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,259
Dr. Brennan wanted me to check on those
swabs from the mummy's chest cavity.

421
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:05,019
- Not that I'm trying to rush you.
- Is everything okay, Daisy?

422
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:06,656
I can't believe you asked that.

423
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,600
Lance and I had a
little disagreement.

424
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,318
He's overbearing and untrusting,

425
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,844
and I'm evaluating the future
of our relationship.

426
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:14,700
You're so good to ask.

427
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,130
- We're close, aren't we?
- Look what I found.

428
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,611
Three different particulates
within the chest cavity.

429
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,197
We got crushed mammal bone,
kermes insect

430
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,074
and woad legume.

431
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:27,619
- Animal, vegetable and mineral.
- Actually, that would be

432
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:31,122
two animals and a vegetable,
because bone is organic, not a mineral.

433
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,498
Oh, my God.

434
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,950
The three particulates
are totally different,

435
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,796
but they're actually
the exact same thing.

436
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:46,471
Woad, kermes insect and bone

437
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,265
were all used by
the Ancient Egyptians to make paint.

438
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:52,310
I learned this when I was in art school.
Bone for white,

439
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:55,647
kermes insect for red
and woad for indigo.

440
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,391
So we just can't make out
the colors anymore because of decomp?

441
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:01,527
Brennan thought perhaps the compaction
was left by a canopic jar.

442
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,391
No. They didn't paint those.
They weren't important.

443
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:06,366
It would have been
like painting Tupperware.

444
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,229
Yeah, but something was painted.

445
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:10,917
- What would have been painted?
- And why did somebody hide it

446
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:12,151
inside his body?

447
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,042
It must have been important,
and it needed to last forever.

448
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,753
So, if I can scan the cavity
and find out

449
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,922
where the paint seeped
into the different tissues,

450
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:24,890
I might be able to reconstruct
what was in Anok's chest.

451
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:28,794
This is Azita Jabbari from
the Egyptian National Museum.

452
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:30,529
Turn off that light.

453
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:32,392
What? Wait a minute.
We just disco...

454
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,708
We have not authorized any invasive
or investigative procedures on Anok.

455
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,647
Ms. Jabbari wants her mummy back.

456
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,234
"The Boy With the Bleeding
Heart" goes back to Cairo today.

457
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,737
Unless you would like to start a feud
between our two governments.

458
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:59,156
Anok is a national treasure
on loan to your country.

459
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:01,921
According to our agreement,
we can revoke the permit at any time.

460
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,093
I understand your government's concern,
but he's safe in our Medico-Legal Lab.

461
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,693
The low humidity and temperature
in the lab are optimum conditions.

462
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,724
With all due respect, you have
no legal grounds to keep him.

463
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,569
Yes, we do.
He's evidence in a murder investigation.

464
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,080
Whoever killed Dr. Kaswell
stole something from inside the mummy.

465
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,734
Any idea what was inside
that was worth killing for?

466
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,403
Have you examined the CAT scans?

467
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:29,657
What CAT scans?

468
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:32,296
A few days ago,
I granted Dr. Kaswell's request

469
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:34,009
to perform CAT scans on Anok.

470
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:36,581
The films should be
in Dr. Kaswell's files.

471
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,178
Dr. Kaswell's lab was searched.

472
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:40,793
The files are missing.

473
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,840
Then ask the young man who worked
for Dr. Kaswell. He sent the request.

474
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,667
"I work for Dr. Kaswell
at the Jeffersonian Institution,

475
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:57,138
"and I'm writing to request
autobiographical information

476
00:23:57,263 --> 00:24:00,742
on the man who funded
the exhumation of Anok's tomb."

477
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:03,816
I checked with the museum.
You never worked with Dr. Kaswell.

478
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,592
- That's why I'm here?
- That and other reasons.

479
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:08,821
She was murdered, so start talking.

480
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:13,598
Technically, I did not work for her,

481
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:16,484
but Dr. Kaswell did agree
to be my doctoral advisor

482
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,247
at the antiquities graduate program

483
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,083
- at Georgetown.
- Very impressive.

484
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,418
Thank you. I'm very bright.

485
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,839
Okay, Bright Boy,
let's just stay on point, shall we?

486
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,468
As soon as I got to D.C.,
Dr. Kaswell said

487
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,798
that she did not have the time
for me anymore,

488
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:33,662
that she was too busy
prepping the Anok exhibit,

489
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,599
but I knew all about Anok.

490
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,518
I wrote a paper
on him as an undergrad.

491
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,937
It pissed you off,
that she wouldn't let you help?

492
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:47,026
Okay, yes,
but not enough to kill her.

493
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,403
I signed up as a museum intern

494
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,489
so I could prove my value to her.

495
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,705
You thought
if you helped her with her work,

496
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,828
she might change her mind
about advising you.

497
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,293
It was my idea to do
the CAT scans on Anok.

498
00:24:58,418 --> 00:25:00,340
She thought it was an
excellent suggestion.

499
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,041
So, you saw the films?

500
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,221
No, I didn't even know
if she followed through,

501
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,613
but I would have killed
to see those images.

502
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:09,513
- Excuse me?
- But I didn't.

503
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,201
Usually all you find in a mummy's torso
are pounded perfumes.

504
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:22,703
That's all I've ever found.

505
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:24,841
Once a sandwich,
but of course, it was stale.

506
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:26,348
You found a sand...?

507
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,943
You're joking.

508
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,736
That's funny. A sandwich,

509
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,186
because it's highly unlikely
to find one in a mummy.

510
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:39,698
Did I tell you
that Anok has six fingers?

511
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:44,167
Also highly unlikely, so perhaps
there is a sandwich in him.

512
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,712
You know, no joke...
I have an uncle with four toes.

513
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:49,589
Frostbite or lawnmower?

514
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,025
You are good. Lawn mowing accident.

515
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,439
He was watching a playoff game
while cutting the lawn.

516
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:56,012
No regrets. It was a great game.

517
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,535
So, what do you want to eat
after this appetizing conversation?

518
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:04,270
Booth likes to get the meatloaf.

519
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,587
He has them take out
the hard boiled egg,

520
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,859
because his mother used to tell him
it was a human eyeball.

521
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,321
I got to say, you and Booth,
it's an unlikely partnership.

522
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,741
I prefer not to talk about Booth,
if you don't mind.

523
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,182
It's fine by me.
You're a far more interesting topic.

524
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:24,457
I'd like to know the story
behind your guitar.

525
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:27,919
Not many FBI directors
have a Stratocaster in their office.

526
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,004
I'm impressed.
You know the Stratocaster.

527
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,465
I had a victim who was beaten
to death with one.

528
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:35,061
But it still played.

529
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:37,136
It is an excellent instrument.

530
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,486
Sorry.

531
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:43,226
I'm so sorry.
They need me back at the lab.

532
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:46,979
You're investigating a murder. That
tends to take precedence over meatloaf.

533
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:50,900
Friday night dinner on me?

534
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:54,237
Sure, and I will then reveal
the secret of the Stratocaster.

535
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:55,665
All right.

536
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:57,850
- Bye.
- Bye.

537
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,543
Why you don't tell me
you were on a date

538
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,504
- when I texted you?
- It was just drinks.

539
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,548
Celibate seeking crumbs. Spill.

540
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:17,510
He's Booth's boss's boss.
His name is Andrew.

541
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,887
Wait. This is his boss's boss?

542
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:21,806
Was Booth upset?

543
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,266
Yes. I don't know why.

544
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:26,413
Brennan, this could screw up
the natural order of things.

545
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,688
And Booth wishes
that you were going out with him.

546
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,446
I drink with him all the time,

547
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,650
but with Andrew,
there's the potential for sex.

548
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:34,856
And not with Booth?

549
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:38,739
You said there was something important
you wanted me to see?

550
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:40,484
Yes.

551
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:45,698
The paint residue was found inside
the compacted area in Anok's chest.

552
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:47,993
Now, I laid a grid over that area.

553
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:51,458
Next, Hodgins inspected
each section of the grid

554
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,983
for chemical residue,

555
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:55,631
assigning values based
on our color differential.

556
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,193
It was kind of like
paint by numbers.

557
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,560
Okay.
Anyway,

558
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,280
bone for white,

559
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,084
kermes insect for red,

560
00:28:06,705 --> 00:28:08,594
and wode for indigo.

561
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,731
Okay, now I reshaped, refined and

562
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,065
cropped the edges.

563
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,013
And finally, I removed the grid.

564
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,069
Hieroglyphs.

565
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:20,209
A negative impression.

566
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,628
Because they were left by the object

567
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:24,702
that was hidden inside the chest.

568
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:27,705
Very good.

569
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,831
I know, right?

570
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,831
Next, we take the object out

571
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:33,579
and we look on the bottom.

572
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,838
And we have the positive
image of the hieroglyphs.

573
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:40,244
Amazing, but many of these
characters are incomplete.

574
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:43,554
Well, some of the paint
residue had faded too much

575
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,367
- and couldn't be retrieved.
- But if we can decipher this,

576
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:49,024
- it could tell us what was inside.
- I know.

577
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:54,648
Sex.

578
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,653
Print this out and send it to
Dr. Babajanian in Ancient Languages.

579
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,114
Come on.

580
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:03,528
Be a pal.

581
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,576
I need a vicarious thrill.

582
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,304
Please?

583
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:22,018
I was looking for Daisy.

584
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:23,411
Haven't seen her.

585
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:25,595
Looks like you're making carpaccio.

586
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,806
This is Dr. Kaswell's brain.

587
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:30,658
God, I'm sorry.

588
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:38,324
I'm having some serious
problems with Daisy.

589
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:40,467
- Can I ask your advice?
- No.

590
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,373
- Really.
- Really.

591
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,493
I have a 16-year-old,
and believe me,

592
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,243
when it comes to dating advice,
I am batting a red hot zero.

593
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,722
You've been through this,
a million times yourself.

594
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,705
Did you call me old?

595
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:55,042
Is that what it felt like?
You see?

596
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,838
I can't help it. I alienate
every woman I talk to, no matter

597
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,361
how pure my motives.

598
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,756
All right, give me a ballpark.

599
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:05,281
No specifics.
I don't want specifics.

600
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,264
The woman I love won't speak to me.

601
00:30:11,652 --> 00:30:13,552
You are an excellent shrink.

602
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,287
You can help people,
but Daisy's not people.

603
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:19,220
She's the person you love,
the person you have to trust.

604
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:22,611
If she's gonna screw up, let her.
It'll show her you have faith in her.

605
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:27,315
- That's superb advice.
- It was kind of good?

606
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,905
I thought I was taking care of her,
but you're right.

607
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,780
I was just insulting her.

608
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:34,465
- Thank you.
- No problem.

609
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,348
And now we're done.
Done.

610
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:39,174
You're crushing me,

611
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,338
and I think you're getting brain
on your suit.

612
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:42,431
Brain.

613
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:45,882
This just gets more and
more interesting, doesn't it?

614
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:47,286
It was a friendship hug.

615
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,246
And an uncomfortable one.

616
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,573
You need something?

617
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:53,756
A courier just dropped off
the memory chip

618
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:56,609
from the CAT scan machine
Dr. Kaswell used to image Anok.

619
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:59,159
- Angela's looking at it now.
- Thank you.

620
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:04,567
You don't need to spy.
I'm fine.

621
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:07,281
And I don't need those stupid
breathing exercises.

622
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,541
I'm sorry.

623
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:10,599
I never meant to...

624
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:12,565
I'm busy.
I have a murder to solve.

625
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,297
And I'm sure you have ink blots
to show somebody.

626
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,166
There's the embedded object.

627
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,409
Based on the density of the image,
it's most likely Nile stone.

628
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,383
- What's that?
- Can you enhance it?

629
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,262
It's crystalline in structure.

630
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:33,604
It's a corundum
in the trigonal crystal system

631
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:35,803
and the hexagonal
scalenohedral class.

632
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,104
- A mineral of some sort?
- If the CAT scan were in color,

633
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,507
it'd be red and really expensive.

634
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,020
A ruby.

635
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:44,944
A giant ruby.

636
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,161
It's where Anok's heart would be.

637
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:49,657
Anok's bleeding heart
must refer to the ruby.

638
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,367
A stone that size worth a fortune.

639
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,786
Only someone who saw the
scan would've known.

640
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:56,121
Dr. Kaswell's grad student...
He's the one

641
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,469
that requested them.

642
00:31:57,594 --> 00:31:59,683
Booth cleared him,
he was working on dioramas.

643
00:31:59,808 --> 00:32:03,087
But Jabbari knew about them, too.
She gave permissionto have them.

644
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:06,549
And she tried to get Anok taken away
before we finish investigating.

645
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,025
This is insane.

646
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,922
I have devoted my life to preserving
my country's antiquities.

647
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:16,684
You knew about the CAT scan.
You had access to the mummy.

648
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:20,645
I didn't know about it, and if I did,
I would have insisted on security.

649
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:22,195
It is a national treasure.

650
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,368
I am holding you responsible
for losing it.

651
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:27,016
Where were you three nights ago
when he was murdered?

652
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:28,306
In Los Angeles.

653
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:30,489
There was a fund-raiser.

654
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:34,266
I know it's tacky, but
the ambassador wanted me there.

655
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:36,704
I am sure that counts as an alibi?

656
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:43,085
You said you found hieroglyphs.
I would like to see them.

657
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:46,714
An expert from the Jeffersonian
is studying them.

658
00:32:48,454 --> 00:32:49,883
I'm one of the foremost scholars

659
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,052
on ancient hieroglyphs.
These are incomplete.

660
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,425
We know. They are remnants
from the paintings

661
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,374
on the box that contained the ruby.

662
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,182
This is a signature.

663
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:00,185
This is a message
from the Pharaoh's wife.

664
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,643
- A note from his mom.
- Exactly.

665
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,191
"My heart bleeds.
For my guiltless son."

666
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:07,756
Guiltless.

667
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:10,279
She didn't think that Anok
killed his brother?

668
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,527
No mother wants to believe that.

669
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:13,991
That hasn't changed.

670
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,409
This could change history.

671
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,508
We now have the ability
to determine Meti's cause of death.

672
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,843
I can have his remains brought
from the Natural History Museum.

673
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,584
- I would like to assist.
- Of course.

674
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,739
- How's that gonna help?
- It won't, but it could exonerate Anok.

675
00:33:26,864 --> 00:33:28,930
There can be no time limit
for justice.

676
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,842
Dr. Kaswell's killer is out there now.
We're running out of suspects.

677
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,799
You'll do it.
You always do.

678
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:35,387
I'll call New York.

679
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:44,240
How's the case going?

680
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:45,773
Not solved yet.

681
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,442
But, you're not here
for that, are you?

682
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:51,158
I wanted to say
you're doing a great job.

683
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,321
Truly exceptional.

684
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,219
Sir, if we would just
kill the compliments

685
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:57,809
and say what's on your mind,
I'd appreciate.

686
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:58,768
Right.

687
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,639
Let's drop the agent/boss thing
for a minute.

688
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,396
It's been a while
since I've met someone,

689
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,378
you know, special.

690
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,130
And, I don't want to make a fool 

691
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,919
if she is only going out
with me 'cause I'm the boss.

692
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:14,642
Right.

693
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,043
Listen, sir,

694
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:19,651
Bones doesn't feel
the pressure to act or do

695
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:21,972
or say anything that
she doesn't want to.

696
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,226
And no one, no one can make her.

697
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,496
That what makes her...

698
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:28,166
Bones.

699
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:33,529
- Okay, thanks, really.
- No problem.

700
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,293
Next time you're
at the Founding Fathers,

701
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,795
you should try the meatloaf
with the egg. You'll like it.

702
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,020
Tastes nothing like a human eye.

703
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,888
Maybe we missed particulates

704
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:49,555
from the killer
on the mummy's linen wrapping.

705
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,330
He was found in a Dumpster,
so he'd be covered in particulates.

706
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:55,426
But we'd be looking for
something non-dumpster related.

707
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:57,866
Of course.

708
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,012
Never give up.

709
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:02,915
- Was I too hard on Lance?
- Focus.

710
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:04,393
But you're a man.

711
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,729
Lance is so cute, isn't he?

712
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,772
That'd be a question for a woman.

713
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:11,859
Someone that cute
isn't malicious. He can't be.

714
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,562
You don't need me
for this conversation, do you?

715
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:16,694
Wait. I think I found something.

716
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:18,360
A probative particulate?

717
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,003
A grease spot.

718
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,659
Most likely a fingerprint.

719
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,422
- What's this?
- What does it look like?

720
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:35,174
An egg.

721
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,677
And when was the last time you
recently talked about an egg?

722
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,047
He asked me what was good,

723
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:46,283
and I mentioned
that you liked the meatloaf.

724
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:49,813
Right there. You said you weren't going
to talk about me, and you did.

725
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,478
But I... I didn't mean
to talk about you.

726
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:54,418
I told him I didn't want to.

727
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,829
But I like that story
and I guess it just

728
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,248
popped out.

729
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,616
I don't need him knowing
about my mother's meatloaf.

730
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:02,786
Why are you so upset?

731
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:04,544
Because...

732
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:07,358
what goes on between us is ours.

733
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:11,915
Come on, you must've told a lot of
people the meatloaf story, right?

734
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:21,637
So, I got a print. Your people
run it through the database.

735
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:24,187
- You get a name?
- Alexander Wheaton.

736
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,017
The Director of Roman Antiquities.

737
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,396
You want evidence?
We found your evidence.

738
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,818
This is ridiculous.
I didn't kill Dr. Kaswell.

739
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,296
You were in the building,

740
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:39,154
your fingerprint was on the mummy.

741
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,199
There's been some kind of mistake.

742
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,431
I would never have touched 

743
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:45,744
without being gloved, and Leslie
never have allowed it.

744
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:47,788
Wait a minute,

745
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,791
I know what happened.

746
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:55,087
What happened, Doc?
I'm all ears.

747
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:57,482
I did go to see her that night.

748
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,591
I'd been a jerk,

749
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:01,519
jealous about her getting the money.

750
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:03,854
We'd been friends for years,
I wanted to apologize.

751
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,025
We made up,

752
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,100
and she wanted to show me Anok,
scientist to scientist.

753
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,032
She opened Anok's coffin

754
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:12,731
and the mummy slipped.
I reached out to stop it.

755
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:16,052
- It was just a reflex.
- Did she show you the CAT scans?

756
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,652
But she swore me to secrecy.

757
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,530
It was such an important find,
I wasn't going to betray her trust.

758
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,994
After you saw them, the mummy
vanishes with your fingerprint,

759
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,369
your friend dies, and these scans,
they just disappear.

760
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:30,455
They were in her notes. She showed
them before she submitted.

761
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,501
The scans that were supposed to be
submitted to Dr. Turnbull?

762
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:38,011
He was the administrator. They'd be
in the notes he turned over to you.

763
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,937
- He deliberately withheld the scans.
- Destroyed them is more likely.

764
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:46,681
Turnbull's spot is number ten.

765
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,682
He probably put Amok in his car,
and he took off with it.

766
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:52,144
I can't imagine anyone
destroying an artifact

767
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,556
like that, especially
a scholar like Turnbull.

768
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:56,982
I was going to call
himabout my work with Meti.

769
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,973
Steven Turnbull's vehicle here?

770
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,404
- That's right.
- Shut that off there, will you?

771
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,272
Can you step out of the car?

772
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,310
You could be destroying evidence.

773
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:07,389
Oh, man, another drug dealer?

774
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:10,752
It's not my fault. I do a good job,
so word of mouth, it gets around...

775
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:12,884
Is he a regular customer of yours?

776
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,871
- He saw my ad at the Laundromat.
- At the Laun...

777
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:19,212
No wonder you have nothing
but drug dealers coming to you.

778
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,883
Stand over there.
Over there, Rodney.

779
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:24,879
Take a whiff.

780
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:28,041
Smells like Christmas.

781
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:31,529
I saw the CAT scans.

782
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:36,621
I was going to sneak in, take
the ruby and close him up again.

783
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:40,043
But Leslie came back.

784
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:41,768
We argued.

785
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:48,617
I lost my retirement in the market.

786
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,955
No one even knew
that ruby was in there.

787
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,632
She shouldn't have
gotten in the way.

788
00:38:58,535 --> 00:38:59,984
It was her fault.

789
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:13,313
What you doing?

790
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,591
My work.

791
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,273
Dr. Brennan and I found
cause of death for Meti.

792
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:19,189
- He's actually...
- Look,

793
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,529
I should've had more faith in you.

794
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:23,151
I knew how important this was,

795
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,654
I want you to get
everything that you want.

796
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,864
And anytime you don't, it kills me.

797
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:29,074
Really?

798
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:32,360
By looking over your shoulder, it makes
people think that you can't do things.

799
00:39:32,485 --> 00:39:34,579
And you can.
You're brilliant.

800
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:36,832
Certainly well above average.

801
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:39,292
Brilliant.

802
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:42,166
You know, Dr. Brennan
was very impressed by you.

803
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:43,505
She said that?

804
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:44,972
Unsolicited.

805
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:47,902
You're so beautiful.

806
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:50,758
And I promise that if you
ever fail in the future,

807
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,805
I will do absolutely nothing

808
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:54,847
but just give you a hug.

809
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:58,915
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

810
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,108
And I really do love
the breathing exercises.

811
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:05,584
So...

812
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,405
do you want
to be my Lance-a-lot again?

813
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:13,285
You know that drives me crazy!

814
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:40,645
We're not supposed
to be down here yet.

815
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,868
You're with me.
This is my find.

816
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:45,734
You're not gonna get into trouble.
Don't step on that!

817
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:48,387
Why? God, this is so cool!

818
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:53,033
He wasn't trampled by his brother?

819
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,912
Meti suffered
from osteogenesis imperfecta.

820
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:01,124
Otherwise known as
brittle bone disease.

821
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,418
Meti's fall from his
horse killed him.

822
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,837
Anok was innocent.
His mother was right.

823
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,908
So it only took 3,000 years for

824
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:09,736
someone to hear her.

825
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:13,095
I'll tell you what. If I was Egypt,
I'd throw you a party, too.

826
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,639
I have to speak.

827
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,103
I hate these things.

828
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:22,929
What are you talking about?

829
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:25,580
You're great at these things.

830
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:29,528
Listen, you changed history.
How many people can say that?

831
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,590
You can.

832
00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:33,556
Every arrest you make
changes history.

833
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:35,158
You make the world safer.

834
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,493
With your help.

835
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,267
So, Andrew...

836
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:45,085
I thought you were going to take him.
That's what he told me.

837
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,303
I was, yes, but...

838
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,638
you and I, this was our case,

839
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:54,074
and I guess...

840
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,426
what goes on between us,

841
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,699
that should just be ours.

842
00:42:01,163 --> 00:42:02,519
Isn't that what you said?

843
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,243
Come on, you two.

844
00:42:10,517 --> 00:42:12,444
The ambassador is about to speak.

845
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:20,314
Thanks.

846
