1
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:31,030
Excuse me, are you all right?

2
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,700
Yes. Thanks.

3
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,903
In fact, I'm great.

4
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,456
I've been fighting leukemia
for the past eight years,

5
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,708
and now I just got a text...

6
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,919
I'm cancer free.

7
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:48,502
That's awesome.
Congratulations, man.

8
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:51,174
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,185
I've been on hold for
almost half my life.

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,765
No more. I'm gonna travel,
I'm going...

11
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,851
to sleep with exotic women,

12
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,396
I'm gonna do anything I want.

13
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,631
That sounds like a good plan.

14
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:08,757
Congrats, man.

15
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,955
Ms. Iwanaga has come all
the way over from Japan

16
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,320
just to interview me
about my new book.

17
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,543
So her book is big in Japan, too?

18
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,061
Yes, very popular.

19
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:28,462
Spine-tingling.

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,449
Spine-tingling is good, Bones.

21
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:34,009
Well, except when it indicates
a dangerous nerve disorder.

22
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,303
She's also interested
in how you work.

23
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,261
Sure, as long as we keep you safe.

24
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:41,058
That is what agent Andy
would say in your books.

25
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,524
It is an earthake.

26
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:52,403
It's not earthquake
This is... this isn't California!

27
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,158
In both 1811 and 1812,

28
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,462
large tremors
shook D.C.,and again in 1828.

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,588
We can discuss this later.

30
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,902
Okay, that's pretty...

31
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:13,716
What's going on?

32
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,178
Let's get out of there!
The main water valve just broke!

33
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,909
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,109
What the hell is that?!

35
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:11,106
Look, there's Sweets.

36
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,037
He looks very upset.

37
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,528
When I talked to him, he
said the guy died in his arms.

38
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,697
- You guys with the FBI?
- We're here about the human remains.

39
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,854
That's him right over there.

40
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,451
No... the skeleton.

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,509
Right, Officer Grant.
She can help you.

42
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,581
I'll meet up with you.
I'm gonna go see Sweets.

43
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,543
Officer McKenna Grant is just
right over there with the police vest.

44
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:31,794
Thanks.

45
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,114
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

46
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,460
You don't look fine.

47
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,928
It's, you know, a whole
subway car full of people,

48
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,647
and, worst injury
is a broken arm, except for this guy.

49
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:45,949
I can see that.

50
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:47,642
I was just talking to him,

51
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:50,814
when it hit,
and he just beat cancer.

52
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,235
All right, look, I tell you what,
and just have a seat and try to relax.

53
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,380
I... you know,
he talked about traveling

54
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:05,294
and sleeping with exotic women,
and... he was gone, just like that.

55
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,098
You just have a seat
all right and relax

56
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm gonna go check on Bones,

57
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,886
and I'll come back
and I'll take you to the office.

58
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:15,963
- That's fine.
- Okay?

59
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,470
It's no problem.

60
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,965
Your friend said the skeleton washed
against the train window.

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,405
Would have freaked me out.

62
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,193
This is Officer Grant
with the transit police.

63
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:34,255
The water mains,
they broke all through the city.

64
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,235
And this station was
closed for construction.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,296
That's probably why
it flooded like that.

66
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:42,115
This is a male, early 30s,
dead at least a week.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,685
Probably washed out in the tunnel
when the valve broke.

68
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,953
This could be quite a thrilling
opening for your next book.

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,748
What did she say?

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,490
Never mind.

71
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,639
Bones - Season 05 Episode 15
"The Bones on the Blue Line"

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,844
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,
Dark_Chii

73
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,492
Subtitle: A²S Team
- -==All-about-Subs.fr==...

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,609
There are striations on the bones
from animals scavenging.

75
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,348
Probably rats
from the subway tunnel.

76
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,391
That explains why there's
so little tissue left.

77
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:37,964
Like the remains in your
book Bred in the Bone.

78
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,197
Those remains
were eaten by weasels, not rats.

79
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:44,844
It's a different genus altogether,
although dentition is similar.

80
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,978
There's some kind of viscous
film on the humerus and scapula.

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,430
I'll take a swab for Hodgins.

82
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,875
So, other than the cancer survivor

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,845
who died in Sweets' subway car,

84
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,020
there were no other fatalities,

85
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,027
just a couple chimneys down and
some stuff falling off the shelves.

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,238
Really rotten luck
for that poor guy.

87
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,865
And this one, too, apparently.

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,033
Hello.

89
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,109
I'm Angela Montenegro.

90
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:13,659
Ms. Iwanaga is interviewing
me for a Japanese magazine.

91
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,635
In her books, you must be Amanda.

92
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,628
I have a lot more fun than Amanda.

93
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,155
Angela, perhaps you could
take Ms. Iwanaga to my office.

94
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,079
We can discuss my book
a little later.

95
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:26,635
- Of course.
- Right this way.

96
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,926
- What are you doing here?
- I came to offer my... my services.

97
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,313
Earthquakes can cause
psychological trauma.

98
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,411
For you, baby.

99
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,818
- What you've been through...
- I'm fine, Daisy.

100
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,528
Sweets, you saw somebody die.

101
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,739
I know my Lancelot.

102
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,200
- You needed to see me, didn't you?
- No, I'm just trying to do my job.

103
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,432
Booth told you to go home.
He knows about things like this.

104
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,208
We'll call if we need you,
I promise.

105
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,002
We'll have Hodgins drive you home.

106
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,673
Bye, Lancelot.

107
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,935
Note the victim's clavicle.

108
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,936
- It's dented.
- And blue.

109
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:23,815
There's also a blue nick on the C-7.

110
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,279
Something blue pierced his clavicle and
went through to the back of his neck.

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,785
That would have sliced
through the carotid artery.

112
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,376
Ms. Wick, take molds of
the clavicle for a possible weapon

113
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,901
and swab the blue pigment
for Hodgins.

114
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,918
You didn't have to give me a lift.
I have a car.

115
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,295
Seeing someone die, Sweets,

116
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:46,356
you don't just go on with your day
after something like that.

117
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,871
Of course, I was...
you know, I thought

118
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:50,935
if I could help other people,
then...

119
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,610
Yes, but, you know,
sometimes you can't.

120
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,460
Eight years of chemo and radiation.

121
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,745
He said he was going to do the things
that he'd been putting off,

122
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,297
and then he was gone.

123
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,861
I'm sorry, man.

124
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,988
I just don't...
I don't want to disappear

125
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,991
without living the life
that I want to live.

126
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,865
Well, how about you start
by taking the afternoon off?

127
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:29,258
Amanda is the best friend
of Dr. Reichs in the books.

128
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,554
- Are you also friends with Dr. Brennan?
- Absolutely. We're best friends.

129
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:34,932
I see.

130
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,433
Amanda once had sex with Agent Andy.

131
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,310
Then I assume you also have...

132
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,315
What are you writing there?
Stop writing.

133
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:48,318
The books and life
are not the same thing.

134
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,570
Most of the time.

135
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,321
Okay, Ms. Iwanaga, I'm all yours.

136
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,406
Excellent.

137
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,140
Dr. Reichs' relationship
with Agent Andy

138
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:59,663
is based on you and Booth.

139
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,583
The quite notorious sex life
they share...

140
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,668
What? No, we are not them.

141
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:06,086
They're fiction.

142
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,298
What are you writing?
You started writing before I answered.

143
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,176
- She loves to write.
- Your readers feel the passion...

144
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,690
My readers appreciate the intricate
plots and the unique forensics.

145
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:19,406
Why aren't you writing that down?
That was interesting what I just said.

146
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,670
I found a tooth in the victim's scapula.
Oh my gosh, am I interrupting?

147
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,564
A tooth?

148
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:28,958
I'm sorry, Ms. Iwanaga.
We can continue this later.

149
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,668
Gomen nasai.

150
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:38,598
Do you and Amanda share
an interest in painting?

151
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,425
But... listen, that does not mean

152
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,667
that I had a thing
with a Norwegian prince.

153
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,296
You got that, right, that Amanda
and I are different people?

154
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,915
Belgian and Norwegian
are not at all the same thing.

155
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,840
Believe me.

156
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,875
There, in the coracoid process.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,142
At first, I thought it was some kind
of mineralized connective tissue,

158
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,940
but then I remembered in your book,

159
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,396
Dr. Reichs is confounded
by the anomalous 13th rib.

160
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,192
Note how you are able to retain
the important facts from the book.

161
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,402
And what does all of this mean?

162
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,124
It's definitely a tooth.

163
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:18,242
I tested it, a canine, and look here.
He's missing his canine.

164
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,662
Someone extracted his tooth and
surgically implanted it in his scapula?

165
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,201
Okay, if that's his tooth,
what's that in the middle of it?

166
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:28,962
Modified
osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis.

167
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,091
Of course.

168
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:32,130
It's a new surgery to restore sight.

169
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,715
In your shoulder?

170
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,593
They use the tooth as an
anchor for a prosthetic lens.

171
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,162
So the victim was blind.

172
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,713
This is a rare operation.

173
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,266
We should contact
ophthalmologists in the area.

174
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,434
One of them
can probably ID the victim.

175
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,832
I identified the blue substance
on his bones as a polymer

176
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:51,900
paint or rubber, maybe dye. That's why
I'd like to go searching for rat poop.

177
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,467
Of course you'd like that.

178
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:56,135
The victim was eaten by rats
in the subway tunnels.

179
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,966
Rat excrement will contain not
only inorganic clues

180
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,160
but digested remains from the victim.
That could give us time of death, too.

181
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,871
Go for it.
Well, I'll need some help.

182
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,458
You seem to know your poop.

183
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,253
Did you get to the part

184
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:17,509
where Kathy swims
through the sewage tunnel

185
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,219
looking for the killer's teeth?

186
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,889
I'm on page three so far.
I've been busy with the murder.

187
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,349
I speed-read.

188
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,194
Yeah, of course you do.

189
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,206
Rat poop.

190
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,928
Let's bag that, okay?

191
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,107
There's our furry little friends.

192
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,753
There's gotta be a rat's nest nearby
because rat's stay close to home.

193
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:37,279
So, keep your eyes open.

194
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,614
Here's a trail of fecal matter.

195
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,950
I think
it's Dr. Brennan's best book.

196
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,141
People think
that scientists aren't romantic,

197
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:47,039
but Dr. Brennan has a knack
for the steamy.

198
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,999
Still waters run deep.

199
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:53,754
Wait until you get to page 187,
it is H-O-T!

200
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,465
She describes this move
that Agent Andy makes,

201
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,594
Lance and I tried it a few times,
and my God, the neighbors complained.

202
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,136
Rat poop, Miss Wick.

203
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,598
You have to check it out.

204
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:06,057
Rat nest.

205
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:14,524
As rat nests go,
this is the mother ship.

206
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,400
There's got to be some
giftin here for us.

207
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,737
Ventilation grates.

208
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,882
The body could've been
dropped through.

209
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,033
Yeah, all right.

210
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,838
Let's start bagging some excrement.

211
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,290
A white cane.

212
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,014
Our victim was blind.

213
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,612
Martin Aragon, 30 years old.

214
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,177
Lives in Kingman Park.

215
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,088
His eye surgeon identified him.

216
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:51,400
He's a scribe.

217
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,438
I beg your pardon?

218
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,873
Seriously,
he wrote letters for a living.

219
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,827
His business partner's name
is Sophia Meade.

220
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,238
I don't like today one bit.

221
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,563
This man was on the vergof
maybe having his sight returned

222
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:08,203
and Lance's dead friend from the subway
just found out he was cured of leukemia.

223
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,456
- Yeah, it's ironic.
- With all due respect, it's not irony.

224
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,125
People may think it's irony

225
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,545
but it's really just
an unfortunate juxtaposition of events.

226
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,964
Guess they're gonna need
a shorter word for that.

227
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,222
Why doesn't Agent Andy

228
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,242
- wear a "cocky" belt buckle?
- Because Andy isn't Booth.

229
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,810
Why does everyone think that?

230
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,562
Agent Booth thinks he is.

231
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,966
He says they are both

232
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,983
- brave and attractive.
- He's wrong.

233
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,610
You do not think he's attractive?

234
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,611
I think his symmetry
is pleasing, yes.

235
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,412
But, Ms. Iwanaga,

236
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:49,229
the characters in my books are really
only there to furer the forensics.

237
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:50,745
I do not agree.

238
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,039
The sex is very involving.

239
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,001
Why does everyone think that?
It's just sex.

240
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,713
- Imaginative sex.
- Okay, I only include that and

241
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,048
the personal interactions
to denote the passage of time.

242
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,718
What are you writing?
I only took conversational Japanese.

243
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:20,400
Page 187.

244
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:28,139
Oh, my God.

245
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,753
One moment please.

246
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,707
Personal privilege, point of order.

247
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,227
How's your rat poop?

248
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,466
Page 187.

249
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,999
You mind reading it aloud?

250
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:49,012
Page 187?
I am not reading the sparky bits to you.

251
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,139
You can get somebody else to do that,
sicko.

252
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,701
Fine.
Read it to yourself then.

253
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,650
That's that thing.
Nobody else does that thing.

254
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,860
It's my thing that I do.

255
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,916
Right.

256
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,490
It's not a well-known thing.
It's, you know, my thing that I do.

257
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,667
I remember.

258
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:10,992
I was there.

259
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,911
You told Brennan
about that thing I do.

260
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,785
- It's a very good thing.
- It's my thing.

261
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,249
That I do.

262
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,086
- Did you tell her that it was my thing?
- Did I give you credit?

263
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,088
Yes. Did you?

264
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:27,981
Good, because I don't need her
looking at me thinking about

265
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,905
- that thing I do.
- That's good then.

266
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,540
But now that thing I do is in print

267
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,977
and every guy that reads that
book is gonna give it a shot.

268
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,449
You know I got other things
that I do.

269
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:46,332
My advice,

270
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,478
only sleep with guys
that can't read because otherwise,

271
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,954
you'll never be rid of me.

272
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:01,869
I'm very worried about Lance.

273
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,876
I didn mean say that out loud.

274
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:06,806
I just thought it so hard
that it popped out of my mouth.

275
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,462
Apology accepted.

276
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:11,595
That guy dying right in front of him
really freaked him out.

277
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:13,346
He's very sensitive,

278
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,224
not inured to death and mortality
like you and I are.

279
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,477
The pattern of this pitting...
I believe it resulted from blowback.

280
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,541
- From a gunshot?
- Most probably.

281
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,567
The victim was shot with a gun and was
standing in front of something glass.

282
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,943
Which shattered and
blew back into his skull.

283
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:30,614
Then the bullet must've been blue.

284
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:33,552
Are there such things as blue bulls?

285
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:36,119
That's for me to find out, right?

286
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,949
Because that's my job.

287
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:46,588
Martin and Iave been business partners
for six years.

288
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,567
We've been writing letters for people
since we got out of college.

289
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,698
How did he adjust
to the fact he was blind?

290
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:54,054
He loved reading and
writing more than anything.

291
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,188
The past couple of years,
he's been very down and depressed.

292
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,164
That's why he got the operation.

293
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,520
Listen, how does this whole,

294
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,409
professional letter writing thing,
you know, work?

295
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:09,199
Well, most people are unable to express
themselves in a cogent manner.

296
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,393
- Martin and I know how to do that.
- Does it pay well?

297
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,242
- $50 a page for simple letters.
- 50 bucks?

298
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,869
$250 for legalese.

299
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,705
- So, someone owes me money...
- You come to us.

300
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,083
Or if you got bad service,

301
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,210
letters to the editor, congressmen,

302
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,921
- even Dear John letters.
- When was the last time you saw him?

303
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:30,298
Last week.

304
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:34,084
We don't work together every day.
I have kids, I work from home.

305
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:37,347
Clients, did they ever want
their money back?

306
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,663
We have dissatisfied customers
like any business.

307
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,308
But none's ever threatened us.

308
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,478
You're welcome
to look at our archives.

309
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:45,480
You have copies of everything.

310
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,525
Yes, on disk.

311
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:53,363
Our victim, he's an expert on everything
look at all these letters here.

312
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,740
Parking tickets, income tax,

313
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,577
court orders, the whole thing.

314
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,945
It's getting to a pot
where I'd want to kill him too.

315
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,751
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

316
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,195
- Sure you're ready to come back?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

317
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:16,265
That guy on the subway,
one way to look at it...

318
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:18,346
he died happy.

319
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,554
What?

320
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:23,910
I mean, think about it.
This guy gets is great news.

321
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:25,598
And what's he do?

322
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:27,489
He shares it with a stranger.

323
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:33,194
You're gonna think I'm stupid
for saying this,

324
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,354
but the whole thing...

325
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:37,615
it felt like a message.

326
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:40,201
Right, a message.
I believe in messages.

327
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,013
Yeah, it was like a message.

328
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,327
"Go ye forth
and live life to the fullest."

329
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:49,294
- Something like that.
- Live life to its fullest.

330
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,796
People should do that more often.

331
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:53,840
Moment to moment, but they don't.

332
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,276
Wait till you see this.
Look at this letter right here.

333
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,231
A letter actually written
by the victim.

334
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,599
I mean, it's written by him.

335
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,842
And signed...

336
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:05,486
signed by him.

337
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,687
He's complaining about
a sandwich franchise.

338
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,284
Says it's disgusting and
should be shut down. What?

339
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,567
Yeah, but you know what?
Keep reading.

340
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,444
All right, he kept the reply.

341
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:17,989
"You're destroying my
career and my living.

342
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,949
People have been killed for less."

343
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:21,409
It's a death threat.

344
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:23,751
It's a death threat.

345
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,585
Let's put together a time
line made out of rat poop.

346
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,878
And now
I'm in a sixth-grade science fair.

347
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,840
The oldest poop containing human remains
dates from seven days ago.

348
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,232
Now, I also found this.

349
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,114
Is that the color
that was found on the bones?

350
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,800
The same sub-micrometer
blue polymer base material.

351
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,352
Now, I'm running a scan companies
at manufacture it

352
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:50,981
to see if it's ever been used
for ammunition,

353
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,012
and check this out.

354
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,069
- Also found this.
- Is that leather?

355
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,977
It's a piece
from the sole of a shoe.

356
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:00,490
- The victim's?
- No. His we matched with DNA.

357
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,927
This leather was found in a rat's
stomach along with bits of the victim.

358
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,635
They were ingested at the same time.

359
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,248
This could've come from
whoever killed Martin Aragon.

360
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,999
What do you know.

361
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,266
King of the lab.

362
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,879
That's a first.
Usually I have to say it.

363
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,383
Yes, but I wanted to hear how it sounded
with a touch of modesty.

364
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,972
Stewart, hello.

365
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,063
So, I spoke
to Sammy's corporate office.

366
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:35,775
I found out you lost your franchise
in Rock Creek last month.

367
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,820
- What's this about?
- They said at they pulled the plug

368
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,657
on you because you got into,
what they called a altercation

369
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,076
with one of the customers there.
You two fought.

370
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:47,871
That blind creep, Aragon.

371
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,956
He comes in twice a
week for three months.

372
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,114
One day he gets sick
and it's my fault.

373
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:55,461
Those letters, they were just
some kind of crazy vendetta.

374
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,171
So, what's this?

375
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,090
Son of a bitch
coming after me again?

376
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,430
He's dead.

377
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:03,887
- He was murdered.
- Then someone did the world a favor.

378
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,138
But it wasn't me.

379
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,411
That bastard cost me over $100,000.

380
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,434
- I lost everything.
- You wrote him back.

381
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,875
Saying you'd kill him if he didn't stop
writing to the head office.

382
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,938
Hold on, man.

383
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,232
That's just something
that you say, okay?

384
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,526
I was going under, my wife left me.

385
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,447
I offered him five free lunches
but nothing was good enough for him.

386
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,241
Where were you last Thursday night?
Anywhere near Rock Creek station?

387
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,669
- Why?
- Why?

388
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:29,636
A second ago you're happy he's dead,
now...

389
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,165
you don't want to tell me anything?

390
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:36,851
Even from the grave
this dude is ruining my life.

391
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,429
I don't have to say nothing.

392
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:41,174
I want one of those
court-appointed lawyers.

393
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,885
Sure. Okay.
Take about a couple of hours. Sit tight.

394
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:50,975
I believe my books are popular
because they introduce the reader

395
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,102
to the world
of forensic anthropology.

396
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:56,231
Why aren't you writing?
You usually write down everything.

397
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,360
Why did it take so long for Dr. Reichs
to have sex with Agent Andy?

398
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,364
For the same reason
that she used stable isotos

399
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,906
to determine that the victim
spent her childhood in East Timor.

400
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,376
The oxygen isotopes
we ingest through food and water

401
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,595
are incorporated into the hydroxyl
carbonic apatite of bone.

402
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,448
You should be writing this down.

403
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:19,482
Will she ever tell Andy
about her affair with Ryan?

404
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,498
That was inconsequential fluff,
Ms. Iwanaga.

405
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:24,865
It's why they fight in chapter six.

406
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,210
They identify the lotus tooth
in chapter six.

407
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:30,515
But that is when their passion
is released, page 187.

408
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,309
Why are you only asking
about things that mean nothing?

409
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,739
Those are the things
that mean everything.

410
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:41,249
All anyone
cares about are characters.

411
00:22:41,374 --> 00:22:44,254
That's what they relate to, you know?
It makes the story real.

412
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:47,635
No, the facts make it real.
They're indisputable.

413
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,584
If you believed that,
you wouldn't write it as well as you do.

414
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:53,538
Angela helps me with those scenes.

415
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,780
What?

416
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:56,135
Angela helps me.

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,292
Page 187?

418
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:01,295
Though.

419
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,964
I'm anxious to try it.

420
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,106
Really?

421
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,304
These are all the letters
he was paid to write?

422
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,993
Yeah, look at this one.

423
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:13,746
"Your breathes gives me life.

424
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:16,077
"We're joined by loves tender coil.

425
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:18,062
Sight ruled by my heart alone."

426
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,856
That's very romantic.

427
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,066
Somebody definitively got
their money's worth.

428
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,193
I don't think it was written
for a stranger.

429
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,390
Yeah, but, this is for the customer.

430
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:27,447
Look.

431
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,991
Sight ruled by my heart alone.

432
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:31,659
He was blind.

433
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:33,339
It's about him.

434
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:36,205
I heard you were here.
I've been calling.

435
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:37,911
I know...

436
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:42,962
I've busy doing lot of thinking,
Daisy.

437
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,130
About what?

438
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:47,225
I know something is bothering you.
You have to share it with me.

439
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,071
Guys, I'm going to leave.

440
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,472
You know what? We should work.
I'll call you.

441
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,266
Okay, I'll...

442
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,899
What's going on, Sweets?

443
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,335
You know,
I only have one life, Angela,

444
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,495
and I don't want to play it safe,

445
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,053
now I'd really like to work.

446
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:18,542
I can check these e-mail headers
to see who got this letters.

447
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,292
Maybe it was some kind love affair
gone wrong.

448
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,875
Okay, the server sent the message
to this IP address.

449
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,882
- The remote desktop is open.
- Okay, what just happened?

450
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:33,429
Well, we now have full control over
the computer that received these emails.

451
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:36,307
- What did you just do?
- Turned the web cam on.

452
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:39,484
That is the manager
at the subway station.

453
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,620
Well, then that is Aragon
she sent the love letters to.

454
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,863
- Where are we going?
- Cam ask me to get you out of the lab.

455
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,491
- Why?
- Because you keep sighing and moaning.

456
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,738
I thought I was keeping
that to myself.

457
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:57,995
No, no.
You were sharing with everyone.

458
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:01,040
Why do you drive a minivan?
Do you have kids we don't know about.

459
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,291
I'm artist, Daisy,

460
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,669
and the Sienna has plenty of room,

461
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,577
plus I stink at parallel parking,

462
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:09,757
and the back up camera thing
is like the invention of the century.

463
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,098
So why are you sighing
and moaning, Daisy?

464
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,055
Because...

465
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,890
Have you ever been dumped?

466
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:19,392
Of course.

467
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:21,561
- Hasn't everybody?
- Not me

468
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,189
- Never?
- Never.

469
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,189
I'm smart,

470
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,109
I'm extremely attractive,
plus I'm a sexual dynamo.

471
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,614
So, do you think that Sweets
is going to break up with you?

472
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,616
I don't know
it's never happened before.

473
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,869
He's pushing me away.

474
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,518
He's been avoiding me.

475
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,901
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Why?

476
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,294
Because
before they break up with you

477
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:50,085
guys usually get really
affectionate and sweet.

478
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,049
Does it always happen like that?

479
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,067
No.
No, not always.

480
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:57,096
So you can't get me any real help at all
even though you've been dumped a lot.

481
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:58,715
Not a lot.

482
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:02,894
Why would Lance break up with me?
I'm awesome.

483
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:10,651
I paid the dude to write letters for me.
Is that a crime?

484
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,321
- To?
- Officer Grant.

485
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,619
Officer Grant, the transit cop
that was at the accident?

486
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:19,493
I was getting nowhere with her.

487
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,788
She was all wrapped
up with this dude. Eddy Cerafick.

488
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,645
Aragon said he could
appeal to her romantic side.

489
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,221
You could close the deal.

490
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,587
She's a cute ass, you know?

491
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,045
I tought maybe that poetry stuff,
it could work.

492
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,009
Right. You are quite
a romantic, Colin.

493
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:36,761
Tell you what, though.

494
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,640
Martin Aragon was murdered.

495
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,092
- You're kidding me.
- Try to look surprised. It'll help.

496
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,018
I swear, I had no idea.

497
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,539
Maybe when he
wrote these letters to her...

498
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:50,025
Yeah, that is what it is.

499
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,277
Maybe when he wrote these letters to her
he actually fell in love with her?

500
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,489
Why would I care?
As long as letters worked.

501
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,454
But those letters, they didn't work.

502
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,695
And you shelled out a lot of
money for those letters, right?

503
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,015
What do you end up with?

504
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,040
A blind guy who falls
in love with your girlfriend.

505
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:10,753
That would make you pretty mad,
wouldn't it?

506
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:14,825
Am I right? 

507
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,516
You feel uncomfortable
talking about this.

508
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,852
Is this cause of something that
that Japanese journalist said?

509
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:31,105
Ms. Riku asked Bones about
some of the character stuff,

510
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,678
with her book and when were alone,

511
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:35,385
she told me you helped her.

512
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,365
I mean, I might have given her
a few suggestions, that's all.

513
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,173
Suggestions? Like...?

514
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:42,372
Brennan types up her book,

515
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,645
and then I go to her place,

516
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,374
and I lie on the couch, I mean,
with a glass of wine,

517
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,065
and she reads me the book.

518
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:51,738
I make suggestions.

519
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:54,054
She reads you the whole book?

520
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,882
Yeah, yeah.
And I say...

521
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,695
"You know what would be great here?

522
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,328
If they were naked."

523
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,820
Or, "What if he says this to her,

524
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:04,724
and then they laugh and they kiss?

525
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,657
You know, that kind of stuff.

526
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,103
- The good stuff, you mean.
- Do not do that.

527
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,459
She writes the book.

528
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:13,073
I just drink wine
and make suggestions.

529
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,675
Like her editor?
And editors do not get credit.

530
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,280
- What about page 187?
- What is it with you guys and page 187?

531
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,786
I have to go.
I'm busy.

532
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,137
You recognize these?

533
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:27,580
Where did you get these?

534
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,832
From the victim's computer.
He wrote them?

535
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,848
No. These letters were sent to me
by Colin.

536
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:35,671
No, Colin paid Martin
Aragon to write these.

537
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,967
He wasted his money 'cause I only
went out with him a couple times.

538
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,261
You think that

539
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,324
maybe Colin blamed
the blind guy for not sealing deal?

540
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:49,873
No, sorry, but Colin isn't exactly
the tough guy type.

541
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,495
Eddie may be, not Colin.

542
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,261
Your previous boyfriend?

543
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,609
Yeah, when I left

544
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,987
Eddie for Colin, he came down
and punched Collin up a little bit.

545
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:02,531
Not hospital punching, but

546
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:04,223
he knocked him around.

547
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:06,325
What if Eddie found
out that Colin used

548
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,418
the blind guy's letters
to woo you away?

549
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,556
- Where would we find Edie?
- He owns a pawnshop

550
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:18,454
- above Rock Creek station where I work.
- Is that how you met him?

551
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:21,509
I met Eddie when I arrested him
for carrying pizzas and weapon.

552
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,819
I hear you, I have issues with men.
Thanks for update.

553
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,935
Our safety slug was designed

554
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,021
to dissintegrate so it wouldn't
riccoshe after it hits its target.

555
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,693
So it's safe bullet?

556
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,445
Not for the person it hits,
just everybody else around.

557
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,645
This is a thin clothing
of blue palmer.

558
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,031
That must be what left marks
on the clavicle C-7.

559
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,576
Perhaps 'cause the ammunititon
is so rare, we could trace buyers.

560
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,905
We're not done yet.

561
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,041
Turning our attention
to glass fragments

562
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,124
embedded in the back
of our victim's head.

563
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,209
The bullet exited the victim,

564
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,504
shattered a glass object
behind him before disintegrating.

565
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,705
Right. The angle of applied
force was 28 degrees.

566
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,472
So if I extend the incident lines,
the point of intersection

567
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,345
is here.

568
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,682
Which means he was standing
between 45 and 60 centimeters

569
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,195
in front of the glass object
when he was shot.

570
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,312
Then we find that glass
and find where he was killed?

571
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,689
We're still not done.

572
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:22,133
Those are my photographs from when
Hodgins and I went to find the rat poop.

573
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:23,874
Let's not get to emotional.

574
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,289
So we need to find glass

575
00:30:26,414 --> 00:30:28,420
fixtures that contain borosilicate.

576
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,895
We find that here.

577
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:32,455
I scanned for color
frequences on the wall

578
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,373
where the bullet
would have disintegrated.

579
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,394
The blue polymer emits
around 20 nanomers.

580
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,459
You found where he was murded.

581
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,933
And he was lured
into this tunnel and was shot.

582
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,844
Let the record show that my photographs
were invaluable to the process.

583
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,578
There is no record, is there?

584
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,610
This is pawnshop.

585
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,872
Like the one in your first book
when Doctor Reichs and Agent Andy

586
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,785
removed their clothes
in the two-man submarine.

587
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,545
The pulverized acromion is the
important part of that book.

588
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,850
I like the sub.

589
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,464
I can hardly wait to see what
you three are looking for.

590
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:17,708
Come on.
You've got to be kidding me.

591
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,169
- You own an gun?
- Of course.

592
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,306
It's a pawnshop.
Never had to use it.

593
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:24,085
I'd wave it around, but...

594
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,022
Why is he allowed to carry a gun

595
00:31:26,147 --> 00:31:28,035
after he was arrested?

596
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,846
Mistake. I accidentally put it
in my pocket,when left work.

597
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,530
Can we see the gun, please?

598
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,226
It's just right over here.

599
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:38,412
Really easy there, pal.

600
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:40,103
Don't want any sudden movements.

601
00:31:40,228 --> 00:31:42,149
No mistakes. That's it.

602
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,651
That's very sexy.

603
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:46,615
Big Andy with a gun,
protecting Kathy.

604
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:49,156
He's not Andy and I'm not Kathy.

605
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,202
Plus, it's more exciting
when he shoots someone with it.

606
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,565
It is.

607
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,331
- Impressive. He never misses.
- Andy sometimes misses.

608
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,267
Yes. See?

609
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:00,709
- Sorry.
- I get it.

610
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:03,629
- Cops gotta be careful.
- Is that a box of ammo over there?

611
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,224
Gotcha, dirtbag!

612
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,227
- Got me for what?
- Don't write that,

613
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,493
dirtbag.

614
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,357
What? We got him. 

615
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:30,034
Officer Grant says you
have quite a temper.

616
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,726
Guy starts writing love letters
to your girlfriend,

617
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,328
then she dumps you for him?
He's gonna get a pop.

618
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,905
It's practically the law.

619
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,345
So you punch him
in the nose, that's fine.

620
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,502
Then you find out that it wasn't
Colin who wrote the letters.

621
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
What?

622
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,463
- He admitted it.
- No, no, no.

623
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,574
He hired someone else.
You find that out

624
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,259
and you shoot him.

625
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,343
Who?

626
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,928
The guy whowrote them.

627
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,514
Wait.
So she dumped me for another guy?

628
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,724
No, for Colin.

629
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,931
I'm confused.

630
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,099
The point of all of this is that we have
your fancy blue bullets

631
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:02,646
the gun, and where you shot.

632
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,733
I never shot my gun.
I told you already.

633
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,938
I might wave it around
from time to time

634
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:11,261
if some bad-looking dude comes
in my joint, but I never shot it.

635
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:15,242
And plus, I'm sure you figured out that
those bullets don't fit in that gun.

636
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,785
Guy could have two guns?

637
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,621
Who are you saying I killed again?

638
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,385
If you have nothing to hide,

639
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,459
why don't you just show me the gun
that uses these fancy blue bullets?

640
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,465
Let the record show that the suspect
acted very suspiciously

641
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,474
when I asked him to
produce the weapon.

642
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,550
Wait!

643
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:32,629
Okay.

644
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,929
I gave the gun to somebody.

645
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,130
Who?

646
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:39,016
She said I was a stiff sometimes.

647
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:40,814
All right? Boring, I guess.

648
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:42,998
And she wanted me to
be a little romantic.

649
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:46,510
I gave her the gun that brought us
together in the first place.

650
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,347
- Officer Grant?
- Yeah.

651
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,237
Got it engraved, and I gave it
to her for Valentine's Day.

652
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,616
So, now, are you gonna inform the record
on what to show on that?

653
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,213
There's nobody in there.

654
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:04,708
Thanks for coming in.
Can I have your sidearm, please?

655
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,462
What's this about?

656
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,632
We got a warrant
to search your apartment.

657
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,300
Will you have a seat, please?

658
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,141
We found Eddie's gun.

659
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,935
It says, "You can
arrest me anytime. Eddie."

660
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,146
You're a law enforcement
professional.

661
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,213
Why would you keep
the murder weapon?

662
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,485
I am a law enforcement professional,

663
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,987
and if you had any evidence that wasn't
circumstantial, you would arrest me.

664
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,228
So, I guess I will be leaving.
It's been a pleasure.

665
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:39,910
Hold on... for one second, please.

666
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,497
We also have a warrant
for your shoes.

667
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,150
My shoes?

668
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:50,713
What's that?

669
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:53,567
Leather we found with
the victim's tissue.

670
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,078
Inside a rat.

671
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,575
If we can match this
leather to your shoes,

672
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,930
it'll show that you were
there when the victim died.

673
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,853
Will you please remove
your shoes, Officer Grant?

674
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,865
Eddie was a good guy.

675
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,906
I just wanted a little romance,

676
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:23,328
but those letters were a lie.

677
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,039
I should have been happy with him.

678
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,308
I should have been
happy with what I had.

679
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,160
Thank you very much.

680
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,382
I have a big article to write.

681
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:51,363
I hope you would stress
important things in my novels.

682
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:53,825
I've learned very much.

683
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,569
You learned that

684
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,835
rat excrement can provide
not only a time line,

685
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,868
but also, very important
non-circumstantial evidence.

686
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,333
I also learned that

687
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,629
people should not take credit
for what other people write.

688
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,416
What is that supposed to mean?

689
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,252
I mean the man who
was murdered, of course.

690
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,708
"Unseen, I feel
your spirit as we work.

691
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:35,842
The scent of your hair.

692
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,904
The accidental brush of your skin.

693
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:42,533
I hear your heart beating.
Mine beating with yours as one.

694
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,318
I breathe when you breathe,

695
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:47,523
breath to breath,
heartbeat to heartbeat..."

696
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:50,435
You believe Martin wrote
these letters to me?

697
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,085
The imagery, you know,
syntax, the emotion.

698
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,045
I do.

699
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:57,381
So you're saying
he was in love with me?

700
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,792
Wasn't sure whether to tell
you, but...

701
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:03,742
I figured that if I was him,

702
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,495
I wouldn't want my fear to prevent
you from knowing how I felt.

703
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,282
But he never said anything.

704
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,253
But Martin wouldn't, would he?

705
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,064
I was married.

706
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,576
I had children.
I was happy.

707
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,027
He could never have what he wanted.

708
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,534
Poor Martin.

709
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,944
- What is this?
- It's your share.

710
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,664
My share of what?

711
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:40,007
My advance, plus an estimation of what
you deserve for the other two books.

712
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,136
Would you stop talking as though
I know what you're talking about?

713
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,619
I've come to realize
over the past couple days that

714
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,983
you deserve 25% of
what I get for my books.

715
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,541
Does this have to do
with Hodgins and

716
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,855
the whole sex thing on page 187?

717
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,415
- Among other things.
- So, is this Booth's idea?

718
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,276
No.

719
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,908
Did my own math.
Booth is terrible at math.

720
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:04,865
I meant the whole share thing.

721
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:07,723
Booth's surprise in your
involment cause me

722
00:38:07,848 --> 00:38:09,745
to reevaluate our arrangement.

723
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,933
Is my math incorrect?

724
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,841
Um, this is... this is 25%?

725
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,118
Yes.

726
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:26,754
I figure if my agent gets
ten percent,

727
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:28,812
you deserve more.

728
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,225
Lancelot, there you are.
Don't touch the bones.

729
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,670
Did it look like I was going to?
I wasn't.

730
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,979
I've been trying to call you.

731
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,328
You've been avoiding me,
haven't you?

732
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,793
Yeah.

733
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:55,998
I needed to think about some things.

734
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,336
About you and me and

735
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,102
what I want my life to be.

736
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,848
Is this because of the boy
who didn't die of leukemia?

737
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,702
Yeah.

738
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,523
And you're here because
you decided something?

739
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,217
Yeah.

740
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,362
Am I going to like what you decided?

741
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:27,948
I don't know.

742
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:33,256
I just want to say that

743
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:36,415
I don't want to spend
any more time away from you

744
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:38,218
than I have to.

745
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,612
- What?
- I'm doing this wrong.

746
00:39:43,274 --> 00:39:45,660
When my mom died,
she left me something,

747
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:49,886
and my mom and dad were
together for almost 60 years.

748
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:50,971
They were old.

749
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,432
They were really old
when they adopted me.

750
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:58,103
It's just a modest ring,

751
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:00,692
but it represents 60 years of love.

752
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,884
Will you be my wife?

753
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,127
It would make me incredibly
happy if you would be my husband.

754
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:30,427
I'm sorry about everyone else,

755
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,410
all the bad things,

756
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,606
but that earthquake was the
luckiest thing in the world for me.

757
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,450
- You are not going to believe this.
- Come in.

758
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,174
You want a drink? I had some
Chinese food in the refrigerator.

759
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:59,751
- A drink. Scotch.
- What am I not going to believe?

760
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,378
Officer Grant got a lawyer.

761
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:07,124
We just arrested her for murder.
I believe that.

762
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:10,946
Eddie got her
the best defense attorney in town.

763
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:12,971
That is hard to believe.

764
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,965
He heard what she did for him, and he
fall in love with her all over again.

765
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,641
That is not rational.

766
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,727
You know what? I still
can be surprised by people.

767
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,035
Is that good or bad?

768
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:23,980
Bad?

769
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:26,465
I think.

770
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,688
Uh... I don't know.

771
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,071
If she's convicted,
even with good behavior,

772
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:35,535
she'll be in prison
for the next 15 years.

773
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,245
But he said that they're soul mates,

774
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,995
and he'll wait for however long
it takes for her to get out.

775
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,498
- Soul mates?
- Soul mates.

776
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:44,955
The idea of soul mates
actually originated with Plato.

777
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,170
You mean the clay
that kids play with.

778
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,130
The...

779
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,591
- What?
- You're joking.

780
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,177
- Me, joke? No.
- The ancient Greek philosopher.

781
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,219
His theory was that

782
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:59,115
humans originally
consisted of four arms,

783
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,101
four legs and two faces.

784
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:05,974
Zeus was threatened by their
power and slipt them all in half,

785
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,656
condemning us all to

786
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:10,915
spend our lives trying
to complete ourselves.

787
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:15,198
I don't believe that's true.

788
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:18,096
I agree. It's ridiculous.

789
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,921
Right?

790
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:23,995
Four arms.

791
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:26,016
Four heads.

792
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,500
- Two faces.
- Come on.

793
