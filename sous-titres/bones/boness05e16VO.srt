1
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,010
You know, we're gonna have
to break this to Sweets very gently.

2
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:08,424
Why? He should be grateful.

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,596
- He can be grateful later.
- What do you mean?

4
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:12,910
You know how people are grateful
when you yell fire,

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,556
but before they're grateful,
they panic, and run into walls?

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,059
You think Sweets is going
to panic and run into a wall?

7
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:20,895
Metaphorically. I got it.

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,109
He's not gonna like it.
If there was a mistake

9
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:25,865
- in one of my books, I'd want to know.
- What you call a mistake,

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,526
Sweets calls an interpretation.

11
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,738
Interpretation?
No, it's an actual factual error.

12
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:35,326
Okay, what exactly do you think,
you think we're telling him about?

13
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:37,286
Page 31. And I quote,

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,997
"Subjects worked together
for the first time in solving the murder

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,375
of pregnant congressional intern
Cleo Eller. "

16
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,081
Right, yeah.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,755
That's right. We worked
that other case before that.

18
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,494
What did you think we were
going to talk to him about?

19
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,135
The whole... love thing?

20
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,553
The love thing?

21
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,913
His conclusion that we're in love?
I don't care about that.

22
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:03,854
- What mistake?
- Hint: It's not what you think.

23
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:07,650
You disagree with my conclusion
that the two of you are in love.

24
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,028
And the sublimating energies of
that connection are responsible

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,238
for the energy,

26
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:16,367
vigor and rigor that you bring
to your homicide investigations.

27
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,410
I just told you,
it's not what you think,

28
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:20,538
and you immediately say
what you think.

29
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,208
That's your interpretation.
We recognize your right to interpret.

30
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,118
You do?

31
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,852
That's your right as a psychologist
to get everything wrong.

32
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:31,632
I have circled some typos.
Other than that, and the fact that

33
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,884
the Cleo Eller murder
was not our first case,

34
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,403
you're ready to publish.

35
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:40,433
My interpretation of your working
relationship is based on

36
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,728
the unfolding, interpersonal dynamics
of that first case.

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,980
It wasn't our first case.

38
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,982
It's not your first case.

39
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:51,826
Well, then, please
tell me all about that real first case

40
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,835
to see if my conclusions
are still valid.

41
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,790
A girl was murdered,

42
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:06,803
and her remains were
thrown in a landfill.

43
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,928
Well, her name was Gemma Harrington.
The case was going nowhere.

44
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,465
I was at an early morning
Gamblers Anonymous meeting.

45
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,718
You snapped the nine.

46
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,286
Rack 'em.

47
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,890
<i>Booth had a gambling problem
before he met me. </i>

48
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,963
<i>Well, since I mostly won,
it wasn't really a problem. </i>

49
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:29,371
<i>But it took your focus away
from more important things,</i>

50
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:30,649
<i>like work. </i>

51
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,901
<i>I was getting it under control. </i>

52
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,926
- Nice shot, Tex.
- Thanks.

53
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:45,623
Right. Okay, on my way.

54
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,064
Thank you for seeing me.

55
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,860
<i>Victim's mother, Jocelyn,
came to see me</i>

56
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:54,639
<i>to tell me that the New York
coroner's office was releasing</i>

57
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:57,014
<i>her daughter's remains for burial. </i>

58
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,211
<i>She was all upset. </i>

59
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,336
<i>Upset why?</i>

60
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,892
The police had given up hope
of finding her daughter's killer.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,811
The case was a split jurisdiction.

62
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,562
The girl was last seen in DC,

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,232
but her body was found
in New York in a landfill.

64
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:15,027
<i>The New York coroner was in town,
and, I decided to meet with her.</i>

65
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:23,267
I can get you Gemma's file,
but you know the definition of insanity

66
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:26,455
is to do the same thing,
expecting a different outcome.

67
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,791
Okay. Maybe I missed something?

68
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,918
How's about you get
another point of view?

69
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,003
Partner up.
You know I don't do that.

70
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,714
There's a forensic anthropologist
at the Jeffersonian.

71
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,913
I read that she solved how
Stone Age Hunter was murdered.

72
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,307
How does that help?

73
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:44,098
She can solve a 4,000-year-old homicide,
maybe she can help on Gemma Harrington.

74
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:46,943
- I could release the remains to her.
- You know what?

75
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:50,437
I'll catch up with you later, all right?
Forensics don't solve crimes. Cops do.

76
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,815
Same activity, same results.

77
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:56,067
Speaking of which, you look
like you've been up all night.

78
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,516
- I'm fine.
- Meaning you won?

79
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,424
<i>That's when he said... </i>

80
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,060
- What's that scientist's name?
- <i>And Cam answered... </i>

81
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,242
Which is me.

82
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:20,325
Most methods of removing flesh
have disadvantages.

83
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:23,060
<i>I was lecturing</i>
<i>on defleshing techniques</i>

84
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,555
<i>at American University. </i>

85
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:28,559
Methods which preserve the bone
perfectly require patience.

86
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,906
<i>Bones was not what I expected. </i>

87
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:35,023
... works quickly, but the bone itself
is cooked, transforming the marrow.

88
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:38,485
The first step is to use conventional
surgical implements,

89
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,280
being very careful that the scalpel

90
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,658
or forceps never come
in contact with bone.

91
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:46,624
Any questions?

92
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,370
I have a question.

93
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,196
Seems to me, if you,
remove the flesh,

94
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,167
aren't you, destroying the evidence?

95
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:55,753
On the contrary,
I am revealing evidence.

96
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Thank you.
See you next week.

97
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:06,639
Just, one more thing.
I mean,

98
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,015
isn't all the good evidence
in the flesh?

99
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,227
You know, like, the poison
and the stab wounds and the bullets?

100
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,648
The important indicators are written
in the bone, if you look carefully.

101
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,274
So that's your thing.

102
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:19,652
Yes. I'm the best in the world.

103
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,696
You're serious.

104
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:24,881
He thought I was being humorous.

105
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,366
That turns out to be true.

106
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,135
But you didn't know that yet.

107
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,621
Are you a student here?

108
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,790
Special Agent Seeley Booth
from the FBI.

109
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:37,564
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan
of the Jeffersonian Institution.

110
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:41,727
- Do you believe in fate?
- Absolutely not.

111
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,050
Ludicrous.

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,200
- I still don't.
- And I still do. 

113
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,827
Bones - Season 5 Episode 16
"The Parts in the Sum of the Whole"

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

116
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:28,455
Booth decided not to provide me
with the murder victim's identity.

117
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,146
<i>I wanted to see if she could find out
what I already knew. </i>

118
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,523
A modicum of connective tissue
indicates that,

119
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:36,474
depending upon burial conditions,

120
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,397
the remains are less
than 200 years old.

121
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,525
Zack, we have to shift the paradigm.
This is a recent murder.

122
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:44,909
- What does this FBI agent want?
- Identification of the remains.

123
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:48,782
Apparently, the FBI has had no luck
with dental records or missing persons.

124
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:51,815
Pelvis tells us female
who has never given birth.

125
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,669
Eruption of the third molar
indicates adolescent.

126
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,845
The fingernails
have lacquer on them.

127
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,673
Fractures to the pars
interarticularis of the C2

128
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,951
indicate a blow to the forehead,
which may have caused unconsciousness,

129
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:04,028
but not death.

130
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:06,508
- What are you doing?
- We are identifying a murder victim.

131
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:08,548
From this century?

132
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,629
I'm taking the clothing.

133
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,058
I have asked you before
not to be so unpleasant.

134
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,102
- Please? I'm taking the clothing.
- Why?

135
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,662
- You are a botanist.
- Yeah, and a mineralogist

136
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,102
and a an entomologist,

137
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,154
which gives me the same number
of doctorates

138
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,861
as the two of you put together,
because you don't have any.

139
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:30,115
Look, I could find fibers, or spores
or other particulates.

140
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,023
Cause of death...
the sharp, symmetrical traumas

141
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,745
to both right and left temporals.

142
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,956
You can take the clothing
and leave now.

143
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,624
Yeah? You can take that femur
and shove...

144
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,764
Naomi from Paleontology suggests
that Hodgins is like that

145
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,932
because he needs to get laid.

146
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,102
That means engage in coitus.

147
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,344
- This is not a good likeness.
- Oh, my God.

148
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,868
No, this is...
This is accurate.

149
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,105
- Actually, this is very accurate.
- I disagree.

150
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,680
In reality, his nose
looks like a yam.

151
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:25,176
Could you go over there
and just wait for me over there?

152
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:33,558
So, you want to do, a caricature?

153
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,586
But an accurate one.

154
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,391
It's for my work.

155
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:41,061
- Oh, my God, that looks real.
- It is real.

156
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,313
Could-you provide me with a face?

157
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,732
- That, that's real?
- It's a murder victim.

158
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:49,745
Murder? Brennan, I thought

159
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,531
that your job was
mummies and cavemen.

160
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,276
- I mean, how did he die?
- She. It's a teenager.

161
00:08:56,897 --> 00:09:00,168
Someone or something
crushed her skull.

162
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:01,854
Poor thing.

163
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:05,540
Could you maybe just
put that away now?

164
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:07,713
Well, the FBI wants
to know who she is.

165
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,931
But why me?

166
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,813
I mean, we've only known
each other a month.

167
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:14,615
Well, I interacted with you
at your art exhibit

168
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,284
because I was very impressed

169
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,637
with your command
of underlying structure.

170
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,142
- You will be paid.
- I'm in.

171
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:25,522
- I'm saving to go back to Paris.
- How much do you have saved up so far?

172
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,734
Whatever you're gonna pay
for that skull, facial murder,

173
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,736
barf-making monstrosity.

174
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,946
Transcripts, interviews,
phone logs, timelines.

175
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:38,331
They dropped the body off
at the Jeffersonian this morning.

176
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,366
- What did you tell them about it?
- Nothing.

177
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:42,419
The gambler in you
checking out the players.

178
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:43,874
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

179
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,473
Don't thank me, Seeley.
Nobody wants this case anymore.

180
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,475
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,966
Traditionally, people disembarked
the elevator before reloading began.

182
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:56,178
I'm gonna take that
as an acceptance of my apology.

183
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,622
But it wasn't an acceptance.
It was an observation of social mores.

184
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:03,769
You're Dr. Brennan, right?
We met at a conference on decapitation.

185
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:07,981
Never mind.

186
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,277
Your victim was 16 years old,
biracial.

187
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,279
She died between three
and four years ago,

188
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,449
and her body was left in a landfill
for approximately one year.

189
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,284
She was born in Southern Alabama

190
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,353
but moved north
when she was eight years old.

191
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:23,455
She was injured in a pre-1998

192
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,596
automobile, no airbags,
when she was 13.

193
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,125
- What?
- I'm not done.

194
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,044
Judging by her ribcage

195
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,588
and diaphragm attachments,
she was either a swimmer,

196
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,591
a singer or an asthmatic,
or any combination thereof.

197
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,218
This preliminary sketch...

198
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,286
gives you a general idea
of what she looks like.

199
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:46,603
I'm sorry, but we've been unable
to find out her name.

200
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:50,399
Just for future reference, those

201
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,173
human remains are forensic evidence.

202
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:53,890
You should be wearing gloves.

203
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,614
I will adjust my behavior
accordingly.

204
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:02,978
- What is this?
- Just watch.

205
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,267
She bares a marked resemblance
to the sketch I gave you.

206
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,583
Gemma Harrington.
She's been dead for four years.

207
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,657
Her body was found in a landfill
3 years ago.

208
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,552
She's the murder victim?

209
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:14,850
Listen, I'm sorry.

210
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,819
- Sorry for the victim?
- Sorry for holding back her identity.

211
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:22,032
Even though my time
and expertise are extremely valuable,

212
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:23,700
I accept your decision

213
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,227
to test my abilities.

214
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:27,371
Obviously,
I passed with a lot of color.

215
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,332
- Pardon me?
- It means I did very well.

216
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,054
Right.

217
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,473
Flying colors.

218
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,380
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes. I know.

219
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,215
But passing your tests

220
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,801
suggests you have something
more important in mind.

221
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,386
I want to catch this bastard{\ bastard
who killed her}.

222
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,347
But how do you know he was a bastard?
How do you even know it was a man?

223
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,518
You know who that is?

224
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,021
Judge Myles Hasty.

225
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,802
That's a federal judge.

226
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:58,276
Well, I don't follow current events
past the industrial revolution.

227
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,738
- He killed Gemma.
- But why haven't you arrested him?

228
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,408
- I don't have enough proof.
- Then how do you know it's him?

229
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,729
I just know.

230
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,994
And I'd like to ask you
to help me to catch him.

231
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,540
- I won't do that.
- Why?

232
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,626
I will help you find out the truth,
and if the truth is that he killed her,

233
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,921
I will help you catch him.
But first the truth, then the catching.

234
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,883
Look, all I need is the kind of crap
that persuades a jury.

235
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:25,866
But it seems to me someone like you
could benefit hugely

236
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:27,848
from an association
with someone like me.

237
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,145
You're being serious.
You're serious.

238
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,695
I was just kidding.

239
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,190
You know, I was having some fun.

240
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:39,326
It is fun.

241
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:47,959
This all happened a year
before the Cleo Eller case?

242
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:49,469
Almost to the day.

243
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,538
13 months, less a week.

244
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,307
And you didn't argue?

245
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,251
Even though he withheld
information and tested you.

246
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,712
Well, my abilities were
outside his experience.

247
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,173
He called evidence crap.
And she basically

248
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,436
called you stupid.

249
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:05,676
We were feeling each other up.
Like a honeymoon period.

250
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,971
"Out".
We were feeling each other out.

251
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,182
You want to hear the rest
of that story?

252
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:15,943
<i>I only knew Hodgins slightly</i>

253
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:20,036
<i>as a very unpleasant authority
on ancient spores and insects. </i>

254
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,822
<i>But he was the one who figured out</i>

255
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:24,196
<i>that the remains were
in a landfill for a year</i>

256
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,531
<i>before being discovered.
And that wasn't all.</i>

257
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,659
I found a sliver
on the dead girl's clothing.

258
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:31,536
The term is nebulous.

259
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:35,330
Wood.
I found a splinter of wood.

260
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,083
Maple, to be exact.

261
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,336
So, your murder victim
most likely struck

262
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,421
with something made out of maple.

263
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,050
Still an observation so vague
as to approach meaninglessness.

264
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,635
Is he trying to piss me off?

265
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,846
You are always angry.
You have an anger management problem.

266
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,896
I'm in a program.

267
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,434
Supposed to snap this
every time I get angry.

268
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,019
I'd be happy to do that for you.

269
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:59,523
The victim's boyfriend was in town
the day she disappeared.

270
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:02,025
Trying out for a minor league
baseball team.

271
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,986
- Okay. So?
- What are baseball bats made of?

272
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,186
Maple?

273
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,782
Maple.
I should've thought of that.

274
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,077
I'm not so sure a baseball bat attack
would leave behind splinters.

275
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,246
Then why posit it as a weapon?

276
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,872
Doubts.

277
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:18,875
I have doubts, you see.
I am doubtful.

278
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,753
Perhaps the two of you could
design an experiment.

279
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,088
What?

280
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,422
No. Wait.

281
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,507
Work together?

282
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,954
I brought in Gemma's baseball-playing
boyfriend

283
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,434
for questioning for murder,
but I know he didn't do it.

284
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,553
- Well, how do you know?
- Why, because the killer's Judge Hasty.

285
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,047
Feeling isn't knowing.

286
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:47,996
When you know something
you can argue fact,

287
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,615
not merely make insupportable claims
in a passionate tone.

288
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,909
You said that in a passionate
tone without facts.

289
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,662
You see, when it comes down to it,
it's all about what you feel.

290
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,124
Why are you interrogating the boyfriend
if you're already convinced?

291
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:01,217
Because I want to convince you.

292
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,409
That's very kind.

293
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:06,631
Can I come in and watch you
broil the suspect?

294
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,634
Yeah, well, I could broil,
but I think you mean grill.

295
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:15,765
I fell apart after I heard
that Gemma got killed.

296
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,864
Couldn't concentrate on anything,
you know?

297
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,353
Couldn't hold it together.

298
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,857
Some people might say the result
of a guilty conscience.

299
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,698
I was in DC

300
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:28,486
to try out for a minor
league baseball team.

301
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:32,407
My dad was with me,
three of my uncles and four cousins.

302
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:36,511
I wasn't away from anybody
long enough to kill Gemma,

303
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:38,997
and transport her body
to New York City.

304
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,457
He has alibis?

305
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,501
Tell Dr. Brennan how you did
at your tryouts.

306
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:46,796
I did great.
What does that have to do with anything?

307
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,049
Your tryouts were
after Gemma was killed.

308
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,839
Yeah, but I didn't know that yet.

309
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,970
I thought everything was great.

310
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,473
I didn't fall apart until after

311
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,763
I found out Gemma was murdered.

312
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:02,396
I still dream about being there
when that happened.

313
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:06,524
About protecting her.

314
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:09,194
Psychologically consistent.

315
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,273
I'm not well-acquainted with psychology,
but anthropologically speaking,

316
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:17,014
men are programmed
to consider themselves

317
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,787
the protectors of their mates.

318
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:22,368
It was unnecessary
to put you through this again.

319
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,626
I don't mind coming and
answering questions,

320
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,059
'cause it means that you guys
are still looking.

321
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:31,264
And I want that.

322
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,563
Why are you the deliver of the blow
while I am the recipient?

323
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,346
Because you grunted
when you picked up the bat.

324
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,025
Brace yourself.

325
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,283
Excuse me.

326
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,989
Go back to work, please.

327
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,553
Conclusions thus far?

328
00:17:56,678 --> 00:17:57,701
No, nothing.

329
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,494
The bat did not leave any slivers,

330
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,202
even though the suit is more abrasive
than the cotton the victim was wearing.

331
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:07,244
A blow like that would have left behind
unmistakable bone damage.

332
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:10,797
Have you tried striking Zack
in the soft tissue or in the liver?

333
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,991
- What?
- Yeah, anatomy's really not my thing.

334
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,702
That one had some pepper!

335
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:19,266
That would most certainly

336
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,025
have caused hemorrhaging in
the liver followed by death.

337
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:23,768
Nothing.

338
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,311
The bat is so honed

339
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,573
and close-grained, it cannot be broken
on the soft tissues of a human being.

340
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:30,066
We can try striking his head.

341
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,776
What?!
Unnecessary.

342
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,193
I guess a baseball bat
was not the murder weapon.

343
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,368
I found something interesting
in the victim's X-rays.

344
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,868
The bones of the inner ear
are missing here.

345
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,834
Indicating that they may
have been extracted during the assault.

346
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,711
Did you set up the UV light source?

347
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,537
Look, I'll do it, Zack.

348
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:54,086
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

349
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:55,717
It's hard to move in this suit.

350
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,535
These bone bruisings
occurred before death.

351
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,057
Possibilities?

352
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,393
Recurring patterns.
So, either struck repeatedly

353
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,104
with the same narrow weapon,
or perhaps

354
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,023
crushed beneath some kind of grid.

355
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,250
Could you please measure
the exact distances

356
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,068
- between the bruises?
- Of course.

357
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,844
So, at 6:30 P. M.,
Gemma and her choir sang here

358
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:26,198
for a group of hoity-toits.

359
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,714
I don't know what that means.

360
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,960
Shakers and <i>machers</i> you know,

361
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,004
and influential types,
including Judge Hasty.

362
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,131
There was a reception at 9:00 P. M.

363
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,342
Gemma was seen
at the beginning of the reception

364
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,739
and then poof.

365
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:42,243
A year later, her remains were found
in a New York City landfill.

366
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,204
What are we looking for?

367
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:46,491
The source of the pattern
of bone bruising

368
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,895
that happened very shortly
before she died.

369
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,262
Regular strikes approximately
33 centimeters apart,

370
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:54,890
spanning the remains
from forehead down to mid-femur.

371
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,264
I was thinking something
made of maple.

372
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:00,615
A heavy bookcase,
scaffolding, a ladder.

373
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,495
I gotta tell you.
I really am enjoying working with you.

374
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,954
- Bones is not my name.
- Well, it's a nickname?

375
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,057
Yes, I see.
I could call you Shoes.

376
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:10,372
Shoes? Why Shoes?

377
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:12,557
Yes, because they are so very shiny.

378
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:14,337
Shoes, they're part of my uniform.

379
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,601
The FBI,
they just have a way of doing things.

380
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:20,635
Anthropologically speaking,
paramilitaristic organizations tend

381
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,515
to constrain individuality.

382
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,197
That's for sure.

383
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:26,513
But in any group,
no matter how restrictive,

384
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:29,223
the freethinkers, the mavericks,

385
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,751
the rebels with leadership quality

386
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,854
find ways to declare
their distinctiveness.

387
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,024
You know,
I'm a freethinking rogue rebel.

388
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,266
Are you seeing anyone?

389
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,907
Right to the point there, Bones?

390
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:46,916
Casually, but she doesn't
really like my hours.

391
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,252
You?

392
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:51,514
A physicist has been asking me out.

393
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,084
I was thinking of saying yes.

394
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,669
I'd ask you out if I could.

395
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:56,754
Why can't you?

396
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,595
Well, FBI rules again.

397
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:01,843
No fraternizing with other agents

398
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,384
or consultants.

399
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:04,512
That's too bad.

400
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,593
Glad you think so.

401
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,023
These stairs.

402
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,946
They're made out of maple.

403
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,146
The sliver on the victim's
clothing could have

404
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,356
come from violent contact
with stairs.

405
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,941
What about the bone bruising?

406
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,319
The hypotenuse of the triangle
formed by the riser

407
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,654
and tread looks to be

408
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,197
approximately 33 centimeters.

409
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,199
Gemma was probably trying to escape.

410
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,744
Down here and the judge...

411
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:31,706
probably dragged her
to the exit right over here.

412
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:33,416
There it is.

413
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:36,127
The killer could've driven back here

414
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,252
and taken her away
without being seen.

415
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,428
You think that Gemma Harrington
was chased by Judge Hasty?

416
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,679
He played football.

417
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,133
Then he swung her
into a wall or something?

418
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:50,266
No, no, no.

419
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,685
- The next part here shows that...
- Who's this now?

420
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,007
I'm Angela Montenegro.

421
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:56,481
I'm an artist.

422
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,857
Who are you?

423
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,817
She's a federal prosecutor.
On our side.

424
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,571
Tell her Angela possesses extremely
keen spatial awareness.

425
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,698
- And who's this now?
- That's Squint.

426
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,743
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

427
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,412
Don't bother. You know?
Never remember Squints.

428
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,665
- That's correct, and you know why?
- Why?

429
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,959
Because they get all wishy-washy and

430
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,877
flip-floppy on the witness stand.

431
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,879
So it's better
I don't remember the last time

432
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,340
they let me down
when I meet them again.

433
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,884
Here, continue
with the flip book there.

434
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:27,887
So the judge tackles Gemma...

435
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,098
You remember?
Football in college.

436
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,808
... and grabs her ankle.

437
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,352
There. All of a sudden,

438
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,313
he's got an unconscious girl.
And you know, he thinks she's dead.

439
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,820
Loads her into his car
at the bottom of the stairs,

440
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:41,891
and drives her to a landfill
in New York.

441
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:43,778
- Why was he chasing?
- Who cares why?

442
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,656
Let's see. A judge, a jury,

443
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,700
the press, and me.

444
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,869
All I need
is a warrant to arrest Judge Hasty.

445
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,214
Well, maybe if this little

446
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,791
stick figure thing
was a big computer,

447
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,751
lots of bells and whistles,

448
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,921
but right now, it just looks like
a sadistic children's book.

449
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:03,464
What's the

450
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,633
pinch-of-death grip thing
that killed the girl?

451
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,092
We don't know yet.

452
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:09,137
This won't get me a warrant.

453
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,764
I'm a lowly federal prosecutor, and

454
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,464
Hasty is a big-shot federal judge.

455
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:15,518
A hoity-toit.

456
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,005
I see what's going on here.

457
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,148
You've always wanted this office.

458
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:25,240
Tired of sitting out there
in the bullpen.

459
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:29,198
Well, I'm not committing career suicide
because you're cute and want a window.

460
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,735
We should go, yeah.

461
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,756
Listen, he is very cute.

462
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,984
I do respond to the breadth of
his shoulders and his strong jaw line.

463
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:39,167
Guys, guys, okay.

464
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,169
Caroline says
that we can't arrest the judge

465
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,848
but she doesn't say
we can't ask him a few questions.

466
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,396
Thanks so much for coming down,
Judge Hasty.

467
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:56,995
As you pointed out, if I refused,
the headline news would read:

468
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,035
"Federal Judge declines
to Cooperate in Homicide Investigation".

469
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,814
What we think is that you chased

470
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,983
Gemma Harrington,
and she fell down those stairs.

471
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,777
Okay. Way to jump right in there.

472
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,417
- She was trying to escape you.
- Why?

473
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,199
- I'm a very nice man.
- Did you use that line on her, too?

474
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,660
The only words I ever spoke to the girl
were "You have a lovely voice".

475
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,121
I said it in front
of a hundred people.

476
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,665
What did you not do in front
of a hundred people, Judge?

477
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,835
Booth is suggesting sexual
impropriety.

478
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,830
So I chased her
through the opera house.

479
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,840
That's very melodramatic.
And then what?

480
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:29,926
I pushed her down the stairs?

481
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,596
No. She was trying to get away from you,
and you tripped her, and she fell down.

482
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,099
- And she died?
- No. Those injuries didn't kill her.

483
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:40,520
You're making this all up.
And she's making you look like an idiot.

484
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:42,772
No. In fact, I am very intelligent.

485
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,968
You could have fooled me.

486
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,783
You're ridiculous.

487
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:07,353
Is this very bad?

488
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,020
I have been wanting
to do that for years.

489
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:11,955
You are so hot!

490
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:14,544
That's great! 

491
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:20,958
That woman punched a federal judge
in the nose!

492
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:21,811
Twice!

493
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:24,432
Self-defense. He was panicking.
All right, we got a right.

494
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,706
Fire her and cut all ties.

495
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,618
- With luck, Hasty sues her and not us.
- I can't do that.

496
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:32,585
She should never have been in the field.
I'm sympathetic.

497
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,298
I have let a pretty face lead me down
the path of unrighteousness.

498
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:37,636
Yours, for example.

499
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,162
Well, it's not like that.

500
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,373
Of course it is. Watching you two
together is like being at prom.

501
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,539
But it's not highschool now, Booth.

502
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,504
It's grownup time.
The beautiful scientist is fired.

503
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,674
She just doesn't know it yet.
That oversight is what

504
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,145
you must rectify.

505
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,484
My advice? Get her drunk first.

506
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:57,923
Me?

507
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:05,523
I'm trying to estimate the force needed
to cause this damage to the skull.

508
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:13,029
Alligator bites have been
measured at 2,000 pounds of force.

509
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,573
Hyenas at a thousand, sharks at 330.

510
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,550
Whatever did this damage was somewhere
between a human and a chimpanzee,

511
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:22,455
meaning approximately
250 pounds of force.

512
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,765
I just had a terrible thought.
We removed the flesh by boiling.

513
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,669
What if there were particulates on
the bone which Hodgins could identify?

514
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,382
But we're not used to dealing with
such fresh kills. We must adapt.

515
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,806
Could I help?

516
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,512
This place is huge.

517
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,598
Angela, this is my assistant,
Zack Addy.

518
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,892
Zack, this is my
friend, Angela Montenegro.

519
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,186
It's Jimmy Neutron, huh?

520
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,769
Boy scientist?

521
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:48,940
- I don't know what that means.
- Neither do I.

522
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:54,075
It occurred to me when I did
the facial reconstruction that

523
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,155
the girl's head was slammed.

524
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,825
Well, a door would have crushed
the entire side of her head, Ange.

525
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:01,748
Right, but what if it were

526
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:05,331
some kind of protuberance,
like a bolt or something?

527
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,580
- A sliding door?
- Well, I don't know.

528
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:10,586
I'm an artist. I belong in Paris.

529
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,172
What about a car trunk
with a catch and a latch?

530
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,508
How much force would a
slamming car trunk generate?

531
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:20,096
Is he doing that in his head?

532
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,348
260 force pounds, give or take.

533
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:23,599
That could fit.

534
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:25,464
I have to go meet Booth.

535
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,815
I have a little math
problem you can't solve.

536
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,488
Can God create a bigger
rock than he can roll?

537
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:38,572
Think about it.

538
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:43,446
Drink up, eh? All right?

539
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:49,750
So all we have to do
is compare the wounds

540
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,295
in the victim's skull
with the judge's cars.

541
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:56,215
Let's just stop talking about the case,
just for one moment, all right?

542
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,589
Check this out.

543
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:08,728
I am declaring my individuality.
I am going rogue.

544
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,104
You have gone rogue.

545
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,655
You can handle
your liquor very well.

546
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,445
This is nothing compared to the bang
I had to drink in India.

547
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,238
It's made of fermented cannabis.

548
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,448
Here's to bang.

549
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,810
To bang.

550
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,039
You're fired.

551
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:32,168
What?! Why?
Because I drank bang?

552
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,570
But that was in pursuit
of scholarly research.

553
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:36,802
Why am I fired?

554
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:39,050
Because you
assaulted a federal judge.

555
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,345
- You thought that was hot.
- I did. I did. It was very hot.

556
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,347
Cheers.

557
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:54,565
If we don't work together anymore,
then we could have sex.

558
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:56,275
I'll call a cab.

559
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,735
Hold on, listen.

560
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,156
Hold that cab. Listen,
I got something to confess.

561
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,527
Is it the fact that
you're a direct descendant

562
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,577
of John Wilkes Booth?
I already know that.

563
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:09,288
- Wait. How do you know that?
- From your bone structure.

564
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,415
Just keep that under your hat,
okay, for now, all right?

565
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,250
Okay.

566
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,932
What I wanted to confess was...

567
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:18,071
See, I have a gambling problem,
but I'm dealing with it.

568
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,342
Why did you feel you
had to tell me that?

569
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,651
I don't know. I just feel like...

570
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:26,514
this is going somewhere.

571
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:29,100
Why did you feel like
this is going somewhere?

572
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,216
I just... I feel like
I'm gonna kiss you.

573
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,366
You kissed?

574
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:46,242
There was tongue contact.

575
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:50,838
My book is crap.

576
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,498
That's why we wanted to come here.

577
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,709
We wanted to warn you, so you wouldn't
be barking up the wrong tree.

578
00:29:56,354 --> 00:29:57,878
How long did this affair last?

579
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:06,706
- Should we tell him?
- Yes! Yes, you should.

580
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,819
We are not spending
the night together.

581
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,411
Of course we aren't. Why?

582
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:24,584
Tequila.

583
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:27,658
Hey, hold the cab.
Hold the cab.

584
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,330
So you're afraid that when I look at you
in the morning, I'll have regrets?

585
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,784
That would never happen.

586
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:42,869
I went home and went to bed.

587
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:52,818
So did I.

588
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:10,185
We have to tell you something.

589
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,105
Zack told me how bad you felt about
boiling all the particulates.

590
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,148
- I need some coffee.
- This is coffee.

591
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,051
Thanks.

592
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:19,534
Despite the boiling, I was able to get
microscopic samples from the bones.

593
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,271
Have I mentioned how excited
I am to be working with you?

594
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:24,006
Yeah, you-you mentioned it.

595
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,008
Dr. Hodgins found
microscopic fragments

596
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,302
of steel and traces
of lubricating oil.

597
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,348
Zack and I compared manufacturer's specs
for the judge's trunk to the victim's

598
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,853
gaping head wound.

599
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:35,409
One of them matched.

600
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,790
- We got fired.
- A '56 Bel Air.

601
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:39,329
- What?
- What?

602
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:42,066
We got fired? Is this
because you slept with Booth?

603
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,360
I didn't sleep with Booth.
Why did you say that?

604
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,070
- Tequila.
- What is happening?

605
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,281
I got us fired because I punched
a judge in the schnozz.

606
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,908
I'm never gonna make it to Paris.

607
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,578
Angela, I can offer you steady
employment reconstructing

608
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,414
- ancient remains and tombs and digs.
- Really?

609
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,605
I've always wanted
to go to Paris with an artist.

610
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,253
Zack, take all of the
evidence to Booth at the FBI.

611
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,421
Then we all can go
back to our normal jobs.

612
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:09,725
You ever feel like you saw something
great that almost happened,

613
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,877
then it didn't?

614
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,892
- Are you Special Agent Booth?
- What are you?

615
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,135
The Jeffersonian, right.

616
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,152
You must be one of the Squints.

617
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,862
I'm not familiar with that term.

618
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,687
Squint. You know, you guys...

619
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,932
you squint when you look at things.
Just like that.

620
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:38,247
This is proof that Federal Judge
Myles Hasty murdered Gemma Harrington.

621
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:39,582
What proof?

622
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,820
It was immensely stupid
of you to fire us.

623
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,836
Sorry, but did you
just call me stupid?

624
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,940
I can only conclude that
you are immensely stupid.

625
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:54,017
You fired
the Jeffersonian Institution?

626
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:56,682
I don't know what
any of this stuff means.

627
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,101
Yeah, Caroline made me.

628
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,353
Dr. Bones punched the
judge right in the nose.

629
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:05,660
- They got the judge.
- They got the judge?This is good news.

630
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,274
What did I tell you?

631
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:09,270
The girl's head was smashed in

632
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:11,905
by the locking mechanism
of a '56 Bel Air.

633
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:14,825
- Here's the evidence.
- Oh, more stickman cartoons?

634
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,536
Yes, but, you can jazz it up
with computers before trial.

635
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,966
- Look at the evidence.
- If you're wrong about this,

636
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,619
my career is over.

637
00:33:21,744 --> 00:33:23,709
So, don't tell me to
look at the evidence,

638
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,378
because you know I will.
And, you, reassure me.

639
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,815
Cam and I,
we did look at the evidence,

640
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,146
and we both feel
that there is enough here to

641
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:33,385
get a warrant to search
the judge's vehicle.

642
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,634
He'd better have done this, because
irritating a federal judge...

643
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,931
very unwise.

644
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,840
A small trace of blood, any DNA
would be enough to make an arrest.

645
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,229
- You fire the Jeffersonian already?
- Of course.

646
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:46,555
- Hire her back.
- Okay.

647
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,865
And push come to shove,

648
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,506
you be ready to testify that judge
walked into a door or something.

649
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,956
I'll have your warrant in an hour.

650
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,244
So why are you still here?

651
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:04,213
You're back, baby!

652
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:06,210
You're rehired!

653
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,797
- But I've moved on.
- What is that, a monkey?

654
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,925
No, this is Ardipithecus ramidus
kadabba, the earliest known...

655
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,052
Okay, abracadabra can wait.

656
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,571
All right, we have a
warrant for the judge's car.

657
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:19,723
So, let's go. What's the matter?

658
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,850
Get your coat. Chop-chop.

659
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,937
Is something wrong?

660
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:44,745
I find I'm annoyed with you.

661
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,365
Because I fired you and hired you back?
It's the government.

662
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,679
No, because you got me drunk to fire me,
and then have sex with me.

663
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,363
No, I got myself drunk
so I could fire you,

664
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,593
and you decided
not to have sex with me,

665
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,153
which I accepted gracefully.

666
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,365
So, you're regretting that decision?

667
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,327
No. I'm not. It was a very
good decision. I stand by it.

668
00:35:02,452 --> 00:35:03,835
What's going on, Bones?

669
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,198
Do not call me Bones.

670
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:08,147
This car's been cleaned, sanded
and repainted, and the rug is new.

671
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,648
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

672
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,365
Can I have my car back?

673
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,875
I see no reason why not.

674
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,067
You've done nothing but cooperate
at every stage of this investigation.

675
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:17,951
- That's it?
- We don't have anything.

676
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,898
- My people should look at it.
- Why?

677
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:22,486
- Because we're smarter than you.
- I beg your pardon?

678
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:24,735
Do you really think brightest
go into law enforcement?

679
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,625
They go to the Jeffersonian.

680
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,502
Really? Because, the one I met couldn't
pick his nose without instruction.

681
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,730
The locking mechanism
should be removed.

682
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,450
Excuse me. You know what?

683
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:37,009
You really need to learn
how to speak to human beings.

684
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,595
I speak six languages. Two of
which you've never even heard of.

685
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,181
- You're a cold fish.
- You're a superstitious moron.

686
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,888
- Get a soul.
- Get a brain.

687
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:44,850
What?

688
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,922
I'm Agent Booth. What?

689
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,947
What is that?

690
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:51,105
- I have no idea.
- It's a stapes.

691
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,525
- It's a bone from the inner ear.
- Gemma Harrington's?

692
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,778
I have to do some tests.

693
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,905
Anyone who took science
should know that.

694
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,366
Anyone with a high school education
would figure,"Who else's could it be?"

695
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,203
Send this to the Jeffersonian.
We'll check it for DNA.

696
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:09,920
All right, you know what?
That's fine, all right. That's it.

697
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,859
Judge Hasty,
you are under arrest, pal. 

698
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:24,139
- Are you okay?
- Here, have a glass of water.

699
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:29,667
It's like... it's like
you two missed your moment.

700
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,855
And then you punished
each other for it.

701
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,214
And you know who ends
up paying the price?

702
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:36,658
Me.

703
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:38,278
I do.

704
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,447
Okay, what happened next?

705
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:44,368
The minute I had the judge
in the interrogation room,

706
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,139
he started to mess up.

707
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:49,745
Stapes.

708
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,552
It was Gemma Harrington's stapes,
of course.

709
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,295
So, we had proof she had been
killed in the trunk of his car.

710
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,175
Nice car. That's her locking.

711
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,826
We also had testimony from

712
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,134
the valet who
saw him pull in the back alley.

713
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,469
Lie upon lie.

714
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,846
Fact upon fact.

715
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,085
But I just...
I didn't know why.

716
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,225
Booth is obsessed with
why people do things.

717
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,726
What did Gemma see?

718
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,980
Why did Hasty chase her
through the back of the theater?

719
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:15,458
- But you figured it out, right?
- Not me.

720
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:17,276
Me.

721
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:21,307
I noticed the way he touched
his nose very gingerly.

722
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:28,495
Now, considering you have no motive,
I'm sure you can see

723
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,834
there's no sense in
detaining my client.

724
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,375
I know what happened.

725
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:36,847
When the prosecutor tells the
jury, they're going to believe it, too.

726
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,673
It had to be something that
would've ruined his career.

727
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,135
But also destroyed his judgment.
You've had your septum replaced.

728
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,971
What was it?
Cocaine? Crystal meth?

729
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,307
Gemma saw you snorting something.

730
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,809
He thought he killed her on the stairs,
so he went to his car.

731
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,604
She regained consciousness as
he loaded her into the truck.

732
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,189
He panicked and slammed the lid,

733
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,061
which... killed her.

734
00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:02,245
I just wanted to stop her.

735
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:04,354
Reason with her.

736
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,450
Maybe offer her a bribe.

737
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,830
- But she ran.
- That's enough, Myles.

738
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:13,290
And it was.

739
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,655
Judge Hasty will be eligible
for parole in ten years.

740
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,512
That's the story of our first case.
Orry about your book.

741
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,446
No, it's not. It's not.

742
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,850
What happened between you two?

743
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:36,730
We started to argue.

744
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,014
In front of the victim's mother.

745
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,990
I was worried that we still
didn't have enough evidence to convict.

746
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,725
I told her this was definitely
not the place to bring this up.

747
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,370
- Let go of me!
- I will, if you would just...

748
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,285
- What the hell?
- You are a bully!

749
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,162
You grab my arm just like the judge.

750
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,539
You use your badge and your
gun to intimidate people.

751
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,417
The way you use your brain to make
people around you feel stupid.

752
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,586
You are a stupid man.
I hate you.

753
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,705
You hate me.

754
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,780
Are you ten years old?
I'm not your dad.

755
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,968
- I will never work with you again.
- Who asked you?

756
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,562
- You struck him?
- I shouldn't have grabbed her.

757
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,495
We're sorry about your book.

758
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,652
Okay, this is... you...
you are totally messed up.

759
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,155
I always said that you could never kiss,
because then the dam would break.

760
00:39:27,586 --> 00:39:30,659
And now it turns out that you kissed.
Did the dam break?

761
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,255
What does that mean?

762
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,746
He still thinks
that we slept together.

763
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,915
We're not in love with each other.

764
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:42,087
It took us a year after we kissed to
be in the same room together, right?

765
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,714
Oh, absolutely.

766
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:46,075
Right. No more kissing or anything.

767
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,426
If you're not, then

768
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,013
how come you haven't been in any serious
relationships since you first met?

769
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,516
- I don't really do that.
- You know, a job, son.

770
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,657
One of you has to have the
courage to break this stalemate.

771
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,397
You. It's got to be you,
because you're the gambler.

772
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:01,789
For once,

773
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,942
make that work for you.

774
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:14,006
Something to eat?

775
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,140
- I could eat.
- Okay. Sorry about that book.

776
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:34,025
In his book, Sweets wrote that being
abandoned by my parents made me

777
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:37,480
convinced that all meaningful
relationships are doomed.

778
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,483
He wrote that I got
white knight syndrome,

779
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:42,771
because of my physically,
abusive, alcoholic father.

780
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,572
Hate psychology.

781
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,132
I'm the gambler.

782
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,588
I believe in giving this a chance.

783
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,707
Look, I want to give this a shot.

784
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,166
You mean us?

785
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:06,216
- The FBI won't let us work together.
- Don't do that. That is no reason...

786
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:13,913
- No!
- Why? Why?

787
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,556
You thought you're protecting me,
but you're the one who needs it.

788
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,979
- Protecting from what?
- From me.

789
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:22,979
I don't have your
kind of open heart.

790
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,023
Give it a chance.
That's all I'm asking.

791
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,422
You said it yourself.

792
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:28,731
The definition of insanity
is doing the same thing

793
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:31,315
over and over again and expecting
a different outcome.

794
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,116
Then let's go for a different outcome,
all right? Hear me out, all right?

795
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,909
When you talk to older couples who

796
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,895
have been in love for 30
or 40 or 50 years, all right?

797
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,206
It's always the guy
who says "I knew".

798
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,336
I knew.
Right from the beginning.

799
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:49,214
Your evidence is anecdotal.

800
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,382
I'm that guy.

801
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,634
- Bones, I'm that guy.
- I know.

802
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,864
I am not a gambler.
I'm a scientist.

803
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:01,512
I can't change.

804
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:03,425
I don't know how.

805
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,242
I don't know how.

806
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,885
Please don't look so sad.

807
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:22,952
You're right. You're right.

808
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:27,346
Can we still work together?

809
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,016
Thank you.

810
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,446
But I got to move on.

811
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,397
You know,
I got to find someone who's,

812
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,189
who's going to love me

813
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,035
in 30 years or 40 or 50.

814
00:42:55,154 --> 00:42:56,154
I know.

815
