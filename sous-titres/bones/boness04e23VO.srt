1
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:05,015
Overall, Clark is the most astute
and experienced.

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:06,517
So, hire him.

3
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:09,101
Wendell has the most potential

4
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,927
and he's next on work ethic.

5
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,887
Plus, you know,
he's somewhat normal.

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,723
That's what you like.
Vincent is the most intelligent.

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,107
Well, that's what you like,
so you should hire him.

8
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:20,061
This person's gonna be
your right hand man.

9
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,819
I've decided to take your opinion
into account as I make this decision.

10
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:25,024
Really?

11
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,935
I'm making an effort.

12
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,653
Well...

13
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:30,672
This is Sergeant Nakamura.

14
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,912
Nake, my friend Nake with the sake!

15
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:35,841
- How's it hanging?
- I'm afraid they are not hanging well.

16
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,187
- What's wrong?
- My sister has not returned my calls.

17
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:40,873
- It has been five days.
- OK, look,

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,876
We all know how overly protective
you are of Sachi.

19
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,559
- Your sister...
- You're a cop like me, Booth.

20
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,495
She calls every day.
Something's wrong.

21
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,770
- So, why are you telling me?
- 'Cause I'm in Tokyo.

22
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,428
- Sachi's here in D.C.?
- Almost two months.

23
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,931
She told me she called you.
She has not called you?

24
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,817
Just relax, all right?

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,479
21-year-old girl probably doesn't want
her brother's friend cramping her style.

26
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,771
If I fly in,
can you help me look for her?

27
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:08,067
I'll tell you what.
Just text me her information,

28
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,152
I'll track her down
and I'll make her call you.

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,770
Okay? I promise.

30
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:21,247
- Detective Frame.
- Hey, Rick, it's Booth.

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,541
Listen, I'm looking
for a little interagency cooperation.

32
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,673
- What do you need?
- Has there been any action

33
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:28,087
on a Japanese national,
legal entry named

34
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,864
Sachi Nakamura, female, age 21?

35
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,339
Give me a minute.

36
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:34,935
- When were you in Japan?
- A few years ago

37
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,668
on an exchange program
with the Tokyo police.

38
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,098
Nak's a great guy, man.

39
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,363
He and his sister,
they made me feel like family.

40
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:42,852
But he's overprotective?

41
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,724
He worries.
Every parent does.

42
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,055
But he's her brother.

43
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,316
Raised his little sister after his
parents died. That makes him a parent.

44
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,931
<i>I got a hit on your girl.</i>

45
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:54,363
<i>A car registered to her was found
abandoned near Tillbrook salt marshes.</i>

46
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,882
Salt marshes...

47
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,034
that's a pretty popular place
to dump a body, Booth.

48
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,165
Yeah.

49
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,133
- Hey, I'm Special Agent...
- Booth. Yeah.

50
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,178
Detective Frame told me to wait on you
before I had this vehicle towed.

51
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,334
- That was nice of him.
- I'm Officer Lisa Kopek.

52
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,846
Car is registered to Sachi Nakamura,

53
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:25,352
311 Ring Road, here on a work visa
from Tokyo, Japan.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,057
I printed her visa photo.

55
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,899
- This is blood on the upholstery.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,692
- Any sign of the girl?
- No.

57
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,103
- Damn.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:34,905
Checked her residence, it's empty.

59
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,858
Looks like it's been that way
a couple days.

60
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,962
Also no sign of her roommate,
Nozomi Sato.

61
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:42,328
Ms. Sato's here
on a lapsed student visa.

62
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,665
I got a request in for cadaver dogs.

63
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:51,813
Bones, what we usually do here
is wait for people in rubber boots.

64
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,109
I see something...

65
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,921
I... I just got these shoes, so...

66
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,020
What is it, a body?

67
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,492
No, it's some kind of mask.

68
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,729
Bones, come on,
get out of there, let's go.

69
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,003
What?

70
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,659
There's flesh in the mask.
Human head.

71
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,869
- Is she serious?
- Yeah, always.

72
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,159
This mask appears to be
Japanese in design.

73
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,318
Bones - Season 4 Episode 23
"The Girl in the Mask"

74
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,263
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Reborn

75
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,159
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

76
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,220
Based on the weak prominence
of thearcus superciliaris,

77
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:14,072
the victim is female.

78
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,130
The head was decapitated

79
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,046
between C5 and C6 vertebrae.

80
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,468
Judging from decomp
and discoloration,

81
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,014
I'd estimate the head was
in the pond a minimum of four days.

82
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,456
Can you confirm decapitation
as cause of death?

83
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,252
Nope, victim was in the water too long.
The blood leached out.

84
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,313
There's trace
lodged deep in the striae.

85
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,107
The blade could have transferred
particulates from the ground

86
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,784
into the wound track when
it was withdrawn from the bone.

87
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,864
Sweetie, Booth is in your office.
He's got some people with him.

88
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,032
Thanks.

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,032
Just when I thought
it couldn't get worse.

90
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,958
Bones, this here is
Sachi Nakamura's brother Ken.

91
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,880
The honor is mine, Dr. Brennan.

92
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,866
May I present to you...

93
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,684
I know.
Dr. Haru Tanaka.

94
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:06,055
The Emperor awarded
Dr. Tanaka the Grand Cordon

95
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,138
of the Order of the Rising Sun
for Dr. Tanaka's paper on

96
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,143
"Investigation of Second, Fourth "

97
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,642
and Eighth Sternal Rib End Variations
related to Age Estimation."

98
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,427
- It was brilliant.
- I am honored to meet you.

99
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,985
Everyone in the field
accepts that you are the best.

100
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,028
Yes, I know.

101
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:24,114
I told Ken and the doctor
they can aid in the investigation.

102
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:27,091
That is against protocol, Booth.

103
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,203
Bones, this could be his sister.

104
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,250
I would enjoy working
with Dr. Tanaka.

105
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:43,557
- You gonna be okay with this?
- I am fine.

106
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:46,345
There is a contact wound
inferior to the mandible,

107
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:48,722
exiting slightly anterior
to the Bregma point.

108
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,783
That would be consistent
with a gunshot wound.

109
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,860
Bones, maybe you should just
jump ahead and I.D. the victim.

110
00:05:56,638 --> 00:06:00,025
Maxilla and zygomatic
onform to her photograph.

111
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:13,282
The palate is fractured
but appears parabolic

112
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,486
with a straight suture
across the palatine bone

113
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,385
indicating that she was
a native Japanese speaker.

114
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:23,215
Did your sister have
any kind of distinctive

115
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,369
facial scarring or dental work?

116
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:29,013
When Sachi was eight, she fell
doing gymnastics; broke her jaw.

117
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,931
It was wired for two months.

118
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:34,059
Impact fracture from a fall.

119
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,173
Remodeling of the jaw suggests
that it occurred prior to puberty.

120
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:44,352
I feel comfortable identifying
the remains as your sister.

121
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,331
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

122
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,325
If you would excuse me.

123
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,305
Nak, listen, I have agents
looking for Sachi's roommate.

124
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,970
There's a chance the roommate
may have seen something.

125
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,689
Yes. Good.

126
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,896
- I'm sorry, Nak.
- You have a child.

127
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:13,121
You know it was my responsibility
to keep her safe.

128
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,809
She was 21 but still a child.

129
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:18,361
All right, come on,
let me get you back to the hotel.

130
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:20,578
- You get some rest.
- Not until we find who did this.

131
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:23,692
I hear you. But we need a lead,
something we can go on.

132
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,810
She was going to move back to Japan.

133
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:28,614
But the man who took these pictures
said he could make her a model.

134
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,976
There's something.

135
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:34,871
Right?

136
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:44,486
This is like one of those big-eyed
paintings they sell at the mall.

137
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:47,716
- The mask is based on anime design.
- Japanese animation.

138
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,482
So, someone had it out
for a cartoon character?

139
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:54,580
No, this is original, not representing
any of the well-known characters:

140
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,141
Sailor Moon, Faye Valentine, Motoko.

141
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,270
The mask could have been used
by the killer to dehumanize the victim,

142
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,315
allowing whoever
decapitated her to distance

143
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,664
himself from the ugly reality
of her death.

144
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,820
You are entering
the realm of psychology,

145
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,942
a field of unverifiable speculation.

146
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:13,017
Perhaps I can be of further help
to Dr. Brennan.

147
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,717
Sometimes I hate hard science.

148
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,541
I know that seems immature,
but that's just how I feel.

149
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,012
- So, any guesses?
- We don't have enough evidence yet.

150
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,866
No, not the case.
The doctor.

151
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,330
Dude or dudette?

152
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,120
I don't know.

153
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,178
Now, remember, Nak, this is
my investigation. You're just a tourist.

154
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:39,553
Just a tourist.

155
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,687
Micah Strutt.

156
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,648
- How can I help you?
- I'd like to ask you a few questions

157
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,969
about Sachi Nakamura
and Nozomi Sato.

158
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,072
Sure.
They were the roommates, right?

159
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,613
- Nice kids.
- When did you see them last?

160
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,824
Must be about a couple months now.

161
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,742
They came in for a shoot.

162
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,830
- "Pappa Puffs."
- Yeah.

163
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,708
- The girls worked there.
- You made them pose like this?

164
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,948
Me? No.
That was their idea.

165
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,462
They convinced their boss
to do some advertising,

166
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,673
but he went postal
when he saw the proofs.

167
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,383
That old jerk fired them for this.

168
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,181
The 21st century,
who cares about a little skin, right?

169
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,306
He does.

170
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,763
That's his sister.

171
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,999
I feel like someone slipped
something into my coffee?

172
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,698
Fashion is the way the Japanese youth
rebel against traditional social roles.

173
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,606
What is with the, "amaloli" girls?

174
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,496
I never expected to see the,
"Sweet Lolitas"here in the States.

175
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,060
The culture follows the youth.
It's just innocent role playing.

176
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,685
- Usually.
- Nak...

177
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,460
I see.

178
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,464
Excuse me.

179
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,268
- You the owner?
- Why do you ask?

180
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,393
FBI.
