1
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:06,025
<i>It's a buyer's market,
so this place is a steal.</i>

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,466
<i>And the owner's wife died,
so he's motivated.</i>

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,378
I'd be surprised if another agent
doesn't already have an offer.

4
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,304
What's that smell?

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,395
Probably the neighbors.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,549
I hear they love to barbecue.

7
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,517
It's a very friendly neighborhood.

8
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:21,395
Now, the master bedroom has been

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,109
beautifully redone,
with coffered ceilings

10
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,740
and all-new carpeting.

11
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:28,405
You ask me, it's to die for.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,170
I'm sorry, he was
supposed to clean up.

13
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:37,378
That's a foot.

14
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:38,553
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:46,443
Crap.

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,553
I thought your grandfather
lived in a nursing home.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,532
It's a retirement community, not
a prison. He can leave when he wants.

18
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,775
It's nice he wants
to stay with you for a while.

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,977
Did something happen
in the nursing home?

20
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,147
If I tell you, you're just gonna read
into it all sorts of stuff.

21
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,524
I won't.

22
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,150
He slugged a nurse.

23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,444
Male nurse.

24
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,602
Actually,
that's pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,527
Hostile, aggressive,
antisocial behavior...

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,035
He wanted to smoke
a cigar in his room.

27
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,103
A cigar?

28
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,707
- That's interesting.
- No. He's a tough guy, that's all.

29
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:24,166
Shrimp.

30
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,134
Hey, Pops.
How you doing?

31
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,094
- "Shrimp"?
- I imagine Booth used to be shorter.

32
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,052
Bring it over!
How you doing?

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm fine.
Come on over, Pops.

34
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,764
Nice place.
The ptomaine come with the food,

35
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,684
or do you have to order it
on the side?

36
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:43,853
This here's Dr. Temperance Brennan.

37
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,231
- Very nice to meet you, Mr. Booth.
- Well, you weren't kidding.

38
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,842
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

39
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,256
- You can give her hand back now.
- All right.

40
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:55,406
You can call me Hank, sweetheart.

41
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,075
- Okay, Hank.
- And who's this, a friend of Parker's?

42
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,369
No, this here is Dr. Sweets.

43
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,371
A doctor?

44
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,956
I don't think so.

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,041
- No, it is.
- It's true.

46
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,635
Where'd you get your MD,
in a Cracker Jack box?

47
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,526
So, what do you got on?
I'm ready for some action.

48
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:14,362
I figured we'd play some dominoes,

49
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:17,066
then after that, maybe go...
Sorry. Excuse me.

50
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:18,526
Sorry, Pops.

51
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,308
Yeah. OK, on our way.
Got a case.

52
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,778
- Good. I can help. I was an MP.
- No, you can't come.

53
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:28,285
I'll tell you what, why don't you
meet me back at the apartment?

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,399
All right.
All right, I'll call a cab.

55
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,850
No. Sweets here, he'll...
he'll give you a ride.

56
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,252
- Okay, Pops?
- It was nice to meet you, Hank.

57
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:36,971
- Sure.
- See ya, Pops.

58
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:37,846
Bang.

59
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,036
So, shall we go?

60
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,789
You got room on your bicycle
for my bag?

61
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:48,992
Are you sure you can handle him?

62
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,298
He must have been
in a nursing home for a reason.

63
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:53,785
Pops, he had triple-
bypass surgery about, well,

64
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,505
I'd say three months ago.
He didn't want to be on his own.

65
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,608
If he wants to be
with me now, that's cool.

66
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,092
- What if he wants to make it permanent.
- It's family.

67
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,980
Nothing trumps family,
just remember that, okay?

68
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:05,750
All right, let's go.
Open up.

69
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,025
- After you, Bones.
- Thank you.

70
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,486
This wouldn't've happened
if I had been here.

71
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,801
She told me to move out.
Said the place would look better.

72
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:16,478
Let me handle this.

73
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:19,728
I'm Katie Selnick.
I'm the real estate agent.

74
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:22,368
And this is Howard Fileman;
he's the owner of the house.

75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,746
I know that this is
a really bad time,

76
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,165
but it is a buyer's market,
so if you...

77
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,780
Show a little a compassion,
all right?

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,819
I need a list of everyone
who had access to the house.

79
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:36,991
- Including real estate agents, clients.
- That's an awfully long list.

80
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,011
You better start getting to work there.
Please stay there, thank you.

81
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,806
Whoever this was
burned to ash overnight.

82
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,237
Give me some space, please.
Back up.

83
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,643
So, nothing else burn?

84
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,144
Nothing else.

85
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,533
Maybe it was the candle
here in the cake.

86
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,768
Everyone freeze!
This hand is <i>very</i> fragile,

87
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,205
especially the phalanges.

88
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:11,709
Any motion may cause
the rest of it to just fall apart.

89
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:15,129
Okay, we're frozen now, Bones.
What can we do?

90
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:19,246
I need some kind of spray adhesive,

91
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:20,801
like hairspray?

92
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,921
- She must have some.
- I'll go get some.

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,225
It would be best if you didn't lift
your feet when you moved.

94
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,230
Careful.

95
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,963
There appear to be wounds
on this hand.

96
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:42,377
But...

97
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:46,152
we won't know what
weapon caused them

98
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:48,414
if I don't stabilize the ash.

99
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,248
- Can I move now?
- Gently.

100
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,918
What are we talking about here,
spontaneous combustion?

101
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,886
- There's no such thing.
- Electrical currents in your body,

102
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,424
they start sparking,
and then before you know it, flame on!

103
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,759
Well, that's absurd.

104
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,469
Really?
Then what happened?

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,727
I have... absolutely no idea.

106
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,770
Exactly.

107
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,589
Spontaneous combustion.

108
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,703

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==-

111
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,521
- I think Booth was on to something.
- What, spontaneous combustion?

112
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:59,042
Well, the so-called instances
of spontaneous combustion

113
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,086
can actually be explained
by a phenomenon

114
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,611
known as the "wick effect."

115
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,341
Okay, here's the classic example.
Heavy set guy

116
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,658
passes out from booze
holding a lit cigarette.

117
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,472
He drops the cigarette
onto his pajamas.

118
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,663
The fire melts his belly fat.

119
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,649
The fat soaks into the bedding,

120
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,105
creating what is essentially
a slow-burning human candle,

121
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,212
the pajamas being the wick.

122
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,632
Fat burns in, not out, which explains
why nothing else caught on fire.

123
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:26,719
Based on the position of the body,
the victim was either unconscious

124
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,262
or dead when the fire started.

125
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,034
People who die at a fire
show signs of motion,

126
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,600
trying to get away from the flames.
This person never moved.

127
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,272
Tox screen from the tissue on the foot
showed no signs of drugs or alcohol.

128
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,649
So, the victim was killed
before the fire even started.

129
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,907
- So you met Booth's granddad?
- I think Booth wants him to move in.

130
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,947
That's a big step.

131
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,399
Well, Hank raised Booth
after his father left.

132
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:52,202
- Seeley'do anything for him.
- Booth is a good man.

133
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,114
Well, well.

134
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,745
Showing a little interest
in the personal lives

135
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,172
of your coworkers there?

136
00:06:58,297 --> 00:06:59,626
No. I just meant

137
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,644
that...

138
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,591
Well, I had a... grandparent who
lived with us when I was young.

139
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,723
And yes, I am.

140
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:09,762
Too often we don't appreciate
the elderly until they're gone.

141
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,017
I just find Agent Booth's actions
to be commendable and moving.

142
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:17,436
You're moved?

143
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:20,773
Yes, I'm moved.

144
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,581
And now I'm not.

145
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,273
Based on the markers,
I say we're looking at a female.

146
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,658
The victim had Haglund's Deformity.
Very good, Dr. Edison.

147
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,173
Haglund's Deformity?

148
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:35,579
It's a bony enlargement
on the heel that's caused by wearing

149
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,164
ill-fitting high-heel shoes.

150
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,541
Judging by the micro-fractures

151
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,086
and remodeling to the tarsus
and the metatarsus, the victim

152
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,670
also had plantar fasciitis.

153
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:47,597
There were also elevated levels
of leptin in the tox screen.

154
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,427
Taken together, that means the victim
was probably obese.

155
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,730
So we have to I.D. a pile of ash

156
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,641
based on only the fact
that it's a... fat lady?

157
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,936
It's quite a challenge, I agree.

158
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,589
This orange goo

159
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:02,439
looks like melted polymers...
Can I grab a sample here?

160
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,400
Just be careful of bone fragments.

161
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,487
- So, what does he call his grandfather?
- Pops.

162
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,907
Called mine Gramps.

163
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:24,319
Agent Booth, this is Officer David
Poe, third district.

164
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:25,796
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

165
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,946
- What's up, Officer Poe?
<i>- I'm here with your grandfather, sir.</i>

166
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:30,754
- Excuse me?
- I'm fine, Seeley...

167
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,041
This cop just pinched me for nothing.
We're at Takoma Park.

168
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,873
- I think he could use a ride home.
- Well, wha... Is he hurt? Is he okay?

169
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:39,977
He was a little bit confused
and disoriented.

170
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,345
Wait a minute!

171
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,272
Seeley, I'm fine.

172
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,785
I just took a subway
to see my friend Willie Lewis.

173
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,627
I mention him to you?
We were in the 82nd together.

174
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:50,821
I remember, Pops.

175
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,103
Well, the son of a bitch
up and died on me.

176
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,368
They had the funeral three weeks ago,
and nobody even told me.

177
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,015
I took a walk to clear
my head, and...

178
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:02,101
well, I... I got turned around.

179
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:05,294
Okay, listen, listen, Pops, just...
I'm coming to get you, okay?

180
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,774
- You're working.
- It's okay, it's okay, Pop.

181
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,506
Just put me back on with the cop.

182
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:10,616
Here.

183
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,011
Hi. Mrs. Selnick.
Hold on.

184
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,070
I have a list of some of the people
who had access to the house.

185
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:18,945
Some?

186
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:21,044
I'll get more, but
I was showing a house.

187
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,460
The market is horrible;
I haven't made a sale in...

188
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,030
A woman is dead,
that doesn't bother you at all?

189
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:28,497
I know it should.
My therapist says I'm afraid to feel.

190
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,880
You really should be afraid of going
to jail for obstructing investigation.

191
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,161
I want those names by tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

192
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,931
I'm on my way, Officer Poe.
Tomorrow.

193
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:40,662
The wounds appear to be defensive,

194
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,624
but this section of hand
is too fragile to take a mold.

195
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,277
Well, I'm making a 3-D rendering,
which is essentially a virtual mold.

196
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:50,887
Booth must be cute
with his grandfather?

197
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,060
Well, his grandfather
calls him Shrimp.

198
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:55,594
Booth seems to like it,
which I don't understand.

199
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,160
Well, it's because
it makes him feel loved,

200
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,349
like when he actually was a shrimp.

201
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:02,643
So the moniker is a
sign of affection.

202
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:04,506
Very good, Brennan.

203
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,031
You never had a nickname?

204
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,775
Just what Booth calls me,
just... just Bones.

205
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,027
The orange glob of goo?

206
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,946
Polyethylene tere phthalate

207
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:18,499
Right. It's polyester.
It's a perfect wick.

208
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,771
She had to have been
wearing it when she was lit.

209
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,837
- Let me see that.
- There's not enough residue

210
00:10:22,962 --> 00:10:25,388
for it to be a coat or pajamas
or anything.

211
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,084
What about a vest?

212
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,336
Yeah. I mean, it could be.

213
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,304
I think I know this color.

214
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,360
The computer can match
the exact shade of color for us.

215
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,575
This is the Palettone color wheel.

216
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,400
When a corporation wants
to standardize their logo,

217
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,892
they have Palettone create
a color for them.

218
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,396
This particular shade of orange
is known as...

219
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,898
PriceCo Blossom Orange.

220
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,567
This is the color of the vest
the employees wear.

221
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,569
The victim worked at PriceCo.

222
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,238
I'll tell Booth.

223
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,662
Just got to make one stop, okay?

224
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,272
It's about the murder?

225
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,092
It's not gonna take long.

226
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:10,294
- You're sure you're all right?
- Will you stop asking me that.

227
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,912
You never got lost?

228
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,901
Just because I'm maturing,
people think I'm going senile.

229
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:17,342
All right, all right.
Okay, just asking.

230
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,466
You remember when I taught
you how to pitch?

231
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:23,181
- You thought I was too old then, too.
- You had the best sinker I ever saw.

232
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,643
- I could never get that one right.
- Your fastball could smoke mine.

233
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,521
Glad you're here, Pops.

234
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,289
Yeah. And don't worry.

235
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,656
If you ever need a little
privacy with the bone doctor,

236
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,613
- I'll make myself scarce.
- OK, thanks.

237
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,008
But there's nothing
going on between us.

238
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,408
- You gay?
- What? No.

239
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,744
She's a keeper.
You should listen to me.

240
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,830
I warned you about Rebecca being
a waste of time, didn't I?

241
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,665
I can take care of my own love life.

242
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,475
I don't think so.

243
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,778
Well, I got to get a book light.
Now, I won't get in your way.

244
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,003
All right, listen, Pops,
do me a favor.

245
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,373
Why don't you just stand
right here at the entrance,

246
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:05,620
right underneath this big sign, OK?
I got to go find the manager.

247
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,170
Well, go!

248
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,477
Keep America safe.

249
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,266
Don't wander off.
Stay right here.

250
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,248
Excuse me.

251
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:20,989
Where would I find electrical tape?

252
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,268
Let's see.

253
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,109
I think...

254
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,666
I think, I think I can help you find it.
This way.

255
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,274
Meg Tracy has been
AWOL since Tuesday.

256
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,255
Never called.
Not like her.

257
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,570
- Would you have an employee photo?
- Sure. Did she do something?

258
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,591
I don't want to get
dragged into anything.

259
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,513
Something may have happened to her.

260
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,999
Maybe you heard complaints about me.

261
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,834
But it's from those slackers
and deadbeats who don't do their job.

262
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,144
I keep my nose clean.

263
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,230
- The photo?
- I'll get her whole file.

264
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,564
Just leave me out of it.

265
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,942
Kitchen and bath, right down there.

266
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,274
Pops, what are you doing?
You don't work here.

267
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,625
- Why are you wearing that vest?
- Three people said

268
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,825
I was a good greeter,
so I got a vest.

269
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,910
We got to go.
Let's go. Take the vest off.

270
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,651
- My shift's not over.
- You don't... you're not on a shift.

271
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:11,790
- Will you...
- You think this is the break room?

272
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,750
- Because I'll fire you.
- Slow down.

273
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,087
This here is my grandfather, all right?
He's just a big fan of the store.

274
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,172
He's always wanted to
work here, but not today.

275
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,050
We got to get this file
back to Bones, okay? Thanks.

276
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:25,387
- I quit.
- Yeah, he... he quits. Come on.

277
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:29,531
Where would I find
fertilizer for Azaleas?

278
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:30,706
Aisle four.

279
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,634
This woman's a size four, tops.

280
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,735
She must have recently lost
a significant amount of weight.

281
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,041
Her doctor confirmed that
she had been treated for both

282
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,676
the micro-fractures we found in the foot
and the Haglund's Deformity.

283
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,960
But on her last visit with him,
she weighed 234 pounds.

284
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,285
Baby had back.

285
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,705
I'm sorry, I don't know
where that came from.

286
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,875
The doctor's X-rays of the foot
match ours. It's Meg Tracy.

287
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,751
If Meg was thin, why so much ash?

288
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,337
Because there was someone else
in bed with Meg.

289
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:02,507
Two people died in that fire.

290
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,751
Given the amount of ash and bone,

291
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,314
these remains represent
approximately 380 pounds of human.

292
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,369
We know Meg Tracy weighed about 120,
which puts our second victim

293
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,819
at 260.

294
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,946
This is part of the mental eminence.

295
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,157
Judging by the angle
of the jaw fragment,

296
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,046
- second victim was male.
- A super-sized male.

297
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:32,370
So the cake on the table
was probably his.

298
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,590
I still don't have nearly enough
to give you a face.

299
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:36,333
I'm still working
on these inorganics.

300
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,478
I'll separate the male
and female bone fragments,

301
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:40,114
see if they share any injuries.

302
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,886
We're still assembling evidence,
analyzing the bones

303
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,930
and constructing 3-D imagery.

304
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:53,631
They got lighter fluid
and presto logs over at PriceCo.

305
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,268
They could burn somebody up.

306
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,854
- There's no evidence of an accelerant.
- Yet.

307
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,750
That manager over there
that yelled at me,

308
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,758
I saw the look in her eyes.

309
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,330
I was an MP, you know.

310
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,346
This is a little bit more
complicated than

311
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,990
arresting some drunk soldiers
who just wandered off base.

312
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,406
I don't think so.

313
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,438
- Did I take these blue pills?
- Yeah, you took the yellow pills, too.

314
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:17,511
I feel like
a damn chemistry experiment.

315
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,671
They didn't have this stuff 50 years ago
and everybody was fine.

316
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:24,706
Actually, medicine has increased
life expectancy quite a bit since 1959.

317
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,758
50 years ago,
you'd probably be dead.

318
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,465
I like her.
She's real.

319
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,720
She's got balls.

320
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,806
Ovaries, actually.

321
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,933
All right,
you got a pair of steel ovaries.

322
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,951
- Thank you.
- Will you two please...

323
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:38,804
Always so proper.
Will you loosen up?

324
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,981
He's skittish
when the subject of sex comes up.

325
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,732
- I'm not.
- Maybe I didn't give him

326
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,901
enough information
when he was a kid.

327
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,864
I'll come in right now.
All right.

328
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,826
- What's going on?
- They brought in Meg Tracy's roommate

329
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,911
for questioning.
I should go talk to her. Sorry.

330
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,122
Go. We'll play dominoes later.
You'll lose.

331
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:58,813
You wish.

332
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:00,499
I love that kid.

333
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,047
I'm more proud of him
than anybody in the world.

334
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:07,990
I think he feels the same way.

335
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:10,969
He had no one else
when his father walked out.

336
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,221
He was lucky to have you.

337
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:18,594
I never had the nerve to tell him
that it was my fault.

338
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:21,224
What was?

339
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,808
Well, if I was a better man,

340
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,487
maybe I could have figured
something else out.

341
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,406
But when I saw my son
hitting Seeley,

342
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,093
beating that little kid,

343
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:35,952
that was it.

344
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,664
I said, "Get out.

345
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,851
"You don't deserve to be a father.

346
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,119
Get out!"

347
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:44,669
He never came back.

348
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:51,287
So I was left with the two boys.

349
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,907
You are a good man, Hank.

350
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,906
I didn't know what else to do.

351
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:03,021
He was beating my grandson.

352
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,153
When the time is right,

353
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:11,926
you'll tell him.

354
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,955
And if he...

355
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:17,143
if he needs it, you'll hold him.

356
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:34,024
I wondered why Meg hadn't
come back to the apartment.

357
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:35,595
I tried to call.

358
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:37,097
You're sure it's Meg?

359
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,357
I'm afraid so.

360
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,642
- How long have you been roommates?
- Three years.

361
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,662
We were weight loss buddies.

362
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,730
This year, the loser paid for
the other one to go to Hawaii.

363
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,528
Incentive, you know.

364
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:49,237
I lost.

365
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:50,360
Obviously.

366
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,861
You paid for Meg's trip?

367
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,607
Meg lost over 100 pounds.

368
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:54,800
I lost six.

369
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:57,242
How did she die?

370
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,436
Well, we're still
working on cause of death.

371
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,581
She was with a man.

372
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,223
Do you happen to know who...

373
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:10,076
Meg was dating?

374
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,291
No one special.
I would've known.

375
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:17,137
She used to meet different guys
at Club Jiggle.

376
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:18,847
Club Jiggle?

377
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:21,246
For thin people who...

378
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,061
let's say they appreciate
people my size.

379
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,709
I went myself a couple times,
but it was too freaky.

380
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,800
These skinny guys saying
they wanted to fondle my cankles

381
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,198
and eat brisket out of my navel.

382
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:34,446
Skeeved me out.

383
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,322
Brisket?

384
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:40,592
Right, that's a whole
another world, I guess.

385
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,455
Where you were
the night of the tenth?

386
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:48,626
There was a big house party.
I was there until after 2:00 a.m.

387
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,665
Can you do me a favor and just...

388
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,152
you know, write down the names

389
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:57,552
of people who could verify
that they saw you at the party there?

390
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,263
Am I a suspect?

391
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,703
You can get the second victim's
height from bone fragments?

392
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:12,082
When subjected to intense heat,
the long bones

393
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,569
warp, crack and contract
in predictable ways.

394
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,671
Based on the figures
that Clark gave me,

395
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,867
I was able to partially reconstruct
a male fibula.

396
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:26,498
The amount of bone shrinkage
from heat exposure was about 20%.

397
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,567
Which allows you to calculate height.
That's brilliant.

398
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,754
We know our victim was approximately
260 pounds.

399
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,971
Yeah, but based on the fibula,
he was five-five.

400
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:40,428
Five-five, 260.

401
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:41,826
That's a start.

402
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:43,641
I'll tell Booth.

403
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:47,750
Meg may have been participating
in a feeder and eater fetish.

404
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,225
Her roommate said the guys
at the club wanted to eat brisket

405
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,690
out of her navel.

406
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,378
That would make sense.

407
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:55,763
Fetishes are common in

408
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:58,370
all sexually repressive
societies like ours.

409
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:02,283
Yeah, feeders and eaters
are a subcategory of fat fetishism

410
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,751
that involves an obese person,
or an eater, and a feeder

411
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:08,169
that derives sexual pleasure
out of the gaining

412
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,208
and fondling of body fat.

413
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,091
That would explain the, uh,
the cake next to the bed.

414
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,713
Which I'm probably
never gonna want to eat again.

415
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,173
Hank said you love cake.

416
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,926
Well, I usually do.
Wait, are we staying on point here?

417
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,170
We were discussing cake, weren't we?

418
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,395
He's making you
grilled cheese tonight.

419
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,514
- Really?
- Yes. I'm invited.

420
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,317
How is it going
with your grandfather?

421
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,398
I know it can be very stressful

422
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,605
to be responsible
for someone who's elderly.

423
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,791
It's fine.

424
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,594
He does take a lot of medication,
so he has health issues.

425
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,347
- You have to stay on top of that.
- He took care of me when I was sick,

426
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,490
- I can take care of him.
- It's not gonna be easy

427
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,736
for him to build
a new life here at his age.

428
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,412
And he's got a history
of aggressive behavior, right?

429
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,247
If he wants to talk, I'd be happy...

430
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,114
Sorry, we were talking about murder.

431
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,117
Meg Tracy, fondling of fat.

432
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,122
Of course.

433
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:57,171
So why would Meg go back to the
club if she wasn't fat anymore?

434
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,734
Meg lived for many years
as an obese woman.

435
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:03,246
Her obsession with food is not something
that would just go away.

436
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,638
She would have to
struggle with it every day.

437
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,031
So you're saying that
she missed overeating so much

438
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,592
that she fed other people

439
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,686
in order to feed herself?

440
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:15,163
- Yes, exactly.
- So the eater became a feeder

441
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:18,001
and somehow it got her killed.

442
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,764
Pops has been making grilled cheese
for a long time.

443
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:27,353
I had these about
three times a week.

444
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:29,412
- Amazing, right?
- Very good.

445
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,165
I learned how to make these
during the Battle of Incheon.

446
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:34,584
American cheese reminded us of home.

447
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:36,085
We kept fighting.

448
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,309
Come on. Dig in, Bones.
This is real food here.

449
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:40,684
- We should get to the club, Booth.
- Bones is right.

450
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:42,800
We got a lot of people
to interrogate.

451
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,194
Sure. Amazing.

452
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:47,432
- What channel's the fishing channel on?
- 135.

453
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,475
You're out of your Coumadin, Hank.

454
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:52,863
I forgot. So many pills.

455
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:56,314
These pills are important. If you forget
to take them, you could get clots,

456
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,149
have a heart attack or a stroke.

457
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,735
- I don't think so.
- When was the last time you took them?

458
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,528
I don't know. A few days ago.

459
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,323
We have to go get this refilled.
He should take them right away.

460
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,241
I'm fine.

461
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,882
No, no. You're coming with us.

462
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:11,621
I'm gonna make sure you take them
in front of me. All right? Come on.

463
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,771
The center of the palm
has some kind of injury.

464
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:18,795
Brennan suspects it's defensive.

465
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:21,920
There was a cake next to them.
Could the injury be caused by a knife?

466
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,508
No, it's not a knife.

467
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,443
See, the markings are jagged.

468
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:28,680
It doesn't indicate
any recognizable weapon.

469
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,533
By filling in the injury, I can make
a virtual mold of the injured area.

470
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:35,561
It's a nose.

471
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,439
Killed by a nose?

472
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,212
That'd be a first.

473
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:43,240
I'll see if I can match
any possible weapons.

474
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,017
Maybe something old.

475
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:48,116
So, you took it?
Took the pill?

476
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,034
I took it. You saw me.

477
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,633
I got you a pill box

478
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:53,769
that has a compartment
for each day's pills.

479
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,290
- That way you won't forget.
- I won't forget.

480
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:59,923
- So where are we going?
- Well, we're going to go to a...

481
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:01,796
It's an unusual spot.

482
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,059
It's where...

483
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,423
- What would be the PC word for "fat"?
- There's nothing wrong with big women.

484
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,281
Your grandma had
some jam in her jelly.

485
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,947
- All right, Pop.
- Being overweight wasn't stigmatized.

486
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,751
During the middle ages in Italy,
the wealthy

487
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:17,854
and influential members of society

488
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,356
were called Popolo Grosse, meaning,

489
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,150
literally, "fat people".

490
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:24,510
Is she always like this?

491
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,738
She always has the facts, Pops.
Always.

492
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,656
Go on a game show.
You'd clean up.

493
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,118
I tell her that all the time,
but you know, she's already loaded.

494
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:36,048
She's got talent, charm,
beauty, money.

495
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,118
And you're just friends?

496
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,068
I didn't raise you very well.

497
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:13,352
- Freaky.
- Listen. We want you to stick close.

498
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:15,610
I don't want you disappearing
into one of those women.

499
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,748
They seem quite happy. They haven't seen
their blood sugar levels.

500
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,115
Hi, baby.

501
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,376
You're not with the celery stick?

502
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,323
No. I mean, yes. Yeah.

503
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,967
My body mass index
is within the accepted medical norms.

504
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,933
- You don't know what you're missing.
- All right, listen.

505
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:35,411
We're gonna go talk to the bartender.
You gonna be okay?

506
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,820
- Will you stop asking me that?
- All right. Come on.

507
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,683
- Is there a problem?
- Just want to ask you a few questions.

508
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:57,308
- You recognize this girl?
- Yeah. Meg.

509
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,706
She's been coming here for years.
She just lost a bunch weight.

510
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,561
- Guess she switched sides.
- Did you ever see her with a man,

511
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:06,462
approximately five, five,
260 pounds?

512
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,964
Is Meg all right?

513
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,006
She's dead.

514
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,467
That might help, you know,
jog your memory a little bit.

515
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:14,566
Yeah. Sure.

516
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:16,257
Let's see.

517
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,825
There was one guy.

518
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:21,811
Yes?

519
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:23,354
Glasses?

520
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,606
- I don't know. You tell us.
- Big, of course.

521
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,831
And short.

522
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:30,283
Meg bought him a bacon burger
and some cake.

523
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:32,655
The guy loved cake,
just like Meg used to.

524
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,242
She must've fed him six pieces,
devil's food.

525
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:38,244
Right. Great.
Do you got a name?

526
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,414
Sorry.

527
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:41,706
- Did he kill her?
- Well, he's dead, too.

528
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:45,431
He had a goatee.
Wait...

529
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:46,649
Hugo.

530
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,296
She called him Hugo.

531
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,007
- Hugo. Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

532
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:52,656
Sorry about Meg.

533
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,532
We should see if there are any Hugos
on the real estate agent's list.

534
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:59,395
- She hasn't given me the list yet.
- Maybe she had a reason not to.

535
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,642
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Look at that.

536
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:04,604
They like him.

537
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,064
You know, he never had
any problems with the ladies.

538
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,155
- We should get him home.
- No. Let's just...

539
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,949
give him a second there.
He's having a good time, right?

540
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:18,303
No rush.

541
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,488
Mr. Fileman,
I didn't expect to see you here.

542
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:43,100
Katie said she was gonna see you
and suggested I come along.

543
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,775
Did you bring the list of people
who had access to the house?

544
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,903
- Yes, I did.
- Right. What's he doing here?

545
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:50,316
He can't sell his house
as long as it's a crime scene.

546
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:51,982
Neither can you.

547
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,486
That was nasty.

548
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,404
- But it's true.
- Look, the bank

549
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,857
is threatening to foreclose,
like this is my fault.

550
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:00,605
I can't lose my house
before I have a chance to sell.

551
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,411
Katie said you could help.

552
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm sorry,
but it's an active crime scene.

553
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:09,596
My wife and I built
that house together.

554
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,014
After she died,
I couldn't get any work.

555
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,592
21 years as a master carpenter,
you know?

556
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:15,936
Means nothing.

557
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,712
How is that fair?

558
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,730
If you could just sign a request
for a stay of foreclosure

559
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:26,050
for unforeseen circumstances,

560
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,111
like a government investigation.

561
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,023
I brought the form, Agent Booth.

562
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,109
This isn't a very long list.

563
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,794
Not a very good market.

564
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,235
Hugo Tucker.

565
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,246
Hugo Tucker. Tucker.

566
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,742
Would he happen to have been,
overweight,

567
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,578
goatee, glasses, by any chance?

568
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:48,331
I think so.

569
00:27:48,456 --> 00:27:50,262
He looked at the house a few times.

570
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,133
- Thought he was gonna make an offer.
- I remember him.

571
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:56,882
He really loved
the custom work I'd done. Nice man.

572
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,843
Well, he's probably
the other victim.

573
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,160
Oh, God.

574
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:02,388
Is that going to delay things more?

575
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:06,309
I'll see what I can do.

576
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:13,024
I've pulled all the teeth
we found in the ashes.

577
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,855
These incisors and molars,
they match the X-rays

578
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,029
that were sent over from
Hugo's dentist.

579
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,363
So it's him.

580
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:22,450
Any markers on the fragments that
could help Angela I.D. a weapon?

581
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,952
All the bone damage I've found
so far is a result of the fire.

582
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:28,323
The heat causes
the bones to break apart

583
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:31,154
into small crescent
shapes like this.

584
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:34,244
Or they'll show a crisscross pattern

585
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:36,272
like this.

586
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,342
- Have you gone through them all?
- I'm still looking.

587
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:40,605
Excellent.

588
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:45,435
I have to say,

589
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,683
I was pleasantly surprised yesterday

590
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,686
that you felt relaxed enough
to talk about your grandfather.

591
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,022
I'm human, you know?

592
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,940
I just believe in working at work.

593
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,262
I realize that.

594
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:57,777
I love him very much.

595
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,746
But...

596
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:02,239
I should have the
discipline to keep it to myself.

597
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,578
Of course.

598
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:05,339
Then, carry on.

599
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,287
He never got to see what I became.

600
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:11,619
What I do, it's for him.

601
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,613
I'm sure he'd be very proud.

602
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,151
Go Tucker. Single.

603
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,357
Glasses and goatee.

604
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:27,293
Signed in at the open house.
I talked to his roommate.

605
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:28,695
No enemies. No debt.

606
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,597
There's no reason {\why
somebody would}to want him dead.

607
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:32,632
Jealousy.
What if Meg had a boyfriend?

608
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:36,134
- Roommate said there was no one.
- I don't like that real estate lady.

609
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,268
I thought you
didn't like to go by your gut.

610
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:40,143
I was just trying it out.

611
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,113
It's not satisfying.

612
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:43,778
Right.

613
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,412
Hank? Why is he calling you?

614
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,064
For dinner.
Tonight at 7:00.

615
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:53,749
We'll play dominoes after.

616
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,755
Tell him he doesn't have to.

617
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,254
Booth says that you
don't have to make dinner.

618
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:01,507
He says, "Shut up
and don't be late".

619
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:04,999
All right. Thanks. Bye.

620
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:08,055
He said he's going to
teach me how to kick your ass.

621
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,272
That'll be the day.
I don't think so.

622
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:13,477
I don't like that real estate agent.
What if she was sleeping with Hugo?

623
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,476
Give me that. All right?

624
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:18,941
Listen, Pops, okay?
We're trying to work here.

625
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:22,653
Not Pops, but I'm interested
to know what's going on.

626
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,457
Nothing special.

627
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:25,739
What is it?

628
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,785
So, this was melted
onto one of the bed springs.

629
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,748
- What is that?
- It's a Slim Ring.

630
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,672
One more time.
What is that?

631
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:35,595
It's a gastric banding device

632
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,564
that actually limits
the amount of food

633
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,837
a person's stomach
can hold at one time.

634
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,778
A surgical means of losing weight.

635
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,509
That's how she lost
100 pounds in such a short time.

636
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,408
- So much for will power.
- It has a serial number.

637
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,109
Exactly. I talked to the doctor

638
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,027
who did the operation.
It turns out

639
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:55,311
that the Ring was not registered
to Meg Tracy, but

640
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,481
to her roommate, Stephanie Stevens.

641
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,002
Meg used her roommate's insurance.

642
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,693
Bet Stephanie was pretty mad.

643
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,224
Especially if she wanted

644
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:06,572
to get the same procedure
herself and now couldn't.

645
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:07,990
But mad enough to kill?

646
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,367
I've seen people killed
for a lot less, believe me.

647
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,578
God.
Is he all right?

648
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:14,339
I'm on my way.

649
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:15,807
A fire in my place.

650
00:31:16,194 --> 00:31:18,292
Pops was cooking on the stove and...

651
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:25,891
Thanks.
Thanks for everything.

652
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,843
It's that stupid stove.

653
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:41,023
- Who has a stove like that?
- You left a dish towel on the stove.

654
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:42,858
I don't think so.

655
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,862
Now, you could've been hurt.
You could've been killed.

656
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:51,144
I always used
to make dinner for you.

657
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:56,664
I've done it more than
a million times.

658
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:01,142
It's that damn stove.

659
00:32:02,803 --> 00:32:03,827
All right.

660
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,259
I won't be long. I just
have to question a suspect.

661
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:18,030
I don't need
a baby-sitter, you know.

662
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:19,705
And I do mean "baby."

663
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:21,730
Why can't I stay here
with Temperance?

664
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:24,575
I have work at the lab.

665
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,819
Perhaps you can teach
Sweets to play dominoes?

666
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,612
- Great idea.
- I already know.

667
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,444
I don't think he'd have a chance.

668
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,283
You don't know who you're
messing with.

669
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,951
Bring it on, old man.

670
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,786
Those are fightin' words, pop.

671
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,454
Thanks, Sweets.

672
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:39,403
See you later, Hank.

673
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:43,839
You know, what happened to me

674
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:45,879
could have happened to anybody.

675
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:47,262
I know.

676
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,201
Just because I'm carrying
a few extra years,

677
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:53,986
doesn't mean I can't take care
of myself.

678
00:32:55,122 --> 00:32:55,972
I know.

679
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:01,881
Smart ass.

680
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:06,371
- I go first.
- All right.

681
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:11,367
I know.

682
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,491
Thanks for coming in.
He really wanted to see you.

683
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,327
Are you sure you don't need me?

684
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,038
I'll interrogate her roommate,
and if I get anything, I'll call you.

685
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,470
I'm sorry.

686
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,793
I guess he needs more
than I can give right now.

687
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,547
I should take a leave of absence.

688
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:32,580
Can you afford to do that?
You have a son to take care of, too.

689
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,796
Pops will think I don't love him.

690
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:36,813
Really?

691
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:39,938
I should go.

692
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:44,980
We know that Meg used
your insurance card for the surgery.

693
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:46,362
What?

694
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,109
- That's why I got turned down?
- You didn't know?

695
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,181
I went in for a routine checkup,

696
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:52,815
and my insurance declined payment.

697
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,185
They said I'd exceeded
my annual limit.

698
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,834
I thought it was a mistake.

699
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:58,912
That's how she lost the weight?

700
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:00,162
That bitch!

701
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,831
You're saying
that she stole your insurance card?

702
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:06,001
Well, no, I, I let her use
my card, but not for that.

703
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:09,254
She was sick. She didn't have
any insurance.

704
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,642
- You know that's a crime, right?
- Isn't it a crime

705
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,926
when your roommate screws you out
of medical coverage?

706
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,315
- You're not answering my question.
- She cheated on our bet.

707
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:20,170
I paid for her trip to Hawaii.
I can't believe this.

708
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:22,643
You were at the party
when Meg was killed, correct?

709
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,842
We talked to those people
off the list that you gave us,

710
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,413
and that was an awfully big party.

711
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,268
Enough for you to disappear,
and no one could really tell,

712
00:34:31,393 --> 00:34:33,483
if you'd gone or if you'd left.

713
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:35,128
They didn't know.

714
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,092
 You're never gonna believe me,

715
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:40,202
so now I have to pay
for a lawyer, too.

716
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:45,091
Have you found anything, Dr. Edison?

717
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:48,567
All of these bone
fragments are scarred

718
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:50,135
with markers from the fire.

719
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,006
But these two, a piece
of the parietal and occipital,

720
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,472
seem to show evidence
of being fractured.

721
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:59,346
Definitely could have been made

722
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:01,812
by the pointed object
Angela's trying to identify.

723
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,333
Look at this.

724
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:06,311
Residue along the edge
of the fracture?

725
00:35:06,907 --> 00:35:08,070
It's a resin.

726
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:17,195
Resin consists of terpenes
and phenolic compounds.

727
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
It's wood.

728
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,076
He was struck with
a weapon made out of wood.

729
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,578
Teak, to be exact.

730
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,912
The bed is teak.

731
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,999
The wounds on Megs hand
were clearly defensive

732
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,600
so she couldn't have
accidentally hit her hand.

733
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:32,400
And the blows were sufficient
to render them unconscious.

734
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:33,944
The finials.

735
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:35,397
The what?

736
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:37,903
The decorative knobs that go
on top of the posts.

737
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:39,442
They're missing.

738
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:41,618
The rest of the bed was carved,

739
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:44,280
which means the finials must
have been carved, too.

740
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,060
This is the real estate agent's

741
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,951
virtual tour of Howard's house.

742
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:53,025
Look,

743
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:54,763
we have finials.

744
00:35:57,281 --> 00:36:00,713
The reason why the image looked like
a nose is because it was a nose.

745
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:04,196
The victim was beaten
with one of these heads.

746
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,480
Wait. That's Howard Fileman,
the homeowner.

747
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,544
He said he was a master carpenter.

748
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,880
So the other one was
probably his wife.

749
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:27,684
It's a match.

750
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:30,846
So it wasn't
about who was having sex,

751
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:33,023
but about where
they were having sex.

752
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,984
He carved this bed for him and his
wife. It was a symbol.

753
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,143
Meg and Hugo both had roommates.

754
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:40,457
The house was cheaper than a hotel.

755
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:43,911
Howard catches Meg and Hugo
having sex in his bed.

756
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,410
Weird cake sex.

757
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,285
He kills them, sets the bed on fire

758
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,388
and then leaves with the busts.

759
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,140
That's so sweet.

760
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,397
And it's horrible, too.

761
00:36:56,522 --> 00:36:57,881
It's mainly horrible.

762
00:36:58,191 --> 00:37:00,500
I'll tell Booth.
Howard might still have the finials.

763
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,177
We'll pull tissue from them.

764
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,571
He'll still have them.
I guarantee it.

765
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:07,628
It's all he has left of her.

766
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:13,367
I went back to sleep in our bed.

767
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:16,554
I used to

768
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,651
stare at her face up on the bedpost

769
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:21,738
and pretend she was next to me.

770
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:25,512
But I found them.

771
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:28,502
It wasn't right.

772
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:43,343
I don't know why you got takeout.
I could have cooked dinner.

773
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,555
Right. Try this one here,
it's chicken. You'll love it.

774
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:48,780
I don't think so.

775
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,310
Doesn't look like chicken to me.

776
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:53,326
I'll try it anyway.

777
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,574
I got you a fork 'cause I know how
much you hate chopsticks, all right?

778
00:37:57,813 --> 00:37:58,813
Good job.

779
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:06,283
Listen, there's something
I gotta tell ya.

780
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:08,607
I know. This isn't chicken.

781
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:10,245
I already told you that.

782
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,874
But there's something I want
to say to you first.

783
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:22,164
I can't tell you how much it
means to me to be here with you,

784
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:24,355
to share your life.

785
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:28,111
To see what a good man
you've turned out to be.

786
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,489
Shut up, shut up.

787
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:35,395
This gooey crap isn't easy for me.

788
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,725
Now, listen,

789
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,558
I don't want you
to think I don't love ya.

790
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,387
But I've gotta go back.

791
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:50,160
What?

792
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,533
To the place.

793
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,945
They need me.

794
00:38:55,143 --> 00:38:57,751
Ronald called.
He's got no one to fish with.

795
00:38:59,394 --> 00:39:01,254
And Margaret needs my help

796
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:03,340
with the crocheting.

797
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,217
You crochet, Pops?

798
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:08,011
That's what we call sex.

799
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:12,496
And let's face it,
your appliances stink.

800
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,143
What about the orderlies?

801
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:18,287
Ah, don't worry about them.
They're used to being hit by me.

802
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,653
You're really sure that
this is what you want?

803
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,349
I already called them.

804
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:35,517
They know I'm coming.

805
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,824
Maybe you and your friends,
you can give me a ride?

806
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:53,405
You'll call, right, Pop?

807
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,864
I'll call, you'll call, we'll visit.

808
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,956
We'll be sick of each other.

809
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:01,106
I'll miss ya, Hank.

810
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:02,683
Of course you will.

811
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:05,902
Shrimp, can you give us a minute?

812
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:08,575
Sure, Pops.

813
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:13,653
You remember what I told ya.

814
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:15,135
I remember.

815
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,262
He's big and strong,

816
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,991
but he's gonna need someone.
Everyone needs someone.

817
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,207
Don't be scared.

818
00:40:24,657 --> 00:40:27,328
Scared of what?
I'm not scared of anything.

819
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,262
It all goes by so fast,

820
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:31,453
you don't want any regrets.

821
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:33,884
I don't understand.

822
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,069
Yes, you do.

823
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:41,747
Give me a hug.

824
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:47,402
It's your turn.

825
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:50,906
- What'd he say to you?
- None of your business.

826
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:55,640
Now listen.
You remember.

827
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:56,912
It's all in there.

828
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,388
Everything you need to know.

829
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:07,790
You just do what it tells ya.

830
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:11,343
I love ya, Pops.

831
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,521
I love you.

832
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:21,196
Okay, now I can't breathe!

833
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:22,778
All right.

834
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:27,563
All right then.

835
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,867
What'd he say to you?

836
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,434
Nothing. Just saying good-bye.

837
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,226
You?

838
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:43,718
Me?

839
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,184
Nothing.

840
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,753
"Be a good boy."

841
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,462
Stuff like that.

842
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:58,014
We should go.

843
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:09,009
- I like that thing around your neck.
- What?

844
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:12,275
That thing that you're wearing
around your neck. It looks really good.

845
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,777
You've seen it before.

846
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,545
I don't think so.

847
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,618
Thanks.

848
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,850
Sure.

849
