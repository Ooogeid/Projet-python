1
00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:03,628
Give everything, my darling.
Everything.

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,921
Utter dross
to upper-class gloss, all right?

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,840
Keep her lit.
Keep her bathed in the glow.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,092
All, right, yes. Okay, good.
Now, look up.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,428
All right. Yes.
Nice. Okay.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,764
Right in front of you, that's it.
That's the future.

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:15,765
Yes, OK.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,060
- What the hell is that?
- Pigeons or blackbirds or crows.

9
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,145
- Something along those lines.
- Telephoto.

10
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:22,688
God, he has an idea.

11
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,534
This is what we need.

12
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:27,276
Caw, caw, yeah, flap, flap.
Flap, yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,380
Give me more, yes.
Aviary. Wings. Yes, beaks.

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,659
Those creatures, they are death.

15
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:38,037
Flap your arms. Chase death away
but remain beautiful. You understand?

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,039
Running through a vacant lot

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,750
at a bunch of birds
in six-inch heels...

18
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:46,019
That's it. Good, good, good!
You're a leopard. Leap!

19
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:47,338
You're an angel!

20
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,216
Oh, yes, beautiful!
Beautiful. Terror, fear!

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,023
Gaze heavenward. Look at the beastly
birds, my darling. Look up!

22
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,513
I love it, yes.
Gaze heavenward, darling.

23
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,273
Look up at the beastly birds!

24
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:12,530
So, what's it look like to you?

25
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:13,824
An ear.

26
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,158
- Did you just make a joke?
- No.

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,203
- 'Cause that wouldn't be like you.
- I didn't. It looks like an ear.

28
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:23,499
- And this stuff in the blue bag there?
- Looks like chili con carne.

29
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,350
Could this be the rest of the person
who lost the ear?

30
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,630
I don't know.
It looks like chili con carne.

31
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,588
There's no single piece here bigger
than the skull of an Australopithecus.

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,053
Sports terms, Bones.
Remember, we talked about this.

33
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,246
Softball. Good. You're getting better.
The size of a softball.

34
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:44,311
At first guess,
the total mass in this garbage bag

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,355
does not add up
to an entire human being.

36
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,623
Right, so I'll just get forensics
to scour the entire lot.

37
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:50,609
Yes.

38
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,405
Would you even want to guess
what happened to this human being?

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,242
- No.
- I knew you'd say that. I had to ask.

40
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,369
All right, let's scour it up!

41
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,170
I've been a pathologist for 13 years
and I admit,

42
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,438
I am a little nauseated.

43
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,198
It's going to fall to me
to empty these bags, isn't it?

44
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,912
All right, then.
Fine.

45
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,994
I may need a pot of tea waiting.

46
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,733
Maggots place time of death

47
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,518
somewhere between 48 and 72 hours.

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,562
I'm going to go
with the wood chipper on this.

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,330
In that case,
it was a gold wood chipper.

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,803
This looks like gold.

51
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:33,857
The ancient Sumerians were prone
to spreading gold dust

52
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,780
over the body during funeral rites.

53
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,783
Did the Sumerians chop up
the body into little, tiny bits first?

54
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,401
- Not to my knowledge.
- What is this?

55
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:44,823
- A black pearl?
- Pearls,

56
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,492
symbolizing eggs
or rebirth and resurrection,

57
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:50,044
were used in many
South Seas funeral rites.

58
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,755
Did they chop up the bodies
into little tiny bits first?

59
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,761
I've begun to apprehend
your point, Dr. Saroyan.

60
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,972
Find out how many corpses
we're dealing with.

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,184
I'll find out if these are really
gold flecks and pearl fragments.

62
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:21,325
Celibacy is a lot like fasting.

63
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,329
So, you've become sexually anorexic?

64
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:27,354
At first, you're out of sorts
and agitated, and then you sort of...

65
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,876
push through to a kind of clarity.

66
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:31,627
Have you reached clarity?

67
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,672
No, I'm still at the agitated
and horny stage.

68
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:37,007
Why are you fasting sexually?

69
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,943
Sweets thinks it will do me good
to put sex on the back burner

70
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,618
in order to relate
to people in other...

71
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,466
Why are you listening to Sweets?

72
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,357
Angela? I asked,
why are you listening to Sweets?

73
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,235
Sweetie, can you pay for this?
I have to go.

74
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:57,778
Sure. Why?

75
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:00,228
I have to save Hodgins' life.

76
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:06,087
I found something interesting
on the cellular level.

77
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,080
I don't care
about the cellular level.

78
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,450
- No hemorrhagic tissue.
- What?

79
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,678
Means the victim was dead
before being chopped up.

80
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:15,336
- You care about that, right?
- No, not really. What I'm interested in

81
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,511
- is how this guy got chopped up.
- Now, this here

82
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:21,343
shows that the cell burst
from the inside out.

83
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:22,876
Gives me nothing.

84
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,388
- Frostbite can do that.
- Like climbing a mountain?

85
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:26,663
Yes. Exactly.

86
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,818
The water in the cells
crystallizes and explodes.

87
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:33,147
I have got an absolutely
fascinating clue to tell you.

88
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,441
Hey, you have to leave town.

89
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,732
- What? Why?
- No, fascinating clue first.

90
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,269
The pearl we found
in the victim wasn't a pearl.

91
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:42,573
- Why do I have to leave town?
- My father is here.

92
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,700
- What was it then?
- Carbonaceous chondrite.

93
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,579
It's what meteorites are made of.
Your father blames me for our break up?

94
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,308
Well, he has sort of a blind spot
when it comes to me.

95
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,335
I think you should just get out of town
until I can call him off.

96
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,855
Stop. Okay, stop it.

97
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,880
- What about the dead guy?
- It's obvious.

98
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:01,086
He was frostbitten while climbing
Everest, then struck by a meteor,

99
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,928
then dumped into a vacant lot
in 2 garbage bags, and eaten by crows.

100
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,437
All right, obvious.
That's so obvious.

101
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,962
Hey, it's a start.

102
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:13,228
Bones - Season 4 Episode 19
"The Science in the Physicist"

103
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:16,231
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Reborn

104
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,879
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

105
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,653
The slowest meteorites

106
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,786
travel at 25,000 miles per hour.

107
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm not just spouting useless facts.

108
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,380
You do not have a chance
of recreating those velocities with

109
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:52,994
a glorified blow gun.

110
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,604
You simply want to fire
a cannon at a dummy.

111
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:58,232
You staying or going?

112
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,236
Another set of eyes and ears
taking note can never be amiss.

113
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:16,458
What possible information
could this experiment

114
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,011
provide us that you couldn't get
mathematically?

115
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,730
Mathematics is theory.

116
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:22,840
This is a real world recreation.

117
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,426
In order to prove what, exactly?

118
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,505
That a, frozen person,

119
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,934
struck by a meteorite,
would turn into chili con carne.

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,237
NASA has no record of

121
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,918
a meteorite of this size and type

122
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,400
striking North America
at the time of death.

123
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:45,446
According to NASA, a meteorite
matching these characteristics

124
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,156
is right here in DC.

125
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:53,108
- I'm all set up and everything.
- Your experiment is not pertinent.

126
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,225
So, you found out
where the meteor came from?

127
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,672
- From the solar nebula.
- OK. Anything more current than that?

128
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:08,385
Fire in the hole!

129
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,234
What the hell was that?

130
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:18,479
We're okay.

131
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,375
Everything's fine.

132
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,913
We should get out of here
before lockdown.

133
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,238
- Let Cam deal with it.
- Yeah...

134
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,241
You know you're grounded, right?

135
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:37,997
So you think the piece of meteor
we found in the murder victim

136
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,793
- came from this?
- Yeah, it's an exact match.

137
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,921
The silicate oxide ratios
are indistinguishable.

138
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,510
- You've heard of Landis Collar, right?
- Sure I have.

139
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:52,019
Blind guy, world's leading expert
in superconductivity.

140
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:56,096
- Do you know what superconductivity is?
- It's better than normal conductivity.

141
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,673
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan,

142
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,901
I'm Christopher Beaudette,
Senior Scholar here at the Collar.

143
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,476
- Shall we?
- Yes.

144
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,071
So you work in superconductivity?

145
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,970
No, Agent Booth,
I'm doing research into

146
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:11,824
generating power from earthquakes.

147
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,207
Groundbreaking.

148
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,009
That was a funny joke.

149
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:17,456
Yeah, and one I've never,
ever heard before.

150
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,225
Are these people here
smarter than you?

151
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,331
That would depend upon how
one defines intelligence.

152
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,810
I'm Landis Collar.
Thank you, Christopher.

153
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:25,935
Landis.

154
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,841
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth,
this here is...

155
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,384
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

156
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,885
Is that clicking noise attached
to your blindness, Dr. Collar?

157
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,639
Yes. It's a protype.

158
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:37,853
Sonic echo-locator.

159
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:40,260
It allows me to...

160
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,857
... apprehend my surroundings.

161
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,005
Have you forgiven me?

162
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,318
Forgiven him?

163
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,486
I was turned down for a fellowship
here at the Institute.

164
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,698
No, no, that is not true.

165
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,535
Your anthropological research
was rejected,

166
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,859
because it looked at the past,
not the future.

167
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,957
Ad aeterno.
Ad gloriam. Ad posterus.

168
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:05,127
To eternity. To glory.
To the future.

169
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,213
Right. Then why say your motto
in a dead, ancient language?

170
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,801
How can I help you?

171
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,584
This...
Well, put your hand out, I'll...

172
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:18,209
- What Agent Booth has given you...
- I know what it is.

173
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,392
It's a piece of my meteorite.

174
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:24,521
- That's impressive for a blind man.
- I know 'cause I had it made for Diane.

175
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,764
Dr. Diane Sidman, my fiancée.

176
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,944
The meteorite was set
in her engagement ring.

177
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,946
That would explain the gold flecks.

178
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,366
- What's happened? Is Diane all right?
- When was the last time you, saw her?

179
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,631
A few days ago.
She was ill, which is understandable,

180
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:40,367
considering the pressure
she's under.

181
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,158
- Pressure?
- She's Editor in Chief

182
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,787
of the Collar Journal,
perhaps the most important venue

183
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:47,502
for scientific publishing in the world.
Please, what has happened?

184
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:51,748
We have discovered some human remains,
which contained...

185
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,594
what is most certainly
your fiancée's engagement ring.

186
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,202
We'd like to talk to anyone
who may have interacted

187
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,736
with her before she disappeared

188
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,672
You must speak
with Diane's students.

189
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,410
Chief amongst them,
Jennifer Keating and Milton Alvaredo.

190
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,959
I'll have Dr. Beaudette
bring them to you.

191
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,891
If you need anything else,
I'll be in my office.

192
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:28,350
My God, Dr. Sidman is dead?

193
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:31,396
We have not yet made
a positive identification.

194
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,590
When was the last time you saw her?

195
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,469
I suffer from a kind
of chronological dyslexia, which

196
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,859
makes it very difficult for me
to place discreet events

197
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,019
accurately on a linear timeline.

198
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,164
This one's all yours.

199
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,141
What exactly are you working on?

200
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:49,183
I'm endeavoring to find a way
to transmit single cell organisms,

201
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,991
using common pond scum,
from one location to another.

202
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,343
You ever try a spoon?

203
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:56,306
I've had some success vibrating two
separate samples of single cell scum

204
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,492
in complete symmetry
on a quantum level.

205
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,916
That's very impressive.

206
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,182
- You wouldn't understand.
- Of course I do. "Beam me up, Scotty."

207
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,408
Very good, yes.
Exactly.

208
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,417
Dr. Sidman must have been eager
to publish that in the Journal.

209
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,086
Very excited, yes.
Pending a few questions.

210
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,768
- Is this publishing thing important?
- Publish or perish.

211
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,049
- I mean, is it motive?
- For murder you mean?

212
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,642
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

213
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,403
But only on the level of vengeance.

214
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,873
Killing her would not reverse
the decision unless of course

215
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:24,308
the person who killed her
wanted to take over her position.

216
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:29,434
I last saw Diane when Jennifer asked us
to stop arguing so loudly.

217
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,706
Jennifer Keating?

218
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,691
- Dr. Sidman's other grad student?
- Yes.

219
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,825
Jenny works
in cosmogenic isotope research.

220
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,600
It can make her cranky.

221
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,193
This place is making me cranky.

222
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:47,302
I asked Milton to quiet down,
not Diane.

223
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:50,372
I would never get mad at Diane.

224
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,543
Why?

225
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:55,811
- She's Editor in Chief of the Journal.
- Publish or perish, right?

226
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,593
- What were they arguing about?
- No idea. Could've been about anything.

227
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,602
Landis encourages
a free exchange of ideas and...

228
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,222
it can get pretty intense.

229
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,933
You specialize
in cosmogenic isotope research?

230
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,280
Cosmogenic?

231
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,064
It's a new way of dating artifacts
using 14C isotopes.

232
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,649
Through accelerated mass
spectroscopy.

233
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,651
That'd make me cranky, too.

234
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,113
I can't imagine that your project
excited Diane Sidman.

235
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,781
"Vene, vidi, vici."
Look to the future.

236
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,203
Carbon dating is all about the past.

237
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:27,537
You're right.

238
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,889
There was no way
she was going to publish me.

239
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,960
This time next year,
I'll be looking for post-graduate work.

240
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,921
Is that the last time you saw Diane?

241
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,589
Yes, three days ago.

242
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:39,883
Why? Is something wrong?

243
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,260
It is possible that she is dead.

244
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:49,468
Bones account for approximately 15%

245
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,144
of the mass of a human being.

246
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,165
Given that
the total bone mass here comes to,

247
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,682
8.9 kilograms, that would suggest
a human being who weighed

248
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,049
approximately...

249
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:02,859
59.3333 kilograms.

250
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:04,504
131 pounds.

251
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:07,202
Well, it matches the victim's stats.

252
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,059
It's Diane Sidman all right.
Dr. Saroyan got DNA confirmation.

253
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:16,669
There are no other particulates outside
of the gold flecks and meteorite.

254
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,294
What did I tell you?

255
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:29,026
That we aren't allowed in the same room
without supervision.

256
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:30,392
Why?

257
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,773
Because we were stupid enough
to fire a cannon indoors.

258
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:37,899
And?

259
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,029
You're here,
which comes for supervision, so...

260
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:44,489
I'll leave.

261
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,580
There's a deep pitting
in these bones,

262
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,708
which may or may not be connected
to the fractures.

263
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,103
Also, I excluded wood chipper
as a possibility.

264
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,588
- How?
- Whirling blades

265
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,674
would create parallel
and evenly spaced fractures.

266
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:06,289
These patterns appear to be
completely random.

267
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,599
Even more puzzling,
they are unusually clean.

268
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,231
What if the cellular damage
and the fractures

269
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,356
were caused by the same thing?

270
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:18,231
The cells

271
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:21,418
could have burst as a result
of ice microcrystals

272
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:24,112
having formed if the body
was rapidly frozen.

273
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,907
You mean freeze the body
and then shatter the bones?

274
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:29,409
Liquid nitron?

275
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:37,417
You have my permission to confer
with Dr. Hodgins on the subject.

276
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,214
In the same room? Yes?
Just to be clear.

277
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,174
Any damages come out of your pay.

278
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,348
As requested: Diane's work area.

279
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,726
Looks like somebody cleaned it out.

280
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,313
No, Booth, Dr. Sidman
was a theoretical physicist.

281
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,067
She didn't do experiments, she figured
everything out through equations.

282
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,404
Diane was a member
of the Large Hadron Collider team.

283
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,406
Isn't that thing in Europe
that's going to create a black hole

284
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,033
and end the universe?

285
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:13,264
There's only a very small chance
of that actually occurring.

286
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,580
And yet, Diane received
a number of death threats.

287
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:18,833
Diane Sidman's role was important
to the Large Hadron Collider Team?

288
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,294
The effort to find the Higgs-Boson
will be set back months.

289
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,838
- The God particle?
- What that's?

290
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,883
A theoretical particle which explains
why matter has mass.

291
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,096
Mass and matter aren't the same?
Don't look at each other like that.

292
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,259
Neither one of you know
how to make your own beer.

293
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:36,163
You realize you just said "don't look
at each other" to a blind man?

294
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,503
Do you have records of threats
made against her?

295
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:42,026
Yes, ever since one of our scientists
was attacked for his work in cloning.

296
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,831
Milton Alvaredo suggested
that we look at whoever

297
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:47,779
was going to replace
Diane Sidman as Editor in Chief.

298
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,032
That would be the Senior Scholar,
Christopher Beaudette.

299
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,453
You can understand
how that makes him a suspect.

300
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,948
I'll tell Sweets to look into threats
and see if they're worth following up.

301
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,944
If it matters, Diane and Christopher

302
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,626
were also enjoying
a sexual relationship.

303
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:05,630
If it matters?
I thought you were going to marry her.

304
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,920
At which time, by mutual agreement,

305
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:11,011
Diane and Christopher's sexual
relationship was to cease.

306
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,052
- Completely rational.
- Except for the completely insane part

307
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:17,142
where somebody killed Diane Sidman.

308
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:22,796
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

309
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,496
My opinion, it's a good thing
they didn't accept you at that place.

310
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:28,236
- Why?
- It's creepy. Everyone there is creepy.

311
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:31,281
If you think they're creepy,
then you must think I'm creepy.

312
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,908
You have a creepy mode, Bones.

313
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,161
Very interesting man.

314
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,508
Highly self-aware.
Major league smarty-pants.

315
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,543
Right, little brain checks in,
the big brain checks out.

316
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,963
I don't know what that means...
little brain, big brain.

317
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:51,114
He freely admits that he had an ongoing
sexual relationship with the victim.

318
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,597
- That little brain.
- But...

319
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,267
he denies ever having been
"in love" with her.

320
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,380
- What's with the hooked fingers?
- Well, he said "in love"

321
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:05,042
very sarcastically.
Like it was something that happened to

322
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,859
- "lower primates."
- OK, who else was he sleeping with?

323
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,779
- I didn't ask.
- Why does that matter?

324
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,815
Because maybe not everybody is so,
you know,

325
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:17,567
"adult," you know, or "rational."

326
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:20,563
Or, "clear thinking."

327
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:23,333
Or "heartless" as him.

328
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:29,242
That was a lot of quotation marks.

329
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:38,428
So, sexual relationships
are pretty casual over there

330
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:39,808
at the Collar Institute?

331
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,769
We're young, close quarters,
we stimulate each other.

332
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:46,120
- Who else were you sleeping with?
- Jennifer.

333
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,982
Who was also seeing Milton.

334
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,902
So, is it possible
that Jennifer was trying

335
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,529
to get rid of a romantic rival?

336
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,970
By that retrograde
manner of thought,

337
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,283
Landis could have killed Diane
for sleeping with me

338
00:17:57,863 --> 00:18:00,995
or I could have killed Diane
for sleeping with Landis or...

339
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,582
Milton could have killed Diane
for sleeping with me and Landis.

340
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:15,969
Ladies and gentlemen,

341
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:18,118
what I propose
to show you today is how

342
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:21,943
our victim's skeletal structure
came to shatter into tiny bits.

343
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,285
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

344
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,345
He enjoys this way too much.

345
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:32,067
Basically Hodgins
is himself his Dr Nemo.

346
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,947
Liquid nitrogen
freezes at 63 degrees Kelvin,

347
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,018
which is minus 210 degrees Celsius

348
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,730
or minus 346 degrees Fahrenheit.

349
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:45,039
It's unnecessary to say
"degrees Celsius." It's implicit.

350
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,544
When I drop
this supercooled turkey...

351
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,255
Once again,
technically not "supercooled."

352
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:56,783
... it'll shatter into hundreds of bits
on the concrete floor.

353
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,934
Shards are gonna fly
in every direction, so...

354
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,059
Ready?

355
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:01,306
Three...

356
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:02,766
two...

357
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:04,981
one!

358
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,195
It's just a glancing blow.

359
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:31,294
I'm Dr. Lance Sweets. I work for the FBI
as a psychological profiler.

360
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,006
- Psychiatrist or psychologist?
- He's just a psychologist.

361
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:40,242
The point is, I looked
through over 800

362
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,472
threats made against Dr. Sidman.

363
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:45,767
You, Dr. Mullins, are the only person
I thought merited questioning.

364
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,435
Using psychology?

365
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,347
That's correct.

366
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,564
You might as well have
picked my name from a hat.

367
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,016
Normally, I'd agree.

368
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:56,638
But your disapproval
of Dr. Sidman's work

369
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,863
makes me wonder
if you're a religious fanatic.

370
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,979
No. Like most reasonable
human beings,

371
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:04,410
I'm an agnostic.

372
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:07,915
You have a doctorate
in physics from Princeton, right?

373
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,500
Yet you work as a welder.

374
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,305
Welding is a real job.

375
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,118
Unlike psychology.

376
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,054
How can a reasonable
human being with

377
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,395
a physics degree honestly believe

378
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,436
that a particle accelerator in Europe
is going to create a black hole

379
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:26,599
which will destroy the solar system?

380
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,227
Would you like a list of Nobel
Laureates who agree with me?

381
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,805
The odds are one in 50 million.
Slight, I admit.

382
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,470
Too high when you consider
the loss of not only humanity,

383
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:38,485
but the only planet in the
cosmos that we know for certain

384
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,322
is capable of generating
and sustaining life.

385
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:48,400
I hate to say it,
but I'm totally with him on this one.

386
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,455
Would you kill someone
on 50 million to one odds?

387
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,000
Kill someone? Who's dead?

388
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,045
Diane Sidman.

389
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,757
Of the 800 threats I studied,
106 of them were from you.

390
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,855
Evidence indicates that
Diane Sidman was frozen

391
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,264
using liquid nitrogen
after she was killed.

392
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,895
Then her body
was dropped and shattered.

393
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Ridiculous. A frozen
cadaver would simply bounce.

394
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:14,105
Any moron should know that.

395
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,253
The point is, as a welder you
have access to liquid nitrogen.

396
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:21,946
My IQ is 162.

397
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:23,758
What about it?

398
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,659
I'm smart enough to know when
to shut up and ask for a lawyer.

399
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,454
Except I've got
one last thing to say.

400
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,830
Knowing that Diane Sidman is dead,

401
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:35,827
I'm going to sleep
about 50 million times

402
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:37,632
better tonight.

403
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:45,195
I got here as soon as I could.
What's up?

404
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,175
Lab results from the CBC
and biopsy on our victim.

405
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,016
Abnormal proliferation

406
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,144
of leukocytes in the thoracic
and lumbar bone marrow.

407
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,147
- These numbers are fatal.
- She died of leukemia?

408
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:58,895
Diane Sidman had a full
physical two weeks ago.

409
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,118
Guess what?

410
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,736
Clean bill of health.

411
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,981
How does a perfectly healthy
young woman develope

412
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,450
advanced leukemia in two weeks?

413
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,169
Leukemia doesn't just appear
in two weeks.

414
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,490
What about radiation?

415
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:22,511
There's got to be some source
of radiation that could cause cancer.

416
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:25,059
Someone accidentally
irradiates this poor woman, and then,

417
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:28,801
covers it up by freezing her and then
smashing her remains into little...

418
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:29,681
bits.

419
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,642
You know, ironically, intelligent people
have been known to commit murders

420
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,960
in ludicrously complicated ways,

421
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:37,188
virtually ensuring their capture.

422
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,065
Isn't that...

423
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:41,985
It's Angela's dad.

424
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:46,906
It's not uncommon for men

425
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,354
to fear their lover's male parent.

426
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,045
You know what creeps me out?

427
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,497
The way
that English people say "lover."

428
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,292
You know, attacking Vincent like that
indicates that what he said is true.

429
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,379
The man is from Texas.

430
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,381
He told me that if I messed up...

431
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,644
I don't remember
what he said exactly, but

432
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,605
but he mentioned the key,"G Demolish,"
and it sounded pretty bad.

433
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,435
The blues is known as
the Devil's music

434
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,965
because those most adept are thought
to have made a pact with the Devil,

435
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,894
and thus fear no earthly law

436
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:20,232
because they're already
doomed to eternity in hell.

437
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:23,776
Harsh.

438
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,872
Thank you.

439
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:27,293
I feel much better now.

440
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:31,034
I happen to have a great deal of insight
into the whole blues culture.

441
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,617
I could talk to him for you.

442
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,742
Yeah, thanks, but... too late.

443
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,870
Have you found something?

444
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,120
The posterior of the T-seven.

445
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,387
It looks very smooth.

446
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,308
This indentation could very
well be the result of a tumor.

447
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,061
The possible source
of Diane Sidman's leukemia.

448
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,857
A tumor this size, over two weeks,

449
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,177
would require a radiation source

450
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:05,610
of between 1,000 and 5,000 REMs.

451
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,737
And that would have
burned the victim.

452
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,448
It must have been a
steady exposure over time.

453
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,560
The woman spent almost
all her time at work.

454
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,305
- Everything's coming up clean.
- Nothing?

455
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,430
Nope.

456
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,924
There should still be some
evidence of radioactivity.

457
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,738
There is nothing
radioactive in this room.

458
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:36,265
God I already stinks.

459
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,975
Hot suits.

460
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:40,365
What?

461
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,360
Right there.
What are you doing, Bones?

462
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,069
Well, this stain here must have hit
Diane Sidman almost

463
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:54,741
exactly where the tumor formed.

464
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,619
You're testing me
on the cancer chair?

465
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,872
Well, you're wearing a suit.
Plus, it's not radioactive anymore.

466
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,751
We're going to need
to take this chair.

467
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:05,002
No! You don't just go around
doing human testing on people, Bones.

468
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,964
I got to go to the bathroom.

469
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,150
Well, I touched it
with my bare hands.

470
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:12,794
See?

471
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,687
You may be wondering why
I'm going through these bones again.

472
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,231
Probably because
you feel bad that Dr. Brennan

473
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,244
found evidence
of a tumor that you missed.

474
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,619
The average chocolate bar
has eight insect legs in it.

475
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:35,256
So, she said hopefully, metaphorically,
you're looking for insect legs?

476
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,160
And I may have found some.

477
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:40,791
These cylindrical notches
on the left clavicle.

478
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
See?

479
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,925
- Two of them, yes.
- They may be stab wounds.

480
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,925
Okay. We'll have Dr. Hodgins check
them for microscopic particulates.

481
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,500
If he hasn't lit out
for Timbuktu yet.

482
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,145
The discoloration in the fabric
was not radioactive,

483
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,184
but because of your suspicion,
I tested for daughter isotopes.

484
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,008
Daughter isotopes?

485
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:07,128
Daughter isotopes are what's left behind
after radioactive isotopes decay.

486
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:10,975
So, there was a radioactive
isotope on Diane Sidman's chair.

487
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,665
Yeah, a strong one.

488
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,822
Is anyone at that place
doing cancer research?

489
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,595
No, it's not that kind of place.

490
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,770
Yeah, right.

491
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,245
"To eternity, to glory,
to the future."

492
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,331
You disapprove
of the Collar Institute?

493
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,705
Up and forward
are only two directions.

494
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,135
Science should look
in all directions.

495
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,711
You taught me that.

496
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:30,630
I did?

497
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,923
Every day.

498
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,250
Thank you.

499
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,910
- Hold on. Just get the door.
- What?

500
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,165
Get the door.

501
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,690
- Open it.
- Now?

502
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:57,448
You got to be kidding me.

503
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,474
You know, it's like Club
Med Mensa around here.

504
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,349
What are you laughing at?

505
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,509
You know, most people... you bust in
on them having sex with a gun, you know.

506
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,445
It kind of disrupts the mood.

507
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,320
Perhaps they decided to start
all over again from the beginning.

508
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,565
It's just sex, Booth.

509
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,642
It's not that.
Look, I'm not a prude.

510
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,144
Well, you have
what they would call hang-ups.

511
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:32,275
- You know that guy, Landis?
- Yes.

512
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,322
- He's about to make a move on you.
- How do you know?

513
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,716
Because it is the rational
and smart thing to do,

514
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:39,591
and he is all about that.

515
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,162
- And I see how he looks at you.
- How he looks at me? He's blind.

516
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,640
That's too literal.

517
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,208
His fiancée was just murdered,
and he's already moving on.

518
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,315
Well, she's gone.
He has accepted it.

519
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,256
Look, good people,
they leave marks on each other.

520
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,924
The least we could do is let them
fade away naturally, not,

521
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,139
you know, scrape them off
or paint over them with new marks.

522
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,290
So, you're not a prude?

523
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:06,392
Moi?

524
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:09,005
I am a very fun and...

525
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:11,689
very sexy guy.

526
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,006
So, you just think that if two
people care about each other,

527
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:17,318
they leave metaphorical marks

528
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,614
which should be allowed
to fade naturally?

529
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,867
You heard me,
but you just didn't understand me.

530
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,036
I wonder that
about you all the time.

531
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,780
My apologies.

532
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:30,008
Were you looking for me?

533
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,485
We need to see
your radioactive isotopes.

534
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,797
How you doing there, pal?
Did you knock one out of the park?

535
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:39,065
I'll be off then, Jennifer.

536
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,490
Good-bye, Milton.

537
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:42,470
Thank you very much.

538
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,540
You're more than welcome.

539
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:52,963
"Thank you, Milton."
"No, thank you, Jennifer"

540
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:55,816
Everyone is so polite here
except for the murder and the cheating.

541
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,775
We can get a warrant for the isotopes
if that's what you require.

542
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,600
That won't be necessary.

543
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,870
I don't know what use
you could have with these.

544
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:06,445
I haven't used them
for months, but...

545
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,120
Something wrong?

546
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:11,402
Some of my vials are missing.

547
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,679
We'll need to know how many people
aside from yourself

548
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,456
had access to them
in the last month.

549
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,981
Everyone in the institute
had access.

550
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:19,590
Everyone.

551
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,735
- This guy is good.
- He really is.

552
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,919
Why would a guy like you
play on a street corner?

553
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,840
Well, I guess that depends on
who exactly you think I am.

554
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,342
I'd like to speak to you
about Hodgins.

555
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,840
- I'd like to help.
- No, thanks son.

556
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,105
I can handle Hodgins all on my own.

557
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,809
Oh, no. I mean, I'd...

558
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,795
I'd like to help with the situation.

559
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,370
See, I'm a psychologist.

560
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:15,949
It's kind of my mojo.

561
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,566
You misunderstand the term.

562
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,778
What I meant was...

563
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,387
Vincent pointed out that each break
appears to have happened

564
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,245
at the weakest part in each bone.

565
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,184
X rays bear me out on that.

566
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,499
The most damage was done
to the weakest bones:

567
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:57,229
the anvil, the hyoid,

568
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,064
these points on the spine.

569
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,400
- I don't get what that means.
- Essentially,

570
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,986
the skeleton broke apart
at the weakest points.

571
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,233
The way a building would fall apart
during an earthquake.

572
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:08,171
So...

573
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,202
the victim was killed,
we're not positive how yet,

574
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,129
then frozen, then shaken
until all the bones fell apart?

575
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,373
Not shaken.

576
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,500
Vibrated.

577
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:21,587
Vibrated until the frozen bones
shattered like crystal.

578
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,406
Hodgins!

579
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,725
Don't sneak up like that.
I could put out an eye on my microscope.

580
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,144
- You got to run.
- You talked to Angela's father.

581
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,062
Oh, God. What did he say?

582
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,273
I have no idea.

583
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,646
But he was very...

584
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:44,902
He's got a very disturbing affect...
sinister.

585
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:46,792
I am not scared of him.

586
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,740
You know that whole "sell your soul
at the crossroads" thing?

587
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:51,987
I'm buying it.

588
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,702
You got to run for it, man.

589
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,204
I told you so.

590
00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:59,375
You know what?
I secretly had a thing for Angela.

591
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,490
Now it's gone. Like...

592
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,629
wiped from the memory banks.

593
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:16,976
It had to be Milton Alvaredo, right?

594
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:18,018
Why?

595
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,188
He's the one who's working on
transporting matter through vibrations?

596
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,940
You understood that?

597
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:25,609
He kills Dr. Sidman,
flash-freezes her,

598
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:28,498
and then tries to transport her
to outer space, the moon, whatever,

599
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:30,695
and ends up
with frozen chili con carne.

600
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,617
- I'm very impressed.
- Yeah, I've learned a lot from you...

601
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,705
and a lot from watching
the Discovery Channel with Parker.

602
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,748
Milton Alvaredo is not
our only suspect.

603
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,058
Jennifer Keating.

604
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:43,210
I mean, her only motive is revenge,

605
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,395
and, like you say,
that's just not logical,

606
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,631
and despite her being, you know,

607
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,508
a sex kitten scientist,

608
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,415
- she's still logical.
- No, not Jennifer Keating.

609
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,635
Chris Beaudette.

610
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,766
His project concerns extracting
energy from earthquakes.

611
00:32:58,564 --> 00:33:01,687
Plus, Dr. Collar is working
on echolocation for the blind.

612
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,699
So, basically,
we're back to square one.

613
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:05,655
I suggest we find an apparatus

614
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,880
capable of shattering
a flash-frozen human cadaver.

615
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Apparatus.

616
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,970
Right, gotcha.

617
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,030
Hello?

618
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,280
Dr. Earthquake?

619
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,555
Okay. So, tell me what
I'm looking for here.

620
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,669
Any apparatus that might facilitate
the creation of a sonic standing wave.

621
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:30,758
Right.
Tell me what I'm looking for again.

622
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,085
You're leaning on it.

623
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,910
Right. I knew that. All right.

624
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:38,185
Look at this.

625
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,336
All right, I'll just get Forensics
to look for blood.

626
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,911
No, there won't be any blood.

627
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:50,152
The remains are frozen solid
by this point.

628
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:55,366
The natural frequency of the human body
is between three and seven Hertz.

629
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,068
Humans have natural frequencies?

630
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:59,620
Naturally,
that would increase dramatically

631
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,205
if the body is frozen solid.

632
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,342
Forget it, Booth.
We're in a high pressure chamber.

633
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:09,046
That door can withstand a force
of at least...

634
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,634
- Oh, no.
- What oh, no?

635
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,986
- We have to get out.
- We have to get out or what,

636
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:17,137
we'll explode?

637
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,075
Booth, what we have to do here is,
we have to try to

638
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,270
counteract the wavelength.

639
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,452
The what?

640
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,295
It's not working.

641
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,656
If we stop,
our brains will turn to pudding.

642
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,306
Booth?

643
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,434
Hello?

644
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,560
Booth, are you okay?

645
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,020
- Are you all right? Can you hear me?
- What?

646
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,426
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right. How about you?

647
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:11,325
I called paramedics.
They should be here...

648
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,610
- Landis pulled us out.
- I heard shots.

649
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,425
Booth, are you okay?

650
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,948
It was my shooting
that saved our lives.

651
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,385
You should have been dead
in five to seven seconds.

652
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,311
- Bones, it was my gun.
- My sonic interference idea worked.

653
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,897
- It wasn't your siren...
- Can you hear me?

654
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:28,083
- It was my gun.
- If I hadn't started interference,

655
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,175
we'd be dead before
you started shooting.

656
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,294
You two might want to try resting
before communicating.

657
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,050
Don't need to be deaf
as well as blind.

658
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,475
What?

659
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,175
Now, this notch you found
in the clavicle?

660
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,944
I found minute traces of graphite,
clay and copolymer.

661
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,095
Pencil lead?

662
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,620
Which, of course,
is not lead at all.

663
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,109
Is that even possible?

664
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:58,969
All right, say a fairly heavy
mechanical pencil, right?

665
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,825
To the windpipe, or the carotid...
victim dies,

666
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,865
is deep frozen, and then shattered.

667
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,245
The freeze-dried chunks
are swept into garbage bags

668
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,270
and dumped for birds to eat.

669
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:13,876
Oh, no, please. You keep it.

670
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:17,235
I don't think I could ever regard it
in the same manner again since...

671
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,860
Thank you very much.

672
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,130
I warned the man, Angie.

673
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:26,391
I told him if he hurt you,
he would have me to contend with.

674
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,015
Did you take off your glasses
when you said it?

675
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,250
I definitely did.

676
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,191
It was a mutual breakup.

677
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,526
Were you hurt?

678
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,432
Dad...

679
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,613
Could he have stopped it?

680
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,678
Yeah.

681
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,130
But so could I.

682
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:48,242
His daddy can come down

683
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:49,998
and kick your ass.

684
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,220
I can't do everybody's job.

685
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,212
I wish you wouldn't.

686
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,143
Okay, Sweet Girl.

687
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,640
I will ameliorate
my vengeful intentions.

688
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,280
Ameliorate?

689
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,859
Honest?

690
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Honest.

691
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,583
Honest as a Texas sundown.

692
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,435
One of you killed Diane Sidman.

693
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,453
And tried to kill us.

694
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,455
I think we can rule out sexual jealousy
as a motive for this murder?

695
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,483
- Of course we can.
- Of course we can.

696
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:36,211
Wait a second. Why? Because these robots
don't feel like humans?

697
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,429
No, because

698
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:40,549
radiation poisoning
is the opposite of a crime of passion.

699
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,303
My people say that Diane Sidman
was stabbed to death with a pencil.

700
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,153
Well, indicating that the murderer
suddenly became impatient,

701
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:49,597
or approached a deadline.

702
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:52,394
You figure out that deadline,
you'll figure out your murderer.

703
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,188
Well it has to be the publishing
deadline from the Journal.

704
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:56,732
Look at this.

705
00:37:57,115 --> 00:38:00,527
Found blood in your resonance chamber.
Obviously, you can't see that,

706
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,596
- but it's right there.
- That's not blood.

707
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,983
- That's not blood.
- Luminol means blood.

708
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,658
There's no evidence of smearing.

709
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,952
The murderer
could have cleaned it up.

710
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,456
Luminol reacts with copper,
iron peroxides and cyanide.

711
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,405
Which provides for a number
of false positives.

712
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,002
Vegetables, fruit pulp.

713
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,125
Cleaning agents, insecticides.

714
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,506
Various glues, rust-remover,

715
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:23,967
ketchup, seaweed, sap, algae.

716
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,180
Is this luminol stuff ever useful?

717
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,268
I'm just asking because, it...
Yes? It is?

718
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,808
Fine. I'll shut up.

719
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,772
What?

720
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,857
Luminol reacts with pond scum.

721
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:40,118
So?

722
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,090
Right.

723
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,770
Right.

724
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,950
Pond Scum Scottie.

725
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,680
You're our guy.

726
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,195
You're under arrest.

727
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,836
Knew it all along. Let's go.

728
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,061
Come on, up.

729
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Oh, God!

730
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,669
That's for killing my fiancée.

731
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:02,222
One person to your left, Dr. Collar.

732
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:06,593
My apologies, Agent Booth.

733
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,311
My echo-locator
must have malfunctioned.

734
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,899
This may not be the most...

735
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,686
apropos time, but...

736
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,854
- Oh, here we go.
- Here we go, what?

737
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,523
I was wondering...

738
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:21,581
Could I have your phone number?

739
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,558
- Told you.
- Really?

740
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,040
I... have been

741
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,567
considering how to respond

742
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,759
if you asked, and

743
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,378
have decided upon no.

744
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,615
I can go, right?

745
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,917
'Cause I have some actual
save-the-world work to do.

746
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,300
Dr. Collar.

747
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:47,175
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

748
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,043
You're the only smart person
I really like.

749
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,259
Thank you.

750
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:53,265
That's...
What... What about me?

751
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,606
So, Diane Sidman
agreed to publish Milton Alvaredo

752
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:04,583
only if he shared credit with her.

753
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:08,655
Right, so she said that he was using
his theories about the God Particles...

754
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,602
- Particle. There's only one.
- Right.

755
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:12,927
Particle to vibrate the pond scum.

756
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,350
He gives her cancer,
but she lives too long.

757
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,905
Yeah, then he kills her with a pencil
and feeds her to crows

758
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,962
so he doesn't have to share
a credit.

759
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,376
That is cold.

760
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,740
And creepy?

761
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,887
- I didn't mean to call you creepy.
- You said I have a creepy mode.

762
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,320
I apologize, okay?

763
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,295
- I wasn't in my element.
- Every element is your element.

764
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,720
No, that is not true.
Okay, listen.

765
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:43,830
We just got to stop hanging out
with geniuses,

766
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:46,735
because you're gonna figure out
that I'm really stupid.

767
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,640
What? Don't worry about that.

768
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,366
I figured out a long time ago
how stupid you are.

769
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,460
What I just said

770
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:02,214
is true, and yet,
it really sounded wrong.

771
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:07,032
What I should say is that I don't care
how stupid you are.

772
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:11,510
It's not any better?

773
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:16,614
- Not at all.
- Okay, well...

774
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,360
There is intelligence, which I have,
and Mr. Nigel-Murray.

775
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:21,775
Oh, thank you.

776
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,110
And Sweets,

777
00:41:23,457 --> 00:41:27,429
even though his is so misdirected
as to be meaningless.

778
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:30,550
Backhand full of knuckles
with that compliment.

779
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:31,675
And Hodgins.

780
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,592
And...

781
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:33,740
Angela...

782
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,619
not so much,
but she's very talented.

783
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,965
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

784
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,784
But there's another quality, which is
the ability to use intelligence.

785
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,140
That is what you have.

786
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,160
Thanks, Bones.

787
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,880
Hey, wait a minute.
Speaking of Hodgins,

788
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:56,596
has anybody seen Hodgins?

789
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:01,957
Oh, God.
